<text>Peter (; 30 August 133423 March 1369), called Peter the Cruel () or the Just (), was King of Castile and León from 1350 to 1369. Peter was the last ruler of the main branch of the House of Ivrea. He was excommunicated by Pope Urban V for his persecutions and cruelties committed against the clergy.

==Early life==
Peter was born in the defensive tower of the Monasterio de Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas in Burgos, Spain. His parents were Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal.

According to chancellor and chronicler Pedro López de Ayala, he had a pale complexion, blue eyes and very light blonde hair; he was tall and muscular. He was accustomed to long, strenuous hours of work, lisped a little and &quot;loved women greatly&quot;. He was well read and a patron of the arts, and in his formative years he enjoyed entertainment, music and poetry.

He was to be married to his contemporary Joan, the second and favourite daughter of King Edward III of England; however, on their way to Castile she and her retinue travelled through cities infested with the Black Death, ignoring townspeople who had warned them not to enter their settlements. Since the plague had not yet entered England, it is likely that they underestimated the danger. Joan soon contracted the disease and died in 1348, aged 14. 
About two years later Peter began his reign when almost sixteen years old and subject to the control of his mother and her favourites. Though at first controlled by his mother, Maria of Portugal, Peter ascended the throne with the encouragement of his mother&#x27;s second cousin, the Portuguese minister Count Alburquerque. Becoming attached to María de Padilla, he married her in secret in 1353. María turned him against Alburquerque, who fled to Portugal.

In the summer of 1353, the young king was practically coerced by his mother and the nobles into marrying Blanche of Bourbon; he deserted her at once upon hearing rumors that she had slept with his half-brother Fadrique, who was supposed to be guarding her virtue and made her instead &quot;an unwilling Isolde to his Tristan,&quot; according to one historian. This marriage necessitated Peter&#x27;s denying that he had married María, but his relationship with her continued and they had four children. He also apparently went through the form of marriage with Juana de Castro, widow of Don Diego de Haro, convincing her that his previous marriage to Queen Blanche was a nullity. The bishops of Avila and Salamanca were asked to concur, and were afraid to say otherwise. Peter and Juana were married in Cuellar, and Juana was proclaimed Queen of Castile. After two nights, he then deserted her. They had a son who died young, after Peter&#x27;s death. A period of turmoil followed in which the king was for a time overpowered and, in effect, imprisoned. The dissension within the party striving to coerce him enabled him to escape from Toro, where he was under observation, to Segovia.

In 1361, Queen Blanche died at Medina Sidonia. French historians claim that Peter ordered two Jews to murder her; another version of the story says she was poisoned; a third one that she was shot with a crossbow, although it may have been the plague. Also that year, Maria de Padilla died in Seville. After Maria&#x27;s death, Peter declared that she had been his first and only legitimate wife.

==Wars with Aragon==

From 1356 to 1366, Peter engaged in constant wars with Aragon in the &quot;War of the Two Peters&quot;, in which he showed neither ability nor skill in his support of his English ally or Castilian interests in the Mediterranean against the French and Aragonese. The king of Aragon then supported Peter&#x27;s bastard brothers against him. It was during this period that Peter perpetrated the series of murders which made him notorious.

In 1366 began the calamitous Castilian Civil War, which would see him dethroned. He was assailed by his bastard brother Henry of Trastámara at the head of a host of soldiers of fortune, including Bertrand du Guesclin and Hugh Calveley, and abandoned the kingdom without daring to give battle, after retreating several times (first from Burgos, then from Toledo, and lastly from Seville) in the face of the oncoming armies. Peter fled with his treasury to Portugal, where he was coldly received by his uncle, King Peter I of Portugal, and thence to Galicia, in the northern Iberian Peninsula, where he ordered the murder of Suero, the archbishop of Santiago, and the dean, Peralvarez.

==Peter and the Spanish Jewry==
Peter&#x27;s rival Henry II of Castile continuously depicted Peter as &quot;King of the Jews&quot;, and had some success in taking advantage of popular Castilian antisemitism. Henry instigated pogroms beginning a period of anti-Jewish riots and forced conversions in Castile that lasted approximately from 1370 to 1390. Peter took forceful measures against this, including the execution of at least five anti-Jewish leaders of a riot.

The prominence of Samuel ha-Levi, King Peter&#x27;s treasurer, has often been cited as evidence of Peter&#x27;s supposed pro-Jewish sentiment, but Ha-Levi&#x27;s success did not necessarily reflect the general experience of the Spanish Jewry in this period which was often marked by discrimination and pogroms. Following Peter&#x27;s death, Jews had to wear a yellow badge, as punishment for having supported him.

==Death==

In the summer of 1366, Peter took refuge with Edward, the Black Prince, who restored him to his throne in the following year after the Battle of Nájera. The health of the Black Prince broke down, and he left the Iberian Peninsula, bringing with him two of Peter&#x27;s daughters, Constance and Isabella of Castile, whom he had taken as hostages as assurers that Peter would pay up. He married the princesses to his younger brothers, most famously Constance to his brother John of Gaunt, in order to make a claim on the Castilian throne.

Meanwhile, Henry of Trastámara returned to Castile in September 1368. The &quot;cortes&quot; of the city of Burgos recognized him as King of Castile. Others followed, including Córdoba, Palencia, Valladolid, and Jaén. Galicia and Asturias, on the other hand, continued to support Peter. As Henry made his way toward Toledo, Peter, who had retreated to Andalusia, chose to confront him in battle. On 14 March 1369, the forces of Peter and Henry met at Montiel, a fortress then controlled by the Order of Santiago. Henry prevailed with the assistance of Bertrand du Guesclin. Peter took refuge in the fortress, which, being controlled by a military order of Galician origin, remained faithful to him. Negotiations were opened between Peter and his besieger, Henry. Peter met with du Guesclin, who was acting as Henry&#x27;s envoy. Peter offered du Guesclin 200,000 gold coins and several towns, including Soria, Almazán, and Atienza to betray Henry. Ever opportunistic, du Guesclin informed Henry of the offer and immediately bargained for greater compensation from Henry to betray Peter.

Having made a deal with Henry, Du Guesclin returned to Peter. Under the guise of accepting his deal, du Guesclin led Peter to his tent on the night of 23 March 1369. Henry was waiting. The historian López de Ayala described the encounter as follows: &quot;Upon entering du Guesclin&#x27;s tent, Henry saw King Peter. He did not recognize him because they had not seen each other for a long time. One of Bertrand&#x27;s men said &#x27;This is your enemy.&#x27; But King Henry asked if it was he and King Peter said twice, &#x27;I am he, I am he.&#x27; Then King Henry recognized him and hit him in the face with a knife and they ... fell to the ground. King Henry struck him again and again.&quot; Having dispatched his half-brother, Henry left Peter&#x27;s body unburied for three days, during which time it was subjected to ridicule and abuse.

==Legacy and reputation==

Popular memory generally views King Peter I as one of the few monarchs who sided with an Islamic sultan (Granada), while also being a Catholic king. Granada paid Pedro I tribute. He helped them during several invasions and a coup. One of the rewards he was given by a sultan of Granada was the famous ruby, a reward for killing an usurper, that is now in the crown of England, brought back by The Black Prince of England along with Peter I&#x27;s surviving two daughters (Constance and Isabella of Castile, who were legitimized). Not all of Peter&#x27;s reputation comes from the works of the chronicler Pero López de Ayala, who after his father&#x27;s change of allegiance had little choice but to serve Peter&#x27;s usurper. After time passed, there was a reaction in Peter&#x27;s favour and an alternative name was found for him. It became a fashion to speak of him as &quot;El Justiciero&quot;, the executor of justice (the Lawful). Apologists were found to say that he had killed only men who would not submit themselves to the law or respect the rights of others. Peter did have his supporters. Even López de Ayala confessed that the king&#x27;s fall was regretted by many, among them the peasants and burghers subjected to the nobles by late feudal gifts and by the merchants, who enjoyed security under his rule.

The English, who backed Peter, also remembered the king positively. Geoffrey Chaucer visited Castile during Peter&#x27;s reign and lamented the monarch&#x27;s death in &quot;The Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot;, part of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. (Chaucer&#x27;s patron, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, had fought on Peter&#x27;s side in his struggle to reclaim the throne.) The English Lake Poet Robert Southey was presented in 1818 with a copy of a five-act play by the novelist Ann Doherty, entitled &quot;Peter the Cruel, King of Castile and Leon&quot;.

Peter had many qualities of those later monarchs educated in the centralization style. He built a strong Royal administrative force ahead of his times. He failed to counter or check all the feudal powers that supported his rivals, however illegitimate and opposite to the principles of aristocracy they represented themselves. But his moral superiority was reduced too by the violent means, including fratricides, by which he sought to suppress opposition; he at times was extremely despotic and unpredictable, even by the standards of his age. In this he was preceded by his father Alfonso XI, who since the crisis at the death of Alfonso X had faced multiple rebellions against royal authority.

The death of King Peter ended the traditional alliance of Castile and Navarre with England, which had been started by the Plantagenets to keep France in check. The alliance was later renewed by the Trastámaras and Tudors. 

His death also led to the Fernandine Wars, where portuguese king Ferdinand I would claim the throne of Galicia, which would eventually lead to the historical alliance between Portugal and England with the involvement of John of Gaunt&#x27;s claim to Castille.

==Children==
Peter&#x27;s children by María de Padilla were:
* Beatrice (1353–1369), nun at the Abbey of Santa Clara at Tordesillas
* Constance (1354–1394), married John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster
* Isabella (1355–1392), married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York
* Alfonso (1359–1362). Peter forced the Cortes to recognize Alfonso as his legitimate heir on 29 April 1362. However, Alfonso, a very sickly child, died at the age of three, months after his recognition as Crown Prince.

Peter had one son with Juana de Castro:
* John (1355–1405), married doña Elvira de Eril, had issue.

With María de Henestrosa, cousin of María de Padilla:
* Fernando de Castilla (1361-1362)

With Isabel de Sandoval, &quot;aya&quot; of his son Alfonso:
* Sancho de Castilla (1363–1371)
* Diego de Castilla (1365–1440), whose grandson Pedro de Castilla y Fonseca &quot;el mozo&quot; was lover to the queen Joan of Portugal.

With Teresa de Ayala, niece of Pero López de Ayala:
* María de Castilla, who with her mother had long careers at the Dominican convent of Santo Domingo el Real in Toledo and maintained a friendly correspondence with the Trastámaras.

==Sources==
The great original but hostile authority for the life of Peter the Cruel is the &quot;Chronicle of the Chancellor Pedro López de Ayala&quot; (1332–1407). To put that in perspective are a biography by Prosper Mérimée, &quot;Histoire de Don Pedro I, roi de Castille&quot; (1848) and a modern history setting Peter in the social and economic context of his time by Clara Estow (&quot;Pedro the Cruel of Castile (1350–1369)&quot;, 1995).

Strictly speaking, Peter was not defeated by Henry but by the opposing aristocracy; the nobles accomplished their objective of enthroning a weaker dynasty (the House of Trastámara), much more amenable to their interests. Most of the bad stories about Peter are likely to be colored by black legend, coined by his enemies, who finally succeeded in their rebellion. The Chancellor López de Ayala, the main source for Peter&#x27;s reign, was the official chronicler of the Trastámara, a servant of the new rulers and of Peter&#x27;s aristocratic adversaries.

The change of dynasty can be considered as the epilogue of the first act of a long struggle between the Castilian monarchy and the aristocracy; this struggle was to continue for more than three centuries and come to an end only under Charles I of Spain, the grandson of Ferdinand II of Aragon (Ferdinand V of Castile) and Isabella I of Castile (The Catholic Monarchs), in the first quarter of the 16th century.

<text>Eusebio Pedroza (March 2, 1956 – March 1, 2019) was a Panamanian boxer who held the WBA and lineal featherweight championship from 1978 to 1985, having defended the title against 18 different contenders, more than any other boxer in featherweight history. His cousin, Rafael Pedroza, was a world champion also, in the junior bantamweight division, although Rafael&#x27;s reign as world champion was short-lived. Eusebio Pedroza died one day before his 63rd birthday.

==Biography==
Pedroza started out as a professional boxer on December 1, 1973, with a four-round knockout win over Julio Garcia. His first 15 bouts were all in Panama. He went 14-1 over that span of fights, including a win over Jacinto Fuentes, a boxer who would later draw and lose to Wilfredo Gómez. His one defeat over that period of his career came to Alfonso Pérez by a knockout in three.

For fight number 16, Pedroza went to Mexicali, Mexico, in the last week of March 1976 to challenge WBA world bantamweight champion Alfonso Zamora for the world title. In his first championship try, Pedroza suffered his second loss, being knocked out in two rounds. After returning to Panama, he beat Pablo Jimenez by a decision in ten, then lost to Oscar Arnal in Venezuela by a knockout in six. He would not lose again for nine years.

Pedroza won three fights in 1977, two by knockout, and then, in April 1978, the WBA featherweight champion, Cecilio Lastra of Spain, travelled to Panama to defend his title on April 18 against Pedroza, who knocked him out in round 13 to become the new WBA featherweight champion.

Pedroza, during the next seven years, travelled the world to defend his title. Among 18 fighters Pedroza defended the title against were Enrique Solis in Puerto Rico, in a 15-round decision win, former world champion Royal Kobayashi (in Japan), knocked out in 14, Sa Wang Kim (in South Korea), knocked out in 8, former three-time world champion and fellow Hall of Famer Rubén Olivares, who lasted 12, Johnny Aba (in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea), who lost in 11, future world junior lightweight champion Rocky Lockridge, who went the distance with Pedroza in New Jersey and in Italy but lost by decision both times, Carlos Piñango (in Venezuela), knocked out in seven, Juan Laporte by decision, Jose Caba in Italy, also by decision, and Bernard Taylor in North Carolina by the way of draw. He also defended in his home country many times during that span, including a decision win over countryman and former WBA world Bantamweight champion Jorge Lujan, and became a household name in Latin America, his face appearing on the cover and posters of &quot;Ring En Español&quot; and &quot;Guantes&quot; magazines multiple times. Pedroza finally lost his title in England, being defeated by Ireland&#x27;s Barry McGuigan in London in a 15-round decision.

During Pedroza&#x27;s reign, talks surfaced of a unification bout against World Boxing Council and lineal featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez. These hopes were dashed when Sanchez died in an automobile accident in 1982. By virtue of his win over LaPorte, who succeeded Sanchez as WBC champion, Pedroza was recognized as the new lineal featherweight champion.

Between 1986 and 1992, Pedroza tried various comebacks, going 3–2 in total on those comeback attempts.

He retired with a record of 42 wins, 6 losses and one draw, with one no contest, and 25 wins by knockout. He is a member of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

Pedroza was one of a few, whose fights inspired young Mike Tyson.

<doc id="151360" wikidata="Q861190" url="?curid=151360" title="The 13th Floor Elevators">
<text>The 13th Floor Elevators was an American rock band from Austin, Texas, United States, formed by guitarist and vocalist Roky Erickson, electric jug player Tommy Hall, and guitarist Stacy Sutherland. The band was together from 1965 to 1969, and during that period released four albums and seven singles for the International Artists record label.

The Elevators were the first band to refer to their music as psychedelic rock, with the first-known use of the term appearing on their business card in December 1965.The 2005 documentary &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; specifically credits Tommy Hall with coining the term &quot;psychedelic rock&quot;. Their contemporary influence has been acknowledged by 1960s musicians such as Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Peter Albin of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Chris Gerniottis of Zakary Thaks.

The 13th Floor Elevators debut single &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, a national &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 55 hit in 1966, was featured on the 1972 compilation &quot;&quot;. Seminal punk rock band Television played the Elevator&#x27;s song &quot;Fire Engine&quot; live in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 13th Floor Elevators influenced bands such as Primal Scream, the Shamen, Lime Spiders, the Jesus and Mary Chain and Spacemen 3, all of whom covered their songs, and 14 Iced Bears who use an electric jug on their single &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, as well as The Black Angels in &quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot;. In 2009, International Artists released a ten CD box set entitled &quot;Sign of the 3-Eyed Men&quot;, which included the mono and new, alternative, stereo mixes of the original albums, together with two albums of previously unreleased material and a number of rare live recordings.

==History==
===Formation===
The 13th Floor Elevators emerged on the local Austin music scene in December 1965, where they were contemporary to bands such as the Wig and the Babycakes and later followed by Shiva&#x27;s Headband and the Conqueroo. The band formed when Roky Erickson left his group the Spades, and joined up with Stacy Sutherland, Benny Thurman, and John Ike Walton who had been playing Texas coastal towns as the Lingsmen. Tommy Hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together, and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player. The band&#x27;s name developed from a suggestion by drummer John Ike Walton to use the name &quot;Elevators&quot;. Clementine Hall added &quot;13th Floor&quot;. In addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the US lack a designated 13th floor, it was noted that the letter &quot;M&quot; (for marijuana) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet.

===1966–1967: &quot;Psychedelic Sounds&quot; and &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;===
In early January 1966, producer Gordon Bynum brought the band to Houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed Contact record label. The songs were Erickson&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, and Hall-Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Tried to Hide&quot;. Some months later, the International Artists label picked it up and re-released it.

Throughout the spring of 1966, the group toured extensively in Texas, playing clubs in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. They also played on live teen dance shows on TV, such as &quot;Sumpin Else&quot;, in Dallas, and &quot;The Larry Kane Show&quot; in Houston. During the Summer, the IA re-release of &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; became popular outside Texas, especially in Miami, Detroit, and the San Francisco Bay Area. In October 1966, it peaked on the national &quot;Billboard&quot; chart at the No. 55 position. Prompted by the success of the single, the Elevators toured the West Coast, made two nationally televised appearances for Dick Clark, and played several dates at the San Francisco ballrooms The Fillmore and The Avalon.

The International Artists record label in Houston, also home to contemporary Texas underground groups such as Red Krayola and Bubble Puppy, signed the Elevators to a record contract and released the album &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; in November 1966, which became popular among the burgeoning counterculture. Tommy Hall&#x27;s sleeve-notes for the album, which advocated chemical agents (such as LSD) as a gateway to a higher, &#x27;non-Aristotelian&#x27; state of consciousness, has also contributed to the album&#x27;s cult status.

During their California tour, the band shared bills with Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Great Society (featuring Grace Slick), and Moby Grape. On returning to Texas in early 1967, they released a second single, &quot;Levitation&quot;, and continued to play live in Austin, Houston and other Texas cities. In November 1967, the band released a second album, &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;. The album featured a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. However, shortly before work began on &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;, Walton and Leatherman left the band and were replaced by Danny Thomas on drums and Dan Galindo on bass, because of disputes over mismanagement of the band&#x27;s career by International Artists and a fundamental disagreement between Walton and Hall over the latter&#x27;s advocacy of the use of LSD in the pursuit of achieving a higher state of human consciousness. As a result, they were not credited in the &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; sleevenotes, despite having appeared on &quot;(I&#x27;ve Got) Levitation&quot; and &quot;She Lives (In a Time of Her Own)&quot;. Despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized, &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; was not the success the band and International Artists had hoped for. Lacking a hit single and released too late in the year, it sold out its original run, but was never reprinted, suggesting somewhat disappointing sales. Record label paperwork indicate that the band&#x27;s debut album sold upwards of 40,000 copies during its original run, while &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; may have sold around 10,000 copies.In 1967, Erickson would guest on a few songs on labelmate, the Red Krayola&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Parable of Arable Land&quot;, writer Paul Drummond detailed that after an aborted Elevators session, Erickson insisted on playing electric organ on &quot;Hurricane Fighter Plane&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot;. Allegedly, Erickson was already &quot;out there&quot; and Tommy Hall had to act as a translator, instructing Mayo Thompson to show Erickson the chord changes.

At one point around 1967, Erickson was a roommate of future cult musician Townes Van Zandt. Erickson insisted that he join the Elevators on bass, even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before. He auditioned for Hall, but Hall rejected him.

===1968–1969: &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; and breakup===
While the band were unable to repeat their national success, they were still a powerful presence on the Texas rock music scene. Chris Gerniottis, ex-lead singer of Zakary Thaks has spoken repeatedly of how the Elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene, and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s. Following the local popularity of the track &quot;Slip Inside This House&quot;, an edited version was released as a single in early 1968 and was played frequently on Houston radio.

Meanwhile, the Elevators had lost their bass player Dan Galindo, who went on to another International Artists band, the Rubiayat. Duke Davis briefly replaced Galindo, before the band&#x27;s earlier bassist Ronnie Leatherman returned in the Summer of 1968. As documented in a lengthy interview and article in the Texas underground music magazine &quot;Mother&quot; No. 3, the band worked all Spring of 1968 on their new album, which at one point was to be called &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. However, because of an unstable member line-up and the increasingly erratic behavior of the psychedelicized Tommy Hall and mentally fragile Roky Erickson, little of value came out of these sessions. The live shows had lost their original energy, and often the band would perform without their lead singer Erickson, due to his recurring hospital treatments at the time. The last concert featuring the &quot;real&quot; Elevators occurred in April 1968.

International Artists put out a &quot;Live&quot; LP in August 1968, which was composed of old demo tapes and outtakes dating back to 1966 for the most part, with fake applause and audience noise added. Around this time, the original 13th Floor Elevators disbanded, as the nucleus of Erickson-Hall-Sutherland had been reduced to guitarist Stacy Sutherland only. Sutherland brought some of his own songs for a final set of studio sessions, which led to the dark, intense posthumous album &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot;. Initially disliked by many Elevators fans, it has found a substantial fan-base today, with some even rating it the band&#x27;s best LP. These final sessions consisted of Sutherland on guitar, Ronnie Leatherman on bass, and Danny Thomas on drums. &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson, due to health and legal problems, and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including &quot;Livin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Never Another&quot;, &quot;Dear Doctor Doom&quot;, and &quot;May the Circle Remain Unbroken&quot;. A few live gigs were played around Texas during the second half of 1968, until an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in December 1968 declared the band gone. International Artists pulled together the various studio recordings from 1968 and, with the assistance of drummer Danny Thomas, added some horn arrangements, which became the &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; album, released in March 1969. The final 13th Floor Elevators record released by International Artists was a reissue of the &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; single in mid-1969.

Singer Janis Joplin was a close associate of Clementine Hall and the band. She opened for the band at a benefit concert in Austin, and considered joining the group prior to heading to San Francisco and joining Big Brother and the Holding Company.

Drug overuse and related legal problems left the band in a state of constant turmoil, which took its toll, both physically and mentally, on the members. In 1969, facing a felony marijuana possession charge, Roky Erickson chose to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital rather than serve a prison term, thus signaling the end of the band&#x27;s career.

==Music==
During the initial months of their existence as a band, the electric guitars used both by Roky Erickson and Stacy Sutherland were Gibson ES-330s. Sutherland&#x27;s pioneering use of reverb and echo, and bluesy, acid-drenched guitar predates such bands as ZZ Top, Butthole Surfers, and the Black Angels. According to Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, in the documentary &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, the guitars were run through Fender Blackface Twin Reverbs, Fender Reverb Units (referred to as a &quot;tube reverb&quot; or &quot;reverb tank&quot;), and Gibson Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tones.

A special aspect of the Elevators&#x27; sound came from Tommy Hall&#x27;s innovative electric jug. The jug, a crock-jug with a microphone held up to it while it was being blown, sounded somewhat like a cross between a minimoog and cuica drum. In contrast to traditional musical jug technique, Hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound. Instead, he vocalized musical runs into the mouth of the jug, using the jug to create echo and distortion of his voice. When playing live, he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug, but when recording the &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; album, the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound.

At Tommy Hall&#x27;s urging, the band often played their live shows and recorded their albums while under the influence of LSD, and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience. Intellectual and esoteric influences helped shape their work, which shows traces of Gurdjieff, the General Semantics of Alfred Korzybski, the psychedelic philosophy of Timothy Leary, and Tantric meditation.

==Members==
The original 13th Floor Elevators line-up was built around singer/guitarist Roky Erickson, electric jug player Tommy Hall, and guitarist Stacy Sutherland. The rhythm section went through several changes, with drummer John Ike Walton and bass player Ronnie Leatherman being replaced in July 1967. Walton and Leatherman left the band; in their stead were new recruits Danny Thomas (drums, piano) and Dan Galindo (bass) which completed the classic Elevators line-up. Hall remained the band&#x27;s primary lyricist and philosopher, with Sutherland and Erickson both contributing lyrics as well as writing music, and, later, working with Danny Thomas to arrange the group&#x27;s more challenging music. In addition to Erickson&#x27;s powerful vocals, Hall&#x27;s &quot;electric jug&quot; became the band&#x27;s signature sound. Later, Ronnie Leatherman returned for the third and final studio album, &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; along with Thomas, and Sutherland.

===Timeline===


==Post-Elevators careers==
===Roky Erickson===

After pleading insanity in response to drug charges—he was arrested for possession of a single marijuana joint—Roky Erickson was committed to a mental hospital in 1969. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic has written that the treatments Erickson received during his three-and-a-half-year confinement may have contributed to his subsequent mental troubles. At that point the Elevators had already dissolved, although local promoters, along with their record label, International Artists, made some attempts to keep the band&#x27;s name alive. Erickson attempted a sporadic solo career, burdened by management who exploited his instability and involved him in contracts that left him no control or profit from his music. After staying mostly out of sight in the 1980s, Erickson gradually returned to music in the 1990s, especially when the tribute album &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye&quot;—featuring players from ZZ Top, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and R.E.M., all of whom claimed Erickson&#x27;s or the Elevators&#x27; influence—was released. He recorded &quot;All That May Do My Rhyme&quot; for the Trance Syndicate label, owned by the Butthole Surfers&#x27;s King Coffey, who claimed Erickson told him it was the first time he&#x27;d ever been given a royalty check for his music. By 2001, Erickson&#x27;s brother Sumner had been awarded custody of the troubled musician and helped him receive better psychological treatment, restore his physical health, and connect with a legal team that helped him untangle his complicated past contracts and begin receiving more royalties for his music. &quot;I Have Always Been Here Before&quot;, a 43-track compilation of his post-Elevators music, was released in 2005, and Erickson receives full royalties for the set. In 2010, he released &quot;True Love Cast Out All Evil&quot;, a full-length collaboration with indie rock band Okkervil River. Erickson died in Austin on May 31, 2019.

===Stacy Sutherland===
Stacy Sutherland formed his own band, Ice, which performed only in Houston and never released any material. In 1969, after a battle with heroin addiction, he was imprisoned in Texas on drug charges, the culmination of several years of drug-related trouble with the law. After his release Sutherland began to drink heavily. He continued to sporadically play music throughout the 1970s, occasionally with former members of the Elevators. Sutherland was shot and killed by his wife Bunni on August 24, 1978, during a domestic dispute, and is buried in Center Point, Kerr County, Texas.

===Danny Galindo===
Danny Galindo played bass with Jimmie Vaughan&#x27;s (Stevie Ray&#x27;s older brother) band Storm in Austin, Texas, during the 1970s. He died in 2001 from complications of Hepatitis C.

===Danny Thomas===

Danny Thomas left the 13th Floor Elevators in 1968 and was hired to perform with blues guitarist Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins. After leaving Texas and returning to North Carolina, he played from 1970 to 1997 with: Lou Curry Band, Dogmeat, Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith, and Bessie Mae&#x27;s Dream. During this time, he owned his own delivery company called Gophers, Inc. Prior to that he worked in accounting at Carolinas Medical Center (formerly Charlotte Memorial Hospital). He lives in Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife, Juanette, and they have two daughters, Christina Juanette Thomas Davis, and Tiffany Joan Thomas Johnson, and son Jason V. Brock, an author of horror fiction.

===Benny Thurman===
Benny Thurman joined a string of other bands, most notably Mother Earth, with Powell St. John, and played with Plum Nelly in the 1970s.

Thurman died on June 22, 2008, at the age of 65.

===Tommy Hall===

Tommy Hall currently lives in downtown San Francisco. In the 1980s, he was rumored to be the true identity of Texas outsider musician Jandek, but this has since been disproved. He became a devout follower of Scientology in the 1970s. He has told interviewers that he is no longer interested in music or thinks of himself as a musician, and that &quot;I lost my jug a long time ago.&quot;

===Ronnie Leatherman===
Bassist Leatherman lives in Kerrville, Texas, where he plays occasionally with local bands and fellow Elevator John Ike Walton.

===John Ike Walton===
Drummer Walton, like Leatherman, also settled in his hometown of Kerrville, Texas.

==Reunions and tribute bands==
Various Elevators tribute/related bands exist, such as the John Ike Walton Revival, featuring namesake John Ike Walton and Fred Mitchim, the Tommy Hall Schedule featuring Fred Mitchim, and Acid Tomb, featuring members of the Alice Rose. Erickson&#x27;s youngest brother Sumner Erickson covers many Elevators songs with his band the Texcentrics.

Several partial reunions took place after the band&#x27;s 1969 demise. Sutherland and Leatherman played 13 Floor Elevator songs at the Ol&#x27; Dog Saloon in Ingram, Texas on April 28, 1977. Another partial reunion occurred at Liberty Lunch in Austin in 1984, with Roky alongside John Ike Walton on drums and Ronnie Leatherman on bass, with Sutherland&#x27;s place taken by guitarist Greg Forest. Tommy Hall did not participate.

On May 10, 2015, members of the band (Erickson, Hall, Leatherman, and Walton) joined for a 50th Anniversary reunion concert appearance at the psychedelic music festival Austin Psych Fest (Levitation 2015). Stacy Sutherland&#x27;s guitar duties were covered by Fred Mitchim and Eli Southard.

==Legacy==
Today, the 13th Floor Elevators continue to influence new generations of musicians. In 1990, 21 contemporary bands—including R.E.M., ZZ Top, Richard Lloyd, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Primal Scream—recorded covers of Elevators and solo Erickson songs on &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson&quot;, one of the first tribute albums. In 2005, a panel at the SXSW music festival discussed the music of the Elevators and Powell St. John, one of the Elevators&#x27; songwriters.

&quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; was covered by Australian group Radio Birdman on the 1978 release of their album &quot;Radios Appear&quot;.

The song &quot;Reverberation&quot; was covered by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen in 1990, with singer Noel Burke.

1980s drone/space-rock band Spacemen 3 were influenced by the 13th Floor Elevators, covering &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; twice, for their debut album, &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot;, and as a 17-minute version for their debut EP &quot;Walkin&#x27; With Jesus&quot;. Vocalist/guitarist Pete Kember also covered &quot;Thru the Rhythm&quot; with his post-Spacemen 3 project Spectrum.

&quot;Slip Inside This House&quot; was covered by Scottish alternative rock band Primal Scream (on their album &quot;Screamadelica&quot;), by Norwegian band Madrugada, by New York noise rock band Oneida (on their 2000 album &quot;Come on Everybody Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;), and by electronic band The Shamen on their 1992 promo, &quot;Make It Mine&quot;.

&quot;Le Bonne Route&quot;, a 1996 album by Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman, features a song titled &quot;Lunatics at the Edge of the World&quot;, which Tek described as &quot;An ode to Syd Barrett and Roky Erickson.&quot;

In the 2000 movie &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; is heard in the opening scene, and is the first song on the movie soundtrack album.

In 2006, Dell Computers used &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; in a television ad for their XPS laptop.

On April 24, 2007, during a radio promotion/interview before a concert, Jesse Lacey of Brand New credited the inspiration and a few lyrics for the song &quot;Degausser&quot; to Roky Erickson.

In 2007, the band&#x27;s biographer Paul Drummond published his first book, Eye Mind: The Saga of Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators (Process Media, December 2007), which was based upon an extensive oral history. A revised and updated edition is promised for 2027. 

In 2009, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; was used at length during a scene in episode 21 of Alan Ball&#x27;s HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;, culminating in a frantic, ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Lafayette Reynolds and Lettie Mae Thornton to remove Tara Thornton from the demonic influence of maenad Maryann Forrester.

The band has also been an influence on the &quot;stoner rock&quot; scene. Bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, Nebula, and Names and Faces regard them as an important influence.

Noted Hollywood actor Johnny Depp praised the Elevators in a 2004 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine: &quot;Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators, a band out of Texas. They were basically the first psychedelic-rock band. 1965. And if you listen to old 13th Floor Elevators stuff—Roky Erickson especially, his voice—and then go back and listen to early Led Zeppelin, you know that Robert Plant absolutely copped everything from Roky Erickson. And it&#x27;s amazing. And Roky Erickson is sitting in Austin, Texas; he&#x27;s just there. And Robert Plant had a huge hit. It always goes back to those guys, you know? I love those fucking guys.&quot;

Parquet Courts, a band which includes two native Texans, included a cover of “Slide Machine” on 2014&#x27;s Content Nausea

Texas recording artist Ray Wylie Hubbard sang &quot;No band was cooler than the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; in his song &quot;Screw You, We&#x27;re from Texas&quot; from his 2003 album &quot;Growl&quot;.

On January 19, 2014, the song &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven (Is Within You)&quot; was featured at the end of episode 2 of &quot;True Detective&quot;.

In 2020, writer Paul Drummond published, through Anthology Editions, his second book on the group with &quot;an unprecedented catalog of primary materials—including scores of previously-unseen band photographs, rare and iconic artwork of the era, items from family scrapbooks and personal diaries, new and archival interviews, dozens of contemporaneous press accounts, and no shortage of Austin Police Department records.&quot;

<text>? and the Mysterians (or Question Mark and the Mysterians) are an American garage rock band from Bay City and Saginaw in Michigan, initially active between 1962 and 1969. Much of the band&#x27;s music consisted of electric organ-driven garage rock and an enigmatic image inspired by the 1957 Japanese science fiction film &quot;The Mysterians&quot;. In addition, the band&#x27;s sound was also marked by the raw, resonating lead vocals of &quot;?&quot; (Question Mark, the stage name of Rudy Martínez), making Question Mark and the Mysterians one of the earliest groups whose musical style is described as punk rock. Their music and imagery were highly influential on later bands.

The band signed to Pa-Go-Go Records (based in San Antonio, Texas and run by Rudy &quot;Tee&quot; Gonzales) in 1966 and released its first and most acclaimed single, &quot;96 Tears&quot;, in the early part of that year. &quot;96 Tears&quot; became a number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and propelled the group to a 15-month period of national prominence. Their debut album, &quot;96 Tears&quot;, followed. Though Question Mark and the Mysterians were unable to replicate their success with their later recordings, and are thus deemed a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;, they did manage to reach the singles charts on five occasions.

Though they disbanded in 1969, the band has regrouped and released additional material over the years. &quot;96 Tears&quot; was listed at number 210 on the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;96 Tears&quot;===
The band members were children of migrant farmers who settled in Michigan. The original trio, consisting of Larry Borjas (guitar), Robert Martinez (drums), and Bobby Balderrama (lead guitar), encountered one another and were motivated by surf rock bands and instrumentalists like Link Wray and Duane Eddy to form a group in 1962. The band played locally with the same lineup until the influence of the British Invasion with groups stressing lead vocals and dynamic stage performances. Rudy Martinez, aka Question Mark, was known for his dancing ability and was suggested to the band as he was Robert Martinez&#x27;s brother. Question Mark was an eccentric figure, publicly stating that his soul had originated from Mars and that he once walked on Earth with the dinosaurs. &quot;?&quot; quickly cemented himself as the group&#x27;s creative force, and they began to develop a blend of gritty rock and roll and pop rock with a repertoire that encompassed compositions penned by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. To correspond with the new lineup, the band took the name ? and The Mysterians, which was inspired by the 1957 science fiction film &quot;The Mysterians&quot;. When the band recruited keyboard player Frank Rodriguez, who was a part of another local group, the Trespassers, it was pivotal in Question Mark and the Mysterians&#x27; overall sound, especially in their song &quot;96 Tears&quot;.

In February 1966, the band auditioned for an independent record label, resulting in the demos &quot;Are You For Real?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, which were only released later and boasted for their very good sound quality in the 1999 album &quot;More Action&quot;. Afterwards, Larry Borjas and Robert Martinez received draft notices and opted to enlist to avoid being sent to Vietnam. The remaining band members continued while Rodriguez improvised an organ riff, and &quot;?&quot; introduced a composition he had been developing for a while in his head. Auditioning for a replacement drummer resulted in Eddie Serrato, originally trained in traditional Mexican music, joining the group. Frank Lugo played bass. With this lineup, Question Mark and the Mysterians recorded &quot;96 Tears&quot; along with &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; for the small Pa-Go-Go label, under label executive and record producer Lilly Gonzales who supervised the band at her 4-track recording studio in Bay City.

When released in April 1966, &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; was originally the A-side for the band&#x27;s debut single; however, &quot;?&quot; promoted the record across Michigan, encouraging radio stations to play &quot;96 Tears&quot; instead. CKLW, a major station in Windsor, Ontario, extensively played the song, thus generating a number one regional hit. The song drew the attention of Neil Bogart, president of Cameo-Parkway Records. The success of the song was attributed to the Vox Continental riff, and, as critic Greg Shaw explained, the simplicity and precise execution. Bogart purchased the rights to &quot;96 Tears&quot;, distributed it on a national scale, and promoted the band by booking television appearances on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;. On October 29, 1966, after a steady climb up the charts, the single peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a week before being overtaken by the Monkees&#x27; &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

===Other chart successes===
The next two singles for &quot;Question Mark and the Mysterians&quot;, &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of You Baby&quot;, also charted, but were nowhere near as successful as &quot;96 Tears&quot;. These were compiled on the album &quot;96 Tears&quot; along with a handful of other songs.

Question Mark and the Mysterians&#x27; second album, &quot;Action&quot;, featured the band at the peak of its musicianship, but the album was not a commercial success. The band then briefly recorded with Capitol Records, Tangerine Records and Super K. The band lineup changed as the original members left for other projects. Mel Schacher, future bass player for Grand Funk Railroad, briefly became the bass guitarist along with Frank Montoya on guitar and Jeff McDonald on drums until Richard Schultz took over on bass and co-wrote several songs with Question Mark; including &quot;She Goes to Church on Sunday&quot;, which was licensed to Paul McCartney&#x27;s publishing company.

===1970s, 1980s and 1990s===
In the early 1970s, Question Mark and the Mysterians reformed with a different lineup consisting of two guitars and no keyboards. The band attracted the attention of rock critic Dave Marsh, who coined the term &quot;punk rock&quot; in a 1971 &quot;Creem Magazine&quot; article about Question Mark.
In 1984, the original lineup of Question Mark and the Mysterians held a reunion concert in Dallas, Texas. Original drummer Robert Martinez returned and replaced Eddie Serrato on drums after Serrato became ill with multiple sclerosis. The Dallas concert did not lead to a full revival for the band, but the concert was recorded and released by the New York record label ROIR, &quot;96 Tears Forever: The Dallas ReUnion Tapes&quot;.

In 1992, Question Mark collaborated with rap artist Saltine aka The Mad Rapper on a hip hop remake of &quot;96 Tears&quot;. The single was released on Pandisc Records following a huge industry buzz on radio. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine gave the single a thumbs up.

In 1997, Question Mark and the Mysterians reformed again. They collaborated with New York promoter Jon Weiss, who made the band headliners at CaveStomp garage rock festivals. The festivals featured many revived 1960s garage and psychedelic acts. In 1998, the cover version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of You, Baby&quot; by Smash Mouth reached number 14 on the US record chart.

===Re-release of &quot;96 Tears&quot;===
During the 1990s, Question Mark and the Mysterians wanted to re-release their now out-of-print albums &quot;96 Tears&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;, but were unable to because the song rights now belonged to record executive Allen Klein. In 1997, the band re-recorded their original 1966 album and released it on the Collectables Records label.

In 1998, Frank Rodriguez rejoined the band on keyboards and Question Mark and the Mysterians released the new live album &quot;Do You Feel It, Baby?&quot; on Norton Records and achieved moderate sales. In 1999, the band released a new studio album, &quot;More Action&quot;, produced and recorded in New York City, with the album design by Michael Calleia at Industrial Strength Design. This design caused controversy as it was not approved by Question Mark prior to the release. Coinciding with the album release, Question Mark dissolved his business relationship with Weiss, allegedly due to dissatisfaction with the record and other business issues.

===Collaborations===
In 2000, Question Mark began a collaboration with New York guitarist and rock promoter Gary Fury. This collaboration led to a series of live concerts featuring Question Mark with a backing band led by Fury, featuring musicians from other garage bands in the New York area. The first backing band lineup included Jim &quot;Royale&quot; Baglino of The Casino Royales and later Monster Magnet on bass, Sam Steinig of the Philadelphia band Mondo Topless on keyboards and original Mysterians drummer Robert Martinez. The new group billed itself as &quot;Question Mark and the Mysterymen&quot; and played the Limelight in New York and the Black Cat in Washington, D.C.

In 2002, Question Mark returned to New York to headline a two-night garage rock festival at the CBGB club. The lineup included Question Mark, Fury, Robert Martinez, Keith Hartel on bass and former Pat Benatar/David Johansen band and current E Street Band keyboardist Charlie Giordano. This new band was billed as &quot;Question Mark and The New Mysterians&quot;. The new band created a multi-track recording in CBGB&#x27;s studio, which is still unreleased.

On January 10, 2007, a fire destroyed Question Mark&#x27;s house in Clio, Michigan, destroying all of his memorabilia and killing the Yorkshire Terrier dogs he was breeding as his business. To help Question Mark, his friends held several benefit shows for him, with Question Mark and the Mysterians performing at some of these events. In May 2007, he and Gary Fury played a benefit show at New York&#x27;s Highline Ballroom. The backup group, known as The Playthings, featured Fury on guitar, Jim Baglino on bass, Jimi Black of Cheetah Chrome and Sylvain Sylvain on drums, and Brian Leonard on keyboards.

Guitarist Dennis Dean Lack joined the band in 1985, and was Question Mark&#x27;s main guitarist and music director, and still collaborates on new songs with Question Mark into 2017. Lack has been active in the band off and on for over 30 years; he now resides in Northern Michigan.

===The originals===
In between these shows, Question Mark was still occasionally active with the original Mysterians. In 2001, Question Mark and the original Mysterians returned to New York City to play guitarist Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s Underground Garage live event, selling out the Village Underground venue.

In 2006, the original members of ? and the Mysterians were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

===Influence===
Many 1960s garage bands played &quot;96 Tears&quot; in their live performances. Cover versions of &quot;96 Tears&quot; have been recorded by a number of bands and musicians, including Big Maybelle, Aretha Franklin, Thelma Houston, Todd Rundgren, Iggy Pop, The Texas Tornados, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Inspiral Carpets, the Stranglers, and Garland Jeffreys. Cerebral serial comedy host Stuart Mclean on the CBC Radio mentioned the band as the butt of a practical joke played by central character Dave in an episode of &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;.

===In the 2010s===
Former Mysterians drummer Eddie Serrato (born Eduardo Serrato, December 5, 1945) died from a heart attack on February 24, 2011, aged 65. Lead guitarist Robert Balderrama was diagnosed with prostate cancer in October 2017.

=== In the 2020s ===
All 5 members played a show on November 11, 2023, at Brooklyn Detroit in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit.

<text>The Pontiac Vibe is a compact car that was sold by Pontiac from 2002 to 2010. It was jointly developed by General Motors along with Toyota, which manufactured the mechanically similar Toyota Matrix. Manufactured by the Toyota-GM joint venture NUMMI in Fremont, California, the Vibe succeeded the Chevrolet Prizm in production at NUMMI and like the Prizm, it was derived from the Toyota Corolla, making it the last of the GM and Toyota developed S-body cars.

From 2002 to 2004, a rebadged right-hand drive variant of the Vibe was exported as the Toyota Voltz to the Japanese domestic market. The Voltz did not sell well in Japan and was discontinued after two model years.

Production of the Vibe ended in 2009 with the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand and the closing of NUMMI under the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization. Its twin, the Toyota Matrix, was in production for another three years for the American market and four years for the Canadian market, as the Matrix was manufactured by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge, Ontario and was unaffected by NUMMI closing down operation.


==First generation (2002)==
The 2003–2006 Vibe was available in an economical base trim, an AWD mid-trim, and the more powerful GT sport trim. It was unveiled in November 2001.

Powertrains available for this car are a Toyota-built 1.8 L straight-4 16-valve engine producing on the base model (manual or automatic transmission), 118 hp on the all-wheel drive model (automatic only), or a version with VVTL-i producing for the GT (manual 6-speed only). The Vibe was at one time the most fuel efficient vehicle sold by GM in North America, but ceased to be the case with the revised United States Environmental Protection Agency testing procedures in 2008.

Although the Vibe and Matrix are similar designs, the two brands actually use several different components, which are brand-specific, for their heating and air conditioning systems. These components include the air conditioning compressor and related hoses, the heater hoses, the heater core, and the serpentine belt.

There were some minor changes between model years. The Vibe was first produced in 2002 and went on sale as a 2003 model. Power ratings for the first three model years were slightly higher, with the GT up to , the base model rated at , and the all-wheel drive model rated at . Engine power claims were decreased for 2006 as a result of Toyota&#x27;s retesting of its engines for the new Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) ratings standard. The GT and all-wheel-drive trims were discontinued for the 2007 model year due to poor sales and new federal emissions standards.

The front fascia was freshened in the 2005 model year. In an attempt to &#x27;converge&#x27; the Pontiac look, the front grille was restyled to resemble the look of the Pontiac Solstice, also adopted by other vehicles in the Pontiac line. The 2003-2004 Vibes had a front grille more closely resembling the Pontiac Aztek.

First generation Vibe/Matrix/Corolla odometers do not have the ability to &quot;roll over&quot; 299,999 km or 299,999 mi. No recall or &quot;fix&quot; is currently available for this. Mileage must be kept track of manually until a solution is found.

===Toyota Voltz===
The is a five-door hatchback that was marketed by Toyota from July 2002 to March 2004 in its home market of Japan. Manufactured by NUMMI alongside the Vibe, the Voltz was exported to Japan in place of the Toyota Matrix. In Japan, the model line was exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called &quot;Toyota Netz Store&quot;.

With the exception of badging and side mirrors, the Voltz shared its exterior with the Vibe, including its Pontiac-designed twin front grilles. In place of Pontiac&#x27;s Arrowhead logo, the Voltz wears a stylized &quot;V&quot; insignia in-between the grilles and foldable side mirrors as opposed to non-foldable mirrors due to regulation. Along with the customary fitment of right-hand drive, the Voltz differed from the Vibe by sharing its interior design with the Matrix. With just over 10,000 units sold, Toyota ended sales of the Voltz with the Toyota Auris as its closest functional successor.

==Second generation (2008) ==
The Vibe was redesigned, along with the Matrix, for the 2009 model year, and debuted at the December 2007 L.A. Auto Show. First deliveries to dealerships were posted on GM&#x27;s Website in April 2008, with comments that initial sales were brisk. The first units were delivered to buyers in early March. &quot;The new Vibe&#x27;s design is sporty yet completely functional,&quot; according to Ron Aselton, chief designer. &quot;Clean lines, minimal overhangs, and wheels pushed to the corners give the vehicle a muscular stance.&quot;

The GT trim and AWD options return, and two new straight-four engines (Toyota&#x27;s 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE was also used on the Camry (and the 2005–2008 RAV4) for the AWD and GT trims as well as optional on the base trim, and a new 1.8-liter 2ZR-FE standard on the base trim) are offered. This was also Pontiac&#x27;s last new model and remained as the brand&#x27;s only remaining car for the 2010 model year. GM ceased Vibe&#x27;s production in August 2009.

The second generation FWD Vibes also offered computerized traction control and StabiliTrak traction control. Like the first generation, it offered anti-lock brakes. Rear disc brakes were standard on all models. Luggage racks were no longer standard order. Power output for the 1.8-liter was while power output for the 2.4-liter was at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm.

The Vibe offered of passenger volume (all seats up) and of cargo volume, for a total of with rear seats that folded completely flat. The cargo area was high and wide, which is large enough to accommodate a standard-sized, North American washing machine or clothes dryer with enough extra room for an appliance dolly.

== Discontinuation ==
On April 27, 2009, GM announced the discontinuation of Vibe production, as well as all other Pontiac models, by the end of 2010. It was later announced that Vibe production would end in August 2009, and the last Vibe left the assembly line on August 17, 2009, according to a source at genvibe.com. This left Toyota with a major problem as they had to scramble to relocate some of the tooling that was jointly used to produce the Matrix in another factory.

GM did not initially produce a compact hatchback to succeed the Pontiac Vibe, choosing to bracket it with the Chevrolet Sonic hatchback and Buick Encore small crossover. In Canada, GM followed the Vibe with the larger Chevrolet Orlando compact MPV, which replaced the Chevrolet HHR. Chevrolet introduced a hatchback version of the Chevrolet Cruze to North America in 2016.

== Recalls ==
In January 2010, Autoblog.com reported that the 2009 and 2010 model year Pontiac Vibes are also included in the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls related to unintended acceleration due to shared components with the Toyota Matrix. Another recall for the Vibe was issued in the Fall of 2009 due to floormat interference with the accelerator pedals. This is also part of the Toyota recall.

On August 26, 2010, another recall was issued for 2005 to 2008 model year Vibes, equipped with the 1ZZ-FE engine and two-wheel drive. The recall notices states that an improperly manufactured Engine Control Module (ECM) can develop a crack in its circuitry, potentially causing the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light to illuminate, harsh shifting, and stalling and/or failure of the engine to start.

In mid-October 2014 the Vibe along with the Saab 9-2x was recalled due to the faulty Takata airbags supplied from the large airbag supplier company. It is undetermined how many Vibes have been recalled.

<doc id="151373" wikidata="Q133808" url="?curid=151373" title="Agustín de Iturbide">
<text>Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu (; 27 September 178319 July 1824), commonly known as Agustín de Iturbide and later by his regnal name Agustín I, was the first Emperor of Mexico from 1822 until his abdication in 1823. An officer in the royal Spanish army, during the Mexican War of Independence he initially fought insurgent forces rebelling against the Spanish crown before changing sides in 1820 and leading a coalition of former royalists and long-time insurgents under his Plan of Iguala. The combined forces under Iturbide brought about Mexican independence in September 1821. After securing the secession of Mexico from Spain, Iturbide was proclaimed president of the Regency in 1821; a year later, he was proclaimed Emperor, reigning from 19 May 1822 to 19 March 1823, when he abdicated. In May 1823 he went into exile in Europe. When he returned to Mexico in July 1824, he was arrested and executed.

==Family and early life==
Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu was born in what was then called Valladolid, now Morelia, the provincial capital of Michoacán, on 27 September 1783. He was baptized with the names of Saints Augustine, Cosmas, and Damian at the cathedral. The fifth child born to his parents, he was the only male to survive and eventually became head of the family.
Iturbide&#x27;s parents were part of the privileged landed class of Valladolid, owning agricultural land including the haciendas of Apeo and Guaracha as well as lands in nearby Quirio. 

Iturbide&#x27;s father, Joaquín de Iturbide, came from a family of the Basque gentry who were confirmed in nobility by King Juan II of Aragon. One of his ancestors, Martín de Iturbide, was designated as Royal &quot;Merino&quot; in the High Valley of Baztan in the 1430s, and thereafter many in the family held political or administrative positions in the Basque Country from the 15th century. As a younger son, Joaquín was not in line to inherit the family lands, so he migrated to New Spain to make his fortune there. While the aristocratic and Spanish lineage of Agustín&#x27;s father was not in doubt, his mother&#x27;s ancestry was less clear.

His mother, María Josefa Arambúru Carrillo de Figueroa, was of pure Spanish blood born in Mexico, and therefore, a criolla. Some sources state she came from a high-ranking family in Michoacán. In the Spanish colonial era, racial caste was important to advancement, including military rank, and having some indigenous ancestry was often regarded as a disadvantage. Iturbide insisted throughout his life that he was criollo (native born of Spanish descent).

Agustín studied at the Catholic seminary called Colegio de San Nicolás in Valladolid, enrolled in the program for secular officials, though he was not a distinguished student. After that, he worked as an overseer at one of his family&#x27;s haciendas for a short time, discovering he was a very good horseman.

Iturbide entered the royal army in 1805, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Valladolid regiment of the provincial infantry. In 1806, he was promoted to full lieutenant.

==Marriage and family==
In 1805, when he was twenty-two, Iturbide married Doña Ana María Josefa Ramona de Huarte y Muñiz, member of the House of Tagle of the family of the Marquises of Altamira. She came from Valladolid, from a prosperous family of businessmen and landowners. She was the daughter of wealthy and powerful noble Isidro de Huarte, governor of the district, and the granddaughter of the Marquis of Altamira. With her dowry of 100,000 pesos, the couple bought the Hacienda of San José de Apeo in the small town of Maravatío, not far from property owned by Father Miguel Hidalgo, who became leader of the insurgency for independence in 1810. Iturbide had a longstanding friendship and had business dealings with the wealthy Mexico City beauty María Ignacia Rodríguez, known as &quot;La Güera&quot; Rodríguez (&quot;Rodríguez the Fair&quot;), who supported the insurgency for independence.

==Military career==
In the early 19th century, there was political unrest in New Spain. One of Iturbide&#x27;s first military campaigns was to help put down a mutiny, headed by 
Gabriel J. de Yermo.

He quickly grew in popularity amongst the royalists, whilst becoming a feared foe for the Insurgents. A peerless horseman and a valiant dragoon who acquired a reputation for achieving victory against numerical odds, his prowess in the field gained him the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of &quot;El Dragón de Hierro&quot; or &quot;The Iron Dragon&quot;, in reference to his skill and position in the army. He was given an important charge in the army. However, he was accused by locals of using his authority for financial gain although he was recognized as valiant in combat. Those accusations could not be proved but cost him his post. He turned down the offer to reclaim his post since he felt that his honor had been damaged. He may have been involved in the initial conspiracy to declare independence in 1809 that was headed by José Mariano Michelena in Valladolid. It is known by his and Hidalgo&#x27;s documents that he was a distant relative of Miguel Hidalgo, the initial leader of the Insurgent Army. Hidalgo wrote to Iturbide, offering him a higher rank in his army. Iturbide writes in his memoirs that he considered the offer, but that ultimately turned it down because he considered Hidalgo&#x27;s uprising ill-executed and his methods barbaric.

==Combating insurgency==
===1810–1816===

After the outbreak of the War of Independence in 1810, leader of the insurgency, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, offered Iturbide the rank of lieutenant general in the insurgent forces, which Iturbide rejected, remaining firmly a royal army officer at the outbreak of the war. From the start, Iturbide was ambitious and compiled a brilliant record of victories against the insurgents, often against far larger numbers. He was also well known by contemporaries of all factions for his cruelty against his opponents, the insurgents themselves as well as their families, including women and children.

One of Agustín&#x27;s first encounters with the rebel army was in the Toluca Valley in 1810 as it advanced toward Mexico City from Valladolid. Royalist and rebel forces engaged on the east bank of the Lerma River at the end of October in what is now known as the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. Royalist forces, under the command of Colonel Torcuato Trujillo, withdrew from the area, allowing rebels to take Toluca. Despite the loss by his side, Iturbide distinguished himself in this battle for valor and tenacity. He would later maintain in his memoirs that it was the only battle he considered to have lost (in which he was directly involved).

Iturbide&#x27;s next major encounter with the rebels would be against José María Morelos himself and in his native city of Valladolid. Iturbide led the defenders. He demonstrated his tactical skill and horsemanship by breaking Morelos&#x27;s siege of the town with a well-executed cavalry charge that caused the insurgent forces to withdraw into the forest. For that action, Iturbide was promoted to captain.

As a captain, he pursued rebel forces in the area, managing to capture Albino Licéaga y Rayón, leading to another promotion. In 1813, Viceroy Félix María Calleja promoted Iturbide to colonel and put him in charge of the regiment in Celaya. Then, in 1814, he was named the commander of forces in the Bajío area of Guanajuato, where he continued to pursue the rebels with vigor in a strongly contested area, and was Morelos&#x27;s principal military opponent from 1813 to 1815.

The next major encounter between Morelos and Iturbide occurred in a town called Puruarán, Michoacán, on 5 January 1814. In the battle, rebel forces were soundly defeated by forces led by Iturbide, forcing Morelos to retreat to the Hacienda of Santa Lucía and to leave Mariano Matamoros and Ignacio López Rayón in command of the rebel army, with over 600 insurgents killed and 700 captured. That marked a turn in the war as Morelos would never again achieve the same level of competency as he had before this defeat. Iturbide and other Spanish commanders relentlessly pursued Morelos, capturing and executing him in late 1815.

===Relieved of command===
Iturbide&#x27;s fortunes reversed after his victory when a number of accusations of cruelty and corruption surfaced. The accusations could not be proved, but Iturbide considered his honor to be tarnished by them and expressed so in his memoirs, written in exile.

Iturbide&#x27;s persistence against the rebels was widely known as well as his views against their liberal, anti-monarchical politics. In his diary, he refers to the insurgents as &quot;perverse,&quot; &quot;bandits,&quot; and &quot;sacrilegious.&quot; In a letter to the viceroy in 1814, he wrote of how he had 300 rebels, to whom he referred as excommunicates, executed to celebrate Good Friday. Iturbide was also criticized for his arbitrariness and his treatment of civilians, in particular his jailing of the mothers, wives, and children of known insurgents. In 1814, he had captured 100 women and incarcerated them into different houses in order to be &quot;re-educated. As for corruption, the Count of Pérez Galvez extensively testified that profiteering by many royalist officers, of whom Iturbide was the most visible, was draining the effectiveness of the royal army. Iturbide acquired a large personal fortune before 1816 by questionable dealings. Some of those shady practices included creating commercial monopolies in areas that he controlled militarily. Other accusations against Iturbide included sacking private property and embezzling military funds. In 1816, the viceroy relieved Iturbide of his command for corruption and cruelty. However, one year later, with the support of an auditor named Bataller, and staunch monarchists in the viceregal government, the charges were withdrawn. Iturbide&#x27;s supporters further convinced the viceroy that he was needed to vanquish the last remaining rebel leader. However, Iturbide never forgot the humiliation of his dismissal.

=== Against Vicente Guerrero ===
Iturbide was fully reinstated to military command in November 1820 by viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca. He was reinstated as colonel of the royalist army and general of the south of New Spain. For a couple of years after the defeat of Morelos at Puruarán, the independence movement had diminished significantly. However, Iturbide was given the task of putting down the remaining insurrectionist movement southwest of Mexico City led by Vicente Guerrero. Iturbide installed his headquarters at Teloloapan. For more than a century, historians believed that Iturbide had first attempted to carry out his duty in destroying Guerrero but that he met with failure and so decided to strike an alliance with the rebel. However, in 2006, new evidence was discovered by Mexican historian Jaime del Arenal Fenochio: a letter between the two military leaders dated 20 November 1820, which also referenced a previous letter. Since communications had been proven to have existed between the two leaders before Iturbide ever set out to seek out Guerrero, it is now believed that both were then carrying out negotiations. Regardless, some encounters between the two military forces were unavoidable, as the troops of Guerrero and Pedro Ascencio (another insurgent leader) managed to force Iturbide&#x27;s rear guard to withdraw from an ambush. In their further correspondence, Iturbide and Guerrero lament the clashes, and Iturbide further attempts to convince Guerrero of his intentions of liberating Mexico.

==Switching sides==
===Criollo rebellion===
From 1810 to 1820, Iturbide had fought against those who sought to overturn the Spanish monarchy and Bourbon dynasty&#x27;s right to rule New Spain and replace that regime with an independent government. He was solidly aligned with the Criollos. However, events in Spain caused problems, as the very monarchy for which that class was fighting was in serious trouble. The 1812 Cadiz Constitution, which was reinstated in Spain in 1820 after the successful Riego Revolt, established a constitutional monarchy, which greatly limited Ferdinand VII&#x27;s powers. There was serious concern in Mexico that the Bourbons would be forced to abandon Spain altogether. That led to the disintegration of viceregal authority in Mexico City, and a political vacuum developed that the Mexican nobility sought to fill, seeking limited representation and autonomy for themselves within the empire. An idea arose in the class that if Mexico became independent or autonomous, and Ferdinand were deposed, he could become king of Mexico.

===Alliance with Guerrero===
Iturbide was convinced that independence for Mexico was the only way to protect the country from a republican tide. He decided to become the leader of the Criollo independence movement. However, to succeed, he would need to put together a very-unlikely coalition of Mexican liberal insurgents, landed nobility, and the Church. Therefore, he penned The Plan of Iguala, which held itself up on Three Guarantees: Freedom (from Spain), Religion (with Catholicism being the only accepted religion in the new country) and Union (with all inhabitants of México to be regarded as equals). In that manner, he was paving the road to gaining the support of the most powerful factions: the insurgents, the clergy and the Spaniards. The plan envisioned a monarchy, thus assuring the support of the royalists as well. Iturbide held a series of negotiations with Guerrero and made a number of demonstrations of his intentions to form an independent Mexico. Iturbide offered Guerrero a full pardon if he surrendered. Guerrero rejected the pardon but agreed to meet with Iturbide to discuss the independence of Mexico. In the &quot;Embrace of Acatempán&quot;, named after the locale, they agreed to implement the plan, which was made public on 24 February 1821 by Iturbide, Guerrero, and another insurgent leader, Guadalupe Victoria. On 1 March 1821, Iturbide was proclaimed head of the Army of the Three Guarantees, with Guerrero fully supporting him and recognizing him as his leader.

===Plan of Iguala===
The plan was a rather vague document that sought the transition of the center of power in New Spain from Madrid to Mexico City. Essentially, the idea was to bring Ferdinand VII to Mexico City to rule. If he did not come to Mexico, another member of the Bourbon royal family would be chosen to rule there. If no European ruler would come to rule México, the nation would have the right to elect a ruler by its own people. To attract the disparate parties involved in the scheme, the plan offered three guarantees: Mexico would be independent from Madrid, Roman Catholicism would be the official religion, and all inhabitants of the new nation, later México, would be considered equals, with no distinction being made between Spaniards, Creoles, Mestizos, etc., thus eliminating the complicated caste system that had been used until then and abolishing the use of slaves in the territory of the new nation as well.

The promise of independence convinced the insurgents to accept the proposal. The promise of the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church was offered to the clergy, who were frightened by anticlerical policies of Spanish Liberalism. The offer of equality between Criollos and the Spanish-born &quot;Peninsulares&quot; assured the latter that they and their property would be safe in the new state. That was important because the Peninsulares owned a significant part of the valuable real estate and many of the businesses in Mexico. If the Spaniards had left, that would have been disastrous for the Mexican economy.
The plan gained wide support because it demanded independence without attacking the landed classes and did not threaten social dissolution. Therefore, Iturbide succeeded in bringing together old insurgents and royalist forces to fight against the new Spanish government and what was left of the viceregal government. Military leaders, soldiers, families, villages, and towns that had been fighting against one another for almost ten years found themselves joining forces to gain Mexican independence. However, their reasons for joining together were very different, and those differences would later foment the turmoil that occurred after independence.

Both the sitting viceroy and Fernando VII rejected the Plan of Iguala. The Spanish parliament sent a new &quot;viceroy,&quot; Juan O&#x27;Donojú, to Mexico. (Technically, the office of viceroy had been replaced by a &quot;superior political chief&quot; under the 1812 Spanish Constitution.) O&#x27;Donojú, however, arrived to witness a nation on the brink of achieving independence and knew that its consummation could not be stopped.

==Independence and early transition==

Iturbide met with O’Donojú and Field Marshall Francisco Novella to negotiate the final terms of capitulation at the landed estate of his longtime friend, Doña María Ignacia Rodríguez de Velasco (La Güera Rodríguez). The hastily negotiated Treaty of Córdoba was similar in terms of its outcomes to the Plan de Iguala—the document tried to guarantee an independent monarchy for New Spain under the Bourbon dynasty. The successor state would invite Ferdinand VII to rule as emperor or, if he defaulted, his brother Don Carlos. If both refused, a suitable monarch would be sought among the various European royal houses. In the meantime, a regency would replace the viceroy. All existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, would remain in force until a new constitution for Mexico was written. A key element was added at O&#x27;Donojú&#x27;s suggestion: if Spain refused its right to appoint a regent for the Mexican Empire, the Mexican congress would have freedom to elect whomever it deemed worthy as emperor. That crucial clause was not in Iturbide&#x27;s Plan de Iguala, a point against the argument that Iturbide entertained the notion of becoming the ruler when he started his campaign for Mexico&#x27;s independence.

To show the military might of the alliance, Iturbide co-ordinated with associated royalist and insurgent commanders in the provinces, opting for a replay of the strategy of closing in on Mexico City from the periphery, which Morelos had attempted in 1811–14. However, Iturbide had the advantage of having most of the former royalist army on his side. Iturbide marched into Mexico City on 27 September 1821, his own birthday, with the Army of the Three Guarantees. The army was received by a jubilant populace who had erected arches of triumph and decorated houses and themselves with the tricolor (red, white, and green) of the army. Cries of &quot;¡Viva Iturbide I!&quot; were heard first on that day. The next day, Mexico was declared an independent empire.

What remained of the royalist army retreated to Veracruz and was cornered in the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa, and O&#x27;Donoju, who had been assured an important position in the government of the new empire, died shortly afterwards, dishonored by his Spaniard compatriots.
Iturbide was named President of the Provisional Governing Junta, which selected the five-person regency that would temporarily govern the newly independent Mexico. The junta had 36 members who would have legislative power until the convocation of a congress. Iturbide controlled both the membership of the junta and the matters that it considered. The junta would be responsible for negotiating the offer of the throne of Mexico to a suitable royal. Members of the former insurgent movement were left out of the government.

This new government was overwhelmingly loyal to Iturbide. Opposition groups included the old insurgents as well as a number of progressives and those loyal to Ferdinand VII. Many liberals and progressives also belonged to Masonic lodges of the Scottish rite, leading these branches of the opposition to be called &quot;escoceses&quot; (Scots). The plan of Iguala was a compromise of the differing factions, but after independence, it became clear that some of the promises it had made would prove very difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish. This state of affairs started to lead to turmoil, even among those in power.

Iturbide moved back to Mexico City and settled himself in a large palatial home that now bears the name Palace of Iturbide. The mansion was lent to him by the family that owned it but was not living in it.

Iturbide began to live extravagantly. He demanded preference for his army and also personally chose ministers. In the meantime, Ferdinand VII rejected the offer of the Mexican throne and forbade any of his family from accepting the position, and the Spanish Cortes rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, granting Mexico its independence.

==Emperor Agustín I==

Shortly after signing the Treaty of Córdoba, the Spanish government reneged. Ferdinand VII had regained the upper hand against the liberals in Spain and increased his influence outside the country. He even had credible plans for the reconquest of the old colony. For those reasons, no European noble would accept the offer of a Mexican crown. In Mexico itself, there was no Mexican noble family that the populace would accept as imperiality.

In the meantime, the governing junta that Iturbide headed convened a constituent congress to set up the new government. The new government had indirect representation, based on the Cadiz model, but the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba were clear that the order of things would be kept as it had been before the Cadiz Constitution. Thus, Iturbide and the junta declared that they would not be bound by the Cadiz Constitution but kept the Congress that was convened. That led to division, which came to a head in February 1822. In its inauguration, Congress swore that it would never abide for all of the powers of the state to fall into the hands of a single person or entity. It, however, proceeded to assign sovereignty to itself, rather than to the people, and proclaimed that it held all three powers of the State. It also considered lowering military pay and decreasing the size of the army. Those moves threatened to reduce Iturbide&#x27;s influence in current and future governments.

That led to political destabilization, which was resolved temporarily when Iturbide was elected Emperor of the Mexican nation. However, it is not clear whether he took the crown at the insistence of the people or simply took advantage of the political situation.

Some call Iturbide&#x27;s decision a coup and state that the public support for him was orchestrated by him and his followers. Others insist that the people&#x27;s offer of the throne was sincere, as there was no other candidate and the people were grateful to him for the liberation of Mexico. The latter accounts stress that Iturbide initially rejected the offer, in favor of persuading Ferdinand VII to change his mind about ruling Mexico, but then reluctantly accepted. When the liberating army entered Mexico on 27 September 1821, the army sought to proclaim Iturbide as Emperor, which he himself stopped. A month later, on 28 October, he was publicly proclaimed Emperor by the people but again refused any such attempt.
The US government appointed Joel Roberts Poinsett as a special envoy to independent Mexico when Iturbide was declared emperor since James Monroe was concerned about how popular and long-lasting the regime might be. Poinsett indicated the empire was not likely to be enduring, but the US still recognized Mexico as an independent country. Poinsett&#x27;s &quot;Notes on Mexico&quot; are an important source as a foreign view of Iturbide&#x27;s regime. Poinsett also took advantage of the opportunity to proposition Iturbide&#x27;s government on the issue of the US wish of acquiring Mexico&#x27;s northern territories but was soundly refused.

Famed Mexican author José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, &quot;El Pensador&quot; (&quot;the Mexican Thinker&quot;), the author of &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot;, wrote about the subject at the time: &quot;If your excellency be not the Emperor, then our Independence be damned. We do not wish to be free if your excellency will not be at the lead of his countrymen.&quot; Timothy E. Anna points out that in the months between the achievement of Independence and his crowning as Emperor, Iturbide already practically ruled the nation, as he was president of the Regency, and the junta had granted him command over all land and sea forces. He was appointed protector of commerce, navigation, local order and ports and was given the right to expedite passports and navigation licenses even after the Emperor had been instated (and according to the Emperor&#x27;s wishes). Iturbide had what he could have possibly wanted before becoming Emperor, Anna notes, and so it is not probable that Iturbide conspired to appoint himself Emperor. Iturbide himself notes in his memoirs written in exile: &quot;I had the condescension–or, call it weakness—of allowing myself to be seated in a throne I had created for others.&quot;

Historians point out that Iturbide had quite possibly all the power, influence, and support he needed before redacting the Plan of Iguala, to crown himself Emperor, and he still wrote the Plan with the clear intention of creating a throne meant for a European noble.

Most historical accounts mention the crowd that gathered outside what is now the Palace of Iturbide in Mexico City shouting &quot;Viva Iturbide!&quot; and insist for him to take the throne of Mexico in May 1822. The crowd included Iturbide&#x27;s old regiment from Celaya. Some detractors of Iturbide insist that this demonstration was staged by Iturbide himself or his loyalists. From a balcony of the palace, Iturbide repeatedly denied his desire for the throne. One interesting twist to the story is reported by Mexico City daily &quot;La Jornada&quot;, which states that Iturbide held the first popular referendum in Mexico. According to the article, Iturbide sent out a questionnaire to military and civilian leaders as to whether the people preferred a republic or a monarchy. The answer came back in favor of a monarchy. Iturbide asked the demonstrators that night to give him the night to think it over, and to respect the wishes of the government. The Congress convened the next day to discuss the matter of Iturbide&#x27;s election as Emperor. Iturbide&#x27;s supporters filled the balconies overlooking the chamber. The Congress confirmed him and his title of Agustín I, Constitutional Emperor of Mexico, by a vast majority. After Iturbide&#x27;s abdication, members would state that it had elected Iturbide out of fear for their lives, as the common folk were present during the vote and loudly proclaimed Iturbide, and no member voted against his crowning as Emperor. However, three days after Iturbide had been elected Emperor, Congress held a private session in which only it was present. It ratified the decision, created titles for the royal family, and declared Iturbide&#x27;s title to be lifelong and hereditary.

Iturbide&#x27;s coronation was held at the Mexico City Cathedral on 21 July 1822, and his wife, Ana María, was crowned empress, in an elaborate ceremony. It was attended by the bishops of Puebla, Guadalajara, Durango, and Oaxaca. According to the author Pérez Memen, Archbishop of Mexico Pedro José de Fonte y Hernández Miravete objected and did not attend. Iturbide was crowned by Rafael Mangino y Mendivil, the head of the Congress, in itself a statement by Congress: the state, not the church or any other power, would be sovereign. The Congress decreed the crown to be hereditary with the title of &quot;Prince of the Union.&quot; As emperor, Iturbide had sovereignty over lands bordered by Panama in the south and the Oregon Country in the north, including the current countries of Central America and the US states of California, Texas, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico. Central America only briefly was part of the Mexican Empire of Iturbide (from 1821 to 1823), because by 1823 the local patriots, both liberal and conservative, made a move for total and absolute independence from Mexico and Spain.

==Downfall==
===Dissolution of Congress===
The republicans were not happy with Iturbide as emperor. While the Catholic clergy supported him, the coronation dashed republican hopes, and while the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba directed that in the event of it being impossible to install a European on the Mexican throne, a national sovereign could be chosen, some of the royalists who had supported Iturbide had hoped for a European ruler. Many of the landed classes supported Iturbide and those documents because they offered a sense of continuity with the past. Iturbide&#x27;s election to the throne was against their wishes, and many of them withdrew their support for him and conspired against the new empire.

The strongest opposition to Iturbide&#x27;s reign came from the Congress, where a significant number of its members supported republican ideas. Many of these members also belonged to Masonic lodges, which provided an easy forum for communication. Those ideas found a voice when Manuel Codorniu founded the newspaper &quot;El Sol&quot;, essentially becoming the in-house publication for the Scottish Rite lodge in its struggle against Iturbide. Iturbide&#x27;s government was notoriously harsh in turning down territorial negotiations with agents of the US government, as attested by Poinsett. The United States was itself a republic as well, meaning Iturbide&#x27;s relations with the US were on shaky ground. The Congress, believing itself to be sovereign over the Emperor and the people and the recipient of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers, antagonized Iturbide. The Congress refused to draw up a new monarchical Mexican Constitution with a role for the Emperor. Furthermore, people loyal to the Emperor became aware of a conspiracy that involved several members of the Congress who planned to kidnap the Emperor and his family and overthrow the Empire. As a response to this claimed threat to his life and to combat the resistance, Iturbide dismissed the Congress on 31 October 1822 and two days later created a new junta, the National Institutional Junta, to legislate in its place, answering only to himself.

The National Institutional Junta was directed to create much-needed legislation in economic matters, create a provisional set of laws for the Empire, and then issue a call for a new Constituent Congress. The formulation of the new Congress was changed in how many representatives each Mexican province was granted. The new Congress would also be in charge of issuing a new Mexican Constitution. Iturbide persecuted his enemies, arresting and jailing a score of former members of the Congress, but that did not bring peace.

A number of prominent politicians and military leaders, many of whom had supported Agustín as emperor, turned against him for having &quot;made a mockery of national representation&quot; in the new Congress&#x27;s composition. Among those were prominent Insurgent leaders Vicente Guerrero, Nicolás Bravo and Guadalupe Victoria.

Meanwhile, Mexico suffered as an independent country. Ferdinand&#x27;s resurgence as a ruler in Spain and his clear intentions to reconquer Mexico meant that no European nation was willing to recognize Mexico&#x27;s independence, and most broke off economic ties with the new state. Iturbide&#x27;s economic policies were draining resources as well. To increase his popularity, he abolished a number of colonial-era taxes. However, he still insisted on a large and very well-paid army and lived extravagantly himself. The elite turned against him when he imposed a 40% property tax.

The situation did not last long. Soon, Iturbide was unable to pay his army, creating discontent in a significant portion of his power base. When criticism of the government grew strong, Iturbide censored the press, an act that backfired against him. Opposition groups began to band together against him. Leaders such as Valentín Gómez Farías and Antonio López de Santa Anna began to conspire against the imperial concept altogether and became convinced that a republican model was needed to combat despotism.

===Veracruz and the Plan of Casa Mata===
Santa Anna publicly opposed Iturbide in December 1822 in the Plan of Veracruz, supported by the old Insurgent hero, Guadalupe Victoria. Santa Anna would later admit in his recollections that at the time, he did not know what a republic was. Iturbide had tried to stop Santa Anna by inviting him to Mexico City. Recognizing the danger of such an invitation, Santa Anna responded with his Plan de Veracruz, which called for the reinstatement of the old Constituent Congress, which would then have the right to decide the form of government of the new nation. Curiously, it did not specifically call for a republic or for the abdication of Iturbide. Santa Anna wrote to Iturbide, explaining his reasons and swearing to sacrifice his own life if it was necessary to ensure the safety of the Emperor. Iturbide&#x27;s enemy-turned-ally, Vicente Guerrero, turned back to enemy when he and General Nicolás Bravo escaped México City and allied themselves with the rebels. In a proclamation that explained their reasons, they also called for the reinstatement of the disintegrated Congress, which would then decide the fate of the nation. Bravo and Guerrero wrote that they swore to abide by the Congress&#x27;s decision, even if it decided to stay as a Constitutional Empire and it elected Iturbide again to lead them.

Iturbide sent his most trusted man, his protégé of sorts, General Echávarri, to combat the rebels. Santa Anna considered escaping to the United States but was stopped by Victoria. Santa Anna retreated and fortified himself in the city of Veracruz with his superior artillery. Victoria was separated from Veracruz, fighting behind Imperial lines. Bravo and Guerrero were defeated, with Guerrero suffering such a grievous injury in battle that the nation believed him dead until he resurfaced months later. However, Echávarri and several other imperial officers turned on the empire; away from Mexico City, the loyalty of the imperial armies proved patchy. Santa Anna, joined by republicans Guerrero, and Bravo, and imperial generals Echávarri, Cortázar y Rábago, and Lobato, proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata, which called for the installation of a new Congress and declared the election of the emperor null and void. Casa Mata also called for giving provinces the right to govern themselves in the interim until the new Congress was formed, an attractive prospect for the provincial governments. They accepted the plan, with the exception of the province of Chiapas. Much of the area now known as Central America declared its opposition to Mexico City and Iturbide&#x27;s rule. In 1823, authorities in what are now Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras convened a Congress to declare themselves independent from Mexico and Spain as the United Provinces of Central America.

Santa Anna&#x27;s army marched toward Mexico City, winning small victories along the way. Iturbide gathered and sent troops to combat Santa Anna who did not put up a strong resistance. Many military leaders who Iturbide appointed turned on him upon contacting Santa Anna&#x27;s forces. Iturbide later admitted he had made a mistake by not leading his armies himself. Iturbide recognized that although his provisional junta was working to call a new Congress, most of the nation had already accepted the Plan of Casa Mata. Recognizing the wishes of the country, Iturbide personally reopened the same Congress that he had closed in March 1823 and presented his abdication to them. He later wrote that he was choosing abdication over bloody civil war. However, Congress refused to accept his abdication, arguing that acceptance of abdication would imply that the existence of the throne was legitimate. Instead, they nullified their own election of Iturbide as emperor and refused to acknowledge the Plan of Iguala or the Treaty of Córdoba.

Executive leadership of the country was passed to the &quot;triumvirate,&quot; made up of the generals Guadalupe Victoria, Nicolás Bravo, and Pedro Celestino Negrete.

==Exile==
On his way to exile, Iturbide and his family were escorted by former insurgent leader Nicolás Bravo, who treated Iturbide harshly. Though the republican movement had triumphed, the people still held Iturbide in high regard and greatly admired him. On his way out of the city, his carriage was surrounded by the people, the horses dismissed and the people sought to drag the carriage themselves out of the city. That treatment was customary in the entrances or exits of great figures in or out of a city. The soldiers escorting Iturbide prevented that from happening and would henceforth lead the former emperor on hidden roads, as the government feared a popular rising in favor of Iturbide.

On 11 May 1823, the ex-emperor boarded the British ship &quot;Rawlins&quot; en route to Livorno, Italy (then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany), accompanied by his wife, children, and some servants. There, he rented a small country house and began to write his memoirs, known under the name of Manifiesto de Liorna. Iturbide and his family struggled financially during this time despite claims by historians and some members of the Congress that deposed him that Iturbide had indulged in illegal enrichment throughout his military career and rule. In exile, Iturbide was approached by a Catholic coalition of nations that sought to enlist his help in a campaign to reconquer México for Spain. Iturbide declined. Spain pressured Tuscany to expel Iturbide, and the Iturbide family moved to England.

There, he published his autobiography, &quot;Statement of Some of the Principal Events in the Public Life of Agustín de Iturbide&quot;. When he was exiled, Iturbide was accorded a government pension, but it was never received by Iturbide. Congress also declared him a traitor and &quot;outside of the law&quot; to be killed if he ever returned to Mexico. Iturbide was unaware of the penalty. After his death, many an author decried the decree calling for Iturbide&#x27;s death, as it was against all known precepts of the law at the time: it was unheard of that a law could be issued solely against a specific citizen, instead of issuing a general law that would be applied to particular cases.

Reports of a probable further Spanish attempt to retake Mexico reached Iturbide in England. He wrote in his memoirs that he was very worried about the future of Mexico. He continued to receive reports from Mexico and advice from supporters that if he returned he would be hailed as a liberator and a potential leader against the Spanish invasion. Iturbide sent word to congress in Mexico City on 13 February 1824 offering his services in the event of Spanish attack. Congress never replied.

Conservative political factions in Mexico finally convinced Iturbide to return.

==Execution and burial==

Iturbide returned to Mexico on 14 July 1824, accompanied by his wife, two children, and a chaplain (Joseph A. Lopez). He landed at the port of Soto la Marina on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of Tamaulipas). He was initially greeted enthusiastically, but was soon arrested by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander. Felipe de la Garza had been the head of a short-lived revolt during Iturbide&#x27;s reign. Iturbide chose to pardon the general and reinstate him to his old post. Perhaps it was because of this debt that de la Garza wavered in his resolve to detain Iturbide. On the way to his trial, de la Garza gave Iturbide command over the military escort that accompanied them and requested that Iturbide present himself to the nearby village of Padilla. Iturbide gave his word of honor and surrendered to authorities.

The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide said, &quot;Mexicans! In the very act of my death, I recommend to you the love to the fatherland, and the observance to our religion, for it shall lead you to glory. I die having come here to help you, and I die merrily, for I die amongst you. I die with honor, not as a traitor; I do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. I am not a traitor, no.&quot; He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824.

The aftermath of his execution was met with indignation by royalists. The sentiment of those horrified by this regicide was compiled by novelist Enrique de Olavarría y Ferrari in &quot;El cadalso de Padilla: &quot;Done is the dark crime, for which we will doubtlessly be called Parricides.&quot; His body was buried and abandoned at the parish church of Padilla until 1833. In that year, President Santa Anna, deciding to rehabilitate the memory of Iturbide, ordered that his remains be transferred to the capital with honors. However, it was not until 1838, during the presidency of Anastasio Bustamante, that the order was confirmed and carried out. His ashes were received in Mexico City with much pomp and ceremony, and the same Congress that had been against him for so many years gave him honor as a hero of the War of Independence, if not the short imperial reign after.

On 27 October 1839, his remains were placed in an urn in the Chapel of San Felipe de Jesús in the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, where they remain. On the stand is an inscription in Spanish that translates to &quot;Agustín de Iturbide. Author of the independence of Mexico. Compatriot, cry for him; passerby, admire him. This monument guards the ashes of a hero. His soul rests in the bosom of God.&quot;

==Iturbide&#x27;s role in history==
Iturbide&#x27;s reign as emperor lasted less than a year, but as leader of the coalition that brought about Mexican independence and then as its first ruler in the post-independence era, he remains an important figure not only in Mexico, but also in Europe . For a number of Mexican autonomists, a constitutionally sanctioned monarchy was a logical solution to the problem of creating a new state as it seemed to be a compromise between those who pushed for a representative form of government and those who wished to keep Mexico&#x27;s monarchist traditions. In their view, a republican, federalist government was virtually unheard of; for 300 years New Spain had lived in a monarchy, so a continuation of some form would have aided national stability . 

Historian Eric Van Young states that Iturbide&#x27;s seizure of the crown &quot;seems less cynical and idiosyncratic when it comes along at the end of the independence struggle.&quot; Van Young&#x27;s assessment is that &quot;he demonstrated moments of political brilliance clouded over in the long term by bad judgment and that in the end he was an opportunist.&quot;

Iturbide is often described as a reactionary rather than a revolutionary , a view supported by his initial refusal to join Miguel Hidalgo’s independence movement until it aligned with his own interests. His role in the independence movement is frequently shared with that of Vicente Guerrero in educational materials, and his legacy remains controversial. No official acts or public events are typically held to commemorate his ascension or death . The rest of the 19th century in Mexico saw frequent shifts between political extremes, with various factions gaining power at different times. The old Mexican nobility remained influential, and members of the Iturbide family were involved in political intrigue against the Mexican government in Madrid, New York, Paris, and Rome into the 1890s 

Liberal or republican ideas would continue to be embraced by people outside the Mexico City elite. These came out of Bourbon Reforms in Europe that were based on the Enlightenment. Attacks on the Catholic Church by liberals in Spain and elsewhere in Europe were conducted also in Mexico during the Liberal Reform period in the mid-nineteenth century. Ideals of the Constitution of Cadiz would find expression in the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. This constitution would influence political thought on both sides of the Mexican political spectrum, with even Iturbide bending to it when he created the first congress of an independent Mexico. After Iturbide, there was wide general consensus, even among the landed elite, that some form of representative government was needed. The question was how much power would be in legislative hands and how much in an executive.

Iturbide&#x27;s empire was replaced with the First Mexican Republic. General Guadalupe Victoria was elected the first president, but in subsequent years, General Vicente Guerrero became the first in a long line of Presidents to gain the Presidency through a military revolt after losing an election. Guerrero was betrayed and assassinated, and Santa Anna would rise to avenge him, beginning an era of Mexican history that Santa Anna dominated. This regime would oscillate and finally be overcome by the Plan of Ayutla. The new Government would struggle between anti-clerical, reformist views and conservative views during the Reform War. During the French Intervention the country would face Civil War amongst conservative, Catholic, Europe-adherent monarchists led by the ironically liberal Maximilian I of Mexico, and liberal, masonic, anti-clerical, reformist and United States-adherent liberals led by the American-backed Benito Juárez. Having prevailed, Juárez died after 15 years of forcefully remaining as president. Porfirio Díaz in the late 19th century would install a one-man rule which imposed upon México its first true period of relative peace, in exchange for freedom, and Díaz remaining for the next 30 years in power. He would be overthrown by the Mexican Revolution.

==In historical memory==

Early in the independence period of Mexico&#x27;s history, the day used to mark Independence was based on one&#x27;s political stance. Conservatives favored 27 September for celebration, when Iturbide entered Mexico City at the head of the conquering army, but Liberals preferred 16 September to celebrate Hidalgo&#x27;s call for rebellion against Spain. In modern Mexico, the liberal tendency has dominated, such that much writing about Iturbide is often hostile, seeing him as a fallen hero, who betrayed the nation by grasping for personal power after independence. Since the 1949 publication of a historical novel, &quot;La Güera Rodríguez&quot; about Iturbide&#x27;s aristocratic friend, Doña María Ignacia Rodríguez de Velasco, Iturbide was cast in the novel as her paramour, having an illicit affair with her. Although the portrayal of her was as a libertine, the notion was based on uncorroborated rumors and innuendo, with nothing ever proven, and then exaggerated in fiction. As her post-humous reputation as a &quot;heroine of Mexican independence&quot; has risen beginning in the late twentieth century, Iturbide&#x27;s has continued to be something much less than that of Mexico&#x27;s Liberator. A two-volume work on Mexican independence contrasts Hidalgo and Iturbide, with the subtitle &quot;the glory and the oblivion&quot;.

Iturbide&#x27;s strategy of defining a plan and using the military to back it began a tradition in Mexican politics that would dominate the country&#x27; history. He can be considered Mexico&#x27;s first &quot;caudillo,&quot; or charismatic military leader, using a combination of widespread popularity and threat of violence toward opposition to rule and would be followed by army generals Antonio López de Santa Anna and Porfirio Díaz, who came to dominate their respective eras. During the 1910 centenary celebrations of independence, the remains of Iturbide were not placed at the &quot;El Ángel&quot; with other leaders of independence, but stayed in the National Cathedral. Following the Mexican Revolution 1910–20, victorious revolutionary general and newly elected president of Mexico Álvaro Obregón mounted a massive centenary celebration for Mexican independence, even larger than the one that Porfirio Díaz had staged in 1910 to commemorate Hidalgo&#x27;s revolt, considered the outbreak of the War of Independence. It was the first time since the mid-19th century that the date was commemorated. Given that Obregón himself was a military strong man, his 1921 commemoration of Mexican independence and Iturbide was an opportunity for him to assert his own state-building vision by appropriating a piece of Mexico&#x27;s history. By overseeing the ceremonies, Obregón could shape and consolidate his own position in power, which was then relatively weak. The Mexican Army benefited from the celebrations with new uniforms and equipment, and there was even a re-enactment of Iturbide&#x27;s triumphal entry into Mexico City.

Mexico owes the country&#x27;s name &quot;Mexico&quot; to Iturbide, as opposed to &quot;United Mexican States.&quot; While the latter is considered the official name, the inhabitants of the country refer to it by the name of Mexico. Another legacy that Iturbide left to Mexico was its modern flag, still used today. The three colors of red, white, and green originally represented the three guarantees of the Plan of Iguala: Freedom, Religion, and Union. In the place of the Spanish emblem for Mexico, he resurrected the old Tenochtitlan symbol for Mexico City, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus holding a snake in its beak. With it, he hoped to link Mexican empire with the Aztec one. Iturbide is noted in the &quot;Himno Nacional Mexicano&quot;, the national anthem for the country. One stanza translates as follows: &quot;If to battle against the foreign host, the warrior trumpet invokes us, Mexicans, the Sacred flag of Iturbide bravely follow. Let the conquered banners serve as a carpet to the brave steeds, may the laurels of triumph bring shade to the brow of the brave Captain.&quot;

<text>James Hugh Calum Laurie (; born 11 June 1959) is an English actor, comedian, musician and writer. He first gained recognition for his work as one half of the English comedy double act Fry and Laurie with Stephen Fry.

Fry and Laurie acted together in a number of projects during the 1980s and 1990s, including the BBC sketch comedy series &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; and the P. G. Wodehouse adaptation &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;. From 1986 to 1989 he appeared in three series of the period comedy &quot;Blackadder&quot;, first as a recurring guest star in the last two episodes of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, before joining the main cast in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, and going on to appear in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; and many related specials.

From 2004 to 2012, Laurie starred as Dr. Gregory House on the Fox medical drama series &quot;House&quot;. He received two Golden Globe Awards and many other accolades for the role. He was listed in the 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most watched leading man on television and was one of the highest-paid actors in a television drama at the time, earning $409,000 (£250,000) per episode. By the end of the series, he was earning $700,000 an episode. His other television credits include starring as arms dealer Richard Onslow Roper, the main antagonist in the miniseries &quot;The Night Manager&quot; (2016), for which he won his third Golden Globe, and playing Senator Tom James in the HBO sitcom &quot;Veep&quot; (2015–2019), for which he received his 10th Emmy Award nomination.

Laurie has appeared in the films &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1992), &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996), &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1997), &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998), &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999), &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001), &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (2004), &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; (2015), &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot; (2011) in which he voiced Steven Claus, and &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot; (2020). Outside acting, he released the blues albums &quot;Let Them Talk&quot; (2011) and &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot; (2013), both to favourable reviews. Laurie wrote the novel &quot;The Gun Seller&quot; (1996). He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours and CBE in the 2018 New Year Honours, both for services to drama.

==Early life==
Laurie was born on 11 June 1959, in the Blackbird Leys area of Oxford, the youngest of four children of Patricia (née Laidlaw) and William George Ranald Mundell &quot;Ran&quot; Laurie, who was a physician and winner of an Olympic gold medal in the coxless pairs (rowing) at the 1948 London Games. He has an older brother, Charles Alexander Lyon Mundell Laurie, and two older sisters, Susan and Janet. He had a strained relationship with his mother, whom he noted as &quot;Presbyterian by character, by mood&quot;. He later said, &quot;I was frustration to her. She didn&#x27;t like me.&quot; His mother died from motor neurone disease in 1989, at the age of 73. According to Laurie, she endured the disease for two years and suffered &quot;painful, plodding paralysis&quot; while being cared for by Laurie&#x27;s father, whom he has called &quot;the sweetest man in the whole world&quot;.

Laurie&#x27;s parents, who were both of Scottish descent, attended St Columba&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (now United Reformed Church) in Oxford. He notes that &quot;belief in God didn&#x27;t play a large role&quot; in his home, but &quot;a certain attitude to life and the living of it did&quot;. He followed this by stating, &quot;Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn&#x27;t really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don&#x27;t know what you do with it, I don&#x27;t know where to put it.&quot; He later stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted, he&#x27;d take it away.&quot;

Laurie was brought up in Oxford and attended the Dragon School from seven to 13, later stating, &quot;I was, in truth, a horrible child. Not much given to things of a &#x27;bookey&#x27; nature, I spent a large part of my youth smoking Number Six and cheating in French vocabulary tests.&quot; He went on to Eton College, which he described as &quot;the most private of private schools&quot;. He arrived at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1978, which he says he attended &quot;as a result of family tradition&quot; since his father went there. Laurie notes that his father was a successful rower at Cambridge and that he was &quot;trying to follow in [his] father&#x27;s footsteps&quot;. He studied archaeology and anthropology, specialising in social anthropology, and graduated with third-class honours in 1981.

Like his father, Laurie rowed at school and university. In 1977, he was a member of the junior coxed pair that won the British national title before representing Britain&#x27;s Youth Team at the 1977 Junior World Rowing Championships. In 1980, Laurie and his rowing partner, J.S. Palmer, were runners-up in the Silver Goblets coxless pairs for Eton Vikings rowing club. He also achieved a Blue while taking part in the 1980 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. Cambridge lost that year by five feet. During this time, Laurie was training for up to eight hours a day and was on course to become an Olympic-standard rower. He is a member of the Leander Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, and was a member of the Hermes Club and Hawks&#x27; Club.

==Career==

===Acting===

Forced to abandon rowing during a bout of glandular fever, Laurie joined the Cambridge Footlights, a university dramatic club that has produced many well-known actors and comedians including members of the popular British surreal comedy group, Monty Python. There he met Emma Thompson, with whom he had a romantic relationship; the two remain good friends. She introduced him to his future comedy partner, Stephen Fry. Laurie, Fry and Thompson later parodied themselves as the &quot;University Challenge&quot; representatives of &quot;Footlights College, Oxbridge&quot; in &quot;Bambi&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, with the series&#x27; co-writer Ben Elton completing their team.

In 1980–81, his final year at university, besides rowing Laurie was president of the Footlights, with Thompson as vice-president. They took their annual revue, &quot;The Cellar Tapes&quot;, to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and won the first Perrier Comedy Award which was presented to them by Rowan Atkinson. The revue was written principally by Laurie and Fry, and the cast also included Thompson, Tony Slattery, Paul Shearer and Penny Dwyer. The Perrier Award led to a West End transfer for &quot;The Cellar Tapes&quot; and a television version of the revue, broadcast in May 1982. It resulted in Laurie, Fry and Thompson being selected, along with Ben Elton, Robbie Coltrane and Siobhan Redmond to write and appear in a new sketch comedy show for Granada Television, &quot;Alfresco&quot;, which ran for two series.

Fry and Laurie worked together on various projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Among them were the &quot;Blackadder&quot; series, written by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, starring Rowan Atkinson, with Laurie in various roles, including two roles in &quot;Blackadder II&quot; which marked his debut appearance in the series, first as drunk Simon Partridge in &quot;Beer&quot; and then as the villainous Prince Ludwig the Indestructible in the &quot;Blackadder II&quot; final episode, &quot;Chains&quot; and then Prince George in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; and Lieutenant George in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;. Other projects followed, of which one was their BBC sketch comedy series &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;; another project was &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, an adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, in which Laurie played Jeeves&#x27;s employer, the amiable twit Bertie Wooster. He and Fry participated in charity stage events, such as &quot;Hysteria! 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot; and Amnesty International&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot;, &quot;Comic Relief&quot; TV shows and the variety show &quot;Fry and Laurie Host a Christmas Night with the Stars&quot;. They collaborated again on the film &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1992) and came together for a retrospective show in 2010 titled &quot;Fry and Laurie Reunited&quot;.

Laurie starred in the Thames Television film &quot;Letters from a Bomber Pilot&quot; (1985) directed by David Hodgson. This was a serious acting role, the film being dramatised from the letters home of Pilot Officer J.R.A. &quot;Bob&quot; Hodgson, a pilot in RAF Bomber Command, who was killed in action in 1943.

Laurie appeared in the music videos for the 1986 single &quot;Experiment IV&quot; by Kate Bush, and the 1992 Annie Lennox single &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; in British Regency period costume alongside John Malkovich. Laurie appeared in the Spice Girls&#x27; film &quot;Spice World&quot; (1997) and had a brief guest-starring role on &quot;Friends&quot; in &quot;The One with Ross&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1998).

Laurie&#x27;s later film appearances include &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), adapted by and starring Emma Thompson; the Disney live-action film &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996), where he played Jasper, one of the bumbling criminals hired to kidnap the puppies; Elton&#x27;s adaptation of his novel &quot;Inconceivable&quot;, &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; (2000); &quot;Girl from Rio&quot;; the 2004 adaptation of &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Stuart Little&quot;.

Since 2002, Laurie has appeared in a range of British television dramas, guest-starring that year in two episodes of the first season of the spy thriller series &quot;Spooks&quot; on BBC One. In 2003, he starred in and also directed ITV&#x27;s comedy-drama series &quot;fortysomething&quot; (in one episode of which Stephen Fry appears). In 2001, he voiced the character of a bar patron in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;One If by Clam, Two If by Sea&quot;. Laurie voiced the character of Mr. Wolf in the cartoon &quot;Preston Pig&quot;. He was a panellist on the first episode of &quot;QI&quot;, alongside Fry as host. In 2004, Laurie guest-starred as a professor in charge of a space probe called &quot;Beagle&quot;, on &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;.
Between 2004 and 2012, Laurie starred as an acerbic physician specialising in diagnostic medicine, Dr. Gregory House, in the Fox medical drama &quot;House&quot;. For his portrayal, he assumed an American accent. He was in Namibia filming &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; and recorded his audition tape for the show in the bathroom of the hotel, as it was the only place he could get enough light. Jacob Vargas operated the camera for the audition tape. Laurie&#x27;s American accent was so convincing that executive producer Bryan Singer, who was unaware at the time that Laurie was British, pointed to him as an example of just the kind of &quot;compelling American actor&quot; he had been looking for. Laurie also adopted the accent between takes on the set of &quot;House&quot;, as well as during script read-throughs, although he used his native accent when directing the episode &quot;Lockdown&quot;. He also served as director for the episode &quot;The C-Word&quot;.

Laurie was nominated for an Emmy Award for his role in &quot;House&quot; in 2005. Although he did not win, he did receive a Golden Globe in both 2006 and 2007 for his work on the series and the Screen Actors Guild award in 2007 and 2009. Laurie was also awarded a large increase in salary, from what was rumoured to be a mid-range five-figure sum to $350,000 per episode. Laurie was not nominated for the 2006 Emmys, apparently to the outrage of Fox executives, but he still appeared in a scripted, pre-taped intro, where he parodied his &quot;House&quot; character by rapidly diagnosing host Conan O&#x27;Brien and then proceeding to grope him as the latter asked him for help to get to the Emmys on time. He would later go on to speak in French while presenting an Emmy with Dame Helen Mirren, and was since nominated in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Laurie was initially cast as Perry White, the editor of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, in Singer&#x27;s film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; but had to bow out of the project because of his commitment to &quot;House&quot;. In July 2006, Laurie appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, where he also performed one of his own comic songs, &quot;Mystery&quot;, accompanying himself on the piano. He hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which he appeared in drag in a sketch about a man (Kenan Thompson) with a broken leg who accuses his doctor of being dishonest. Laurie played the man&#x27;s wife.
In August 2007, Laurie appeared on BBC Four&#x27;s documentary &quot;Stephen Fry: 50 Not Out&quot;, filmed in celebration of Fry&#x27;s 50th birthday. In 2008, he took part in &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot; which saw him reuniting with former Blackadder producer, John Lloyd who had travelled to the set of House MD in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California to interview Laurie who recalled his time working on the Blackadder series. Laurie also appeared as Captain James Biggs in &quot;Street Kings&quot;, opposite Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker, and then in 2009 as the eccentric Dr. Herbert Cockroach, PhD in DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;. He also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the second time on the Christmas show in which he sang a medley of three-second Christmas songs to close his monologue. In 2009, Laurie returned to guest star in another &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, &quot;Business Guy&quot;, parodying Gregory House. In 2010, Laurie guest starred in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXI&quot; as Roger, a castaway who is planning a murder scheme on a ship during Homer and Marge&#x27;s second honeymoon.

On 8 February 2012 Fox announced that season eight of &quot;House&quot; would be the last. On 13 June 2012 the media announced that Laurie was in negotiations to play the villain in &quot;RoboCop&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;RoboCop&quot; film. These negotiations ultimately fell through and Laurie passed on the project. In 2012, Laurie starred in an independent feature called &quot;The Oranges&quot; that had a limited release. &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; of Newark, New Jersey thought that he was &quot;particularly good&quot;. After the end of &quot;House&quot; Laurie took a three-year hiatus from film and TV work.
Laurie was in negotiations to be cast in the role of Blackbeard for the 2014 series &quot;Crossbones&quot;. However, the role went to John Malkovich. In 2015 he returned to TV work with a recurring role on &quot;Veep&quot; as Tom James, a role written specifically for him after showrunner Armando Iannucci heard he was a fan of the show. Laurie continued to recur on the show until the final season in 2019. The same year he played the villain David Nix in Brad Bird&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;.

Laurie played arms dealer Richard Onslow Roper in the BBC 1 miniseries &quot;The Night Manager&quot;. The series started filming in spring 2015 and aired first on the BBC. He was nominated for two Emmys for his work on the miniseries and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. In addition to being an Executive Producer on the show alongside Tom Hiddleston, it was also Laurie&#x27;s first role on British TV in thirteen years.

Laurie starred as Dr Eldon Chance, a San Francisco-based forensic neuropsychiatrist in the Hulu thriller series &quot;Chance&quot; which lasted for two seasons from 2016 to 2017. In 2018 Laurie had a small role in the critically panned film &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson&quot;.

In 2019 Laurie appeared in &quot;Veep&quot; creator Armando Iannucci&#x27;s film &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;, an adaptation of the novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens. That same year it was announced he would also work with Iannucci on the upcoming space comedy &quot;Avenue 5&quot; for HBO. Season 2 of &quot;Avenue 5&quot; was released on 10 October 2022, with Laurie reprising his role as Captain Ryan.

It was reported in February 2023 that Laurie would be the feature guest star for the third season of &quot;Tehran&quot;.

===Music===
Laurie is an accomplished pianist who began taking piano lessons at the age of six. He sings and plays the piano, guitar, drums, harmonica, and saxophone. He has displayed his musical talents throughout his acting career, such as on &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;, &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, &quot;House&quot; and when he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October 2006. He is a vocalist and keyboard player for the Los Angeles charity rock group Band From TV.

Following Meat Loaf&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Simple Explanation&quot;, Laurie played piano as a special guest on the song &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; from Meat Loaf&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&quot;. Laurie co-wrote and performed the humorous blues song, &quot;Sperm Test in the Morning&quot;, in the film &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;.

On &quot;House&quot; Laurie played several classic rock &#x27;n roll instruments including Gibson Flying V and Les Paul guitars. His character has a Hammond B-3 organ in his home and on one episode performed the introduction to Procol Harum&#x27;s classic &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;.

On 26 July 2010 it was announced that Laurie would be releasing a blues album after signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records. The album, called &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;, was released in France on 18 April 2011 and in Germany on 29 April. The album features collaborations from well-known artists such as Tom Jones, Irma Thomas and Dr. John.

On 1 May 2011 Laurie and a jazz quintet closed the 2011 Cheltenham Jazz Festival to great acclaim. He followed that up as the subject of the 15 May 2011 episode of ITV&#x27;s series &quot;Perspectives&quot;, explaining his love for the music of New Orleans and playing music, from his album &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;, at studios and live venues in the city itself. He was the subject of PBS Great Performances &quot;Let them Talk&quot;, also about New Orleans jazz, first broadcast on 30 September 2011.

His second album, &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot;, was released in the UK on 6 May 2013. In the same year he played at the together with his band. This concert was filmed and later released as &quot;Live on the Queen Mary&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray.

===Writing===
In 1996 Laurie&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Gun Seller&quot;, an intricate thriller laced with Wodehouseian humour, was published and became a best-seller. He has since been working on the screenplay for a film version. His second novel, &quot;The Paper Soldier&quot;, was scheduled for September 2009 but has yet to appear.

==Personal life==
Laurie married theatre administrator Jo Green on 16 June 1989 in the Camden area of London. They have three children, Charlie, Bill, and Rebecca. Laurie&#x27;s elder son Charlie played a small role as baby William in &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;, during a sketch titled &quot;Special Squad&quot;. His daughter Rebecca had a role in the film &quot;Wit&quot; as five-year-old Vivian Bearing. Stephen Fry, Laurie&#x27;s best friend and long-time comedy partner, was the best man at his wedding and is the godfather of his children.

While appearing on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in 2006 he discussed his struggles with severe clinical depression. He told host James Lipton that he first concluded he had a problem while driving in a charity demolition derby, during which he realised that seeing two cars collide and explode made him feel bored rather than excited or frightened; he quipped that &quot;boredom is not an appropriate response to exploding cars&quot;. As of 2006 he was having regular sessions with a psychotherapist.

Laurie admires the writings of P. G. Wodehouse, explaining in a 27 May 1999 article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; how reading Wodehouse novels had saved his life. In an interview also in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he confirmed that he is an atheist. He is an avid motorcycle enthusiast and has two motorbikes, one at his London home and one at his Los Angeles home.

<text>The earliest known chess column appeared in the &quot;Lancet&quot; in 1823, but due to lack of popularity disappeared after less than a year.

==Historical development==
The first column to establish itself was that of George Walker in &quot;Bells Life&quot; in 1834 which survived until 1873. From February 15, 1845, onwards it faced competition from Howard Staunton&#x27;s column in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, a column which outlived Walker&#x27;s, but only by 5 years. During this time a chess column also appeared in the &quot;Pictorial Times&quot; lasting from February 1845 to June 1848.

In 1882 Henry Bird in his &quot;Chess History and Reminiscences&quot; estimated that there were 150 chess columns. Less than thirty years later in 1913 H. J. R. Murray in his &quot;A History of Chess&quot; estimated there existed at least 1,000 chess columns worldwide.

George Koltanowski became the chess columnist for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, which carried his chess column every day for the next 52 years until his death, publishing an estimated 19,000 columns. American Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote a column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1972 to 2006. GM Lubomir Kavalek&#x27;s column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran from 1986 to 2010. GM Nigel Short wrote a chess column for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; from 1995 to 2005, and then for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 2005 to 2006. GM Jon Speelman wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 2005 to 2008. GM Patrick Wolff was co-writing a column for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in 2012.

==Current day==
Raymond Keene&#x27;s column appears daily in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. Bill Cornwall&#x27;s &quot;Chess: A Knight&#x27;s Tour&quot; has been published by Tribune since 1993, and appears in the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; and Los Angeles Times.

A record of longevity has been achieved by Leonard Barden, who still writes weekly chess columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and has done since September 1955 (61 years as of August 2017), and daily columns for the London Evening Standard since June 1956 (61 years as of August 2017).

As of June 2022 the writer for the &quot;New York Times&quot; chess column is Daniel Naroditsky.

<doc id="151386" wikidata="Q7849459" url="?curid=151386" title="Tscherim Soobzokov">
<text>Tscherim &quot;Tom&quot; Soobzokov (; ) (24 August 1924 – 6 September 1985) was a Circassian spy, American politician, SS Obersturmführer, and Nazi fugitive. He rose to prominence in the New Jersey Democratic Party and the Circassian community in Paterson, New Jersey. During the Cold War, Soobzokov served the CIA as an anti-Soviet operative.

Soobzokov came to national attention in the United States with the publication of Howard Blum&#x27;s &quot;Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America&quot; in 1977, and his subsequent appearance on PBS NewsHour. He was accused of collaborating with Nazi Germany during the invasion of the Soviet Union&#x27;s North Caucasus before coming to the United States. In 1985, Soobzokov was murdered by a pipe bomb at his house. He was publicly supported by Pat Buchanan and New Jersey Congressman Robert Roe.

== Biography==
Tscherim Soobzokov was born August 24, 1924, in Takhtamukay, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In some documents, Soobzokov listed his year of birth as either 1918 or 1921, although these were most likely lies.

In 1940, Soobzokov was arrested and sentenced to 1 year imprisonment for either hooliganism (Soobzokov claimed it had been for &quot;throwing a rock at a judge&quot;) or embezzling farm tax funds.

In August 1942, Soobzokov was recruited by an SS or SD officer as chief of Nazi police in Takhtamukay. In 1943-1944 Soobzokov served as a military recruiter for the Nazis, and in early 1945, he was promoted to the rank of Obersturmführer in the Waffen SS.

After the end of the war, Soobzokov went into hiding in Italy; assured that the Vatican protected Nazi fugitives, Soobzokov remained there until 1947, when, with the aid of the Italian Red Cross and donations from Jordan, a group of 67 Circassian Nazi fugitives made their way to Jordan. One of the Circassians who had journeyed on the same ship from Italy to Jordan later accused Soobzokov of trying to defraud the other passengers and stealing silverware from the ship&#x27;s dining room.

In 1950, Soobzokov was first approached for employment by the CIA. Soobzokov was admitted into the United States in 1955. Soobzokov settled in Paterson, New Jersey and became a naturalized US citizen in 1961. Official accusations against Soobzokov started in 1969, when a fellow immigrant named Mahamet Perchich, who had known Soobzokov in Jordan, wrote a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, claiming Soobzokov had bragged about murdering Jews during the war. In 1972, the Social Security Administration began investigating Soobzokov based on reports of his participation in a Social Security fraud scheme. Despite the investigation and accusations against him in Paterson&#x27;s tight-knit Circassian community, Soobzokov rose through the local political ranks, becoming a Democratic party apparatchik, serving as vice chairman of the Paterson Zoning Board, and eventually being appointed Chief Purchasing Inspector of Passaic County, New Jersey.

Accusations against Soobzokov came to national attention in 1977 with the publication of Howard Blum&#x27;s exposé of Nazi war criminal residing in the United States, &quot;Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America&quot;. Both Blum and Soobzokov appeared on the February 2, 1977 episode of the PBS NewsHour The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. In the program, Soobzokov admitted that &quot;I wore that uniform, but I never was any official. I never was in any service by the so-called Waffen-S.S.,&quot; and denied working for the CIA after WWII. Both statements would subsequently be shown to be false by Soobzokov&#x27;s own defense lawyers in his 1979 denaturalization trial, when they produced secret CIA documents where Soobzokov admitted to serving in the Waffen-SS.

In 1979, the Office of Special Investigations opened a denaturalization case against Soobzokov. In July 1980, the OSI withdrew its suit after the CIA shared with investigators a copy of Soobzokov&#x27;s State Department Form V-30, which confirmed his claims he had disclosed service with the North Caucasian Legion and the Waffen SS when applying for his US immigration visa in Amman.

Soobzokov sued Blum&#x27;s publisher, Quadrangle Books (a division of the New York Times Company) for libel in 1977. After the deportation case against Soobzokov was dropped, the publisher decided to settle the suit for $450,000 before trial. A trove of classified CIA documents released in 2006 under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act contained admissions by Soobzokov that validated witness testimony taken from survivors in the 1970s, and vindicated Blum&#x27;s research.

==War crimes==
The first documented evidence of Soobzokov&#x27;s involvement in war crimes comes from reports made in 1943, after the Nazis had been driven from the North Caucasus. Soobzokov was implicated in the abduction and murder of Bachir Tlekhuch and Valeghei Skhazhok by Tlekhuch&#x27;s father, and by one Soobzokov&#x27;s colleagues in the Nazi Punitive Detachment. Further testimony gathered in 1976 from surviving Nazi collaborators who had served with Soobzokov confirmed his participation in raids and executions in the auls (villages) of Edepsukai-1, Edepsukai-2, and Dzhidzkhihabl. Even Soobzokov&#x27;s own father-in-law (who had himself collaborated with the Nazis in the Vlasov army) and nephew had provided affidavits attesting to his activities.

Circassian immigrants who had known Soobzokov in Paterson claimed that he had bragged about serving in German punitive detachments and participating in executions. A number of Circassian immigrants who had ended up settling in Paterson had personally witnessed Soobzokov rounding up Jews as part of Nazi Punitive Detachments, or later in SS uniform as a military recruiter for the Nazis. Several said that Soobzokov had tried to intimidate them by bringing up his political connections.

Soobzokov had confidentially admitted to the CIA that he had indeed participated in an execution unit and hunted for Jews and Communists. Witnesses said he actively participated in the rounding-up and mass executions of Jews and Communists.

==Relationships with the CIA and FBI==
The CIA first took note of Soobzokov in 1949, and engaged him to provide intelligence and recruit assets in Jordan in December 1950, under the code name &quot;NOSTRIL.&quot; Soobzokov proved to be &quot;a failure of an agent,&quot; only managing to provide his handlers with 2 potential recruits. Agency reports &quot;indicate[d] that he [Soobzokov] is a rather unscrupulous individual.&quot; By the middle of 1952, Soobzokov was unemployed.

The CIA decided to re-engage Soobzokov in 1953, as part of the AEDEPOT program. During a polygraph examination in 1953, a CIA official noted that Soobzokov had &quot;consistent and pronounced reactions to all questions regarding war crimes.&quot; Soobzokov continued recruitment operations for the CIA in Jordan until 1955.

In 1957, Soobzokov resumed working for the CIA as part of project AEACRE in the REDSOX program. The Agency sent Soobzokov to Beirut on an assignment to recruit Russian exiles willing to return to the Soviet Union as undercover agents. The assignment was cut short after the Agency learned that Soobzokov was openly flaunting his CIA affiliation and running a scheme promising to use his connections to help refugees emigrate to America.

Soobzokov had falsely told the CIA that he had attended a Soviet military academy, a claim he later recanted when the Agency decided to send him to a bomb-making course in Fort Meade, Maryland in 1958. Finally, after a 1959 debriefing, a CIA examiner concluded that Soobzokov was an &quot;incorrigible fabricator,&quot; after which the Agency cancelled his operational approval.

In the 1970s, Soobzokov acted as the president of the Committee for Liberation of North Caucasia in U.S.A. (incorporated as a non-profit in 1965) and Committee for Liberation of North Caucasia, in New Jersey U.S.A. (incorporated as a non-profit in 1971), which were likely CIA-funded anti-Soviet front groups similar to the American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia.

In August 1958, Soobzokov became an FBI informant, spying on the immigrant community in Paterson.

==Death==
Soobzokov&#x27;s public notoriety resulted in him receiving death threats. The first attempt on Soobzokov&#x27;s life came in 1979, when someone mailed a package containing a bomb to his house. On 15 August 1985, a pipe bomb was detonated outside Soobzokov&#x27;s home in Paterson, critically injuring him. Soobzokov died of his wounds on 6 September 1985. An anonymous caller claiming to represent the Jewish Defense League said they had carried out the bombing. A spokesman for the JDL later denied responsibility, but applauded Soobzokov&#x27;s murder as a &quot;righteous act.&quot; No one was ever charged with the bombing. Tscherim&#x27;s son, Aslan Soobzokov, has twice sued the federal government over its investigation. In 2017, Aslan made a statement claiming that &quot;Soobzokov was killed because CIA feared revelation of the truth.&quot; The bombing was linked by the FBI to a similar bomb attack on Nazi fugitive Elmārs Sproģis.

The prime suspect in these attacks is Robert Manning, who is also considered a prime suspect in the murder of Alex Odeh. In 1994, Manning was convicted of an unrelated non-political murder, that of computer company secretary Patricia Wilkerson in California, in July 1980, and sentenced to life in prison. In October 2023, Manning was granted parole and is set to be released from prison in July 2024.

<text>Howard Staunton (April 1810 – 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is generally regarded as the world&#x27;s strongest player from 1843 to 1851, largely as a result of his 1843 victory over Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant. He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape – the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cooke – that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world&#x27;s leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world&#x27;s strongest player.

From 1840 onwards he became a leading chess commentator, and won matches against top players of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a parallel career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy, but it never came about. It was alleged by British Chess Association president Lord Lyttelton that Staunton misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match; it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match.

Modern commentators consider Staunton&#x27;s understanding of positional play to have been far ahead of his contemporaries. Although not a rampant attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his &quot;Chess-Players&#x27; Handbook&quot; (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.

==Life==

Most information about Staunton&#x27;s early life is based on claims he made. In the 1861 and 1871 English census, he claimed he was born in Keswick, Cumberland, located within the Lake District, which he listed as his birthplace in the 1851 census. In 1849, he listed William Staunton as his father on his marriage registration. Record of his birth or baptism has never been found.

The chess historian H. J. R. Murray summarised the information that he gleaned from various sources: Staunton was born in 1810, reputedly the natural son (meaning illegitimately born) of Frederick Howard, fifth Earl of Carlisle; he was neglected in youth, receiving little or no education; although he spent some time in Oxford, he was never a member of the university; when he came of age he inherited a few thousand pounds, which he soon squandered; in later life Staunton often used to tell how he had once played Lorenzo in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, with the famous English actor Edmund Kean playing Shylock.

===1836–1842, first steps in chess===
In 1836, Staunton came to London, where he took out a subscription for William Greenwood Walker&#x27;s &quot;Games at Chess, actually played in London, by the late Alexander McDonnell Esq.&quot; Staunton was apparently twenty-six when he took a serious interest in chess. He said that at that time the strongest players he saw in London, Saint-Amant and George Walker, could easily have given him rook odds.

In 1838 he played many games with Captain Evans, inventor of the Evans Gambit, and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H.W. Popert, a slow, cautious player with great defensive skill.

From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a chess column for the &quot;New Court Gazette&quot;. He then became chess editor of the magazine &quot;British Miscellany&quot;, and his chess column developed into a separate magazine, the &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s.

===1843, competitive peak===
Early in 1843 Staunton prevailed in a long series of games against John Cochrane, a strong player and chess theoretician. Chessmetrics treats these games incorrectly as one match when it was in fact a series of matches, and lists it as Staunton&#x27;s best performance.

A little later that year he lost a short match (2½–3½) in London against the visiting French player Saint-Amant, who was generally regarded as the world&#x27;s strongest active player.

Staunton challenged Saint-Amant to a longer match to be played in Paris for a stake of £100, . Then he prepared new opening lines, especially those beginning 1.c4, which became known as the English Opening after this match. He also took Thomas Worrall and Harry Wilson to Paris as his assistants; this is the first known case where seconds were used in a match. Staunton gained a seven-game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning the match 13–8 (eleven wins, four draws, and six losses) in December 1843.

Saint-Amant wanted a third match, but Staunton was initially unwilling as he had developed heart palpitations during the second match. Von der Lasa later suggested this was why Staunton faded in the second match. However, after a long, difficult negotiation, which he reported in the &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844, but he caught pneumonia while travelling and almost died; the match was postponed and never took place.

Several modern commentators regard Staunton as &quot;de facto&quot; World Champion after his match victory over Saint-Amant, although that title did not yet formally exist. After Saint-Amant&#x27;s defeat, no other Frenchmen arose to continue the French supremacy in chess established by Philidor, Deschapelles, La Bourdonnais and Saint-Amant. Some contemporary English commentators, mainly in Staunton&#x27;s &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, and some later writers hailed Staunton as the world champion.

The response was less enthusiastic elsewhere in Europe. Even in England some writers suggested other players, notably Buckle or von der Lasa, were stronger.

===1845–1848, chess writer and promoter===
In 1845 Staunton began a chess column for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, which became the most influential chess column in the world and which he continued for the rest of his life. Although his articles mostly focused on over-the-board play, a significant number featured correspondence chess. Some followed with enthusiasm the progress of promising youngsters, including Paul Morphy. Staunton produced over 1,400 weekly articles for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;.

The first chess match by electric telegraph took place in 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy travelled to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had travelled a total of 220,000 miles (not much less than the distance between Earth and Moon).

In 1847 Staunton published his most famous work, &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which is still in print. It contained over 300 pages of opening analysis, and almost 100 pages of endgame analysis. Staunton&#x27;s Handbook was based on Bilguer and von der Lasa&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; (first published in 1843), but enhanced by many variations and analyses of Staunton&#x27;s own. His book &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Companion&quot; followed in 1849.

He still found time for two matches in 1846, comfortably beating the professionals Bernhard Horwitz (fourteen wins, three draws, and seven losses) and Daniel Harrwitz. The match against Harrwitz was set up in a very unusual way: seven games in which Staunton gave Harrwitz odds of pawn and two moves (Staunton won four and lost three), seven games where he gave pawn and move (Staunton lost six and won one), and seven at no odds (Staunton won all seven).
===1849, marriage and design of a chess set===

On 23 July 1849, Staunton married Frances Carpenter Nethersole, who had had eight children by a previous marriage.

In 1849, Nathaniel Cooke registered a chess set design, and Jaques of London obtained the manufacturing rights. Staunton advertised the new set in his &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; chess column, pointing out that the pieces were easily identifiable, very stable, and good-looking. Each box was signed by Staunton, and Staunton received a royalty on each set sold.

The design became popular, and has been the standard for both professional and amateur chess players ever since. Anthony Saidy and Norman Lessing wrote that, &quot;if a vote was taken among chess-players as to which pieces they most enjoyed playing with, ... the Staunton chessmen would win by an overwhelming margin.&quot;

===1851, London International Tournament===
Staunton proposed and then took the lead in organising the first ever international tournament, as he thought the Great Exhibition of 1851 presented a unique opportunity, because the difficulties that obstructed international participation would be greatly reduced. He may also have been motivated by reports that a few years earlier Ludwig Bledow had proposed to organise an international tournament in Germany, whose winner was to be recognised as the world champion. Staunton and his colleagues had ambitious objectives for this tournament, including convening a &quot;Chess Parliament&quot; to complete the standardisation of various rules and procedures for competitive chess and for writing about chess. Staunton also proposed the production of a compendium showing what was known about chess openings, preferably as a table. Before the tournament started Captain Kennedy and the &quot;Liberty Weekly Tribune&quot; in Missouri wrote that the winner should be regarded as &quot;the World&#x27;s Chess Champion&quot;.

The organisers obtained financial contributions from Europe, the US and Asia, enabling the committee to set up a prize fund of £500, equivalent to about £359,000 in 2006&#x27;s money.
Despite the generally enthusiastic response, several major players were unable to participate, including von der Lasa, Saint-Amant and Cochrane. Adolf Anderssen was at first deterred by the travel costs, but accepted his invitation when Staunton offered to pay Anderssen&#x27;s travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary. The committee had also organised a &quot;London Provincial Tournament&quot; for other British players, and &quot;promoted&quot; some of the entrants to play in the International Tournament to obtain the right number of players for a knock-out tournament.

The tournament was a success, but disappointing for Staunton personally; in the second round he was knocked out by Anderssen, who won the tournament convincingly; and in the play-off for third place Staunton was narrowly beaten by Elijah Williams. Staunton&#x27;s defeat by Williams suggests that Staunton had over-stretched himself by acting as both a competitor and the Secretary of the organising committee.

The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organised a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in Staunton&#x27;s tournament), and the result was the same: Anderssen won.

In 1852 Staunton published his book &quot;The Chess Tournament&quot;, which recounted in detail the efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. Some of Staunton&#x27;s comments in the book and in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; were offensive, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.

===1852–1860, final stages of playing career and Shakespeare publication===
Immediately after the London International tournament Staunton challenged Anderssen to a match of twenty-one games, for £100 (£14,874/US$18,355 in 2022 terms). Anderssen accepted the challenge but the match could not be arranged: Staunton was physically unfit for an immediate contest, and Anderssen had to return to work.

Carl Jaenisch had arrived too late for the tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses). Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against Elijah Williams, who had won their play-off for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start.

In 1853, while trying to arrange a match against Anderssen, Staunton met von der Lasa in Brussels. The two began a match, but had to abandon it in the middle of the thirteenth game, with von der Lasa leading (five wins, four losses, and three draws). Staunton was unfit to continue because of heart palpitations, which had affected him in the second match against Saint-Amant in 1843. In von der Lasa&#x27;s opinion there was no chance that Staunton&#x27;s health would be good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards.

In the mid-1850s Staunton obtained a contract with the publishers Routledge to edit the text of Shakespeare. This edition appeared in parts from 1857 to 1860, and Staunton&#x27;s work was praised by experts.
While Staunton was busy with the Shakespeare edition, he received a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy &quot;for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion&quot; and pointing out that he had not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match.

Staunton also wrote in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; that he had &quot;been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game ... . If Mr. Morphy – for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration – be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions ... ready to test and do honor to his prowess.&quot;

Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton&#x27;s letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray&#x27;s interpretation of Staunton&#x27;s response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe – which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.

Upon arriving in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy&#x27;s offer saying that the challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given time to get back into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks.

Staunton did compete in a tournament in Birmingham, that started on 22 August, but it was a knock-out tournament, and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton&#x27;s last public chess competition. H.J.R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess.

Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker had published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by &quot;Anti-book&quot; appeared in Staunton&#x27;s column in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker&#x27;s article and Morphy&#x27;s letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham.

Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the U.S. asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy&#x27;s family refused to contribute as they &quot;should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else&#x27;s&quot;, but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris, Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton&#x27;s conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy&#x27;s open letter, omitting the reference to the &quot;anti-book&quot; letter.

Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton&#x27;s representation of the facts in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and demanding &quot;that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place.&quot; Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.

===Later life===

Staunton continued writing the chess column in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; until his death in 1874, greeting new developments with enthusiasm. In 1860 he published &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;, a supplement to his 1847 work &quot;The Chess Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy&#x27;s games and praised the American&#x27;s play.

Five years later Staunton published &quot;Great Schools of England&quot; (1865), whose main subject was the history of major English public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas: Learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged; corporal punishment is to be avoided and fagging should be abolished.

Most of Staunton&#x27;s later life was occupied in writing about Shakespeare, including: A photolithographic reproduction of the 1600 Quarto of &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; in 1864 and of the First Folio of Shakespeare in 1866; and papers on &quot;Unsuspected corruptions of Shakespeare&#x27;s text&quot;, published from 1872 to his death. All these works were highly regarded at the time.

When he died suddenly of heart disease, on 22 June 1874, he was at his desk writing one of these papers. At the same time he was also working on his last chess book, &quot;Chess: Theory and Practice&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1876.

A memorial plaque now hangs at his old residence of 117 Lansdowne Road, London. In 1997 a memorial stone bearing an engraving of a chess knight was raised over his grave at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, which had previously been unmarked and neglected.

==Assessment==
Staunton has been a controversial figure ever since his own time. In the words of chess journalist Mark Weeks, &quot;Staunton represents a unique challenge to chess history. Many players immediately associate his name with Paul Morphy, as in &#x27;Staunton ducked a match with Morphy&#x27;. ... This is extremely unfair, as it concentrates the focus on Staunton to a relatively minor, factually controversial incident, while it ignores his significant achievements.&quot; As chess historian Edward Winter writes, &quot;The issue of national bias does, unfortunately, require consideration in the Staunton–Morphy affair.&quot; Chess historian Dale Brandreth makes a similar point, from an American perspective:
However, Frederick Edge (1830–1882) and Philip W. Sergeant (1872–1952), two of Staunton&#x27;s harshest critics, were British, while former world champion Bobby Fischer (1943–2008), one of the biggest fans of both Staunton and Morphy, was American.

===Staunton–Morphy controversy===

Chess historians trace much of the 20th century animosity against Staunton to books by Sergeant about Morphy. Sergeant in turn relied on a book by Edge, who accompanied Morphy to Europe in 1858 as his secretary and personal assistant, but returned to the U.S. in January 1859, a few months before Morphy. Opinions of Edge&#x27;s value as a historical source vary widely:
* American chess journalist Daniel Willard Fiske, reviewing Edge&#x27;s book, commented, &quot;Mr. Morphy expressly disclaims any connection with it in any way or manner. ... will afford the reader a half-hour&#x27;s entertainment&quot;.
* Sergeant&#x27;s books and David Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Paul Morphy: The pride and sorrow of chess&quot; (New York, 1976) make extensive use of Edge&#x27;s book, but note Edge&#x27;s strong anti-Staunton bias. Lawson also suggests that Morphy had seen the manuscript of Edge&#x27;s book, disliked its treatment of the Staunton affair so much that he disavowed it, and objected to Edge&#x27;s treatment of other matters.
* Chess historians H. J. R. Murray, David Hooper and Ken Whyld described Edge as unreliable and having an extreme bias against Staunton.

E.G. Winter summarized the situation by writing:
Edge&#x27;s letters to Fiske show that Edge regarded Morphy as lazy and rather helpless, and himself as the one who would make Morphy&#x27;s name immortal, and that Morphy wanted to keep the negotiations with Staunton discreet while Edge insisted on making them as public as possible.

H.J.R. Murray wrote that Staunton&#x27;s response to Morphy&#x27;s initial challenge and his article about the same in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair:

but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious.

In response to Morphy&#x27;s complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton&#x27;s health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the &quot;City of London Chess Magazine&quot;
Some 20th century commentators have been more critical of Staunton. However some well-known chess writers, including Fred Reinfeld, Israel &quot;Al&quot; Horowitz and Reuben Fine, have been criticised by chess historians for their inaccuracy, both in general and specifically where Staunton is concerned. Edward Winter writes, &quot;It is unwise for the &#x27;non-playing&#x27; historian to publish his own analysis, although he may be a useful compiler. Similarly, players who are unversed in, and indifferent to, chess history should not touch it.&quot;

William Hartston wrote of Staunton&#x27;s non-match with Morphy:

G. H. Diggle wrote in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot;:
===Playing strength and style===

There is a famous story that Paul Morphy described Staunton as the author of &quot;some devilish bad games&quot;. Chess historian Edward Winter traced this back to a book published in 1902, whose author said he had seen a copy of Staunton&#x27;s &quot;The Chess Tournament&quot; in which Morphy had written &quot;some devilish bad games&quot; on the title page; Winter was unable to trace the copy. Around the time of Staunton&#x27;s death, Morphy is said to have commented that Staunton may have been the strongest player of his time, had great analytical ability and judgement of positions, but lacked the imagination required to deliberately create opportunities for combinations.

Twentieth-century opinions of Staunton&#x27;s play varied enormously. Fred Reinfeld, Al Horowitz, and Reuben Fine all condemned it.
In his book The World of Chess, Anthony Saidy refused to reprint a single Staunton game and said his style of play was mostly about the acquisition of material rather than strategic or analytical brilliance.

On the other hand, Savielly Tartakower wrote, &quot;A remarkable feature of Staunton&#x27;s play is the number of ultra-modern ideas with which he was familiar, e.g. the restricted centre, the &quot;fianchetto&quot; development, bilateral work, the theory of the local engagement, etc., and, last but not least, the &quot;English Opening&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Staunton Opening&quot;).&quot; Garry Kasparov considered Staunton &quot;by the early 1840s ... superior to all his rivals&quot;. Bobby Fischer opined that &quot;Staunton was the most profound opening analyst of all time. He was more theorist than player, but nonetheless he was the strongest player of his day ... . In addition, he understood all of the positional concepts which modern players hold dear, and thus – with Steinitz – must be considered the first modern player.&quot;

The website Chessmetrics ranks Staunton as world number one from May 1843 to August 1849, in the top ten from July 1851 to May 1853, and in the top five from June 1853 to January 1856.

From the early 1840s–1851 Staunton could successfully give odds to almost any UK-based player, including eventually John Cochrane; the exceptions were Henry Thomas Buckle, to whom Staunton gave pawn and move in 1843 and lost their match (6 losses, no draws, 1 win), and Elijah Williams in 1851, against whom Staunton won more games, but lost the match because he had given Williams a 3-game start. According to match records collected by Jeremy P. Spinrad, the only players who were successful against Staunton without receiving odds from 1840 to 1852 were:
* Saint-Amant, who won their first match in London in 1843 and lost their second, longer match in Paris the same year;
* Adolf Anderssen, who eliminated Staunton from the 1851 London International tournament; and
* Elijah Williams, who beat Staunton in the play-off for third place in the same tournament.

Before 1840 Staunton was still a relative beginner, and after 1851 his health was too fragile for serious competition. In the late 1840s some UK commentators wrote that Buckle was stronger, and von der Lasa was regarded by some as the world&#x27;s best. Staunton did not play von der Lasa until 1853, and was forced by ill-health to abandon the match.

In his own time Staunton was regarded as belonging to the &quot;closed&quot; category of chess players (along with for example Philidor and József Szén) rather than to the &quot;heroic&quot; category (which included La Bourdonnais, Morphy, and Anderssen) – instead of seeking immediate combat, Staunton deferred it until he was ready. The closed English Opening got its name from Staunton&#x27;s frequent use of it, especially against Saint-Amant in 1843. However he was noted for the accuracy and incisiveness of his combinations.

===Personality===
Staunton&#x27;s virtues and defects were both on a large scale. Former world champion Garry Kasparov commented that Staunton &quot;founded and edited the magazine &quot;Chess Player&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; ... wrote a chess column (1845–1874), studied opening theory ... published four remarkable books ... endorsed the famous &#x27;Staunton pieces&#x27; ... organized the first international chess tournament in history ... .&quot; However, British International Master William Hartston wrote that Staunton&#x27;s many achievements were done &quot;with the full weight of an arrogant and pompous nature which has scarcely been matched in the history of the game.&quot;

Even contemporaries sympathetic to Staunton admitted that he could be spiteful in response to unexpected defeats, and to proposals or arguments that he considered ill-founded or malicious. Staunton had a highly volatile relationship with George Walker, the founder of the London Chess Club, a dedicated populariser of chess, and one of Staunton&#x27;s earliest supporters.

Chess journalism could be a bruising business in those days, even when Staunton was not involved. However it does seem that Staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes.

Staunton&#x27;s enemies gave as good as they got.

H. J. R. Murray suggested that these frequent wars of words may have originated from leading players&#x27; and commentators&#x27; jealousy over Staunton&#x27;s unexpected rise to the top in the early 1840s, and from snobbish disdain about his humble and possibly illegitimate birth. Saidy and Lessing wrote that, &quot;He can hardly be blamed if the struggles and privations of his youth warped his character so that he became a jealous, suspicious, and vitriolic man.&quot;

On the other hand, Staunton&#x27;s often-criticized description of Anderssen as Germany&#x27;s second best player, after Anderssen had won the 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable on the basis of what is now known about von der Lasa&#x27;s skill. Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: A large percentage of his 1860 book &quot;Chess Praxis&quot; was devoted to Morphy&#x27;s games, which he praised highly; and in &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1849) Staunton sometimes criticised his own play, and presented a few of his losses.

Staunton showed excellent management skills in building the team to organise the 1851 London International tournament, and determination and resourcefulness in overcoming the difficulties of getting enough competitors. He also maintained good working relationships with important players and enthusiasts, for example: Popert and Cochrane helped him to prepare for his second match against Saint-Amant; Captain Evans agreed to be one of his seconds in that match and later helped Staunton to organise the 1845 telegraphic match; the Calcutta Chess Club contributed £100 to help finance the London International Tournament in 1851, and in addition its principal officers Cochrane and T.C. Morton made two of the four largest personal contributions; Staunton corresponded with von der Lasa for over 30 years, although they only met once; Staunton&#x27;s last letter to von der Lasa, November 1873, expressed his sorrow at the deaths of various masters and enthusiasts, including Saint-Amant, and especially Carl Jaenisch.

In conversation Staunton was charming and witty.

Despite the disappointing way in which his playing career ended, Staunton continued to write with enthusiasm about the progress of new technologies, players, and developments in chess theory. His last book, &quot;Chess: Theory and Practice&quot;, was sufficiently complete at the time of his death to be published posthumously in 1876, and it was described as up-to-date fourteen years after his death.

===Influence on chess===

Staunton proposed and was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament, which proved that such events were possible, and which produced a clear consensus on who was the world&#x27;s strongest player – Adolf Anderssen. All subsequent international tournaments took place in Great Britain until Paris 1867.

Contemporaries, including Steinitz and Morphy, regarded Staunton&#x27;s writings on chess openings as among the best of their time. Staunton&#x27;s &quot;Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1847) immediately became the leading English-language chess textbook. It went through twenty-one reprints by 1935, spawned several imitators, and remained in print (in a revised edition) until the 1940s.

Around 1888 Staunton&#x27;s &quot;Chess: Theory and Practice&quot;, published posthumously in 1876, was regarded as modern in most respects, but there was a growing need for more up-to-date analysis of openings.

Staunton&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The City of London Chess Magazine&quot; said:
His play, however, had little influence on other players of the day. William Hartston explains that
Staunton&#x27;s style and the openings that accompanied it were eclipsed by the more directly aggressive styles of Anderssen and Morphy, which dominated chess from 1851 until Steinitz unveiled his positional approach in 1873.

There is little evidence that Staunton had much direct influence on modern chess. Although he introduced the English Opening, it has been called &quot;really a 20th century invention&quot; that only became fully respectable after future world champion Mikhail Botvinnik began playing it in the 1930s. Similarly, although Staunton was an early champion of the Sicilian Defense, which is today the most popular opening, and the most successful response to 1.e4, Staunton seems to have had little influence on how the Sicilian is played today: He regarded it as a safe defensive line, while it is now treated as a vigorous but slightly risky counterattack.

Staunton introduced the Staunton Gambit against the Dutch Defence (1.d4 f5 2.e4). Although it was once a feared attacking line, it has been out of favour since the mid-1920s, and is thought to &quot;offer White equality at best&quot;. Staunton also analysed a different gambit approach to the Dutch, 2.h3 followed by g4. In 1979 Viktor Korchnoi, one of the world&#x27;s leading players, successfully introduced this line into top-class competition, but later authorities concluded, as Staunton had, that Black gets a good game with 2...Nf6 3.g4 d5

Staunton also advocated the Ponziani Opening 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3, which was often called &quot;Staunton&#x27;s Opening&quot;. It is rarely played today because it allows Black to choose between a sharp counterattack and a safe line that usually leads to a draw.
===His other writings===
Staunton&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays was respected.

==Staunton Memorial Tournament==
Between 2003 and 2009, a Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament was held at Simpson&#x27;s-in-the-Strand, London, a restaurant which Staunton regularly visited in the 19th century to play and discuss chess (it was then a coffee house known as &quot;The Divan&quot; or &quot;Simpson&#x27;s Divan&quot;). The 2008 tournament was the strongest to be held in London since 1986.

Notes:
#In some cases it is known who won but not by what score.
#Books and articles about most players often omit games at odds. But Staunton gave odds, usually successfully, in his matches against most UK-based players and most of his matches were played this way.
#&quot;P + 1&quot; means &quot;Pawn and move&quot;, &quot;P + 2&quot; means &quot;Pawn and two moves&quot;.

<text>Paul James Martin (born 9 July 1957), known by the stage name Paul Merton, is an English comedian.

Known for his improvisation skill, Merton&#x27;s humour is rooted in deadpan, surreal and sometimes dark comedy. He has been ranked by critics, fellow comedians and viewers to be among Britain&#x27;s greatest comedians. He made his breakthrough in the late 1980s as a regular performer on the original British version of the comedy improvisation show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, and has been a team captain on the comedy panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; since it began in 1990. He was also the host of &quot;Room 101&quot; from 1999 to 2007, replacing original host Nick Hancock.

Merton appears as a panellist regularly on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, first appearing in 1989, and became the only remaining regular panellist in 2009 following the death of Clement Freud. He has also appeared as one of the Comedy Store&#x27;s Comedy Store Players.

== Early life ==
Paul James Martin was born on 9 July 1957 in Parsons Green, west London, to an English Anglican father, Albert Martin (a train driver on the London Underground), and an Irish Catholic mother, Mary Ann Power (a medical nurse). It was revealed on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that Merton&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James Power, was from Passage East in County Waterford and served in the British Army in the First World War. His father then left to join the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, serving as an IRA volunteer with the rank of 1st lieutenant in the East Waterford Brigade. 

Merton lived in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham until 8 years old. Merton attended St Thomas&#x27;s School, Fulham and St Teresa&#x27;s, Morden (&quot;being sent to Coventry at school&quot;). He then went to Wimbledon College, a Jesuit-run secondary school that was formerly a grammar school and had just become a comprehensive, in a stream for boys who had failed the 11-plus, and he passed A-levels in English and History. 

After leaving school, Merton worked at the Tooting employment office as a clerical officer for three years, quitting in February 1980.

Merton auditioned for Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts at 19 years old.

== Career ==
Merton has stated that he was inspired to go into comedy at an early age watching clowns at a circus, remembering, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d seen clowns before. I&#x27;d certainly never seen adults behave like this...From that evening, I wanted to be part of the process that was making all those people laugh.&quot; He gained his earliest professional credits under his birth name, including an appearance as a yokel in &quot;Time&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; in 1984. On joining Equity he found that the name Paul Martin was already taken by a juggler in Leeds, so he renamed himself after Merton, the district of London where he grew up.

=== Stage ===

Though he had harboured serious ambitions of becoming a performing comedian since his school days, it was not until April 1982, at the Comedy Store in Soho, that his dream was realised. Merton commented that he made his professional debut, along with writing partner John Irwin, in Swansea in 1982 which led to having an &quot;affection for Wales&quot;. &quot;What we did over the course of two weeks was perform 10 shows and it meant that our first time on stage if we made a mistake on the Monday we wouldn&#x27;t repeat that mistake the next day.&quot;

Merton recalls that on only his second or third night he found the dour role that has informed his comic approach ever since. After performing on the London Alternative Comedy circuit at places like The Comedy Store and Jongleurs, in 1985 his first foray to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival was with the show Have You Been on Telly where he shared the bill with Morris Minor and the Majors and Mark Steel. He has been a member of the London improvisation group The Comedy Store Players since 1985, and still regularly performs with them.

Merton has performed in Paul Merton&#x27;s Impro Chums at Pleasance as part of the Edinburgh Comedy Festival every year from 2008.

Merton was due to make his West End debut in the 2021 revival of &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the London Coliseum. However, after several delays to the show it was confirmed that Merton would not be joining the company.

=== Radio ===
In the late 1980s, Merton appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Big Fun Show&quot;. After long-time &quot;Just a Minute&quot; panellist Kenneth Williams died in 1988, Merton (a fan of the show) contacted the producer at the suggestion of the host, Nicholas Parsons. He was invited to participate during the following year and has appeared regularly on the programme ever since. In 2016 Merton overtook Williams to become the second most regular panellist, surpassed only by Clement Freud.

Besides his work on &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, Merton was a semi-regular guest on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; from 1991 to 1998. Between 1993 and 1995, Merton was among the regular cast members on the Radio 4 improvisational comedy series &quot;The Masterson Inheritance&quot;. In 2000 he presented &quot;Two Priests and a Nun Go into a Pub&quot;, in which he interviewed British and Irish comedians who had (like Merton himself) been brought up as members of the Roman Catholic Church. In 2009, Merton started a Radio 4 series in which he reads Spike Milligan&#x27;s war memoirs in an audio-book fashion.

=== Television ===
Merton&#x27;s breakthrough as a television performer came in 1988 with Channel 4&#x27;s improvised comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, which moved to TV from BBC Radio 4, though he had previously performed on the channel&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Live&quot; and compered its series Comedy Wavelength in 1987. He remained on &quot;Whose Line&quot; until 1993. &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; began in 1990, and two series of his own sketch show, &quot;Paul Merton: The Series&quot;, followed soon after. In 1995 he presented a documentary series celebrating the history of the London Palladium, entitled &quot;Paul Merton&#x27;s Palladium Story&quot;. In 1996, Merton performed updated versions of fifteen of Ray Galton and Alan Simpson&#x27;s old scripts for an ITV series, &quot;Paul Merton in Galton &amp; Simpson&#x27;s...&quot;. Six of these scripts were previously performed by Tony Hancock. These were very badly received by critics, and although a selection of episodes was initially released on VHS, it was not until June 2007 that the complete series was released on DVD.

Also in 1996, Merton took a break from &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; during its eleventh series, making only one appearance as a guest on fellow captain Ian Hislop&#x27;s team. Merton later said that at the time he was &quot;very tired&quot; of the show and that he thought it had become &quot;stuck in a rut&quot;. Nevertheless, he added that he felt his absence gave the programme the &quot;shot in the arm&quot; it needed and that it had been &quot;better ever since&quot;. In 2002, following allegations in the UK tabloids linking the show&#x27;s chairman, Angus Deayton, with prostitutes and drug use, the host was asked to resign from the show. Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton&#x27;s departure and was described as &quot;merciless&quot; in his treatment of his former co-star.

In 1999 Merton replaced Nick Hancock as host of &quot;Room 101&quot;, a chat show in which guests are offered the chance to discuss their pet hates and consign them to the oblivion of Room 101. His first guest was Hancock. He hosted 64 editions. In 2007, his final guest was Ian Hislop (who became the first interviewee to appear twice, having also been on an edition with Hancock). Hislop&#x27;s selections deliberately included items that Merton was known to like, such as The Beatles and the films of Charlie Chaplin. Hislop&#x27;s final choice was Merton himself, done to represent his departure from the show. Merton cast himself in the room to end the show, although on the condition that Hislop would go in with him.

Merton is one of the recurring stars from the 4 ITV Pantos. His best role came in 1999, where Merton starred alongside Ronnie Corbett as one of the ugly sisters in ITV&#x27;s Christmas pantomime of Cinderella. His other co-stars were Julian Clary, Samantha Janus, Ben Miller, Harry Hill, Frank Skinner and Alexander Armstrong. In the same year – to coincide with the launch of his first stand up tour in 10 years, &quot;and this is me...Paul Merton –&quot; he was given his own one hour &quot;South Bank Show&quot; special. The show charted his beginnings in the comedy business, to the development of his improvisational skills, his mental breakdown, and the popularity of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;.

He was rumoured to be a possible new host of &quot;Countdown&quot; to replace both Richard Whiteley and his successor, Des Lynam, but decided not to pursue this.

Merton is a keen student of comedy, particularly the early silent comedians and in 2006, BBC Four broadcast &quot;Paul Merton&#x27;s Silent Clowns&quot;, a four-part documentary series on the silent comedy craft of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Harold Lloyd. He examined their respective careers, interspersed with moments from a live show in which he presented clips of their work. Among the audience were many children, who were seeing the performers for the first time. Merton took a stage version of this show to the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe Festival and in late 2007 took the show on a UK tour. A tie-in book, &quot;Silent Comedy&quot;, was written by Merton and published by RH Books in late 2007. &quot;The Independent&quot; described it as &quot;clearly a labour of love&quot; but criticised the exhaustive and overly-thorough plot synopses of the films discussed.

Also in 2007 Merton presented a four-part travel documentary, &quot;Paul Merton in China&quot;, which was broadcast on Five from 21 May 2007. His second travel series, &quot;Paul Merton in India&quot; was transmitted from 8 October 2008 on the same channel. A third series, &quot;Paul Merton in Europe&quot; began broadcasting on 11 January 2010, again on Five. In 2015 he was commissioned by More4 to present &quot;Paul Merton’s Secret Stations&quot;, a travel documentary series about some of Britain&#x27;s little-used request stop railway stations inspired by travel writer Dixe Wills&#x27; book &quot;Tiny Stations&quot;.

In 2009, Paul wrote and presented &quot;Morecambe and Wise: The Show What Paul Merton Did&quot;.

Merton hosted the British version of &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, which aired on ITV in 2008. In 2009, Merton directed and presented a documentary on the British films of Alfred Hitchcock, in a series of star-presented documentaries on BBC Four. In May 2010, Merton temporarily co-presented &quot;The One Show&quot; after Adrian Chiles left the show.

His three-part documentary series &quot;Paul Merton&#x27;s Birth of Hollywood&quot; about the early history of Hollywood was broadcast in May 2011 on BBC2. In Merton&#x27;s third TV series for 2011, &quot;Paul Merton&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, he travels around the world going on popular tourist trails, but still manages to find some extraordinary things.

In 2021, Merton returned to Channel 5 for a new travel show, &quot;Motorhoming with Merton &amp; Webster&quot;, a 6-part hour-long series which sees Merton travelling around Britain with his wife Suki Webster in a camper van.

In October 2023, Merton appeared on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Antiques Road Trip&quot; with his wife Suki.

In 2024, Merton appeared as the guest on the programme &quot;Perfect Pub Walks with Bill Bailey&quot;. Merton and Bill Bailey walked, talked and visited pubs on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset.

== Personal life ==
Merton married actress Caroline Quentin in 1990; they announced their separation in April 1997, which was followed by divorce in 1998. Merton had a relationship with producer and actress Sarah Parkinson; they were married unofficially in a service in the Maldives in 2000. They were officially married three months before her death from breast cancer on 23 September 2003. He married fellow improviser Suki Webster in 2009 and they live in Sudbury, Suffolk.

Shortly before becoming a household name on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, Merton booked himself into the Maudsley psychiatric hospital for six weeks, because of psychiatric problems caused by the malaria medicine Lariam. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; he was reported to have been &quot;hallucinating conversations with friends, and became convinced he was a target for the Freemasons&quot;.

He used his experiences at Maudsley as a key framework in his 2012 tour, &quot;Out of My Head&quot;. He gave many examples of his misadventures there, conversations with staff and fellow patients were played out as sketches with his fellow performers, Richard Vranch, Lee Simpson and Suki Webster. He stated that, during his time at the Maudsley, he was simultaneously appearing in &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; on Channel 4.

== Acclaim and awards ==
In a 2007 public poll featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Merton was voted alongside the likes of Oscar Wilde, Spike Milligan, Noël Coward and Winston Churchill as one of the ten greatest wits of all time. &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, a 2005 Channel 4 poll of fellow comedians, saw him voted among the top twenty greatest international comedians in history, with host Jimmy Carr crediting him for being &quot;responsible for more great lines than Angus Deayton&#x27;s dealer&quot;. &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The A–Z of Laughter&quot;, a 2003 special compiled by expert judges which featured the 50 funniest acts in British comedy by letter, applauded Merton for &quot;bringing to &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; a genuine surrealism that cuts through the clubbable smugness&quot;.

Merton has accumulated multiple awards and honours. After seven BAFTA Award nominations for &quot;Best Entertainment Performance&quot;, he finally won the award in 2003, defeating fellow &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; star Angus Deayton, who had been dismissed from the show the previous October. He has since been nominated for a further three awards – a total of eleven nominations – including a nomination for his travel documentary &quot;Paul Merton in China&quot;. Merton&#x27;s appearances on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; have seen him nominated for five British Comedy Awards, winning the 1992 &quot;Top TV Comedy Personality&quot; and 1999 &quot;Best Comedy Entertainment Personality&quot; awards. He has also shared a further three British Comedy Awards with the panel and crew of the show, winning &quot;Best new TV comedy&quot; in 1991, &quot;Best comedy gameshow&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Best Comedy Panel Show&quot; in 2009. He received the 2004 Broadcasting Press Guild Award for &quot;Best Non-Acting Performer&quot;, also for his work on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In 2008, Merton presented Bruce Forsyth with a BAFTA Fellowship: Forsyth had given Merton his Best Entertainment Performance award in 2003.

<doc id="151390" wikidata="Q741663" url="?curid=151390" title="Heaven 17">
<text>Heaven 17 are an English synth-pop band formed in Sheffield in 1980. The band were a trio for most of their career, composed of founding Human League members Martyn Ware (keyboards, drum machine, vocals) and Ian Craig Marsh (keyboards) with vocalist Glenn Gregory.

Although most of their music was recorded in the 1980s, they have occasionally reformed, and played their first live concerts in 1997.

==History==
===1980s===
====Origin and formation====
Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware were the founding members of pioneering Sheffield synthpop group the Human League; Glenn Gregory (who had previously been in a punk band called Musical Vomit with Marsh) had been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but as he had moved to London to work as a photographer at the time, they chose Ware&#x27;s school friend Philip Oakey instead. When personal and creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980, Marsh and Ware left the band, ceding the Human League name to Oakey. They formed the production company British Electric Foundation (B.E.F.).

====1981: B.E.F. and &quot;Penthouse and Pavement&quot;====
B.E.F.&#x27;s first recordings were a cassette-only album called &quot;Music for Stowaways&quot; and an LP called &quot;Music for Listening To&quot;, which was re-released on CD in 1997 with two extra tracks. Shortly after, they completed their line-up when they recruited their friend, photographer Glenn Gregory, as vocalist. Taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in Anthony Burgess&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (where The Heaven Seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with &quot;Inside&quot;), Heaven 17 was intended to be just one of the musical projects for British Electric Foundation.

Like the Human League, Heaven 17 used synthesisers and drum machines heavily (the Linn LM-1 programmed by Ware). Session musicians were used for bass guitar and guitar (John Wilson) and grand piano (Nick Plytas). Whereas the band&#x27;s former colleagues the Human League had gone on to major chart success in 1981, Heaven 17 struggled to make an impact. Their debut single &quot;(We Don&#x27;t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang&quot; attracted some attention and was banned by the BBC due to concerns by Radio 1&#x27;s legal department that it libelled Ronald Reagan, who had recently been elected President of the United States. Neither &quot;Fascist Groove Thang&quot; nor any of the three other singles taken from the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Penthouse and Pavement&quot; reached the UK Top 40. The album itself proved to be a success, however, peaking at Number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the BPI in 1982.

Around this time, Ware and Marsh produced two further albums as B.E.F., the first being &quot;Music of Quality &amp; Distinction Volume One&quot; featuring Glenn Gregory, Tina Turner, Paula Yates, Billy Mackenzie, Hank Marvin, Paul Jones, Bernie Nolan, and Gary Glitter. The tracks were cover versions of songs that Ware, Marsh and Gregory had grown up listening to. The album peaked at number 25. The second album was &quot;Geisha Boys and Temple Girls&quot; for the dance troupe Hot Gossip, which used songs formerly recorded by the Human League and Heaven 17, and a track each from Sting and Talking Heads. B.E.F. took over production duties when Richard James Burgess of the band Landscape was unable to complete the album.

====1982–1983: &quot;The Luxury Gap&quot; and commercial success====
In October 1982, Heaven 17 released their new single &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, which charted just outside the UK Top 40 (but reached the Irish Top 30). However, in 1983 the band&#x27;s fortunes changed. Their next single, &quot;Temptation&quot; (on which they were augmented by vocalist Carol Kenyon and a studio orchestra), reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1983 and became their biggest hit. The song was taken from their second album, &quot;The Luxury Gap&quot;, which featured further chart hits &quot;Come Live with Me&quot; (UK #5) and &quot;Crushed by the Wheels of Industry&quot; (UK #17). The album itself charted at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, their highest ever position, and was certified platinum by the BPI in 1984.

In the United States, their self-titled &quot;Heaven 17&quot; album was a re-working of &quot;Penthouse and Pavement&quot; with three songs deleted and replaced by &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Money&quot; (along with a different mix of &quot;The Height of the Fighting&quot;). American and Canadian new wave audiences were most familiar with &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, which received high rotation airplay on alternative rock and new wave format radio stations such as Los Angeles, California&#x27;s KROQ-FM, and Long Island, New York&#x27;s WLIR, an CKOI-FM (Montreal), a regular Top Ten station, and additionally, frequent MTV exposure.

====1983–1985: Collaborations and &quot;How Men Are&quot;====
Towards the end of 1983, the band (under their B.E.F. guise and assisted by Greg Walsh) helped relaunch Tina Turner&#x27;s career, producing, and providing backing vocals on her hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, a cover of the Al Green song. 1984 saw the release of Heaven 17&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;How Men Are&quot;, which reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified silver by the BPI. The album featured the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire brass section, and two singles from the album (&quot;Sunset Now&quot; and &quot;This Is Mine&quot;) both reached the UK Top 40, but would be the band&#x27;s last singles to do so until various remixes were released in the 1990s.

The band also worked on the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at the end of 1984, with Gregory supplying vocals alongside Midge Ure and Sting, after a personal request from Ure that he attend. However, the band did not perform at Live Aid the following year. Heaven 17&#x27;s first &quot;live&quot; performance was in 1982 on the UK television programme &quot;The Tube&quot; (though the band made use of backing tapes during this performance).

In 1985 Heaven 17 joined the Red Wedge collective.

====1986–1988: Critical and commercial decline====
After the remix album &quot;Endless&quot; peaked at number 70 in July 1986, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Pleasure One&quot; was released in November 1986 and featured the single &quot;Trouble&quot; (UK No. 51, Germany #17). The album contained a number of songs that were originally intended for a French film project that never came to be. This was also the first Heaven 17 album to not mention production credits for B.E.F. and the abbreviation would not appear again until the &quot;Bigger Than America&quot; album in 1996. It was followed up in 1988 with the album &quot;Teddy Bear, Duke &amp; Psycho&quot; (featuring the singles &quot;The Ballad of Go Go Brown&quot; and &quot;Train of Love in Motion&quot;), although these two albums were poorly received and had little commercial success. In September 1988, the band appeared on the bill at the Sport Aid event in Sheffield. Heaven 17 were managed by Keith Bourton for Heavenly Management Ltd. during much of this period.

===1990s===
The early 1990s was a quiet period for the band, though Ware produced a second B.E.F. album in 1991, to follow 1982&#x27;s original &quot;Music of Quality &amp; Distinction.&quot; This album again featured Tina Turner and Billy Mackenzie, but this time also featured artists such as Scritti Politti&#x27;s Green Gartside, Lalah Hathaway, Billy Preston, and Chaka Khan. Ware also became a producer for the likes of Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Soft Cell&#x27;s Marc Almond, and Erasure. Gregory, meanwhile, went on to form the band Honeyroot with Keith Lowndes, then Ugly with John Uriel and Ian Wright . 

In late 1992, a Brothers in Rhythm remix of &quot;Temptation&quot; reached number 4 and was followed by the compilation album &quot;Higher and Higher – The Best of Heaven 17&quot; in 1993. Remixes of &quot;(We Don&#x27;t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang&quot; and &quot;Penthouse and Pavement&quot; were also minor hits in 1993. However, the band would not release any new material as Heaven 17 until 1996&#x27;s &quot;Bigger Than America&quot;. The album failed to chart in the UK.

===2000s===
The year 2005 saw the release of a new studio album, &quot;Before After&quot;, which had a much more contemporary dance sound compared to previous albums. A CD composed entirely of remixes of the song &quot;Hands Up to Heaven&quot; from the album reached number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in May 2006. In October of the same year, Virgin Records issued a greatest hits compilation album entitled &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, which included a previously-unheard version of &quot;Temptation&quot; with spoken vocals by an unknown student from Germany whom the band met in 1982. It had been discovered on 1-inch tape by Gregory&#x27;s mother and was remastered by Simon Heyworth. In November 2005, Heaven 17 were filmed for a live DVD playing to a packed house at The Scala in London. The DVD contains an in-depth question-and-answer session with both Ware and Gregory, along with fans&#x27; reactions to the gig.

In 2006, Marsh stopped making live appearances with the band. In an early 2009 interview, Ware stated that Marsh had left the band and was now studying at university. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Billie Godfrey worked with the band as a backing vocalist and appeared with them at concerts. She performed as part of the band on 21 November 2008 for their highest profile TV appearance of recent years on &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call 1983&quot; on ITV1.

In December 2008, Heaven 17 toured the UK as part of the Sheffield band-based Steel City Tour alongside the Human League and ABC. Coinciding with this was the release of their new album, &quot;Naked as Advertised – Versions 08&quot;, issued through the Just Music record label. The album contained re-workings of tracks such as &quot;Temptation&quot; along with versions of Ware songs best known from his time with the Human League, including &quot;Being Boiled&quot; and &quot;Empire State Human&quot;, as well as a cover of the Associates&#x27; hit &quot;Party Fears Two&quot;. The band were managed by Nick Ashton-Hart for much of the early 2000s.

In December 2009, Heaven 17 made appearances at the &quot;Nokia Night of the Proms&quot; in Germany.

===2010s===
On 16 February 2010, Heaven 17 joined La Roux to record a joint live session for the BBC which was shown on the BBC Red Button interactive channel in January 2010. Glenn Gregory joined La Roux on stage at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2010, performing &quot;Temptation&quot;. (La Roux cite Heaven 17 as one of their main influences). The two acts also appeared live on stage at the War Child Brit Awards aftershow in February 2010.

In the run up to their 30th anniversary, the band announced several dates in which they would perform their 1981 debut album &quot;Penthouse and Pavement&quot; live in its entirety for the first time. The dates were scheduled over November and December 2010 with the first date held on 10 November 2010 at the well known Leadmill live music venue in Sheffield. By chance the Leadmill also celebrated a 30-year anniversary in 2010. By their own admission this Leadmill gig was one of the band&#x27;s most successful. The band performed a couple of dates of the Penthouse and Pavement tour in March 2010, one of which was in Sheffield and was filmed and shown on BBC Two on 16 May 2010. An hour-long documentary about the making of the album was shown on BBC Two the following night. This film was also screened at a special &quot;Music in Sheffield&quot; evening of films at the Showroom in Sheffield, which Martyn Ware attended, on the eve of the announcement of the City of Culture 2013.

The band appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on 22 October 2010, performing &quot;(We Don&#x27;t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang&quot; and &quot;Temptation&quot; and appeared in BBC Children in Need in November 2010. They also made a tongue-in-cheek appearance in TV advertisements for Sheffield-based broadband provider Plusnet. On 22 November, the band released a 2 disc DVD combining never-seen-before documentary and rehearsal footage with the band&#x27;s full live concert filmed in Sheffield in March 2010. Also included was a unique collection of all the digital videos used in the live show, set to the accompanying live audio from the performance. Each video was commissioned from a different visual artist and included both established up-and-coming artists from the worlds of digital and graphic design, fine art, and film.

Since 2011 the band&#x27;s regular keyboard player has been Berenice Scott (the daughter of Robin Scott of the group M and &quot;Pop Muzik&quot; fame). In July 2014, they appeared as special guests of John Shuttleworth in his BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;John Shuttleworth&#x27;s Music Lounge&quot; and performed some of Shuttleworth&#x27;s material.

In November 2015, a compilation album called &quot;80s Recovered&quot; featured many groups including Heaven 17. They performed a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, with a regular version, and a remix.

During October 2016, Heaven 17 undertook a dual headline tour with their British Electronic Foundation (B.E.F.) The dates included venues in Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Gateshead, Manchester, Bury St Edmunds, Basingstoke and London. B.E.F. enlisted Mari Wilson, Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols), and Peter Hooton (The Farm) to present new arrangements of songs from the B.E.F. back catalogue. The tour was significant in that it was the first time that Heaven 17 had played the Sheffield City Hall, having not performed there during the 1980s.

In January 2017, Ware and Gregory started work on a new album at Ware&#x27;s London studio &quot;The House of Illustrious&quot;. A work-in-progress version of this album was released by Bowers &amp; Wilkins under the title &quot;Not For Public Broadcast&quot; (Society of Sound #105).

In late 2018 Heaven 17 gigs in Liverpool, London, Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield celebrated the 35th anniversary of &quot;The Luxury Gap&quot; album. The tour support was provided by X-Propaganda featuring Claudia Brücken and Susanne Freytag from &#x27;80s band Propaganda.

In October/November 2019 the band took part as &#x27;Special Guests&#x27; on a tour with Squeeze.

===2020s===
In September 2021 the group performed the first two Human League albums &quot;Reproduction&quot; (1979) and &quot;Travelogue&quot; (1980) in Sheffield and London with long-standing collaborator Malcolm Garrett providing live visuals on stage. 

In September 2024, Ware said Rockstar Games had asked to license &quot;Temptation&quot; for its upcoming video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto VI&quot; for per writer; Ware countered with an offer for or &quot;a reasonable royalty&quot; but said Rockstar declined. Ware responded &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot;, citing the estimated revenue earned by the game&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Naomi Pohl, the general secretary of the Musicians&#x27; Union, felt Ware&#x27;s reaction was unsurprising and said the game&#x27;s high profile would not necessarily translate to higher exposure for the song, noting that &quot;streaming doesn&#x27;t sustain careers&quot;.

<doc id="151395" wikidata="Q3345451" url="?curid=151395" title="David Gower">
<text>David Ivon Gower (born 1 April 1957) is an English cricket commentator and former cricketer who was captain of the England cricket team during the 1980s. Described as one of the most stylish left-handed batsmen of his era, Gower played 117 Test matches and 114 One Day Internationals (ODI) scoring 8,231 and 3,170 runs, respectively. He was one of the most capped and high-scoring players for England during his period, and only Jack Hobbs made more runs against Australia than Gower&#x27;s 3,269. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

Gower led England during the 1985 Ashes, and his team was victorious; however, two 5–0 whitewashes against the West Indies (in 1984 and 1985–86) reflected poorly on his captaincy, and Gower was replaced in 1986. He was briefly reinstated for the 1989 Ashes series, before being replaced as captain by Graham Gooch. The strained relationship between the pair contributed to Gower retiring from international cricket in 1993. Nevertheless, he ended with an impressive record in first-class cricket, accumulating 26,339 runs at an average of 40.08, and 53 centuries. As of February 2021, he held the record of 119 consecutive innings without registering a duck in Test cricket. Following his retirement, Gower became a successful cricket commentator with Sky Sports, and on 16 July 2009 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

On the occasion of England&#x27;s 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country&#x27;s greatest Test XI by the ECB.

==Early life==
Gower was born in Tunbridge Wells in 1957. His father, Richard Gower OBE, was working for the Colonial Service in a position in Dar es Salaam, capital of the then British-administered territory of Tanganyika Territory, where Gower spent his early childhood. The family returned to England after Tanganyika was granted independence, when Gower was six years old, settling in Kent and later moving to Loughborough. Gower attended prep school at Marlborough House School in Hawkhurst from the age of 8 to that of 13, where he leaned towards cricket as his preferred sport.

He was awarded a scholarship to attend The King&#x27;s School in Canterbury – where his father had once been head boy – as a boarder. Gower made the school cricket First XI aged 14, and was later made captain. He also played for the rugby First XV before being dropped from the team for &quot;lack of effort&quot;. While at school, Gower played representative cricket for Public Schools against English Schools at under-16 level.

Gower finished school with eight O levels, three A levels and one S level in history. He sat the History exam for Oxford University and was offered an interview at St Edmund Hall, but missed a place. Spurning a place at University College London, Gower returned to school in an attempt to gain two more A levels but lost interest partway through the year. Having played some matches for the Leicestershire Second XI the previous summer, Gower tried his luck at the club as a professional for the remainder of the year, for £25 per week. In the summer, Gower returned to University College, where he studied law, but after six months he returned to professional cricket.

Gower is nicknamed &quot;Lord Gower&quot; by his Sky Sports colleagues, in allusion to his aristocratic ancestry and public school education. As a member of the Gower family formerly of Glandovan, he is a distant cousin of the Leveson-Gower family, Dukes of Sutherland. Per Gower&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;An Endangered Species&quot;, &quot;there was reckoned to be land in the family in Pembrokeshire two or three generations earlier, which an errant ancestor gambled away in a moment of boredom, and a connection with a place called Castell Malgwyn, now a country house hotel, in Cardigan.&quot;

==Playing career==
Gower enjoyed one of the most prolific first-class cricket careers in English history, in both domestic and international competitions. Gower&#x27;s career run total in test matches of 8,231 is the fifth-highest by an English player, behind only Alec Stewart with 8,463, Graham Gooch with 8,900, Sir Alastair Cook with 12,472 and Joe Root (still active) with 12,777 . He played domestic cricket from 1975 until 1993, largely with Leicestershire until 1989, when he moved to Hampshire. He was a stalwart batsman at both clubs.

===Domestic career===
Gower made his debut for Leicestershire on 30 July 1975, during that season&#x27;s County Championship, against Lancashire at Stanley Park, Blackpool. Winning the toss, Lancashire chose to bat first and amassed 259, thanks largely to a century by David Lloyd, who would later become Gower&#x27;s co-commentator. Gower, batting at number seven, scored 32 before he was dismissed by Ken Shuttleworth, Leicestershire making 321 and taking a first-innings lead. Lloyd made 90 in the second innings as Lancashire declared on 305, with Gower taking one catch to dismiss Jack Simmons for 17. The match, lasting only three days with 100 overs as a maximum limit imposed on both teams for each innings, ended in a draw, with Leicestershire reaching 90 without Gower getting to bat again. Gower continued to make little impression during the rest of the 1975 season, playing in only two more matches and ending the season with 65 runs at 13.00. He enjoyed greater success in his debut List A season, playing in eight matches, scoring 175 runs at 25.00 with two fifties.

Gower was retained for the 1976 season, however, playing in a total of seven first-class matches. He enjoyed greater success, with 323 runs at 35.88 including a maiden century, 102*, and a second fifty. In one-day cricket he played another eight matches, scoring 188 runs at 23.50 with a season–high score of 48. The 1977 season saw Gower play 25 matches, with another career-best of 144*, his only century of the season. He amassed 745 runs at 23.28, with three other half-centuries. In the one-day format he was far more prolific, playing 24 matches and scoring 867 with a best of 135*, one of two hundreds that year, along with four fifties, all at 48.16. After two first-class matches against Sri Lankan domestic teams over the winter of 1977–78, in which he scored 76 runs at 38.00 in first-class and a score of 22 in the only one-day fixture, Gower topped 1,000 runs in a season for the first time in his career, scoring 1098 runs at 37.86 including two hundreds, five fifties and a call-up to the national team.

Gower returned to England in 1978 from an international tour with a career-best 200*, forming part of his 957 runs for the season at 41.60, with eight fifties to go with that one hundred. For his efforts that season, Gower was awarded Wisden Cricketer of the Year. &quot;Wisden&quot; recorded that &quot;The sun scarcely graced the English cricket scene with its presence in 1978, but when it did it seemed to adorn the blond head of David Gower. The young Leicestershire left-hander could do little wrong. He typified a new, precocious breed of stroke-players, imperious and exciting, who added colour and glamour to an otherwise bedraggled English summer.&quot; The 1980 season in England saw Gower again top 1,000 runs, with 1142 at 48.89, including five hundreds and a career-best 156*. This was, thus far, the most prolific first-class season of Gower&#x27;s career. He also played 21 one-day matches, with 616 runs including another century. He followed up the winter international tour with a prolific performance during the 1981 season, which included the 1981 Ashes series. During this season Gower played 19 matches, scoring a career-best 1,418 runs at 48.89, including one knock of 156*. Against Essex at Grace Road he shared an unbroken county record second-wicket stand of 289 with Chris Balderstone.

After another successful international tour, Gower returned to England to breach 1,000 runs again with a career-best 1,530 at 46.36, with two hundreds, and scored five further hundreds for only the second time in 1983, when he again topped 1,000 runs, 1,253 this time at 46.40. He narrowly failed to reach 1,000 runs in the 1984 season, ending with 999 at 35.67, and then scored 1,000 runs, including a then career-best of 215, at 54.70, in 1985. Gower scored one century in England and Australia in the next two seasons, before topping 1,000 runs for three consecutive series, in 1987, 1988 and 1989, with a total of seven centuries including his career-best 228.

In 1989 he moved to Hampshire, and upon returning from the 1989–90 tour of the West Indies, where he scored only four in one match, he scored 1,263 runs for his new club at 46.77, and he scored 1,142, 1,225 and 1,136 in his final three seasons, ending his last, 1993, with four centuries at 42.07. This was despite Gower being, at times, so out-of-form that Brian Mason, a personal counsellor, was asked to work with him on his poor form. His final three seasons had seen poorer returns in one-day cricket, with his last century coming in 1992, and with his final season returning 347 runs at 26.69. In his final first-class match, Gower faced Essex at Chelmsford on 16 September 1993. Batting at number four, he made a farewell century of 134 before he was stumped in the first innings, and with future captain Nasser Hussain and then captain Graham Gooch both making centuries as Essex fell short of Hampshire&#x27;s 347 with their own innings of 268, Gower came out to bat for the final time in Hampshire&#x27;s second innings. He made 25. Gooch, at that time the England captain, having succeeded Gower, came back onto the field for Essex to score his second century of the match.

===International career===

Gower was selected to play for the England Young Cricketers in 1976 against the West Indies equivalent team. Gower played one match, on 27 August, at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Port of Spain. Opening the batting, Gower made only 10 runs in the first innings as England were bowled out for 164; after the West Indies had made 201, he scored 49 in the second innings, stumped off a spin bowler. England were dismissed for 202, and bowled the West Indies out for 143 to take a 22-run victory. He made his debut in Test cricket in 1978 at Edgbaston, scoring a boundary via a pull shot off his first delivery, bowled by Pakistan&#x27;s Liaqat Ali. He went on to make 58 in England&#x27;s only innings, followed by 56 at Lord&#x27;s and 39 at Headingley. On 27 July, Gower played against New Zealand, scoring his maiden Test hundred, 111 off of 253 deliveries in the first innings, and making 11 in the second. He made scores of 46, 71 and 46 in the rest of the series, the latter including his first Test six, earning him selection for the following Ashes Tests in Australia.

Gower made his Ashes début at the Gabba, Brisbane, on 1 December 1978. He made 44 and 48* in the first Test, before making his maiden Ashes hundred, 102 from 221 balls at Perth. These were to be his only significant contributions, however, and he saw out the rest of the series with scores of 29, 49, 7, 34, 9 and 21, until a meticulous 65 in the final Test at Sydney. He then faced four Test matches against India over the summer of 1979, beginning the series with a fast-paced 200* at Edgbaston, followed by an 82 at Lord&#x27;s. Ducks at Leeds and The Oval followed, however, and he struggled against Australia in the winter of 1979 with 17, 23 and three. A battling 98* at Sydney was again followed by another duck and 11 as Gower&#x27;s form deserted him. After 16 against India in February 1980, and 20 and one against the West Indies, his form picked up marginally with scores of 45, 35 and 48 against Australia and the West Indies. One more fifty followed at Bridgetown; however, he eventually broke the run of poor form with a hard-fought 154* from 403 deliveries at Kingston.

Gower&#x27;s timely revival of form ensured his selection for the 1981 Ashes series; however, apart from an 89 at Lord&#x27;s, Gower failed to convert the success he was having in the domestic game to the Test matches, with many scores in the twenties or lower. Two scores in the eighties against India, one against Sri Lanka and two seventies against Pakistan over the winter of 1981/82 kept in him contention for an international place, but centuries were lacking in his game. In August 1982, however, Australia received the England touring team at Perth, where Gower made 72 and 28. He followed this with 18, 34 and 60 at Brisbane and Adelaide before a compact 114 in the second innings of the Adelaide match revived his hundred count. Two more hundreds in the summer of 1983 against New Zealand, and knocks of 152 and 173* against Pakistan in 1984 ensured his place in the side.

Following his 173* in the last Test against Pakistan, Gower suffered another drop in form, managing only three fifties in the next 18 Test innings against the West Indies, Sri Lanka and India. In 1985, however, after low scores at Leeds, Gower enjoyed a &quot;golden season&quot; in the 1985 Ashes. He scored 86 and 22 at Lord&#x27;s against Australia, and 166 at Trent Bridge. Following this, he scored 47 at Old Trafford, and then at Edgbaston on 15 August, scored 215 from 314 balls, his career-best score, and immediately followed this with 157 at The Oval. In addition, he forged two partnerships over 300 runs, with 331 scored with Tim Robinson (148) during Gower&#x27;s own double-century, and 351 with Gooch&#x27;s 196 at The Oval. He ended the series with 732 runs at 81.33, leading England to a 3–1 victory.

Gower struggled in 1986. His mother had died a week before he left to captain the England tour to the West Indies which ended in a 5–0 defeat (Gower&#x27;s second at their hands). Back in England against India, Gower lost the captaincy after two Tests both of which were lost. Retained as a senior player for the New Zealand series and the subsequent Ashes tour, his fortunes began to turn in December with 136 against Australia at Perth.

In 1987 Gower declined to play in that year&#x27;s Cricket World Cup for he did not wish to travel, having been on nine successive winter tours since his debut. He never again declined an opportunity to play for England; yet, in 1989, rumours that Gower lacked serious commitment gained currency when, as England captain, he walked out of a press conference claiming he had tickets for the theatre.

More controversially, during the 1990–91 Ashes Tour in Australia, England were playing a warm up match in Queensland when Gower, together with batsman John Morris, chose to go for a joy-ride in two Tiger Moth biplanes without telling the England team management. Both had been dismissed earlier that day, and they decided not to remain at the ground to &quot;watch Allan Lamb and Robin Smith flat the Queensland attack before a small crowd&quot;. For this Gower was fined £1000, a penalty that could have been steeper had he released the water bombs he had also prepared. He also posed for press photographs with the plane the next day.

Gooch was enraged, as he was by Gower&#x27;s mode of dismissal at a crucial stage of one of the Test matches. During the fourth Test at Adelaide, Gower walked out to the crease to the tune of &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;. The last ball before lunch was bowled down the leg side to a leg trap, and all Gower needed to do was block. However, Gower flicked idly at the delivery and was caught at leg-slip. According to Mike Atherton in his autobiography, &quot;Gooch was at the other end and as he walked off his face was thunderous&quot;. This was another example of the strained relationship between the two. His score of nought in the second innings at Melbourne in 1991, when England were chasing quick runs for victory, ended his world record, unbroken sequence, of 119 Test innings without registering a duck. Gower scored 73 and 31* in the following matches against Pakistan; however, on 9 August 1992 he was dismissed for one by Waqar Younis in what would be his last Test match, at The Oval. It is often thought that Gooch was instrumental in Gower being omitted from the subsequent tour of India. The selection decision prompted a vote of no confidence in the selectors at the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but it was to no avail as Gower was not included. In response to Gooch&#x27;s perceived regime of hard work over talent, Gower retired from international cricket in early 1993.

===Playing style===

Gower, a left-handed batsmen, played with a dominant top hand and a &quot;most graceful&quot; style of batting though he had a reputation for being aloof. His languid style was often misinterpreted as indifference and a lack of seriousness, an air he bolstered with a variety of &quot;misdemeanours&quot; from apparently &quot;lazy&quot; shots, to practical jokes, even to his preference for blue (not white) socks. &quot;Wisden&quot; described him as &quot;fluffy-haired, ethereal-looking&quot; who played &quot;beautifully, until the moment he made a mistake. Sometimes, the mistake was put off long enough for him to play an innings of unforgettable brilliance.&quot;

Gower was repeatedly lambasted by the media as being &quot;laid back&quot; or &quot;nonchalant&quot; with a &quot;devil-may-care&quot; approach some found infuriating, as &quot;Wisden&quot; records, &quot;the difference between an exquisite stroke and a nick was little more than an inch&quot; in his style of batting. Peter Roebuck recorded that &quot;Gower never moves, he drifts&quot;, while Frances Edmonds in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; spoke of Gower in 1985: &quot;Difficult to be more laid back without being actually comatose.&quot; Gower himself commented in 1995 in an interview in &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I was never destined to be on the ball 100 per cent of the time. I don&#x27;t have the same ability that Graham Gooch has, to produce something very close to his best every time he plays. There were Test matches where I suddenly felt, at the end of it, &#x27;Well, I wish I&#x27;d really been at that one.&#x27;&quot;

Gower was also a right-arm off break spin bowler despite batting left-handed, who took one Test wicket at 20.00 out of the six overs he sent down on the rare occasions when he was called upon to bowl. His domestic cricket added another three wickets to give him an overall average of 56.75; however, Martin Williamson, the managing editor of ESPNcricinfo, records Gower and James Whitaker as &quot;probably two of the worst bowlers in the country&quot; in 1983. On one occasion, during Steve O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s 35-minute century for Lancashire, Gower conceded 102 for 0 from nine overs. In the 1986 Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge, Gower became the only England bowler to be called for throwing in a Test in England. Handed the ball by captain Mike Gatting with New Zealand requiring only one run to win, Gower deliberately threw his first ball to Martin Crowe. Technically the game ended with the no-ball call, but Crowe hit a four off the ball which was permitted to stand, leaving Gower with the unusual match bowling figures of 0-0-4-0 (1nb).

In the field, Gower is noted by biographer Kersi Meher-Homji as being a &quot;magnificent outfielder who took amazing catches and threw with accuracy and power to run out the blasé batsman.&quot; Ambidextrous in the field and when bowling, Gower also plays both golf and hockey, writes and kicks right-handed. However, he was far less effective as a fielder late in his career, especially in one-day matches, since a chronic shoulder injury – usually described as the shoulder being &quot;thrown out&quot; – meant that he usually bowled the ball in when fielding, rather than throwing it in, significantly reducing the speed of the return and allowing batsmen easy runs.

==Commentating==
After leaving the game, Gower enjoyed a new career as a cricket broadcaster and television personality, including being one of the team captains on the popular BBC comedy sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; from 1995 to 2003. He also presented four series of the BBC2 cricket magazine show, &quot;Gower&#x27;s Cricket Monthly&quot;, from 1995 to 1998, and, at the same time was one of the BBC&#x27;s main cricket commentators. Gower also spent time commentating on several cricket series in Australia in the 1990s. His commentary for Channel Nine, with his trademark relaxed calls of play and generous attitude to the players and fellow commentators, proved extremely popular with Australian cricket viewing audiences.

Gower was the main presenter of international cricket coverage for Sky Sports and a regular commentator for many years until 2019 when Sky decided not to renew his contract. Matthew Engel of ESPNcricinfo wrote that Gower&#x27;s commentating career has been &quot;so successful that his cricket seemed mere preparation&quot;. Gower returned to commentary for BT Sport in the 2021–22 Ashes series. Alan Tyers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that it had been &quot;excellent having Lord Gower back on the cricket commentary: assured, amusing, urbane. And always a steelier character than his insouciance suggested [...] perhaps he might even be enjoying reminding his former employers at Sky that he is still a quality broadcaster.&quot;

==Later life and interests==
Gower is interested in conservation. In 1989, he joined Gerald Durrell and his wife Lee, along with David Attenborough, in helping to launch the World Land Trust (then the World Wide Land Conservation Trust). The initial goal of the trust was to purchase rainforest land in Belize as part of the Programme for Belize. Gower is also a Patron of the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation, and he is vice-president of the Nature in Art Trust. In 1992, he was named an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). In 1994, he received an Honorary Master of Arts award from Loughborough University.

Gower is also a director of an Internet wine company. Gower and his wife, Thorunn, are Patrons of Southampton-based charity Leukaemia Busters. He was also awarded the &quot;Oldie of the Year&quot; award in 1993 by &quot;The Oldie&quot; magazine. He is the author of a number of written works on cricket, including &quot;Gower: The Autobiography&quot; with &quot;The Independent&quot; journalist Martin Johnson in 1992, &quot;David Gower: With Time to Spare&quot; with Alan Lee in 1995 and &quot;Can&#x27;t Bat, Can&#x27;t Bowl, Can&#x27;t Field&quot; also with Johnson. In 2009, Gower was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

In August 2014, Gower was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<text>The Human League are an English synth-pop band formed in Sheffield in 1977. Initially an experimental electronic outfit, the group signed to Virgin Records in 1979 and later attained widespread commercial success with their third album &quot;Dare&quot; in 1981 after restructuring their lineup. The album contained four hit singles, including the UK/US number one hit &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;. The band received the Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 1982. Further hits followed throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, including &quot;Mirror Man&quot;, &quot;(Keep Feeling) Fascination&quot;, &quot;The Lebanon&quot;, &quot;Human&quot; (a second US No. 1) and &quot;Tell Me When&quot;.

The only constant band member since 1977 has been lead singer and songwriter Philip Oakey. Keyboard players Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh both left the band in 1980 to form Heaven 17, leaving Oakey and Adrian Wright to assemble a new line-up. The Human League then evolved into a commercially successful new pop band, with the line-up comprising Oakey, Wright, vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley, bassist and keyboard player Ian Burden and guitarist and keyboard player Jo Callis. Wright, Burden and Callis all left the band by the end of the 1980s, since which time the band has essentially been a trio of Oakey, Catherall and Sulley with various sidemen.

Since 1978, the Human League have released 9 studio albums, a remix album, a live album, 6 EPs, 29 singles and 13 compilation albums. They have had 6 top 20 albums and 13 top 20 singles in the UK and had sold more than 20 million records worldwide by 2010. As an early techno-pop act that received extensive MTV airplay, they are regarded as one of the leading artists of the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US.

==History==
===1970s: Early years===
Before adopting the name the Human League, the band briefly had two previous incarnations. In early 1977, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, who had met at youth arts project &quot;Meatwhistle&quot;, were both working as computer operators. Their musical collaboration combined pop music (such as glam rock and Tamla Motown) with avant-garde electronic music. With the price of electronic components dropping in the mid-1970s, equipment became more affordable for the average consumer; Ware and Marsh purchased a Korg 700S synthesizer together and learned how to play it. Their musical reputation spread, and they were invited to play at a friend&#x27;s 21st birthday party. For the party, Ware and Marsh formed themselves into an informal band called The Dead Daughters. Their live highlight was a rendition of the theme of the British TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

After a few more low-key, private performances, Ware and Marsh decided to officially form a band. Joined by their friend Adi Newton and another synthesizer (a Roland System-100), they formed The Future and began to create music in their own rehearsal facility in a disused cutlery workshop in the centre of Sheffield. Although The Future was never signed and did not release material commercially at the time, a collection of demos from this period was released retrospectively on CD in 2002 titled &quot;The Golden Hour of the Future&quot;, mixed by Richard X. The association with Adi Newton was short; Newton left The Future and went on to form Clock DVA. Ware at this point decided that he needed a singer rather than another keyboard player. The reason for this was twofold: record companies had been reluctant to sign The Future, as they could not offer any &quot;marketable&quot; songs, and therefore a talented singer was required for any chance of commercial success; also the group only owned two synthesizers and could not afford a third.

Ware and Marsh searched for a vocalist, but their first choice, Glenn Gregory, was unavailable (Gregory eventually became the lead singer of their subsequent band Heaven 17). Ware then decided to invite an old school friend, Philip Oakey, to join the band. Oakey was working as a hospital porter at the time and was known on the Sheffield social scene for his eclectic style of dress. Although he had no musical experience, Ware thought he would be ideal as lead singer for The Future as &quot;he already looked like a pop star&quot;. When Ware called on Oakey, he found he was out, so asked him to join the Future by leaving a note stuck to his front door. He accepted the invitation, but early sessions were awkward. Oakey had never sung in front of an audience before, could not play keyboards and only owned a saxophone (which he could barely play). Listening to one of Ware and Marsh&#x27;s demos, Oakey was inspired to write some lyrics which later became the single &quot;Being Boiled&quot;.

With a new line-up, sound, and vocalist, Ware decided that the band needed a new name. It would also allow them to approach record companies again from a different angle. Ware suggested &quot;The Human League&quot;, after a group in the science-fiction board game &quot;&quot;. In the game, the Human League arose in 2415 A.D. and were a frontier-oriented society that desired more independence from Earth. Oakey and Marsh agreed on the new name, and in early 1978 The Future became The Human League.
Using &quot;Future&quot; material, the Human League released a demo tape to record companies under their new name. The tape contained versions of &quot;Being Boiled&quot;, &quot;Toyota City&quot; and &quot;Circus of Death&quot;. Ware&#x27;s friend Paul Bower of Sheffield new-wave band &quot;2.3&quot;, who had just recorded a single for Bob Last&#x27;s Edinburgh-based independent label Fast Product, took their demo to Last and he signed the band.

The band released their first single, &quot;Being Boiled&quot;, in June 1978, which became Fast Product&#x27;s third release. Although a limited release—because it was unique and at odds with everything else on the market—it was picked up on by &quot;NME&quot;, who championed the band, although one guest reviewer, John Lydon of Public Image Limited, condemned the band as &quot;trendy hippies&quot;.

Boosted by critical praise, on 12 June 1978 the band played their first live gig together at Bar 2 in Sheffield&#x27;s Psalter Lane Art College (latterly Sheffield Hallam University); a plaque commemorated the event until the Psalter Lane site officially closed on 31 August 2008.

With their reliance on technology and tape machines, the band had been nervous about playing live. After the Psalter Lane performance, they worried that they had appeared static and uninspiring. A friend of Oakey&#x27;s who had been in the audience, Philip Adrian Wright, who also had an art and photography background, was invited to become the band&#x27;s Director of Visuals, with a remit to &quot;liven up&quot; the stage performance with slides, film clips and lighting.

In August 1978 the band recorded a session for John Peel, including a re-worked version of &quot;Being Boiled&quot;.

The band&#x27;s live performances began to gain momentum and acclaim, and they were asked to support first The Rezillos (featuring future band member Jo Callis), then Siouxsie and the Banshees, as early as September 1978. In December 1978, David Bowie appeared in the audience and later declared to &quot;NME&quot; that he &quot;had seen the future of pop music&quot;.

In April 1979, the Human League released their first EP on the Fast Product label entitled &quot;The Dignity of Labour&quot;, which contained four experimental instrumentals. Although the EP barely charted, major record labels began approaching the band in an attempt to lure them away from Fast. In May 1979, the band accepted an offer by Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Records. Because of his label&#x27;s early support, the band offered Bob Last the position as band manager.

In June 1979, the Human League supported Iggy Pop on his European tour, before settling into recording their first single for Virgin. Despite promising them creative freedom, Virgin demanded sweeping changes to the band&#x27;s style for their first single, in order to make it more commercial. The label required the band to use conventional instruments and vocals as well as synthesizers. Because the League had accepted a large financial signing advance, Ware was in no position to refuse but insisted that any releases in this style be credited to a pseudonym.

The band&#x27;s first single under Virgin Records was the disco influenced &quot;I Don&#x27;t Depend on You&quot;, released in July 1979 under the pseudonym &quot;The Men&quot;. The single did not chart and had very little in common with the previous work of the Human League. It did, however, feature female vocals by guests Lisa (Liza) Strike and Katie Kissoon, sounding like the yet-to-be-formed future Human League of 1981.

Because the imposed style had not worked, Virgin permitted the band to return to their original style and the band recorded and released their first full studio album &quot;Reproduction&quot; in August 1979. The album and the single &quot;Empire State Human&quot; failed to make an impact on the charts. After these flops, Virgin cancelled the band&#x27;s December 1979 tour. By this time, the Human League&#x27;s role as UK electronic pioneers was usurped by Gary Numan, when his single &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; became a huge hit in the UK in mid-1979.

In March 1980, the band—which had not yet hit the singles charts—was namechecked in a UK hit song by The Undertones. The track &quot;My Perfect Cousin&quot;, which would peak at #9 on the UK charts in May, contained a dig at the perceived &quot;arty&quot; Human League in the lyric:

In April 1980, the band was able to release an EP entitled &quot;Holiday &#x27;80&quot;, containing the principal track &quot;Marianne&quot; and a cover of &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; (written by Bowie and Iggy Pop). The seven-inch version of &quot;Holiday &#x27;80&quot; did well enough to get the band their first TV appearance on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 8 May 1980 opening a Peter Powell presented show with Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot;. This was to be the only high-profile TV appearance by the Oakey/Marsh/Ware trio on British television, with the sole exception of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Mainstream&quot; programme in late 1979, organised and presented by the artist Brian Clarke, an early supporter of the band. A performance in the studio, complete with slideshow, was broadcast of the tracks &quot;The Path of Least Resistance&quot; and the current minor hit &quot;Empire State Human&quot;.

In May 1980, the band toured the UK. Philip Adrian Wright was now playing incidental keyboards in addition to his visuals role. The Human League featured a cover version of Judas Priest&#x27;s heavy metal anthem &quot;Take on the World&quot; on their 1980 tour. It was the last time all four members performed together live. Also in May, the band released their second studio album &quot;Travelogue&quot;. More commercial-sounding than &quot;Reproduction&quot;, it peaked at No. 16 in the UK, giving the band their first real success. As a result, &quot;Empire State Human&quot; was re-released and the band made their second appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, even though it only reached No. 62 in the singles chart.

Because of their lack of commercial success, Virgin refused to release further singles from &quot;Travelogue&quot;. The Human League was booked to conduct a tour of the UK and Europe from October to November 1980, but the lack of success after two years of hard work and perceived lack of faith by Virgin set about severe internal conflict within the band.

Equipment used in this period were: Roland Jupiter 4, Korg 770, Roland System 100 consisting of 1 × 101 keyboard, 2 × 102 expanders, 2 × 104 sequencers and 103 mixer, plus taped backing for rhythm and drum parts.

===1980s: Lineup changes and rise in popularity===
 The relationship between Oakey and Ware had always been turbulent, and the pair often quarrelled over creative and personal matters. Their lack of success compared with the success of Gary Numan at that time had brought matters to a head. Ware insisted the band maintain their pure electronic sound, while Oakey wanted to emulate the more conventional sound of more successful pop groups. The two clashed continually and Ware eventually walked out in 1980. Taking Ware&#x27;s side, Marsh joined him in quitting the band.

Manager Bob Last tried to reconcile both parties, and when that proved impossible, various options were suggested, including two new bands under a Human League sub-label. Eventually, it was agreed that Oakey would continue with the Human League name, while Ware and Marsh would form a completely new band, which became Heaven 17. Two weeks before the UK/Europe tour, the band split.

Retaining the Human League name came at a heavy price for Oakey. As the band&#x27;s sole remaining member, he was responsible for all Human League debts and commitments. Furthermore, the terms of the Virgin contract required him to pay Ware and Marsh one per cent of royalties of the next Human League album. The split also jeopardized the band&#x27;s upcoming tour. With the first performance only ten days away and the music media reporting that the Human League was finished now that &quot;the talented people had left&quot;, promoters started threatening to sue Oakey if the concerts were not completed as contracted.

To save the tour, Oakey had to recruit new people in a matter of days. He initially intended to hire a single female backing vocalist to replace Ware, who provided high-pitched backing vocals. In a frequently repeated anecdote, Oakey and his then girlfriend went into Sheffield city centre one Wednesday night and visited various venues with the hope of finding a female singer to join the band. They eventually came to the Crazy Daisy Nightclub on High Street, where Oakey spotted two girls dancing together on the dance floor, Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall. They were both 17-year-old students on a night out and neither had any experience singing or dancing professionally. With no preamble, Oakey asked both girls to join the tour as dancers and incidental vocalists.

Oakey has stated that upon discovering the girls were only teenagers and also best friends, he invited them both so they could look after each other on the tour for safety. He has also said that he thought having two women as vocalists and dancers would also add glamour to the band. Because of the girls&#x27; ages, Oakey and Wright later had to visit Sulley and Catherall&#x27;s respective parents to obtain permission for the girls to go on the tour. Their parents let them join the band under the provision that Oakey would keep them safe. Sulley also reported that both her father and Catherall&#x27;s went to the girls&#x27; school and convinced them that the experience of touring could be educational because of the travelling involved.

In addition to Sulley and Catherall, Oakey employed professional musician Ian Burden from Sheffield synth band Graph as a session keyboard player for the tour to cover for the keyboards of the now departed Ware and Marsh.

The tour was completed as advertised with the first date at Doncaster Top Rank. However, the music press was scornful of &quot;Oakey and his dancing girls&quot; and treated the new band line-up with derision. On completion of the tour, Burden went on to his next commitment playing bass guitar in West Berlin. Because of the professionalism they had shown and because he planned to use them further vocally, Oakey and manager Bob Last made Sulley and Catherall full members of the band, to be paid on a salary basis.

In January 1981, although they had survived the tour, the band was still in trouble. Heavily in debt to Virgin Records, Oakey and Wright were under pressure to produce results quickly. By February 1981 the band recorded and rushed out &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;. Sulley and Catherall (who had returned to their sixth-form full-time) were not involved in the recording but were included on the single&#x27;s front cover. The single reached No. 47 in the UK charts, the band&#x27;s highest chart position to that point. Oakey acknowledged that he needed to bring in professional musicians, and so Ian Burden was tracked down and invited to join the band as a trial member.

Virgin&#x27;s faith had been restored by &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, but they believed the band lacked professional production. In March, Oakey was introduced to veteran producer Martin Rushent. Rushent&#x27;s first move was to dispatch the entire band to his Genetic Studios in Reading, Berkshire, away from the &quot;unhealthy atmosphere&quot; of Monumental Studios, Sheffield, that they shared with Ware and Marsh&#x27;s Heaven 17. The first result of the Genetic sessions was the single &quot;The Sound of the Crowd&quot;. The single became their first Top 40 hit, reaching No. 12 in the UK.

Bob Last believed that the band could be improved further by the addition of one more professional musician, so in April 1981, his associate Jo Callis (formerly of The Rezillos whom Last had previously managed) was invited to become the final permanent member of the band. The next single, &quot;Love Action (I Believe in Love)&quot;, reached No. 3 in the UK in August 1981. The band set about arranging their existing material and demos into a viable album, produced by Rushent. Sulley and Catherall, who had just left school, immediately postponed their plans to attend university to work on the album.

By this time, the band&#x27;s commercial success and higher profile had caused their first two albums to start selling again. &quot;Reproduction&quot; charted for the first time in August 1981, eventually peaking at No. 34, and &quot;Travelogue&quot; also recharted and returned to the Top 30 for several weeks. Both albums would eventually achieve Gold status. In October 1981, Virgin released a brand new single, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, which gave the band another Top 10 hit. The band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Dare&quot;, was also released in October 1981 and reached No. 1 in the UK. It spent a total of four weeks at the top spot over the 1981/82 period, remaining in the chart for 77 weeks and eventually going triple platinum.

Because of &quot;Dare&quot; success, Virgin executive Simon Draper instructed that a fourth single be released from the album before the end of 1981. His choice was to be &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, a track Oakey considered to be a filler and the weakest track on the album. Oakey fought the decision, believing it would damage the band, but was overruled by Draper, and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; was released in November 1981. Aided by an expensive music video (a rarity at the time) directed by film maker Steve Barron, the single went to No. 1 for five weeks over the 1981 Christmas period. In a 1995 interview with music journalist James Richliano, Oakey credited MTV for helping the song reach the top of the charts: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we would have had a number one if it weren&#x27;t for the video and MTV. Trying to interpret songs with video is a real problem, but at the same time, we know that we wouldn&#x27;t be here without video.&quot;

&quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, selling almost 1.5 million copies in the UK. &quot;Dare&quot; has since been labelled as one of pop music&#x27;s most influential albums. In a retrospective review of the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, gave &quot;Dare&quot; a five-star rating. He wrote: &quot;The technology may have dated, synths and drum machines may have become more advanced, but few have manipulated technology in such an emotionally effective way.&quot; Philip Oakey often plays down claims of &quot;Dare&quot; being such an influential album, but at other times acknowledges its influence on modern music.

Although the group has been retrospectively identified with the New Romantic movement of this period, according to Dave Rimmer, author of &quot;New Romantics: The Look&quot;, &quot;at the time [they] were no such thing.&quot; The band themselves have also consistently and strenuously rejected the label. The Sheffield scene in which the Human League formed predated New Romanticism and took more influence from Kraftwerk. Bands in the Sheffield scene were also referred to as Futurists, although Oakey himself has said: &quot;We thought we were the punkiest band in Sheffield.&quot;

Capitalising on the success of the album and their recent No. 1 hit single, &quot;Being Boiled&quot; was re-released and became a Top 10 hit in early 1982. The band toured for the first time together internationally. Concurrently, &quot;Dare&quot; (later renamed &quot;Dare!&quot;) was released in the US by A&amp;M Records and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; also reached No. 1 there in the summer of 1982. A remix album of &quot;Dare&quot; entitled &quot;Love and Dancing&quot; was released under the group name &quot;The League Unlimited Orchestra&quot; (a tribute to Barry White&#x27;s Love Unlimited Orchestra), reaching No. 3 on the UK album chart.

In 1982, the band received the Best British Newcomer award at the annual Brit Music awards, and Rushent also took Best Producer for his work on &quot;Dare&quot;.

In November 1982, the Motown influenced electropop single &quot;Mirror Man&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK chart, just missing another Christmas No. 1, which was taken by &quot;Save Your Love&quot; by Renée and Renato.

The Human League&#x27;s work was now recognised on both sides of the Atlantic. In February 1983, the band was nominated for the &quot;Best New Artist&quot; award at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards (though the award eventually went to Men at Work).

The follow-up single, &quot;(Keep Feeling) Fascination&quot;, was released in April 1983, and peaked at No. 2 in the UK and Number 8 on the Billboard Charts in the USA. The following months proved to be difficult ones for the band as they struggled to record a follow-up album to &quot;Dare&quot; under immense pressure from Virgin. A six-song EP called &quot;Fascination!&quot; composed of the singles &quot;Mirror Man&quot; and &quot;Fascination&quot; together with the new track &quot;I Love You Too Much&quot; was released from the original recording sessions for their new album, later to be named &quot;Hysteria&quot;. The EP was released in America as a stop-gap and also became a strong seller as an import in the UK.

In August 1983, the band released &quot;the UK&#x27;s first videotape single&quot; to capitalise on the growing market created by the increasing popularity of domestic home video cassette recorders (VCRs), called &quot;The Human League Video Single&quot;. Although &quot;video albums&quot; had been released by bands such as Blondie and ELO as early as 1979, this release was a short (12 mins) video tape cassette in either VHS or Betamax format containing just three tracks (the music videos for &quot;Mirror Man&quot;, &quot;Love Action (I Believe in Love)&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;). Although it was not a commercial success (as it retailed for £10.99, compared to 12&quot; vinyl singles averaging £1.99 in 1983), the format caught on and other artists began releasing video singles/EPs of their own.

The band spent many months agonising as they tried to make a successor to &quot;Dare&quot;, and as things became ever more stressful, producer Martin Rushent left the project. At this point, the band ditched much of the material recorded so far and started over again with new producers Hugh Padgham and Chris Thomas (though some of Rushent&#x27;s contributions to certain tracks from the earlier sessions were included on the released album).

Finally in May 1984, the band released the single &quot;The Lebanon&quot; about the Lebanese Civil War. The single peaked at No. 11 in the UK. This was followed shortly thereafter by the album &quot;Hysteria&quot;, so called because of the difficult and tense recording process. It entered the UK album chart at No. 3; however, it climbed no further and critics and fans were divided by the new direction the band had taken. The second single was &quot;Life on Your Own&quot; in mid-1984. The single peaked at No. 16.

Later that year, success outside of the Human League came for Oakey in the shape of the huge hit single &quot;Together in Electric Dreams&quot;, a collaboration with one of his idols, synth pioneer Giorgio Moroder. The track was taken from the film soundtrack to &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; and became a massive hit. Often now erroneously credited as a Human League single, due to its success and enduring popularity, the band have since adopted it for their live performances and it appears on their greatest hits compilations. Oakey and Moroder then recorded an album together for Virgin, &quot;Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder&quot;, but this met with rather less success and the following two singles failed to make the UK Top 40. However, the success of the original Oakey and Moroder track encouraged Virgin to release one final single from &quot;Hysteria&quot; in November 1984; the ballad &quot;Louise&quot; was released and reached No. 13 in the UK.

After &quot;Hysteria&quot;, the group found themselves in creative stagnation, struggling to record material to follow up on their previous successes. Key songwriter Jo Callis departed, replaced by drummer Jim Russell. Bob Last quit as manager and was not replaced. In 1985, the band spent several months working on a new album with producer Colin Thurston (who had produced &quot;I Don&#x27;t Depend on You&quot;, &quot;Reproduction&quot;, and the first two Duran Duran albums), but yet more clashes in the recording studio ensued and the project was shelved in September 1985.

Worried by the lack of progress with their most profitable act, Virgin paired the Human League up with American R&amp;B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who had a proven track record with Janet Jackson, the SOS Band, Alexander O&#x27;Neal, and Cherelle. Jam and Lewis had expressed an interest in working with the band after hearing their US releases. Virgin flew the entire band to Minneapolis. The four-month-long recording sessions were beset with creative disputes, with Jam and Lewis having preconceived ideas on how they wanted the album to sound, rejecting most of the band&#x27;s material (which would cost the band considerable loss of royalty income).

The final result of the sessions was the &quot;Crash&quot; album. The album featured much material written by the Jam and Lewis team, and showcased their Yamaha DX7-led sound. It had a US No. 1 single, &quot;Human&quot; (No. 8 in the UK), but other singles performed relatively poorly. The album, while making the Top 10 in the UK, was not as popular as previous releases. Disheartened by being sidelined in Minneapolis and with the direction the band had taken, Adrian Wright left the band to work in film. &quot;Crash&quot; was generally more popular in the US and internationally than in the UK. The band toured in the UK and internationally in 1986 and 1987 to capitalise on their high-profile at this time.

In 1987, Ian Burden also left the band. In November 1988, a greatest hits compilation album was released that reached No. 3 in UK. This was preceded by the release of the single &quot;Love Is All That Matters&quot; from &quot;Crash&quot;.

In 1989, the band built their own studio in Sheffield, jointly funded by Oakey and a business development loan from Sheffield City Council.

===1990s: Further recordings===
In 1990, the band released their last album for Virgin Records, &quot;Romantic?&quot;. By now, longstanding members Adrian Wright and Ian Burden, together with newer recruit Jim Russell, had all left the band, although Jo Callis did return to play on some of the sessions and co-wrote two songs, including the minor hit single &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;. New to the line-up were keyboardist Neil Sutton, who had worked with the band on the Crash tour of 1986, and guitarist/keyboardist Russell Dennett. At odds with the prevailing trend of US grunge and the Manchester scene, the &quot;Romantic?&quot; album did not re-capture the group&#x27;s huge commercial success of the 1980s, with its second single &quot;Soundtrack to a Generation&quot; barely charting.

In 1992, Virgin abruptly cancelled their recording contract. Damaged by the failure of the album, their rejection by Virgin, harsh criticism in the media and facing financial ruin, the emotional well-being of Oakey and Sulley deteriorated badly.

After a couple of years, the band had recovered enough confidence to put out demos to other record labels. Concurrently in 1993, they were invited to work with veteran Japanese electropop band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), which resulted in the EP &quot;YMO Versus The Human League&quot;. Released principally in Japan and Asia in April 1993, the EP includes cover versions of the YMO songs &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; and &quot;Kimi Ni Mune Kyun&quot; (&quot;I Love You&quot;), featuring the vocals of Sulley and Catherall.

In 1994, EastWest Records (a subsidiary of Time Warner) showed interest in the band&#x27;s demos and the material rejected by Virgin. They signed the band and paired them with producer Ian Stanley (formerly of Tears for Fears). EastWest financed expensive music videos and heavily promoted their releases. The first release was on Boxing Day 1994 and was the single &quot;Tell Me When&quot;, which gave the band their first Top 10 hit since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Human&quot;. It also topped the UK airplay charts for several weeks. The accompanying album, &quot;Octopus&quot;, returned the band to the UK Top 10 and later achieved a gold disc.

On the album cover artwork and in videos, the group was now presented simply as a trio of Oakey/Catherall/Sulley. In reality, however, other musicians had input to the record, including producer Ian Stanley, with continued playing and songwriting contributions from Neil Sutton and Russell Dennett; and Oakey co-writing one track with Jo Callis.

The next single from the album was the ballad &quot;One Man in My Heart&quot;, which features Sulley on lead vocals. It reached No. 13 in the UK and was unique in that it was the only single by the Human League to feature a female only lead vocal until &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; in 2011.

Their renewed success prompted the band to tour again for the first time since 1987, and they conducted a tour of the US and UK in 1995. Subsequent singles &quot;Filling Up with Heaven&quot; and the non-album single &quot;Stay with Me Tonight&quot; also reached the UK Top 40, and a new remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; was released to capitalise on the band&#x27;s revitalised profile. This was in the run up to a new &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation in 1996, but which proved less successful than their first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album from 1988.

A change in management at EastWest in 1998 saw the cancellation of the band&#x27;s contract once again. Afterward, the band co-headlined with Culture Club and Howard Jones on VH1&#x27;s 1980s &quot;Big Rewind&quot; nostalgia tour and made other concert and public appearances throughout 1997–2000.

===2000s: &quot;Secrets&quot; and touring===

In May 2000, the band signed to Papillon Records, a subsidiary of the Chrysalis Group, and began recording tracks for their new album due out the following year. The next album, titled &quot;Secrets&quot;, was released August 2001, and, like the previous album &quot;Octopus&quot;, the band was presented as the Oakey, Sulley and Catherall trio, although Neil Sutton was credited with keyboards and co-wrote most of the material with Oakey. The album received generally favourable reviews from critics. Commercially, the album flopped, entering the UK album chart at No. 44, falling off the chart the following week. This was not helped by the band&#x27;s record label, Papillon, which developed financial problems. It was closed by the parent company shortly after the album&#x27;s release, leading to poor promotion and sales. BBC Radio 1 also refused to playlist the single &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; because, now in their 40s, the band did not match the radio station&#x27;s demographic target audience.

Susan Sulley said that the rejection of &quot;Secrets&quot; was &quot;the lowest the band had been since 1992 and, after putting in so much time and effort in to an album that then failed, nearly causing them to call it a day.&quot;

To accompany the then-stalled album, the band conducted the 2001 &#x27;Secrets Tour&#x27;. Along with Sulley and Catherall, the band had Neil Sutton on keyboards. Long-time studio engineer David Beevers had become part of the on-stage line-up, controlling the sequencers from behind his deck of twin Apple Macs. Oakey further recruited multi-instrumentalist Nic Burke, then aged 21, who he had seen playing in Sheffield, to play electric guitar and keytar. To round off the line-up in 2002, percussionist Errol Rollins was added to play the electronic drum kit. Rollins was replaced by Rob Barton in 2004.

As a point of honour, the band refuses to use playback; they always play live and rehearse before every appearance, ensuring that no two performances are the same. This was clearly demonstrated in 2002, when the band was booked to appear on UK national TV channel GMTV, where they were to play &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; before being interviewed. The producer was astounded when the band arrived at 5 am (three hours early), expecting to set up and rehearse; it had been assumed they would just mime to playback. Joanne Catherall explained why on air during the interview: &quot;We simply don&#x27;t sound like we did 20 years ago; it would be wrong if we used tapes, so we do everything live.&quot;

In 2003, a second single from &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;Love Me Madly?&quot;, was released independently as a private venture by Nukove, a small independent label especially set up to release Human League material, but it did not have funds for promotion and the single did not chart. Also in 2003, Virgin records released &quot;The Very Best of The Human League&quot;, a DVD of most of their previously recorded music videos. The DVD sold well in the UK and US and was accompanied by a compilation album of the same name.

Throughout the following years, the band has continued to tour frequently, enjoying success and popularity as a live act. In 2004, they released The Human League &quot;Live at the Dome&quot;, a DVD of a live show filmed at the Brighton Dome, complete with a compilation CD called &quot;Live at the Dome&quot;.

At the end of 2005, together with EMI, the band released a compilation album of remixes. Called &quot;The Human League Original Remixes and Rarities&quot;, it was aimed at the DJ/Dance market in the US and UK.

As well as dedicated Human League tours, the band has appeared at many independent concerts and festivals worldwide. They have played at the V Festival in 2004 and 2009, Homelands in 2005, Nokia Trends in Brazil 2005, and Festival Internacional de Benicàssim in 2007.

On 22 September 2006, the band performed on the US network television show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The band&#x27;s highlight of 2006 was a performance to an audience of 18,000 at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles, on 24 October 2006, one of their largest concerts to date. This was followed up by an 11-venue tour of Europe in November and December 2006.

The band has been the subject of, and appeared in, various TV documentaries and features, including Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Made in Sheffield&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Young Guns: The Bands of the Early 1980s&quot;. In June 2007, Sulley and Catherall presented a documentary on Sheffield&#x27;s pop music history entitled &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Music Cities&quot; for VH1.

In November and December 2007, to mark their 30th anniversary (1977–2007), the band conducted their highest profile tour since the Secrets tour of 2001. The &#x27;Dare! 2007&#x27; tour encompassed 20 European venues from London to Stockholm, most of which were sold out. Their set list included (for the first time ever) a performance of &quot;Dare&quot;, played sequentially and in its entirety. This included Philip Oakey playing the Human League&#x27;s instrumental arrangement of the theme from &quot;Get Carter&quot; on an original Casio VL-Tone from 1981. The remainder of the concert was dedicated to songs from the band&#x27;s other albums and also included the Oakey/Moroder song &quot;Together in Electric Dreams&quot;. The band invested heavily in the stage set and lighting for the tour, including elaborate high definition video backgrounds provided by set designer Rob Sinclair.

A 12&quot; single remix of &quot;Things That Dreams Are Made Of&quot; (originally from the &quot;Dare!&quot; album) was released in the UK in January 2008, by Hooj Choons. It peaked at No. 2 on the UK Dance chart.

In August and September 2008, the band headlined the US Regeneration Tour, supported by ABC, A Flock of Seagulls, Naked Eyes, and, at some venues, Belinda Carlisle.

In November and December 2008, the Human League got together with Martin Fry&#x27;s ABC and Heaven 17 for &#x27;The Steel City Tour&#x27; of the UK. This was Philip Oakey&#x27;s concept of a joint tour of all three bands celebrating the original electronic music of early 1980s Sheffield (the titular Steel City). Much had been made in the UK media of the history between Heaven 17 and the Human League, the original events of 1980 and the fact they were now working together. Both Oakey and Martyn Ware said that any acrimony from that period had long since been forgotten.

The Human League were one of the headline acts in the line-up at Spillers Wharf on 30 May 2009, in the Newcastle/Gateshead Evolution festival, and were one of the headline bands for Dubai&#x27;s first music festival, the &#x27;Dubai Sound City&#x27; festival, between 5 and 7 November 2009.

On 11 December 2009, the Human League signed a new recording contract with UK based Wall of Sound. They also have their own studio in Sheffield and are managed by Sidewinder Management Ltd. The band continue to record and play live, with regular appearances at music festivals worldwide, at many of which they are among the headliners.

Although the subject of retirement is often brought up in interviews, Oakey, Sulley and Catherall have all stated that they still enjoy performing and intend to carry on for &quot;as long as they are filling concerts and people want to see them&quot;. Sulley has joked that she &quot;has to carry on because she doesn&#x27;t know how to do anything else&quot;.

===2010s: &quot;Credo&quot; and further tours===
A new album, &quot;Credo&quot;, was released in March 2011. It peaked at No. 44 on the UK Albums Chart.

The first single from the album, &quot;Night People&quot; was released on 22 November 2010 but failed to enter the mainstream UK chart. It did, however, reach No. 25 in the UK Indie chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, was released in the UK on 1 March 2011; however, in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, &quot;Egomaniac&quot; was chosen as the second single. A double vinyl edition of &quot;Credo&quot; was released on 25 July 2011, together with the download of &quot;Sky&quot;, the third single from the album.

At the end of 2012, the band undertook the &#x27;XXXV Tour&#x27; across Europe and the UK to celebrate 35 years in existence. The shows were critically acclaimed. The UK&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said &quot;as good a night&#x27;s entertainment as you are likely to find anywhere on the planet&quot;.

In March 2014, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; re-entered the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, thanks to a social media campaign from the fans of Aberdeen F.C., who won the Scottish League Cup the previous weekend. They have adopted the song as a terrace chant, citing their midfielder Peter Pawlett with the lyrics changed to &quot;Peter Pawlett Baby&quot;.

In 2016, the band performed their &#x27;A Very British Synthesizer Group&#x27; European and UK tour to accompany the release of the multi-disc anthology of the same name. In winter 2018, they undertook an extensive &#x27;Red Tour&#x27; in Europe and the UK.

In 2019, a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; version of their 2001 &quot;Secrets&quot; album was released.

===2020s: Further releases and Anniversary tour===
In 2020, similar &#x27;deluxe&#x27; treatment was given to their 1995 &quot;Octopus&quot; album on its 25th anniversary. Also in 2020, a three-disc &#x27;Essential&#x27; collection from their Virgin Records years reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. This compilation was unique in that the third disc, with the exception of the first two tracks, focused entirely on the band&#x27;s pre-Dare material.

In 2021 the band embarked on the &#x27;Dare 40&#x27; European and UK tour. They played the &quot;Dare&quot; album in full, as well as other songs from their back catalogue.

In 2023, they were one of the headliners at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California however they had to cut short their performance due to storms.

In March 2024 the group performed a nine-date tour of Australia, with further summer festival dates and a &quot;Generations 2024&quot; arena tour in Europe and the UK in November and December 2024. They have announced further shows including festival appearances in 2025.

==Legacy and influence==
The Human League has influenced many electropop, other synth-pop, and mainstream performers, including Pet Shop Boys. Moby and Little Boots are longtime fans of the group. They have been sampled and covered by various artists, including Ladytron, Utah Saints, George Michael, Robbie Williams and LCD Soundsystem.

In 2000, the tribute album &quot;&quot; was released. It contains cover versions of 16 of the Human League&#x27;s songs, including performances by Ladytron, Lali Puna, Momus, Future Bible Heroes, Stephin Merritt and The Aluminum Group.

&quot;Nightshift&quot; identified the Human League, and fellow late 1970s debutants Gary Numan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), as &quot;the holy trinity of synth-pop&quot;. The history of the band&#x27;s Fast Product era is covered in a 2015 documentary, &quot;Big Gold Dream&quot;.

<text>Philip Milton Roth (March 19, 1933 – May 22, 2018) was an American novelist and short-story writer. Roth&#x27;s fiction—often set in his birthplace of Newark, New Jersey—is known for its intensely autobiographical character, for philosophically and formally blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, for its &quot;sensual, ingenious style&quot; and for its provocative explorations of American identity. He first gained attention with the 1959 short story collection &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;, which won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. Ten years later, he published the bestseller &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. Nathan Zuckerman, Roth&#x27;s literary alter ego, narrates several of his books. A fictionalized Roth narrates some of his others, such as the alternate history &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;.

Roth was one of the most honored American writers of his generation. He received the National Book Critics Circle award for &quot;The Counterlife,&quot; the PEN/Faulkner Award for &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, &quot;The Human Stain,&quot; and &quot;Everyman&quot;, a second National Book Award for &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;, and the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;American Pastoral&quot;. In 2001, Roth received the inaugural Franz Kafka Prize in Prague. In 2005, the Library of America began publishing his complete works, making him the second author so anthologized while still living, after Eudora Welty. Harold Bloom named him one of the four greatest American novelists of his day, along with Cormac McCarthy, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo. James Wood wrote: &quot;More than any other post-war American writer, Roth wrote the self—the self was examined, cajoled, lampooned, fictionalized, ghosted, exalted, disgraced but above all constituted by and in writing. Maybe you have to go back to the very different Henry James to find an American novelist so purely a bundle of words, so restlessly and absolutely committed to the investigation and construction of life through language... He would not cease from exploration; he could not cease, and the varieties of fiction existed for him to explore the varieties of experience.&quot;

==Early life and academic pursuits==
Philip Roth was born in Newark, New Jersey, on March 19, 1933, and grew up at 81 Summit Avenue in the Weequahic neighborhood. He was the second child of Bess (née Finkel) and Herman Roth, an insurance broker. Roth&#x27;s family was Jewish, and his parents were second-generation Americans. His paternal grandparents came from Kozlov near Lviv (then Lemberg) in Austrian Galicia, and his mother&#x27;s ancestors were from the region of Kyiv in Ukraine. He graduated from Newark&#x27;s Weequahic High School in or around 1950.

In 1969, Arnold H. Lubasch wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the school &quot;has provided the focus for the fiction of Philip Roth, the novelist who evokes his era at Weequahic High School in the highly acclaimed &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. Besides identifying Weequahic High School by name, the novel specifies such sites as the Empire Burlesque, the Weequahic Diner, the Newark Museum and Irvington Park, all local landmarks that helped shape the youth of the real Roth and the fictional Portnoy, both graduates of Weequahic class of &#x27;50.&quot; The 1950 &quot;Weequahic Yearbook&quot; calls Roth a &quot;boy of real intelligence, combined with wit and common sense&quot;. He was known as a comedian during his time at school.

===Academic career===
Roth attended Rutgers University in Newark for a year, then transferred to Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received a fellowship to attend the University of Chicago, where he earned an M.A. in English literature in 1955 and briefly worked as an instructor in the university&#x27;s writing program. That same year, rather than wait to be drafted, Roth enlisted in the army, but suffered a back injury during basic training and was given a medical discharge. He returned to Chicago in 1956 to study for a PhD in literature, but dropped out after one term. Roth was a longtime faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught comparative literature until retiring from teaching in 1991.

==Writing career==

Roth&#x27;s work first appeared in print in the &quot;Chicago Review&quot; while he was studying, and later teaching, at the University of Chicago. His first book, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;, contains the novella &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and four short stories. It won the National Book Award in 1960. He published his first full-length novel, &quot;Letting Go,&quot; in 1962. In 1967 he published &quot;When She Was Good&quot;, set in the WASP Midwest in the 1940s. It is based in part on the life of Margaret Martinson Williams, whom Roth married in 1959.

The publication in 1969 of his fourth and most controversial novel, &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, gave Roth widespread commercial and critical success, causing his profile to rise significantly. During the 1970s Roth experimented in various modes, from the political satire &quot;Our Gang&quot; (1971) to the Kafkaesque &quot;The Breast&quot; (1972). By the end of the decade Roth had created his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman. In a series of highly self-referential novels and novellas that followed between 1979 and 1986, Zuckerman appeared as either the main character or an interlocutor.

&quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; (1995) may have Roth&#x27;s most lecherous protagonist, Mickey Sabbath, a disgraced former puppeteer. It won his second National Book Award. In complete contrast, &quot;American Pastoral&quot; (1997), the first volume of his so-called American Trilogy, focuses on the life of virtuous Newark star athlete Swede Levov, and the tragedy that befalls him when his teenage daughter becomes a domestic terrorist during the late 1960s. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

&quot;The Dying Animal&quot; (2001) is a short novel about eros and death that revisits literary professor David Kepesh, protagonist of two 1970s works, &quot;The Breast&quot; and &quot;The Professor of Desire&quot; (1977). In &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; (2004), Roth imagines an alternative American history in which Charles Lindbergh, aviator hero and isolationist, is elected U.S. President in 1940, and the U.S. negotiates an understanding with Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Germany and embarks on its own program of anti-Semitism.

Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;Everyman&quot;, a meditation on illness, aging, desire, and death, was published in May 2006. It was Roth&#x27;s third book to win the PEN/Faulkner Award, making him the only person so honored. &quot;Exit Ghost&quot;, which again features Nathan Zuckerman, was released in October 2007. It was the last Zuckerman novel. &quot;Indignation&quot;, Roth&#x27;s 29th book, was published on September 16, 2008. Set in 1951, during the Korean War, it follows Marcus Messner&#x27;s departure from Newark to Ohio&#x27;s Winesburg College, where he begins his sophomore year. In 2009, Roth&#x27;s 30th book, &quot;The Humbling&quot;, was published. It tells the story of the last performances of Simon Axler, a celebrated stage actor. Roth&#x27;s 31st book, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, was published on October 5, 2010. According to the book&#x27;s notes, &quot;Nemesis&quot; is the last in a series of four &quot;short novels&quot;, after &quot;Everyman&quot;, &quot;Indignation&quot; and &quot;The Humbling&quot;. In October 2009, during an interview with Tina Brown of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; to promote &quot;The Humbling&quot;, Roth considered the future of literature and its place in society, stating his belief that within 25 years the reading of novels will be regarded as a &quot;cultic&quot; activity:

I was being optimistic about 25 years really. I think it&#x27;s going to be cultic. I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range. ... To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don&#x27;t read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by—it&#x27;s hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities[.]

When asked about the prospects for printed versus digital books, Roth was equally downbeat:

The book can&#x27;t compete with the screen. It couldn&#x27;t compete beginning with the movie screen. It couldn&#x27;t compete with the television screen, and it can&#x27;t compete with the computer screen. ... Now we have all those screens, so against all those screens a book couldn&#x27;t measure up.
This was not the first time Roth had expressed pessimism about the future of the novel and its significance in recent years. Talking to &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Robert McCrum in 2001, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not good at finding &#x27;encouraging&#x27; features in American culture. I doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here.&quot; In an October 2012 interview with the French magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, Roth announced that he would be retiring from writing and confirmed subsequently in &quot;Le Monde&quot; that he would no longer publish fiction. In a May 2014 interview with Alan Yentob for the BBC, Roth said, &quot;this is my last appearance on television, my absolutely last appearance on any stage anywhere.&quot;

Reflecting on his writing career, in an afterword written on the 25th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, Roth wrote, &quot;I wished to dazzle in my very own way and to dazzle myself no less than anyone else.&quot; To inspire himself to write, he recalled thinking, &quot;All you have to do is sit down and work!&quot;

==Influences and themes==
Much of Roth&#x27;s fiction revolves around semi-autobiographical themes, while self-consciously and playfully addressing the perils of establishing connections between Roth and his fictional lives and voices. Examples of this close relationship between the author&#x27;s life and his characters&#x27; include narrators and protagonists such as David Kepesh and Nathan Zuckerman as well as the character &quot;Philip Roth&quot;, who appears in &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; and of whom there are two in &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;. Critic Jacques Berlinerblau noted in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers, deceiving them into believing they &quot;know&quot; Roth.

In Roth&#x27;s fiction the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic, secular Jewish son who attempts to distance himself from Jewish customs and traditions, and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents, rabbis, and other community leaders. Roth&#x27;s fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by &quot;a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it&quot;.

Roth&#x27;s first work, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;, was an irreverently humorous depiction of the life of middle-class Jewish Americans and received highly polarized reviews; one reviewer found it infused with self-loathing. In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay &quot;Writing About Jews&quot; (collected in &quot;Reading Myself and Others&quot;), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:
The cry &#x27;Watch out for the goyim!&#x27; at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh that they were out there, so that we could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits—something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.

In Roth&#x27;s fiction the exploration of &quot;promiscuous instincts&quot; within the context of Jewish lives, mainly from a male viewpoint, plays an important role. In the words of critic Hermione Lee:
Philip Roth&#x27;s fiction strains to shed the burden of Jewish traditions and proscriptions. ... The liberated Jewish consciousness, let loose into the disintegration of the American Dream, finds itself deracinated and homeless. American society and politics, by the late sixties, are a grotesque travesty of what Jewish immigrants had traveled towards: liberty, peace, security, a decent liberal democracy.

While Roth&#x27;s fiction has strong autobiographical influences, it also incorporates social commentary and political satire, most obviously in &quot;Our Gang&quot; and &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;. From the 1990s on, Roth&#x27;s fiction often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar American life. Roth described &quot;American Pastoral&quot; and the two following novels as a loosely connected &quot;American trilogy&quot;. Each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered Jewish American childhood of Nathan Zuckerman, in which the experience of life on the American home front during the Second World War features prominently. &quot;American Pastoral&quot; looks at the legacy of the 1960s, as Swede Levov&#x27;s daughter becomes an antiwar terrorist. &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998), in which radio actor Ira Ringold is revealed as a communist sympathizer, is set in the McCarthy era&quot;. The Human Stain&quot;, in which classics professor Coleman Silk&#x27;s secret history is revealed, explores identity politics in the late 1990s.

In much of Roth&#x27;s fiction, the 1940s, comprising Roth&#x27;s and Zuckerman&#x27;s childhood, mark a high point of American idealism and social cohesion. A more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in Roth&#x27;s comic novels, such as &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; and &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;. In &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, the alternate history of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of anti-Semitism and racism in America at the time, despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war. In his fiction, Roth portrayed the 1940s, and the New Deal era of the 1930s that preceded it, as a heroic phase in American history. A sense of frustration with social and political developments in the United States since the 1940s is palpable in the American trilogy and &quot;Exit Ghost&quot;, but had already been present in Roth&#x27;s earlier works that contained political and social satire, such as &quot;Our Gang&quot; and &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;. Writing about the latter, Hermione Lee points to the sense of disillusionment with &quot;the American Dream&quot; in Roth&#x27;s fiction: &quot;The mythic words on which Roth&#x27;s generation was brought up—winning, patriotism, gamesmanship—are desanctified; greed, fear, racism, and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the &#x27;all-American ideals&#x27;.&quot; Although Roth&#x27;s writings often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth rejected being labeled a Jewish American writer. &quot;It&#x27;s not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it&#x27;s really not interesting,&quot; he told the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2005. &quot;I&#x27;m an American.&quot;

Roth was a baseball fan, and credited the game with shaping his literary sensibility. In an essay published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on Opening Day, 1973, Roth wrote that &quot;baseball, with its lore and legends, its cultural power, its seasonal associations, its native authenticity, its simple rules and transparent strategy, its longueurs and thrills, its spaciousness, its suspensefulness, its heroics, its nuances, its lingo, its &#x27;characters,&#x27; its peculiarly hypnotic tedium, its mythic transformation of the immediate, was the literature of my boyhood... Of course, as time passed neither the flavor and suggestiveness of Red Barber&#x27;s narration, nor specific details, vivid and revealing even as Rex Barney&#x27;s pre-game hot dog, could continue to satisfy a developing literary appetite; there is no doubt, however, that they helped sustain me until I was old enough and literate enough to begin to respond to the great inventors of narrative detail and masters of narrative voice and perspective, like James and Conrad and Dostoyevsky and Bellow.&quot; Baseball features in several of Roth&#x27;s novels; the hero of &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; dreams of playing like Duke Snider, and Nicholas Dawidoff called &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; &quot;one of the most eccentric baseball novels ever written&quot;. &quot;American Pastoral&quot; alludes to John R. Tunis&#x27;s baseball novel &quot;The Kid from Tomkinsville&quot;.

In a speech on his 80th birthday, Roth emphasized the importance of realistic detail in American literature:the passion for specificity, the hypnotic materiality of the world one is in, is all but at the heart of the task to which every American novelist has been enjoined since Herman Melville and his whale and Mark Twain and his river: to discover the most arresting, evocative verbal depiction of every last American thing. Without strong representation of the thing—animate or inanimate—without the crucial representation of what is real, there is nothing. Its concreteness, its unabashed focus on all the particulars, a fervor for the singular and a profound aversion to generalities is fiction&#x27;s lifeblood. It is from a scrupulous fidelity to the blizzard of specific data that is a personal life, it is from the force of its uncompromising particularity, from its physicalness, that the realistic novel, the insatiable realistic novel with its multitude of realities, derives its ruthless intimacy. And its mission: to portray humanity in its particularity.

==Personal life==
While at Chicago in 1956, Roth met Margaret Martinson, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, and Martinson&#x27;s subsequent death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth&#x27;s literary output. Martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of Roth&#x27;s novels, including Lucy Nelson in &quot;When She Was Good&quot; and Maureen Tarnopol in &quot;My Life as a Man&quot;.

Roth was an atheist who once said, &quot;When the whole world doesn&#x27;t believe in God, it&#x27;ll be a great place.&quot; He also said during an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m exactly the opposite of religious, I&#x27;m anti-religious. I find religious people hideous. I hate the religious lies. It&#x27;s all a big lie ... It&#x27;s not a neurotic thing, but the miserable record of religion—I don&#x27;t even want to talk about it. It&#x27;s not interesting to talk about the sheep referred to as believers. When I write, I&#x27;m alone. It&#x27;s filled with fear and loneliness and anxiety—and I never needed religion to save me.&quot;

In 1990, Roth married his longtime companion, English actress Claire Bloom, with whom he had been living since 1976. When Bloom asked him to marry her, &quot;cruelly, he agreed, on condition that she signed a pre-nuptial agreement that would give her very little in the event of a divorce—which he duly demanded two years later.&quot; He also stipulated that Bloom&#x27;s daughter Anna Steiger—from her marriage to Rod Steiger—not live with them. They divorced in 1994, and Bloom published a 1996 memoir, &quot;Leaving a Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, that depicted Roth as a misogynist and control freak. Some critics have detected parallels between Bloom and the character Eve Frame in Roth&#x27;s &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998).

The novel &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; (1993) and other works draw on a post-operative breakdown, as well as Roth&#x27;s experience of the temporary side effects of the sedative Halcion (triazolam), prescribed post-operatively in the 1980s.

==Death and burial==
Roth died at a Manhattan hospital of heart failure on May 22, 2018, at the age of 85. Roth was buried at the Bard College Cemetery in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where in 1999 he taught a class. He had originally planned to be buried next to his parents at the Gomel Chesed Cemetery in Newark, but changed his mind about 15 years before his death, in order to be buried close to where his friend Norman Manea is writer in residence, and near other Jews &quot;to whom he could talk&quot;. Roth expressly banned any religious rituals from his funeral service, though it was noted that, the day after his burial, a pebble had been placed on top of his tombstone in accordance with Jewish tradition.

==Awards and nominations==
Two of Roth&#x27;s works won the National Book Award for Fiction; four others were finalists. Two won National Book Critics Circle awards; another five were finalists. Roth won three PEN/Faulkner Awards (for &quot;Operation Shylock,&quot; &quot;The Human Stain,&quot; and &quot;Everyman&quot;) and a Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel &quot;American Pastoral&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;The Human Stain&quot; was awarded the United Kingdom&#x27;s WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year, as well as France&#x27;s Prix Médicis Étranger. Also in 2001, the MacDowell Colony awarded Roth the 42nd Edward MacDowell Medal. In 2002, Roth was awarded the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

In 2003, literary critic Harold Bloom named Roth one of the four major American novelists still at work, along with Cormac McCarthy, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo. &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; (2004) won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2005 and the Society of American Historians&#x27; James Fenimore Cooper Prize. Roth was also awarded the United Kingdom&#x27;s WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year, an award he received twice.

In October 2005, Roth was honored in his hometown when then-mayor Sharpe James presided over the unveiling of a street sign in Roth&#x27;s name on the corner of Summit and Keer Avenues, where Roth lived for much of his childhood, a setting prominent in &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;. A plaque on the house where the Roths lived was unveiled. In May 2006, he received the PEN/Nabokov Award, and in 2007 he received the PEN/Faulkner award for &quot;Everyman,&quot; making him the award&#x27;s only three-time winner. In April 2007, he received the first PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction.

The May 21, 2006, issue of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; announced the results of a letter that was sent to what the publication described as &quot;a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to identify &#x27;the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years&#x27;&quot;. &quot;American Pastoral&quot; tied for fifth, and &quot;The Counterlife&quot;, &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;, &quot;The Human Stain&quot; and &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; received multiple votes. In the accompanying essay, A. O. Scott wrote: &quot;Over the past 15 years, Roth&#x27;s output has been so steady, so various and (mostly) so excellent that his vote has been, inevitably, split. If we had asked for the single best writer of fiction of the past 25 years, he would have won.&quot; Scott notes that &quot;The Roth whose primary concern is the past—the elegiac, summarizing, conservative Roth—is preferred over his more aesthetically radical, restless, present-minded doppelgänger by a narrow but decisive margin.&quot; In 2009, Roth received the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Welt&quot;-Literaturpreis.

President Barack Obama awarded Roth the 2010 National Humanities Medal in the East Room of the White House on March 2, 2011.

In May 2011, Roth was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement in fiction on the world stage, the fourth winner of the biennial prize. One of the judges, Carmen Callil, a publisher of the feminist Virago house, withdrew in protest, referring to Roth&#x27;s work as &quot;Emperor&#x27;s clothes&quot;. She said &quot;he goes on and on and on about the same subject in almost every single book. It&#x27;s as though he&#x27;s sitting on your face and you can&#x27;t breathe ... I don&#x27;t rate him as a writer at all ...&quot;. Observers noted that Callil had a conflict of interest, having published a book by Claire Bloom (Roth&#x27;s ex-wife) that criticized Roth and lambasted their marriage. In response, one of the two other Booker judges, Rick Gekoski, remarked:
In 1959 he writes &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and it&#x27;s a masterpiece, magnificent. Fifty-one years later he&#x27;s 78 years old and he writes &quot;Nemesis&quot; and it is so wonderful, such a terrific novel ... Tell me one other writer who 50 years apart writes masterpieces ... If you look at the trajectory of the average novel writer, there is a learning period, then a period of high achievement, then the talent runs out and in middle age they start slowly to decline. People say why aren&#x27;t Martin [Amis] and Julian [Barnes] getting on the Booker prize shortlist, but that&#x27;s what happens in middle age. Philip Roth, though, gets better and better in middle age. In the 1990s he was almost incapable of not writing a masterpiece—&quot;The Human Stain&quot;, &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;. He was 65–70 years old, what the hell&#x27;s he doing writing that well? In 2012 Roth received the Prince of Asturias Award for literature. On March 19, 2013, his 80th birthday was celebrated in public ceremonies at the Newark Museum.

One prize that eluded Roth was the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he was a favorite of bookmakers and critics for decades. Ron Charles of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;thundering obituaries&quot; around the world noted that &quot;he won every other honor a writer could win&quot;, sometimes even two or three times, except the Nobel Prize.

Roth worked hard to obtain his many awards, spending large amounts of time &quot;networking, scratching people&#x27;s backs, placing his people in positions, voting for them&quot; in order to increase his chances of receiving awards.

===Films===
Eight of Roth&#x27;s novels and short stories have been adapted as films: &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;; &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;; &quot;The Human Stain&quot;; &quot;The Dying Animal,&quot; adapted as &quot;Elegy&quot;; &quot;The Humbling&quot;; &quot;Indignation&quot;; and &quot;American Pastoral&quot;. In addition, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; was adapted for television in 1984. In 2014 filmmaker Alex Ross Perry made &quot;Listen Up Philip&quot;, which was influenced by Roth&#x27;s work. HBO dramatized Roth&#x27;s &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; in 2020 as a six-part series starting Zoe Kazan, Winona Ryder, John Turturro, and Morgan Spencer.

==Legacy==
John Updike, considered by many Roth&#x27;s chief literary rival, said in 2008, &quot;He&#x27;s scarily devoted to the novelist&#x27;s craft... [he] seems more dedicated in a way to the act of writing as a means of really reshaping the world to your liking. But he&#x27;s been very good to have around as far as goading me to become a better writer.&quot; Roth spoke at Updike&#x27;s memorial service, saying, &quot;He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.&quot; After Updike&#x27;s memorial at the New York Public Library, Roth told Charles McGrath, &quot;I dream about John sometimes. He&#x27;s standing behind me, watching me write.&quot; Asked who was better, Roth said, &quot;John had more talent, but I think maybe I got more out of the talent I had.&quot; McGrath agreed with that assessment, adding that Updike might be the better stylist, but Roth&#x27;s work was more consistent and &quot;much funnier&quot;. McGrath added that in the 1990s Roth &quot;underwent a kind of sea change and, borne aloft by that extraordinary second wind, produced some of his very best work&quot;: &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; and the American Trilogy (&quot;American Pastoral&quot;, &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;, and &quot;The Human Stain&quot;). Another admirer of Roth&#x27;s work is Bruce Springsteen. Roth read Springsteen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, and Springsteen praised Roth&#x27;s American Trilogy: &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you, those three recent books by Philip Roth just knocked me on my ass... To be in his sixties making work that is so strong, so full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that&#x27;s the way to live your artistic life. Sustain, sustain, sustain.&quot;

Roth left his book collection and more than $2 million to the Newark Public Library. In 2021, the Philip Roth Personal Library opened for public viewing in the Newark Public Library. In April 2021, W. W. Norton &amp; Company published Blake Bailey&#x27;s authorized biography of Roth, &quot;Philip Roth: The Biography&quot;. Publication was halted two weeks after release due to sexual assault allegations against Bailey. Three weeks later, in May 2021, Skyhorse Publishing announced that it would release a paperback, ebook, and audiobook versions of the biography. Roth had asked his executors &quot;to destroy many of his personal papers after the publication of the semi-authorized biography on which Blake Bailey had recently begun work... Roth wanted to ensure that Bailey, who was producing exactly the type of biography he wanted, would be the only person outside a small circle of intimates permitted to access personal, sensitive manuscripts, including the unpublished &quot;Notes for My Biographer&quot; (a 295-page rebuttal to his ex-wife&#x27;s memoir) and &quot;Notes on a Slander-Monger&quot; (another rebuttal, this time to a biographical effort from Bailey&#x27;s predecessor). &#x27;I don&#x27;t want my personal papers dragged all over the place,&#x27; Roth said. The fate of Roth&#x27;s personal papers took on new urgency in the wake of Norton&#x27;s decision to halt distribution of the biography. In May 2021, the Philip Roth Society published an open letter imploring Roth&#x27;s executors &#x27;to preserve these documents and make them readily available to researchers.&#x27;&quot;

After Roth&#x27;s death, Harold Bloom told the Library of America: &quot;Philip Roth&#x27;s departure is a dark day for me and for many others. His two greatest novels, &quot;American Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;, have a controlled frenzy, a high imaginative ferocity, and a deep perception of America in the days of its decline. The Zuckerman tetralogy remains fully alive and relevant, and I should mention too the extraordinary invention of &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, the astonishing achievement of &quot;The Counterlife&quot;, and the pungency of &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;. His &quot;My Life as a Man&quot; still haunts me. In one sense Philip Roth is the culmination of the unsolved riddle of Jewish literature in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The complex influences of Kafka and Freud and the malaise of American Jewish life produced in Philip a new kind of synthesis. Pynchon aside, he must be estimated as the major American novelist since Faulkner.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; asked several prominent authors to name their favorite work by Roth. The responses were varied; Jonathan Safran Foer chose &quot;&quot;, Roth&#x27;s memoir of his father&#x27;s illness: &quot;Much has been written about Roth since he died. In keeping with the unseemliness of our profession, we all have something to say. The responses have overflowed with a kind of blunt adoration that would be perfectly un-Rothlike if they weren&#x27;t the efforts of children agonizing over the right way to bury our father. None of it feels right, perhaps because nothing could. Roth&#x27;s words dressed his father for death, and they dressed so many of us for life. How does one properly acknowledge that? How does one say thank you for the thousand almost-invisible preparations? This morning, as I was getting my children dressed for school, I felt the profound gratitude of a &#x27;little son.&#x27;&quot;

Joyce Carol Oates told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Philip Roth was a slightly older contemporary of mine. We had come of age in more or less the same repressive 50s era in America—formalist, ironic, &#x27;Jamesian&#x27;, a time of literary indirection and understatement, above all impersonality—as the high priest TS Eliot had preached: &#x27;Poetry is an escape from personality.&#x27; Boldly, brilliantly, at times furiously, and with an unsparing sense of the ridiculous, Philip repudiated all that. He did revere Kafka—but Lenny Bruce as well. (In fact, the essential Roth is just that anomaly: Kafka riotously interpreted by Lenny Bruce.) But there was much more to Philip than furious rebellion. For at heart he was a true moralist, fired to root out hypocrisy and mendacity in public life as well as private. Few saw &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; as actual prophecy, but here we are. He will abide.&quot;

<text>Charles Edward Springall (19 June 1925 – 23 December 2006), known professionally as Charlie Drake, was an English comedian, actor, writer and singer.

With his small stature ( tall), curly red hair and liking for slapstick, he was a popular comedian with children in his early years, becoming nationally known for his &quot;Hello, my darlings!&quot; catchphrase.

==Early life==
Born Charles Edward Springall in the Elephant and Castle, Southwark, south London, he took his mother&#x27;s maiden name for the stage and, later, film and television, achieving success as a comedian. Aged eight, he won a chorus place in a Harry Champion music hall production. He left school and home aged fourteen to become an electrician&#x27;s mate while attempting to break into showbusiness.

==Career==
Drake made his first appearance on stage at the age of eight, and after leaving school toured working men&#x27;s clubs. After serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Drake turned professional and made his television début in &quot;The Centre Show&quot; in 1953. He then joined his wartime comrade Jack Edwardes to form a double act, named &#x27;Mick and Montmorency&#x27;. In 1954 he appeared with Bob Monkhouse and Denis Goodwin in their BBC Television Service sketch comedy show, &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;.

He appeared in the television shows &quot;Laughter in Store&quot; (1957), &quot;Drake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1957–58), &quot;Charlie Drake In…&quot; (1958 to 1960) and &quot;The Charlie Drake Show&quot; (1960 to 1961), being remembered for his opening catchphrase &quot;Hello, my darlings!&quot; The catchphrase came about because he was short, and so his eyes would often be naturally directly level with a lady&#x27;s bosom. Because of this and because in his television work he preferred appearing with big-busted women, the catchphrase was born.

===Bookcase incident===
In 1961, the later series was brought to an abrupt end, however, by a serious accident which occurred during a live transmission. Drake had arranged for a bookcase to be set up in such a way that it would fall apart when he was pulled through it during a slapstick sketch.

It was later discovered that an overenthusiastic workman had &quot;mended&quot; the bookcase before the broadcast. The actors working with him, unaware of what had happened, proceeded with the rest of the sketch which required that they pick him up and throw him through an open window. Drake fractured his skull and was unconscious for three days. It would be two years before he returned to the screen.

===Comeback===
Drake returned to television in 1963 with &quot;The Charlie Drake Show&quot;, a compilation of which won an award at the Montreux Festival in 1968. The centrepiece of this was an extended sketch featuring an orchestra performing the 1812 Overture, in which Drake appeared to play all the instruments; as well as conducting and one scene in which he was the player of a triangle waiting for his cue to play a single strike – which he subsequently missed.

Through the series he played a gymnast doing a single arm twist from a high ring while a commentator counted eventually into the thousands and by the end of the series, Drake&#x27;s arm appeared to be long. Other shows included &quot;Who Is Sylvia?&quot; (1967) and &quot;Slapstick and Old Lace&quot; (1971), but it was &quot;The Worker&quot; (1965 to 1970) that gained most acclaim.

Television fame led to four films, none of them successful — &quot;Sands of the Desert&quot; (1960), &quot;Petticoat Pirates&quot; (1961), &quot;The Cracksman&quot; (1963) and &quot;Mister Ten Per Cent&quot; (1967).

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in December 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in a rehearsal room at the London Palladium, and in November 1995, when Michael Aspel surprised him at the curtain call of the comedy play &quot;Funny Money&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre.

===&quot;The Worker&quot;===
In &quot;The Worker&quot; (ATV/ITV, 1965–70) he played a perpetually unemployed labourer who, in every episode, was dispatched to a new job by the ever-frustrated clerk (firstly Mr Whittaker in series one, played by Percy Herbert, and from series two onwards Mr Pugh, played by Henry McGee) at the local labour exchange. All the jobs he embarked upon ended in disaster, sometimes with a burst of classic slapstick, sometimes with a bewildered Drake himself at the centre of incomprehensible actions by the people employing him. Bookending these sequences were the encounters between Drake and the labour exchange clerk. Running jokes included Drake&#x27;s inability to manage the name of the clerk, with Mr Whittaker rendered as Mr Wicketer and then Mr Pugh variously mispronounced from a childish &quot;Mi&#x27;er Poo&quot; to &quot;Peeyooo&quot;. Drake sang the theme song himself, using an old music hall number. The series was briefly revived by London Weekend Television in 1978 as a series of short sketches on &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot;, with Drake and McGee reprising their roles.

=== Recording career ===
Drake made a number of records, most of them produced by George Martin for the Parlophone label. The first, &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, a cover version of a rock and roll song originally recorded by Bobby Darin, got into the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 7 in 1958. In 1961, &quot;My Boomerang Won&#x27;t Come Back&quot; became a mid-chart UK hit (No. 14) and an edited, more politically correct, version (with one word overdubbed) was a No 21 US hit, a follow-up to &quot;Mr. Custer&quot; (No. 12 UK charts).

In 1972 Drake recorded a spoof song called &#x27;Puckwudgie&#x27; on Columbia records. It referred to a 2-or-3-foot-tall (0.61 or 0.91 m) being from the Wampanoag folklore. It reached number 47 in the BBC Top 50 in early 1972.

Peter Gabriel, after leaving Genesis in late 1975, produced a single &quot;You Never Know&quot; for Drake (UK Charisma), with Sandy Denny on backing vocals and Phil Collins on drums. It was not a chart success.

===Later career===
Drake turned to straight acting in the 1980s, winning acclaim for his role as Touchstone in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; (at the Ludlow Festival), and an award for his part in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, along with Michael Angelis. Drake also starred as Smallweed in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1985), and &quot;Filipina Dreamgirls&quot;, a TV film for the BBC. His final appearances on stage were with Jim Davidson in &quot;Sinderella&quot;, his adult adaptation of Cinderella, as Baron Hard-on. A live recording of one of the dates on the tour of the pantomime was later adapted, and edited for video, and put out for sale nationwide.

==Personal life==
Drake was married twice. He was married to Heather Barnes from 1953 until 1971, and they had three sons. In 1976, Drake married his second wife, Elaine Bird, but the marriage was dissolved in 1984.

===Retirement===
Drake suffered a stroke in 1995 and retired, staying at Brinsworth House, a retirement home for actors and performers, run by the Entertainment Artistes&#x27; Benevolent Fund, until his death on 23 December 2006, after suffering multiple strokes the previous night.

===Theme tune from &quot;The Worker&quot;===
Drake sang the theme song himself, based upon an old music hall song
:&quot;I gets up every mornin&#x27; when the clock strikes eight&quot;
:&quot;I&#x27;m always punctual, never never late&quot;
:&quot;With a nice cup of tea, a little round of toast&quot;
:&quot;The Sporting Life and the Winning Post.&quot;
:&quot;I gets all nice and tidy, then I toddles off to work&quot;
:&quot;I do the best I can&quot;
:&quot;Cos I&#x27;m only a-doin&#x27; what a bloke should do&quot;
:&quot;Cos I&#x27;m only a workin&#x27; man!&quot;

The song, &quot;Only A Working Man&quot;, written by Herbert Rule and Fred Holt in 1923, was featured by Lily Morris on the music hall stage, and in the 1930 film, &quot;Elstree Calling&quot;, the original lyric being &quot;He&#x27;s only a workin&#x27; man&quot;.

<doc id="151403" wikidata="Q1049995" url="?curid=151403" title="Casual Friday">
<text>Casual Friday (also known as dress-down Friday or casual day) is a Western dress code trend in which businesses relax their dress code on Fridays. Businesses that usually require employees to wear suits, dress shirts, neckties, and dress shoes, may allow more casual or business casual wear on such days.

In 1994, 497 of the 1000 most important companies in America observed casual Friday, including General Motors, Ford, and IBM.

The trend originated from Hawaii&#x27;s midcentury custom of Aloha Friday which slowly spread to California, continuing around the globe until the 1990s when it became known as Casual Friday. Casual Friday began in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, when Hewlett-Packard allowed its employees to dress more casually on Friday and work on new ideas.

In Hawaii, &quot;Aloha Wear&quot; is suitable business attire any day of the week, and the term &quot;Aloha Friday&quot; is generally used simply to refer to the last day of the workweek.

Valerie Steele described the introduction of casual Friday as the most radical change in work fashion since the 70s, when women asked for the right to wear trousers in the office.

<doc id="151404" wikidata="Q200228" url="?curid=151404" title="Benny Hill">
<text>Alfred Hawthorne &quot;Benny&quot; Hill (21 January 1924 – 18 April 1992) was an English comedian, actor, and scriptwriter. He is remembered for his television programme, &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, an amalgam of slapstick, burlesque and double entendre in a format that included live comedy and filmed segments, with Hill at the focus of almost every segment.

The BFI called Hill &quot;the first British comedian to attain fame through television&quot; and that he was &quot;a major star for over forty years&quot;. Making his television debut in 1949, he appeared on BBC variety shows where he developed his parodic sketches, and in 1954 he was voted television personality of the year. &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, which debuted in 1955, was among the most-watched programmes in the UK, and his audience was more than 21 million in 1971. The show was also exported to over 100 countries around the world, a global appeal which the BFI attributed to &quot;Hill&#x27;s emphasis on visual humour transcending language barriers&quot;.

Hill received a BAFTA Television Award for Best Writer and a Rose d&#x27;Or, and he was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance and for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Variety. In 1990, Anthony Burgess described Hill as &quot;a comic genius steeped in the British music hall tradition&quot;. In 2006, Hill was voted by the British public number 17 in ITV&#x27;s poll of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars.

Outside television, Hill starred in films including the Ealing comedy &quot;Who Done It?&quot; (1956), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969). His comedy song, &quot;Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)&quot;, was 1971&#x27;s number one Christmas song on the UK Singles Chart, and earned Hill an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 1972.

== Early life ==
Alfred Hawthorne Hill was born 21 January 1924 (although some sources give his birth year as 1925) in Southampton, Hampshire. His father, Alfred Hill (1893–1972), manager of a surgical appliance shop, and grandfather, Henry Hill (born 1871), had been circus clowns. His mother was Helen (&quot;née&quot; Cave; 1894–1976).

After leaving Taunton&#x27;s School in Southampton, Hill worked at Woolworths and as a milkman, a bridge operator, a driver and a drummer before becoming assistant stage manager with a touring revue. He was called up in 1942 and trained as a mechanic in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, British Army. He served as a mechanic, truck driver and searchlight operator in Normandy after September 1944, and transferred to the Combined Services Entertainment division before the end of the war.

Inspired by the &quot;star comedians&quot; of British music hall shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. He took the nickname of &quot;Benny&quot; in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny.

== Career ==
After the war, Hill worked as a performer on radio, making his debut on &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot; on 5 October 1947. His first job in theatre was as Reg Varney&#x27;s straight man, with Hill beating a then unknown Peter Sellers to the role. His first appearance on television was in 1949. He later starred in a sitcom anthology, &quot;Benny Hill&quot;, which ran from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played Nick Bottom in an all-star TV film production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He also had a radio programme lasting three series called &quot;Benny Hill Time&quot; on BBC Radio&#x27;s Light Programme from 1964 to 1966. It was a topical show; for example, a March 1964 episode featured James Bond, 007, in &quot;From Moscow with Love&quot;, and his version of The Beatles. He played a number of characters in the series, such as Harry Hill and Fred Scuttle.

=== Films and recordings ===
Hill appeared in five full-length feature films: &quot;Who Done It?&quot; (1956), &quot;Light Up the Sky!&quot; (1960), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969). He also made two short-subject films: &quot;The Waiters&quot; (1969) and &quot;Eddie in August&quot; (1970), the latter a TV production. Finally, a clip-show film spin-off of his early Thames Television shows (1969–1973), called &quot;The Best of Benny Hill&quot; (1974), was a theatrically-released compilation of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; episodes.

Hill&#x27;s audio recordings include &quot;Gather in the Mushrooms&quot; (1961), &quot;Pepys&#x27; Diary&quot; (1961), &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; (1961), &quot;Harvest of Love&quot; (1963) and &quot;Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)&quot;, which was the UK Christmas number one single in 1971. He received an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 1972.

=== &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; ===
Hill had struggled on stage and had uneven success in radio, but in television he found a medium that played to his strengths. In the early 1950s, he appeared as a guest on various BBC variety shows where he developed his parodic sketches, and in 1954 he was voted television personality of the year. &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, which debuted the following year, aired on the BBC and ITV (from 1969) between 15 January 1955 and 1 May 1989. It had a music hall-derived format, combining live on-stage comedy and filmed sketches, which included his comic characters such as Fred Scuttle, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody and his cowriter from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.

Hill remained mostly with the BBC through 1968, except for a few sojourns with ITV and ATV stations between 1957 and 1960, and again in 1967. In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where it remained until its cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hill&#x27;s talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, Cherri Gilham, to whom he wrote from Spain, telling her he was using her &quot;Fat Lady&quot; idea on the show in January 1977).
The most common running gag in Hill&#x27;s shows was the closing sequence, the &quot;run-off&quot;, which was literally a running gag featuring various members of the cast chasing Hill, along with other stock comedy characters, such as policemen, vicars and old women. This was commonly filmed using &quot;under-cranking&quot; camera techniques, and included other comic features, such as jogging instead of a run at full speed and characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, Boots Randolph&#x27;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot;, is so strongly associated with the show that it is commonly referred to as &quot;The Benny Hill Theme&quot;. It has been used as a form of parody in many ways by television shows and films. In a 2015 UK-wide poll, the show&#x27;s theme song was voted number 1 on the ITV special, &quot;The Sound of ITV – The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Theme Tune&quot;.

From the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as &quot;Hill&#x27;s Angels&quot;. They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence or in character as foils against Hill. Sue Upton was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels. Jane Leeves appeared as well. Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players and later shows also featured &quot;Hill&#x27;s Little Angels&quot;, a group of children, including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the show&#x27;s director) and Sue Upton. Jenny Lee-Wright (who first appeared on Hill&#x27;s show in 1970) earned the nickname, &quot;The Sexiest Stooge&quot;, coined by Hill.

The alternative comedian Ben Elton made a headline-grabbing allegation, both on the TV show &quot;Saturday Live&quot; and in the January 1987 edition of &quot;Q&quot; magazine, that &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; incited crimes and misdemeanours. &quot;We know in Britain, women can&#x27;t even walk safe in a park anymore. That, for me, is worrying.&quot; A writer in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, though, opined that Elton&#x27;s charge was &quot;like watching an elderly uncle being kicked to death by young thugs&quot;. &quot;GQ&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Pompous and portentous as this is, blaming Hill for rape statistics is like pointing a finger at concert pianists for causing elephant poaching.&quot; Elton later parodied himself in &quot;Harry Enfield &amp; Chums&quot; as Benny Elton, a politically correct spoilsport; Elton ends up being chased by angry women, accompanied by the &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; theme, after trying to force them to be more feminist. A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Council commented that &quot;the convention is becoming increasingly offensive ]...] It&#x27;s not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.&quot;

In late May 1989, Hill announced that after 21 years with Thames Television, he was quitting and taking a year off. His shows had earned Thames £26 million, with a large percentage due to the success of his shows in the United States. John Howard Davies, the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Hill when the company decided not to renew his contract. &quot;The show was past its sell-by date&quot;, Davies told &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;The audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired.&quot;&quot;&quot;

In 1991, Hill started work on a new television series called &quot;Benny Hill&#x27;s World Tour&quot;, which would see Hill performing his sketches in various places around the world in places his show had become popular. However, Hill managed to record only one special called &quot;Greetings from New York&quot; (with regular cast members such as Henry McGee, Bob Todd and Sue Upton), with the show becoming billed as &quot;his final TV appearance&quot; when released on DVD.

In February 1992, Thames Television, which received a steady stream of requests from viewers for &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; repeats, finally gave in and put together a number of re-edited shows. Hill died on the same day a new contract arrived in the post from Central Independent Television, for which he was to have made a series of specials. He had turned down competing offers from Carlton and Thames.

== Celebrity fans ==
Johnny Carson and sidekick Ed McMahon were both fans of Hill, and tried several times to get him to travel to Los Angeles to be a guest on Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Radio and TV host Adam Carolla said that he was a fan of Hill, and that he considered Hill &quot;as American as The Beatles&quot;. During an episode of &quot;The Man Show&quot;, Carolla performed in what was billed as a tribute to &quot;our favourite Englishman, Sir Benny Hill&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;; in fact, Hill was never knighted), in more risqué versions of some of the sketches. Carolla played a rude and lecherous waiter, a typical Hill role, and the sketch featured many of the staples of Hill&#x27;s shows, including a Jackie Wright-esque bald man, as well as scantily clad women.

During a British tour in the 1970s, Michael Jackson said in an interview that he was a fan of Hill. In 1987, Genesis filmed a video for their song &quot;Anything She Does&quot;, featuring Hill as his character Fred Scuttle, portraying an incompetent security guard who lets a ridiculous number of fans backstage at a Genesis concert. In a June 2011 interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, the rapper Snoop Dogg declared himself to be a fan of Hill.

In the &quot;Omnibus&quot; episode, &quot;Benny Hill – Clown Imperial&quot;, filmed shortly before his death, several celebrities, including Burt Reynolds, Michael Caine, John Mortimer, Mickey Rooney and Walter Cronkite, among others, expressed their appreciation of and admiration for Hill and his humour. In Reynolds&#x27; case, the appreciation extended to the Hill&#x27;s Angels as well. The novelist Anthony Burgess was also an admirer of Hill. Burgess, whose novels were often comic, relished language, wordplay and dialect, and admired the verbal and comedic skill that underlay Hill&#x27;s success. Reviewing a biography of Hill, &quot;Saucy Boy&quot;, in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1990, Burgess described Hill as &quot;a comic genius steeped in the British music hall tradition&quot; (as were Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, two of Hill&#x27;s childhood idols) and &quot;one of the great artists of our age&quot;. A meeting between the two men was described in a newspaper article by Burgess, and recalled in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper by the satirist Craig Brown.

== Personal life ==

Hill was noted for his frugality. He never owned his own home in London and preferred to rent a flat rather than buy one. He rented a double-room apartment on London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Gate for 26 years until around 1986, when he moved to Fairwater House in Teddington. While looking for somewhere to live, he briefly stayed at 22 Westrow Gardens in Southampton.

Despite being a multi-millionaire, he continued with the frugal habits he picked up from his parents, such as buying cheap food at supermarkets, walking for miles rather than paying for a taxi unless someone picked up the tab for a limousine, and regularly patching and mending the same clothes. He also never owned a car, despite having a valid driving licence.

Hill never married and had no children. He had proposed to three women, but none accepted. Shortly after his death in 1992, actress Annette Andre said that she turned down his proposal of marriage in the early 1960s. Rumours circulated that he was gay, but he always denied them.

Hill was a Francophile and enjoyed visits to France, particularly Marseille, where, until the 1980s, he could go to outdoor cafes anonymously, travelling on public transport and socialising with local women. He spoke French fluently and also knew basic German, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. Travel was the only luxury he permitted himself; even then, he would stay in modest accommodations.

== Health problems and death ==

Hill&#x27;s health declined in the mid-to-late 1980s and after his contract ended with Thames Television. After Hill had a mild heart attack on 24 February 1992, doctors recommended a heart bypass; he declined. A week later, he was found to have kidney failure, but he refused to undergo kidney dialysis. Hill died at his flat in Teddington on 18 April 1992 at the age of 68, but his body was not found until 20 April. He died while watching television in his armchair. The cause of death was recorded as coronary thrombosis. Hill was buried at Hollybrook Cemetery, near his birthplace in Southampton, on 28 April 1992.

Hill&#x27;s estate was probated at £7,548,192, . His will, written thirty years earlier, left most of his estate to his parents, who had predeceased him; ultimately, Hill&#x27;s estate was divided among his seven nieces and nephews.

During the night of 4 October 1992, following speculation that Hill had been buried with a large amount of gold and jewellery, grave robbers exhumed and broke open Hill&#x27;s coffin. The coffin was reburied and covered with a thick concrete slab.

== Legacy ==

In 1998, Channel 4 featured Hill in one of its &quot;Heroes of Comedy&quot; programmes. In 2002, D. J. Taylor of &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked him the third greatest British comedian of the 20th century, after Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel.

On 28 December 2006, Channel 4 broadcast the documentary, &quot;Is Benny Hill Still Funny?&quot;. The programme featured an audience that comprised a cross-section of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of &quot;Little Britain&quot;, &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; and &quot;Borat&quot;. The participants favourably rated a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hill&#x27;s humour from his BBC and ITV shows.

In November 2021, That&#x27;s TV announced that &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; would feature in its Christmas schedule, alongside other ITV programmes, such as &quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot; and &quot;Kenny Everett&#x27;s New Year Specials&quot;. In addition to operating a number of local television channels on Freeview, That&#x27;s TV had another national slot on channel 65, meaning that Hill&#x27;s show would be seen in full, nationwide on British television, for the first time in nearly 20 years.

<doc id="151408" wikidata="Q516671" url="?curid=151408" title="Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)">
<text>Richard Wilson (born Iain Carmichael Wilson; 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He is most famous for playing Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. Another notable role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama &quot;Merlin&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wilson was born in Greenock in Renfrewshire, Scotland. He went to the Lady Alice Primary school in Greenock. He studied science subjects at Greenock Academy, then completed his National Service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Singapore.

== Career ==
Wilson worked in a laboratory at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow as a research assistant before switching to acting at age 27. He trained at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, graduating in 1965 with an Acting (RADA Diploma). He then appeared in repertory theatres in Edinburgh (Traverse Theatre), Glasgow and Manchester (Stables Theatre).

Wilson initially turned down the role of Victor Meldrew and it was almost offered to Les Dawson before Wilson changed his mind. Wilson has stated that he came to hate Meldrew&#x27;s catchphrase of &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it!&quot; to the point where he now refuses to say it except for charity.

Wilson was appointed an OBE in the 1994 Birthday Honours for services to Drama. In April 1996, he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow for a term of three years.

The narration of &quot;The Man Who Called Himself Jesus&quot;, from Strawbs&#x27; 1969 eponymous first album, was performed by Wilson.

Wilson&#x27;s biography, &quot;One Foot on the Stage: The Biography of Richard Wilson&quot;, was written by James Roose-Evans.

In March 2011, Wilson presented an edition of the Channel 4 current affairs programme &quot;Dispatches&quot; entitled &quot;Train Journeys From Hell&quot;, with transport journalist Christian Wolmar highlighting the failings of the British railway network.

==Personal life and political views==
Wilson has lived in London since 1959.

Wilson has been a campaigner for gay rights for many years. He appeared at charity events organised by gay rights campaign group Stonewall, but had not discussed his own sexuality in interviews with the media. He was named in a list of influential gay people in 2013 by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, which he considered to have outed him.

Wilson is a supporter of his local football club, Greenock Morton, but he has come to lend greater support to English club Manchester United. He is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust. Wilson is a good friend of his &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; co-star Angus Deayton, and is godfather to Deayton&#x27;s son.

Wilson is one of the patrons of Scottish Youth Theatre. Wilson is also a long-time supporter of the charity Sense and in 2007 hosted their annual award ceremony. He is also one of the honorary patrons of the London children&#x27;s charity, Scene &amp; Heard. He has been Honorary President of the Scottish Community Drama Association (SCDA) since 1998.

Wilson is a supporter of the Labour Party. He donated more than £5,000 to the party in 1997 and recorded the party&#x27;s manifesto on audio for the 2010 general election.

It was reported on 12 August 2016 that Wilson had suffered a heart attack. He had been due to reprise the role of Victor Meldrew in a one-man show at the 2016 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

In June 2021 Wilson was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His choices included &quot;Hammond Song&quot; by The Roches, &quot;Symphony No. 6 in D minor&quot; by Sibelius and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; performed by Roberta Flack. His book choice was the poetry of Robert Burns and his luxury item was a subscription to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Wilson had one older sister, Moira, who died in 2021 aged 91.

<text>I. G. Farbenindustrie AG, commonly known as IG Farben, was a German chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. It was formed in 1925 from a merger of six chemical companies: Agfa, BASF, Bayer, , Hoechst, and Weiler-ter-Meer. It was seized by the Allies after World War II and split into its constituent companies; parts in East Germany were nationalized.

IG Farben was once the largest company in Europe and the largest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world. IG Farben scientists made fundamental contributions to all areas of chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Otto Bayer discovered the polyaddition for the synthesis of polyurethane in 1937, and three company scientists became Nobel laureates: Carl Bosch and Friedrich Bergius in 1931 &quot;for their contributions to the invention and development of chemical high pressure methods&quot;, and Gerhard Domagk in 1939 &quot;for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil&quot;.

In the 1920s, the company had ties to the liberal nationalist German People&#x27;s Party and was accused by the Nazis of being an &quot;international capitalist Jewish company&quot;. A decade later, it was a Nazi Party donor and, after the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933, a major government contractor, providing significant material for the German war effort. Throughout that decade it purged itself of its Jewish employees; the remainder left in 1938. Described as &quot;the most notorious German industrial concern during the Third Reich&quot;, in the 1940s the company relied on slave labour from concentration camps, including 30,000 from Auschwitz, and was involved in medical experiments on inmates at both Auschwitz and Mauthausen. One of its subsidiaries supplied the poison gas Zyklon B, which killed over one million people in gas chambers during the Holocaust.

The Allies seized the company at the end of the war in 1945 and the US authorities put its directors on trial. Held from 1947 to 1948 as one of the subsequent Nuremberg trials, the IG Farben trial saw 23 IG Farben directors tried for war crimes and 13 convicted. However, by 1951 all of them were released from prison early after the U.S. military instituted good time credits in its war crime program. What remained of IG Farben in the West was split in 1951 into its six constituent companies, then again into three: BASF, Bayer, and Hoechst. These companies continued to operate as an informal cartel and played a major role in the West German &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;. Following several later mergers the main successor companies are Agfa, BASF, Bayer and Sanofi. In 2004, the University of Frankfurt, housed in the former IG Farben head office, set up a permanent exhibition on campus, the Norbert Wollheim memorial, for the slave labourers and those killed by Zyklon B.

==Early history==
===Background===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes. Three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, produced several hundred different dyes. Five smaller firms, Agfa, Cassella, , Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron and Chemische Fabrik vorm. Weiler-ter Meer, concentrated on high-quality specialty dyes. In 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials, and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals. Contrary to other industries, the founders and their families had little influence on the top-level decision-making of the leading German chemical firms, which was in the hands of professional salaried managers. Because of this unique situation, the economic historian Alfred Chandler called the German dye companies &quot;the world&#x27;s first truly managerial industrial enterprises&quot;.
With the world market for synthetic dyes and other chemical products dominated by the German industry, German firms competed vigorously for market shares. Although cartels were attempted, they lasted at most for a few years. Others argued for the formation of a profit pool or &quot;Interessen-Gemeinschaft&quot; (abbr. IG, lit. &quot;community of interest&quot;). In contrast, the chairman of Bayer, Carl Duisberg, argued for a merger. During a trip to the United States in the spring of 1903, he had visited several of the large American trusts such as Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, International Paper and Alcoa. In 1904, after returning to Germany, he proposed a nationwide merger of the producers of dye and pharmaceuticals in a memorandum to Gustav von Brüning, the senior manager at Hoechst.

Hoechst and several pharmaceutical firms refused to join. Instead, Hoechst and Cassella made an alliance based on mutual equity stakes in 1904. This prompted Duisberg and Heinrich von Brunck, chairman of BASF, to accelerate their negotiations. In October 1904 an &quot;Interessen-Gemeinschaft&quot; between Bayer, BASF and Agfa was formed, also known as the &quot;Dreibund&quot; or little IG. Profits of the three firms were pooled, with BASF and Bayer getting 43 percent each and Agfa 14 percent of all profits. The two alliances were loosely connected with each other through an agreement between BASF and Hoechst to jointly exploit the patent on the Heumann-Pfleger indigo synthesis.

Within the &quot;Dreibund&quot;, Bayer and BASF concentrated on dye, while Agfa increasingly concentrated on photographic film. Although there was some cooperation between the technical staff in production and accounting, there was little cooperation between the firms in other areas. Neither were production or distribution facilities consolidated nor did the commercial staff cooperate. In 1908 Hoechst and Cassella acquired 88 percent of the shares of Chemische Fabrik Kalle. As Hoechst, Cassella and Kalle were connected by mutual equity shares and were located close to each other in the Frankfurt area, this allowed them to cooperate more successfully than the &quot;Dreibund&quot;, although they also did not rationalize or consolidate their production facilities.

===Foundation===

IG Farben was founded in December 1925 as a merger of six companies: BASF (27.4 percent of equity capital); Bayer (27.4 percent); Hoechst, including Cassella and Chemische Fabrik Kalle (27.4 percent); Agfa (9 percent); Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron (6.9 percent); and Chemische Fabrik vorm. Weiler Ter Meer (1.9 percent). The supervisory board members became widely known as, and were said to call themselves jokingly, the &quot;Council of Gods&quot; (&quot;Rat der Götter&quot;). The designation was used as the title of an East German film, &quot;The Council of the Gods&quot; (1950).
In 1926, IG Farben had a market capitalization of (equivalent to billion euros) and a workforce of 100,000, of which 2.6 percent were university educated, 18.2 percent were salaried professionals and 79.2 percent were workers. BASF was the nominal survivor; all shares were exchanged for BASF shares. Similar mergers took place in other countries. In the United Kingdom Brunner Mond, Nobel Industries, United Alkali Company and British Dyestuffs merged to form Imperial Chemical Industries in September 1926. In France Établissements Poulenc Frères and Société Chimique des Usines du Rhône merged to form Rhône-Poulenc in 1928. The IG Farben Building, headquarters for the conglomerate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was completed in 1931. In 1938, the company had 218,090 employees.
IG Farben was controversial on both the far left and far right, partly for the same reasons, related to the size and international nature of the conglomerate and the Jewish background of several of its key leaders and major shareholders . Far-right newspapers of the 1920s and early 1930s, accused it of being an &quot;international capitalist Jewish company&quot;. The liberal and business-friendly German People&#x27;s Party was its most pronounced supporter. Not a single member of the management of IG Farben before 1933 supported the Nazi Party; four members, or a third, of the IG Farben supervisory board were themselves Jewish.

Throughout the 1930s, the company underwent a process of Aryanization, and the company ended up being the &quot;largest single contribution&quot; to the successful Nazi election campaign of 1933; there is also evidence of &quot;secret contributions&quot; to the party in 1931 and 1932.
By 1938 the Jews on the board had resigned and the remaining Jewish employees had been dismissed after Hermann Göring issued a decree, as part of the Nazis&#x27; Four Year Plan (announced in 1936), that the German government would make foreign exchange available to German firms to fund construction or purchases overseas only if certain conditions were met, which included making sure the company employed no Jews.

===Products===

IG Farben&#x27;s products included synthetic dyes, nitrile rubber, polyurethane, prontosil, and chloroquine. The nerve agent Sarin was first discovered by IG Farben. The company is perhaps best known for its role in producing the poison gas Zyklon B. One product crucial to the operations of the Wehrmacht was synthetic fuel, made from lignite using the coal liquefaction process.

IG Farben scientists made fundamental contributions to all areas of chemistry. Otto Bayer discovered the polyaddition for the synthesis of polyurethane in 1937. Several IG Farben scientists were awarded a Nobel Prize. Carl Bosch and Friedrich Bergius were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931 &quot;in recognition of their contributions to the invention and development of chemical high pressure methods&quot;. Gerhard Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939 &quot;for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil&quot;.

==World War II and the Holocaust==
===Growth and slave labour===
IG Farben has been described as &quot;the most notorious German industrial concern during the Third Reich&quot;. When World War II began, it was the fourth largest corporation in the world and the largest in Europe. In February 1941, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler signed an order supporting the construction of an IG Farben Buna-N (synthetic rubber) plant—known as Monowitz Buna Werke (or Buna)—near the Monowitz concentration camp, part of the Auschwitz concentration camp complex in German-occupied Poland. (Monowitz came to be known as Auschwitz III; Auschwitz I was the administrative centre and Auschwitz II-Birkenau the extermination camp.) The IG Farben plant&#x27;s workforce consisted of slave labour from Auschwitz, leased to the company by the SS for a low daily rate. One of IG Farben&#x27;s subsidiaries supplied the poison gas, Zyklon B, that killed over one million people in gas chambers.

Company executives said after the war that they had not known what was happening inside the camps. According to the historian Peter Hayes, &quot;the killings were an open secret within Farben, and people worked at not reflecting upon what they knew.&quot;

In 1978, Joseph Borkin, who investigated the company as a United States Justice Department lawyer, quoted an American report: &quot;Without I.G.&#x27;s immense productive facilities, its far-reaching research, varied technical expertise and overall concentration of economic power, Germany would not have been in a position to start its aggressive war in September 1939.&quot; The company placed its resources, technical capabilities and overseas contacts at the German government&#x27;s disposal. The minutes of a meeting of the Commercial Committee on 10 September 1937 noted:

This message was repeated by Wilhelm Rudolf Mann, who chaired a meeting of the Bayer division board of directors on 16 February 1938, and who in an earlier meeting had referred to the &quot;miracle of the birth of the German nation&quot;: &quot;The chairman points out our incontestable being in line with the National Socialist attitude in the association of the entire &#x27;Bayer&#x27; pharmaceutica and insecticides; beyond that, he requests the heads of the offices abroad to regard it as their self-evident duty to collaborate in a fine and understanding manner with the functionaries of the Party, with the DAF (German Workers&#x27; Front), et cetera. Orders to that effect again are to be given to the leading German gentlemen so that there may be no misunderstanding in their execution.&quot;

By 1943, IG Farben was manufacturing products worth three billion marks in 334 facilities in occupied Europe; almost half its workforce of 330,000 men and women consisted of slave labour or conscripts, including 30,000 Auschwitz prisoners. Altogether its annual net profit was around (equivalent to billion euros). In 1945, according to Raymond G. Stokes, it manufactured all the synthetic rubber and methanol in Germany, 90 percent of its plastic and &quot;organic intermediates&quot;, 84 percent of its explosives, 75 percent of its nitrogen and solvents, around 50 percent of its pharmaceuticals, and around 33 percent of its synthetic fuel.

===Medical experiments===
Staff of the Bayer group at IG Farben conducted medical experiments on concentration-camp inmates at Auschwitz and at the Mauthausen concentration camp. 
At Auschwitz they were led by Bayer employee Helmuth Vetter, an Auschwitz camp physician and SS captain, and Auschwitz physicians Friedrich Entress and Eduard Wirths. Most of the experiments were conducted in Birkenau in Block 20, the women&#x27;s camp hospital. The patients were suffering from, and in many cases had been deliberately infected with, typhoid, tuberculosis, diphtheria and other diseases, then were given preparations named Rutenol, Periston, B-1012, B-1034, B-1036, 3582 and P-111. According to prisoner-physicians who witnessed the experiments, after being given the drugs the women would experience circulation problems, bloody vomiting, and painful diarrhea &quot;containing fragments of mucus membrane&quot;. Of the 50 typhoid sufferers given 3852, 15 died; 40 of the 75 tuberculosis patients given Rutenol died.

For one experiment, which tested an anaesthetic, Bayer had 150 women sent from Auschwitz to its own facility. They paid RM 150 per woman, all of whom died as a result of the research; the camp had asked for RM 200 per person, but Bayer had said that was too high. A Bayer employee wrote to Rudolf Höss, the Auschwitz commandant: &quot;The transport of 150 women arrived in good condition. However, we were unable to obtain conclusive results because they died during the experiments. We would kindly request that you send us another group of women to the same number and at the same price.&quot;

===Zyklon B===
Between 1942 and 1945, a cyanide-based pesticide, Zyklon B, was used to kill over one million people, mostly Jews, in gas chambers in Europe, including in the Auschwitz II and Majdanek extermination camps in German-occupied Poland. The poison gas was supplied by an IG Farben subsidiary, Degesch (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung MbH, or German Company for Pest Control). Degesch originally supplied the gas to Auschwitz to fumigate clothing that was infested with lice, which carried typhus. Fumigation took place within a closed room, but it was a slow process, so Degesch recommended building small gas chambers, which heated the gas to over 30 °C and killed the lice within one hour. The idea was that the inmates would be shaved and showered while their clothes were being fumigated. The gas was first used on human beings in Auschwitz (650 Soviet POWs and 200 others) in September 1941.

Peter Hayes compiled the following table showing the increase in Zyklon B ordered by Auschwitz (figures with an asterisk are incomplete). One ton of Zyklon B was enough to kill around 312,500 people.

Several IG Farben executives said after the war that they did not know about the gassings, despite the increase in sales of Zyklon B to Auschwitz. IG Farben owned 42.5 percent of Degesch shares, and three members of Degesch&#x27;s 11-person executive board, Wilhelm Rudolf Mann, Heinrich Hörlein and Carl Wurster, were directors of IG Farben. Mann, who had been an SA-Sturmführer, was the chair of Degesch&#x27;s board. Peter Hayes writes that the board did not meet after 1940, and that although Mann &quot;continued to review the monthly sales figures for Degesch, he could not necessarily have inferred from them the uses to which the Auschwitz camp was putting the product&quot;. IG Farben executives did visit Auschwitz but not Auschwitz II-Birkenau, where the gas chambers were located.

Other IG Farben staff appear to have known. Ernst Struss, secretary of the IG Farben&#x27;s managing board, testified after the war that the company&#x27;s chief engineer at Auschwitz had told him about the gassings. The general manager of Degesch is said to have learned about the gassings from Kurt Gerstein of the SS. According to the post-war testimony of Rudolf Höss, the Auschwitz commandant, he was asked by , technical manager of the IG Farben Auschwitz plant, whether it was true that Jews were being cremated at Auschwitz. Höss replied that he could not discuss it and thereafter assumed that Dürrfeld knew. Dürrfeld, a friend of Höss, denied knowing about it.

Hayes writes that the inmates of Auschwitz III, which supplied the slave labour for IG Farben, were well aware of the gas chambers, in part because of the stench from the Auschwitz II crematoria, and in part because IG Farben supervisors in the camp spoke about the gassings, including using the threat of them to make the inmates work harder. Charles Coward, a British POW who had been held at Auschwitz III, told the IG Farben trial:

Mann, Hörlein and Wurster (directors of both IG Farben and Degesch) were acquitted at the IG Farben trial in 1948 of having supplied Zyklon B for the purpose of mass extermination. The judges ruled that the prosecution had not shown that the defendants or executive board &quot;had any persuasive influence on the management policies of Degesch or any significant knowledge as to the uses to which its production was being put&quot;. In 1949, Mann became head of pharmaceutical sales at Bayer. Hörlein became chair of Bayer&#x27;s supervisory board. Wurster became chair of the IG Farben board, helped to reestablish BASF as a separate company, and became an honorary professor at the University of Heidelberg. Dürrfeld was sentenced to eight years, but had his sentence commuted to time served in 1951 by John McCloy, the US High Commissioner for Germany, under massive political pressure, after which he joined the management or supervisory boards of several chemical companies.

===Seizure by the Allies===
The company destroyed most of its records as it became clear that Germany was losing the war. In September 1944, Fritz ter Meer, a member of IG Farben&#x27;s supervisory board and future chair of Bayer&#x27;s board of directors, and Ernst Struss, secretary of the company&#x27;s managing board, are said to have made plans to destroy company files in Frankfurt in the event of an American invasion. As the Red Army approached Auschwitz in January 1945 to liberate it, IG Farben reportedly destroyed the company&#x27;s records inside the camp, and in the spring of 1945, the company burned and shredded 15 tons of paperwork in Frankfurt.

The Americans seized the company&#x27;s property under &quot;General Order No. 2 pursuant to Military Government Law No. 52&quot;, 2 July 1945, which allowed the US to disperse &quot;ownership and control of such of the plants and equipment seized under this order as have not been transferred or destroyed&quot;. The French followed suit in the areas they controlled. On 30 November 1945, Allied Control Council Law No. 9, &quot;Seizure of Property owned by I.G. Farbenindustrie and the Control Thereof&quot;, formalized the seizure for &quot;knowingly and prominently ... building up and maintaining German war potential&quot;. The division of property followed the division of Germany into four zones: American, British, French and Soviet.

In the Western occupation zone, the idea of destroying the company was abandoned as the policy of denazification evolved, in part because of a need for industry to support reconstruction, and in part because of the company&#x27;s entanglement with American companies, notably the successors of Standard Oil. In 1951, the company was split into its original constituent companies. The four largest quickly bought the smaller ones. In January 1955, the Allied High Commission issued the I.G. Liquidation Conclusion Law, naming IG Farben&#x27;s legal successor as &quot;IG Farbenindustrie AG in Abwicklung&quot; (IGiA) (&quot;I.G. Farbenindustrie AG in Liquidation).

===IG Farben trial===

In 1947, the American government put IG Farben&#x27;s directors on trial. &quot;The United States of America vs. Carl Krauch, et al.&quot; (1947–1948), also known as the IG Farben trial, was the sixth of 12 trials for war crimes the US authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany (Nuremberg) against leading industrialists of Nazi Germany. There were five counts against the IG Farben directors:


Of the 24 defendants arraigned, one fell ill and his case was discontinued. The indictment was filed on 3 May 1947; the trial lasted from 27 August 1947 until 30 July 1948. The judges were Curtis Grover Shake (presiding), James Morris, Paul M. Hebert, and Clarence F. Merrell as an alternate judge. Telford Taylor was the chief counsel for the prosecution. Thirteen defendants were found guilty, with sentences ranging from 18 months to eight years. All were cleared of the first count of waging war. The heaviest sentences went to those involved with Auschwitz, which was IG Farben&#x27;s Upper Rhine group. Ambros, Bütefisch, Dürrfeld, Krauch and ter Meer were convicted of &quot;participating in ... enslavement and deportation for slave labor&quot;.

All defendants who were sentenced to prison received early release. Most were quickly restored to their directorships and other positions in post-war companies, and some were awarded the Federal Cross of Merit. Those who served prison sentences included:

Those acquitted included:

==Liquidation==
Agfa, BASF and Bayer remained in business; Hoechst spun off its chemical business in 1999 as Celanese AG before merging with Rhône-Poulenc to form Aventis, which later merged with Sanofi-Synthélabo to form Sanofi. Two years earlier, another part of Hoechst was sold in 1997 to the chemical spin-off of Sandoz, the Muttenz (Switzerland) based Clariant. The successor companies remain some of the world&#x27;s largest chemical and pharmaceutical companies.

Although IG Farben was officially put into liquidation in 1952, this did not end the company&#x27;s legal existence. The purpose of a corporation&#x27;s continuing existence, being &quot;in liquidation&quot;, is to ensure an orderly wind-down of its affairs. As almost all its assets and all its activities had been transferred to the original constituent companies, IG Farben was from 1952, largely a shell company with no real activity.
In 2001, IG Farben announced that it would formally wind up its affairs in 2003. It had been continually criticized over the years for failing to pay compensation to the former labourers; its stated reason for its continued existence after 1952 was to administer its claims and pay its debts. The company, in turn, blamed ongoing legal disputes with the former captive labourers for its inability to be legally dissolved and have the remaining assets distributed as reparations.

On 10 November 2003, its liquidators filed for insolvency, but this did not affect the existence of the company as a legal entity. While it did not join a national compensation fund set up in 2001 to pay the victims, it contributed 500,000 DM (£160,000 stg or €255,646) towards a foundation for former captive labourers under the Nazi regime. The remaining property, worth DM 21 million (£6.7 million or €10.7 million), went to a buyer. Each year, the company&#x27;s annual meeting in Frankfurt was the site of demonstrations by hundreds of protesters. Its stock (denominated in Reichsmarks) traded on German markets until early 2012. , it still existed as a corporation in liquidation.

<text>Eastern philosophy (also called Asian philosophy or Oriental philosophy) includes the various philosophies that originated in East and South Asia, including Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophy, Korean philosophy, and Vietnamese philosophy, which are dominant in East Asia; and Indian philosophy (including Hindu philosophy, Jain philosophy, Buddhist philosophy), which are dominant in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tibet, Japan and Mongolia.

==Indian philosophy==

Indian philosophy refers to ancient philosophical traditions (; &#x27;world views&#x27;, &#x27;teachings&#x27;) of the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism may have roots dating back to the times of the Indus Valley civilization. The major orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the Common Era and the Gupta Empire. These Hindu schools developed what has been called the &quot;Hindu synthesis&quot; merging orthodox Brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism. Hindu thought also spread east to the Indonesian Srivijaya empire and the Cambodian Khmer Empire. These religio-philosophical traditions were later grouped under the label Hinduism. Hinduism is the dominant religion, or way of life, in South Asia. It includes Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism among numerous other traditions, and a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of &quot;daily morality&quot; based on karma, dharma, and societal norms. Hinduism is a categorization of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid, common set of beliefs. Hinduism, with about one billion followers is the world&#x27;s third-largest religion, after Christianity and Islam. Hinduism has been called the &quot;oldest religion&quot; in the world and is traditionally called &quot;&quot;, &quot;the eternal law&quot; or the &quot;eternal way&quot;; beyond human origins. Western scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.

Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE). Important Indian philosophical concepts include dharma, karma, samsara, moksha, and ahimsa. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic and investigated topics such as Ontology (metaphysics, Brahman-Atman, Sunyata-Anatta), reliable means of knowledge (epistemology, Pramanas), value system (axiology) and other topics. Indian philosophy also covered topics such as political philosophy as seen in the Arthashastra c. 4th century BCE and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra. The Kural literature of the post-Sangam period between c. 1st century BCE and 5th century CE, written by the Tamil poet-philosopher Valluvar, is believed by many scholars to be based on Jain or Hindu philosophies.

Later developments include the development of Tantra and Iranian-Islamic influences. Buddhism mostly disappeared from India after the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent, surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India. The early modern period saw the flourishing of Navya-Nyāya (the &#x27;new reason&#x27;) under philosophers such as Raghunatha Siromani (c. 1460–1540) who founded the tradition, Jayarama Pancanana, Mahadeva Punatamakara and Yashovijaya (who formulated a Jain response).

===Orthodox schools===
The principal Indian philosophical schools are classified as either orthodox or heterodox – āstika or nāstika – depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the Vedas are a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of Brahman and Atman; and whether the school believes in afterlife and Devas.

There are six major schools of orthodox Indian Hindu philosophy—Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta, and five major heterodox schools—Jain, Buddhist, Ajivika, Ajñana, and Cārvāka. However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyaranya for instance identifies sixteen schools of Hindu Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the Śaiva and Raseśvara traditions.

Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive epistemological literature called &quot;Pramana-sastras&quot;.

In Hindu history, the distinction of the six orthodox schools was current in the Gupta period &quot;golden age&quot; of Hinduism. With the disappearance of Vaisheshika and Mīmāṃsā, it became obsolete by the later Middle Ages, when the various sub-schools of Vedanta (Dvaita &quot;dualism&quot;, Advaita Vedanta &quot;non-dualism&quot; and others) began to rise to prominence as the main divisions of religious philosophy. Nyaya survived into the 17th century as &quot;Navya Nyaya&quot; &quot;Neo-Nyaya&quot;, while Samkhya gradually lost its status as an independent school, its tenets absorbed into Yoga and Vedanta.

====Sāmkhya and Yoga====
Sāmkhya is a dualist philosophical tradition based on the Samkhyakarika (c. 320–540 CE), while the Yoga school was a closely related tradition emphasizing meditation and liberation whose major text is the Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE). Elements of proto-Samkhya ideas can, however, be traced back to the period of the early Upanishads. One of the main differences between the two closely related schools was that Yoga allowed for the existence of a God, while most Sāmkhya thinkers criticized this idea.

Sāmkhya epistemology accepts three of six pramanas (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge; &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;anumāṇa&quot; (inference) and &quot;śabda&quot; (word/testimony of reliable sources). The school developed a complex theoretical exposition of the evolution of consciousness and matter. Sāmkhya sources argue that the universe consists of two realities, puruṣa (consciousness) and prakṛti (matter).

As shown by the &quot;Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra&quot; (c. 14th century CE), Sāmkhya continued to develop throughout the medieval period.

====Nyāya====
The Nyāya school of epistemology explores sources of knowledge (&quot;Pramāṇa&quot;) and is based on the &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot; (circa 6th century BCE and 2nd century CE). Nyāya holds that human suffering arises out of ignorance and liberation arises through correct knowledge. Therefore, they sought to investigate the sources of correct knowledge or epistemology.

Nyāya traditionally accepts four &quot;Pramanas&quot; as reliable means of gaining knowledge – &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;Anumāṇa&quot; (inference), &quot;Upamāṇa&quot; (comparison and analogy) and &quot;Śabda&quot; (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). Nyāya also traditionally defended a form of philosophical realism.

The &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot; was a very influential text in Indian philosophy, laying the foundations for classical Indian epistemological debates between the different philosophical schools. It includes, for example, the classic Hindu rejoinders against Buddhist not-self (anatta) arguments. The work also famously argues against a creator God (Ishvara), a debate which became central to Hinduism in the medieval period.

====Vaiśeṣika====
Vaiśeṣika is a naturalist school of atomism, which accepts only two sources of knowledge, perception, and inference. This philosophy held that the universe was reducible to &quot;paramāṇu&quot; (atoms), which are indestructible (&quot;anitya&quot;), indivisible, and have a special kind of dimension, called &quot;small&quot; (&quot;aṇu&quot;). Whatever we experience is a composite of these atoms.

Vaiśeṣika organized all objects of experience into what they called &quot;padārtha&quot;s (literally: &#x27;the meaning of a word&#x27;) which included six categories; &quot;dravya&quot; (substance), &quot;guṇa&quot; (quality), &quot;karma&quot; (activity), &quot;sāmānya&quot; (generality), &quot;viśeṣa&quot; (particularity) and &quot;samavāya&quot; (inherence). Later &quot;Vaiśeṣika&quot;s (&quot;Śrīdhara&quot; and Udayana and &quot;Śivāditya&quot;) added one more category &quot;abhava&quot; (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as &quot;artha&quot; (which can be perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as &quot;budhyapekṣam&quot; (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.

====Mīmāṃsā====
Mīmāṃsā is a school of ritual orthopraxy and is known for its hermeneutical study and interpretation of the Vedas. For this tradition, the study of &quot;dharma&quot; as ritual and social duty was paramount. They also held that the Vedas were &quot;eternal, authorless, [and] infallible&quot; and that Vedic injunctions and mantras in rituals are prescriptive actions of primary importance. Because of their focus on textual study and interpretation, Mīmāṃsā also developed theories of philology and the philosophy of language which influenced other Indian schools. They primarily held that the purpose of language was to correctly &quot;prescribe&quot; proper actions, rituals, and correct dharma (duty or virtue). Mīmāṃsā is also mainly atheistic, holding that the evidence for the existence of God is insufficient and that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the names, mantras and their power.

A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the Mīmāṃsā Sūtra of Jaimini and major Mīmāṃsā scholars include Prabhākara (c. 7th century) and Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (fl. roughly 700). The Mīmāṃsā school strongly influenced Vedānta, which was also known as &quot;Uttara-Mīmāṃsā&quot;; however, while Mīmāṃsā emphasized &quot;karmakāṇḍa&quot;, or the study of ritual actions, using the four early Vedas, the Vedānta schools emphasized &quot;jñanakāṇḍa&quot;, the study of knowledge, using the later parts of Vedas like the Upaniṣads.

====Vedānta====

Vedānta (meaning &quot;end of the Vedas&quot;) or &quot;Uttara-Mīmāṃsā&quot;, are a group of traditions which focus on the philosophical issues found in the Prasthanatrayi (the three sources), which are the &quot;Principal Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita.&quot; Vedānta sees the Vedas, particularly the Upanishads, as a reliable source of knowledge.

The central concern for these schools is the nature of and the relationship between &quot;Brahman&quot; (ultimate reality, universal consciousness), &quot;Ātman&quot; (individual soul) and &quot;Prakriti&quot; (empirical world).

The sub-traditions of Vedānta include Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Dvaita (dualism), and Bhedabheda (difference and non-difference). Due to the popularity of the bhakti movement, Vedānta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period.

====Other====
While the classical enumeration of Indian philosophies lists six orthodox schools, there are other schools that are sometimes seen as orthodox. These include:
* Paśupata, an ascetic school of Shaivism founded by Lakulisha (≈2nd century CE).
* Śaiva Siddhānta, a school of dualistic Shaivism which was strongly influenced by Samkhya.
* Pratyabhijña (recognition) school of Utpaladeva (10th century) and Abhinavagupta (975–1025 CE), a form of non-dual Shaiva tantra.
* Raseśvara, the mercurial school
* Pāṇini Darśana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of Sphoṭa)

===Heterodox or Śramaṇic schools===

The nāstika or heterodox schools are associated with the non-Vedic Śramaṇic traditions that existed in India since before the 6th century BCE. The Śramaṇa movement gave rise to a diverse range of non-Vedic ideas, ranging from accepting or denying the concepts of atman, atomism, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, extreme asceticism, strict ahimsa (non-violence) and vegetarianism. Notable philosophies that arose from Śramaṇic movement were Jainism, early Buddhism, Cārvāka, Ajñana, and Ājīvika.

====Jain philosophy====
Jain philosophy deals extensively with the problems of metaphysics, reality, cosmology, ontology, epistemology, and divinity. Jainism is essentially a transtheistic religion of ancient India. It continues the ancient  tradition, which co-existed with the Vedic tradition since ancient times. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy include a mind-body dualism, denial of a creative and omnipotent God, karma, an eternal and uncreated universe, non-violence, the theory of the multiple facets of truth, and morality based on liberation of the soul. Jain philosophy attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of the bondage and the means to achieve liberation.
It has often been described as an ascetic movement for its strong emphasis on self-control, austerities, and renunciation. It has also been called a model of philosophical liberalism for its insistence that truth is relative and multifaceted and for its willingness to accommodate all possible view-points of the rival philosophies. Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of the soul and personal responsibility for one&#x27;s decisions, and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one&#x27;s liberation.

The contribution of the Jains in the development of Indian philosophy has been significant. Jain philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Moksa, Samsara, and the like are common with other Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism in various forms. While Jainism traces its philosophy from teachings of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras, various Jain philosophers from Kundakunda and Umasvati in ancient times to Yasovijaya and Shrimad Rajchandra in recent times have contributed to Indian philosophical discourse in uniquely Jain ways.

====Cārvāka====
Cārvāka or Lokāyata was an atheistic philosophy of scepticism and materialism, who rejected the Vedas and all associated supernatural doctrines. Cārvāka philosophers like Brihaspati were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Cārvāka deemed the Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology. They declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies invented by humans whose only usefulness was to provide a livelihood to priests.

Likewise, they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of liberation, reincarnation, and accumulation of merit or demerit through karma. They believed the viewpoint of relinquishing pleasure to avoid pain was the &quot;reasoning of fools&quot;. Cārvāka epistemology holds perception as the primary source of knowledge while rejecting inference which can be invalid. The primary texts of Cārvāka, like the Barhaspatya sutras (c. 600 BCE) have been lost.

====Ājīvika====
Ājīvika was founded by Makkhali Gosala, it was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism.

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Hindu Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas. The Ājīvika school is known for its &quot;Niyati&quot; doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvika considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an &quot;ātman&quot; – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.

====Ajñana====
Ajñana was a Śramaṇa school of radical Indian skepticism and a rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were seen as sophists who specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own. Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (fl. c. 800), the author of the skeptical work entitled &quot;Tattvopaplavasiṃha&quot; (&quot;The Lion that Devours All Categories&quot;/&quot;The Upsetting of All Principles&quot;), has been seen as an important Ajñana philosopher.

===Buddhist philosophies===


Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the early Buddhist texts. It generally refers to the philosophical investigations that developed among various Buddhist schools in India and later spread throughout Asia through the Silk Road. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. It is the dominant philosophical tradition in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka and Burma.

Buddhism&#x27;s main concern is soteriological, defined as freedom from dukkha (unease). Because ignorance of the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering, Buddhist thinkers concerned themselves with philosophical questions related to epistemology and the use of reason. Key Buddhist concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Anatta (not-self) a critique of a fixed personal identity, the transience of all things (Anicca), and a certain skepticism about metaphysical questions. Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in East Asia have covered topics as varied as phenomenology, ethics, ontology, epistemology, logic, and philosophy of time.

Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed &#x27;Abhidharma&#x27;. Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of Shunyata (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism. The Dignāga (c. 480–540) school of Pramāṇa promoted a complex form of epistemology and Buddhist logic. This tradition contributed to what has been called an &quot;epistemological turn&quot; in Indian philosophy. Through the work of Dharmakirti, this tradition of Buddhist logic has become the major epistemological system used in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and debate.

After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist, and Theravada Buddhist traditions. In Tibet, the Indian tradition continued to be developed under the work of thinkers like Sakya Pandita, Tsongkhapa, and Ju Mipham. In East Asian Buddhism, new developments were led by East Asian Yogacara thinkers such as Paramartha, Xuanzang, and Wŏnhyo and East Asian Madhyamaka thinkers like Jizang. New sinitic schools also arose, like Tiantai, founded by Zhiyi, Huayan, defended by figures like Fazang, and Zen, which included philosophers like Guifeng Zongmi.

====Buddhist modernism====
The modern period saw the rise of Buddhist modernism and Humanistic Buddhism under Western influences and the development of Western Buddhism with influences from modern psychology and Western philosophy. Important exponents of Buddhist modernism include Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933) and the American convert Henry Steel Olcott, the Chinese modernists Taixu (1890–1947) and Yin Shun (1906–2005), Zen scholar D.T. Suzuki, and the Tibetan Gendün Chöphel (1903–1951). Buddhist modernism refers to &quot;forms of Buddhism that have emerged out of engagement with the dominant cultural and intellectual forces of modernity.&quot; Forces which influenced modernists like Dhammapala and Yin Shun included Enlightenment values and Western science. A Neo-Buddhist movement was founded by the influential Indian Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar in the 1950s who emphasized social and political reform.

Buddhist modernism includes various movements like Humanistic Buddhism, Secular Buddhism, the Vipassana movement, and Engaged Buddhism. Chinese humanistic Buddhism or &quot;Buddhism for Human Life&quot; (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was to be free of supernatural beliefs has also been an influential form of modern Buddhism in Asia.

===Sikh philosophy===

Sikhism is an Indian religion developed by Guru Nanak (1469–1539) in the Punjab region during the Mughal Era. Their main sacred text is the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib.&quot; The fundamental beliefs include constant spiritual meditation of God&#x27;s name, being guided by the Guru instead of yielding to capriciousness, living a householder&#x27;s life instead of monasticism, truthful action to dharma (righteousness, moral duty), equality of all human beings, and believing in God&#x27;s grace. Key concepts include &quot;Simran&quot;, &quot;Seva&quot;, the Three Pillars of Sikhism, and the Five Thieves.

===Modern Indian philosophy===

In response to colonialism and their contact with Western philosophy, 19th-century Indians developed new ways of thinking now termed Neo-Vedanta and Hindu modernism. Their ideas focused on the universality of Indian philosophy (particularly Vedanta) and the unity of different religions. It was during this period that Hindu modernists presented a single idealized and united &quot;Hinduism.&quot; exemplified by the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. They were also influenced by Western ideas. The first of these movements was that of the Brahmo Samaj of Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833). Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) was very influential in developing the Hindu reform movements and in bringing the worldview to the West. Through the work of Indians like Vivekananda as well as westerners such as the proponents of the Theosophical society, modern Hindu thought also influenced western culture.

The political thought of Hindu nationalism is also another important current in modern Indian thought. The work of Mahatma Gandhi, Deendayal Upadhyaya, Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo, Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan has had a large impact on modern Indian philosophy.

Jainism also had its modern interpreters and defenders, such as Virchand Gandhi, Champat Rai Jain, and Shrimad Rajchandra (well known as a spiritual guide of Mahatma Gandhi).

==East Asian philosophies==


===Chinese===
East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the &quot;Hundred Schools of Thought&quot; flourished (6th century to 221 BCE). This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major Chinese philosophical schools (Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism) as well as numerous less influential schools (Mohism, School of Names, School of Yin Yang). These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political, and ethical theories which, along with Chinese Buddhism, had a direct influence on the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere. Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), through a gradual Silk road transmission and gradually developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/Zen).

====Confucianism====
Confucianism (孔教, &quot;Kǒngjiào&quot; — &quot;Confucius&#x27; doctrine&quot;), also known as &quot;Ruism&quot; (&quot;Rújiào&quot; — &quot;doctrine of the scholars&quot;), is a Chinese philosophical system with ritual, moral, and religious applications. The tradition developed around the teachings of Confucius (&quot;Kǒng Fūzǐ&quot;, 孔夫子, &quot;Master Kong&quot;, 551–479 BCE) who saw himself as transmitting the values and theology of the ancestors before him. Other influential classical Confucian philosophers include Mencius and Xun Kuang who famously disagreed on the innate moral nature of humans.

Confucianism focuses on humanistic values like familial and social harmony, filial piety (孝, &quot;xiào&quot;), &quot;Rén&quot; (仁, &quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;humaneness&quot;) and &quot;Lǐ&quot; (禮/礼) which is a system of ritual norms that determines how a person should act to be in harmony with the law of Heaven. Confucianism traditionally holds that these values are based on the transcendent principle known as Heaven (&quot;Tiān&quot; 天), and also includes the belief in spirits or gods (&quot;shén&quot;).

Confucianism was a major ideology of the imperial state during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) and was revived as Neo-Confucianism during the Tang dynasty (618–907). During later Chinese dynasties like Song dynasty (960–1297) and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200) and Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought and was promoted by the imperial state. Beginning in the Song dynasty, Confucian classics were the basis of the imperial exams and became the core philosophy of the scholar-official class. Confucianism suffered setbacks during the 20th century, but is recently undergoing a revival, which is termed New Confucianism.

Traditionally, East Asian cultures and countries in the cultural sphere are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam as well as various overseas territories settled predominantly by Overseas Chinese, such as Singapore.

====Legalism====
Legalism (法家，pinyin: &quot;Fǎjiā;&quot; school of &quot;methods&quot; or &quot;standards&quot;) was a philosophical tradition which focused on laws, realpolitik, and bureaucratic management. Largely ignoring morality or idealized views of how society should be, they focused on the pragmatic government through the power of the autocrat and state. Their goal was to achieve increased order, security, and stability. They were initially influenced by Mohist ideas. A key figure of this school was administrator and political philosopher Shen Buhai (c. 400–337 BCE). Another central figure, Shang Yang (390–338 BCE), was a leading statesman and reformer who transformed the Qin state into the dominant power that conquered the rest of China in 221 BCE. Shen&#x27;s successor Han Fei (c. 280–233 BCE) synthesized the thought of the other Legalists in his eponymous text, the &quot;Han Feizi,&quot; one of the most influential Legalist texts which was used by successive Chinese statesmen and rulers as a guide for statesmanship and bureaucratic organization of the imperial state.

====Mohism====
Mohism (墨家，&quot;Mòjiā&quot;; &quot;School of Mo&quot;), was founded by Mozi (c. 470–391 BCE) and his students. It was a major school of thought and rival of Confucianism and Taoism during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (c. 770–221 BCE). The main text of the school is the &quot;Mozi&quot; (book). The administrative thought of Mohism was later absorbed by Legalism, their ethics absorbed into Confucianism and its books were also merged into the Taoist canon, as Mohism all but disappeared as an independent school after the Qin dynasty era.

Mohism is best known for the idea of &quot;impartial care&quot; (Chinese: 兼愛; pinyin: &quot;jiān ài&quot;; literally: &quot;inclusive love/care&quot;). According to Master Mo, persons should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to them. Mo also advocated impartial meritocracy in government which should be based on talent, not blood relations. Mozi was against Confucian ritualism, instead emphasizing pragmatic survival through farming, fortification, and statecraft. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize the general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the &quot;Will of Heaven&quot;, but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels utilitarianism.

Mohism was also associated with and influenced by a separate philosophical school known as the School of Names (&quot;Míngjiā&quot;; also known as &#x27;Logicians&#x27;), that focused on the philosophy of language, definition, and logic.

====Taoism====
Taoism (or Daoism) is a term for various philosophies and religious systems that emphasize harmony with the &quot;Tao&quot; (Chinese: 道; pinyin: &quot;Dào&quot;; literally: &quot;the Way&quot;) which is seen as the principle which is the source, pattern, and substance of everything that exists. Taoism tends to emphasize virtues such as &quot;wu wei&quot; (effortless action), &quot;ziran&quot; (naturalness), &quot;pu&quot; (simplicity), and spontaneity while placing less emphasis on norms and ritual (as opposed to Confucianism). The attainment of immortality through external alchemy (waidan) and internal alchemy (neidan) was an important goal for many Taoists historically.

Early forms of Taoism developed in the 4th century BCE, influenced by the cosmological theories of the School of Naturalists and the &quot;I Ching.&quot; The School of Naturalists or Yin-yang was another philosophical school that synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements; Zou Yan is considered the founder.

The &quot;Dao De Jing&quot; (&quot;Tao-Te-Ching,&quot; c. 4th century BCE), traditionally attributed to Laozi, and the &quot;Nan Hua Jing&quot; (&quot;Zhuang Zi&quot;) are considered the key texts of the tradition. The first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters&#x27;) school arose in the 2nd century CE. Xuanxue (&quot;deep learning&quot;, also &quot;Neo-Taoism&quot;) was a major philosophical movement influenced by Confucian scholarship, which focused on the interpretation of the &quot;Yijing,&quot; &quot;Daodejing,&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; and which flourished during the third to sixth centuries CE. The most important philosophers of this movement were He Yan, Wang Bi, the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Ge Hong, and Guo Xiang. Thinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi focused on the deep nature of Tao, which they saw as being best exemplified by the term &quot;Wu&quot; (nothingness, non-being, negativity).

Other schools rose to prominence throughout Chinese history, such as the Shangqing school during the Tang dynasty (618–907), the Lingbao school during the Song dynasty (960–1279) and the Quanzhen School which develop during the 13th–14th centuries and during the Yuan dynasty. The later Taoist traditions were also influenced by Chinese Buddhism.

===Modern East Asian philosophy===
====Chinese====
Modern Chinese thought is generally seen as being rooted in Classical Confucianism (&quot;Jingxue&quot;), Neo-Confucianism (&quot;Lixue&quot;), Buddhism, Daoism, and &quot;Xixue&quot; (&quot;Western Learning&quot; which arose during the late Ming dynasty).

The Opium war of 1839–42 saw the beginning of Western and Japanese invasions and exploitation of China which was humiliating to Chinese thinkers. The late 19th and early 20th century saw Chinese thinkers such as Zhang Zhidong looking to Western practical knowledge as a way to preserve traditional Chinese culture, a doctrine that he defined as &quot;Chinese Learning as Substance and Western Learning as Function&quot; (&quot;Zhongti Xiyong&quot;).

The traditionalists meanwhile sought to revive and fortify traditional Chinese philosophical schools. Chinese Buddhist thought was promoted by thinkers like Yang Rensan and Ou-Yang Jingwu while another influential movement is New Confucianism (Chinese: 新儒家; pinyin: &quot;xīn rú jiā&quot;). New Confucianism is a traditionalist revival of Confucian thought in China beginning in the 20th-century Republican China which is also associated with New Conservatism. Key New Confucians of the first generation are Xiong Shili and Fung Youlan. The second generation (1950–1979) include individuals like Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, and Xu Fuguan, all three students of Xiong Shili. Together with Zhang Junmai, the second generation published the New Confucian Manifesto in 1958.

====Japanese====

Modern Japanese thought is strongly influenced by Western science and philosophy. Japan&#x27;s rapid modernization was partly aided by the early study of western science (known as Rangaku) during the Edo period (1603–1868). Another intellectual movement during the Edo period was Kokugaku (national study), which sought to focus on the study of ancient Japanese thought, classic texts, and culture over and against foreign Chinese and Buddhist cultures. A key figure of this movement is Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801), who argued that the essence of classic Japanese literature and culture was a sense called mono no aware (&quot;sorrow at evanescence&quot;).

In the Meiji period (1868–1912), the modernist Meirokusha (Meiji 6, formed in 1874) intellectual society promoted European enlightenment thought. Meirokusha philosophers like Mori Arinori, Nishi Amane, and Fukuzawa Yukichi sought ways to combine Western ideas with Japanese culture and values. The Shōwa period (1926–1989) saw the rise of State Shinto and Japanese nationalism.

Japanese Buddhist philosophy was influenced by the work of the Kyoto School which drew from western philosophers (especially German philosophy) and Buddhist thought and included Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, Hajime Tanabe, and Masao Abe. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is Critical Buddhism, which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as Buddha-nature and original enlightenment.

====North Korean====

Juche, usually translated as &quot;self-reliance&quot;, is the official political ideology of North Korea, described by the regime as Kim Il-Sung&#x27;s &quot;original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought&quot;. The idea states that an individual is &quot;the master of his destiny&quot; and that the North Korean masses are to act as the &quot;masters of the revolution and construction&quot;.

==Syntheses of Eastern and Western philosophy==
===Modern===

In the modern era, there have been many attempts to integrate Western and Eastern philosophical traditions.

Arthur Schopenhauer developed a philosophy that was essentially a synthesis of Hinduism with Western thought. He anticipated that the &quot;Upanishads&quot; (primary Hindu scriptures) would have a much greater influence in the West than they have had. However, Schopenhauer was working with heavily flawed early translations (and sometimes second-degree translations), and many feel that he may not necessarily have accurately grasped the Eastern philosophies which interested him.

Recent attempts to incorporate Western philosophy into Eastern thought include the Kyoto School of philosophers, who combined the phenomenology of Husserl with the insights of Zen Buddhism. Watsuji Tetsurô, a 20th-century Japanese philosopher attempted to combine the works of Søren Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Heidegger with Eastern philosophies. Some have claimed that there is also a definite eastern element within Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy. For the most part, this is not made explicit within Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy, apart from in the dialogue between a Japanese and inquirer. Heidegger did spend time attempting to translate the Tao Te Ching into German, working with his Chinese student Paul Hsaio. It has also been claimed that much of Heidegger&#x27;s later philosophy, particularly the sacredness of Being, bears a distinct similarity to Taoist ideas. There are clear parallels between Heidegger and the work of Kyoto School, and ultimately, it may be read that Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy is an attempt to &#x27;turn eastwards&#x27; in response to the crisis in Western civilization. However, this is only an interpretation.

The 20th-century Hindu guru Sri Aurobindo was influenced by German Idealism and his integral yoga is regarded as a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought. The German phenomenologist Jean Gebser&#x27;s writings on the history of consciousness referred to a new planetary consciousness that would bridge this gap. Followers of these two authors are often grouped together under the term Integral thought.

Following the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 and the end of the Qing dynasty, the May Fourth Movement sought to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China (such as the old civil service system). There were two major philosophical trends during this period. One was anti-traditional and promoted Western learning and ideas. A key figure of this anti-traditional current was Yan Fu (1853–1921) who translated various Western philosophical works including Smith&#x27;s The Wealth of Nations and Mill&#x27;s On Liberty. There were also attempts to incorporate Western ideas of democracy, and republicanism into Chinese political philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-Sen (1866–1925) at the beginning of the 20th century. Another influential modern Chinese philosopher was Hu Shih, who was a student of John Dewey at Columbia University and who promoted a form of pragmatism.

The influence of Marxism on modern Chinese political thought is vast, especially through the work of Mao Zedong, the most famous thinker of Chinese Marxist Philosophy. Maoism is a Chinese Marxist philosophy based on the teachings of the 20th-century Chinese Communist Party revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. It is based partially on earlier theories by Marx and Lenin, but rejects the urban proletariat and Leninist emphasis on heavy industrialization in favor of a revolution supported by the peasantry, and a decentralized agrarian economy based on many collectively worked farms. The current government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China continues to espouse a pragmatic form of socialism as its official party ideology which it calls Socialism with Chinese characteristics. When the Chinese Communist Party took over the reign, previous schools of thought such as Taoism and Confucianism (except Legalism) were denounced as backward, and later purged during the violence of the Cultural Revolution which saw many Taoist and Buddhist temples and institutions destroyed.

Swiss psychologist Carl Jung was deeply influenced by the I Ching (Book of Changes), an ancient Chinese text that dates back to the Bronze Age Shang dynasty (c. 1700–1050 BCE). It uses a system of Yin and Yang, which it places into hexagrams for the purposes of divination. Carl Jung&#x27;s idea of synchronicity moves towards an Oriental view of causality, as he states in the foreword to Richard Wilhelm&#x27;s translation of the I Ching. He explains that this Chinese view of the world is based not on science as the West knows it, but on chance.

==Criticism==
According to the British philosopher Victoria S. Harrison, the category of &quot;Eastern philosophy&quot;, and similarly &quot;Asian philosophy&quot; and &quot;Oriental philosophy&quot; is a product of 19th-century Western scholarship and did not exist in East Asia or India. This is because in Asia there is no single unified philosophical tradition with a single root, but various autonomous traditions that have come into contact with each other over time.

Some Eurocentric thinkers claim that philosophy as such is only characteristic of Western cultures. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger is reported to have said that only Greek and German languages are suitable for philosophizing. It is still commonplace in Western universities to teach only Western philosophy and to ignore Asian philosophy altogether, or consider only newer Western-influenced Asian thought proper &quot;philosophy&quot;. Carine Defoort, herself a specialist in Chinese thought, has offered support for such a &quot;family&quot; view of philosophy, while Rein Raud has presented an argument against it and offered a more flexible definition of philosophy that would include both Western and Asian thought on equal terms. In response, Ouyang Min argues that philosophy proper is a Western cultural practice and essentially different from &quot;zhexue&quot;, which is what the Chinese have, even though &quot;zhexue&quot; (originally &quot;tetsugaku&quot;) is actually a neologism coined in 1873 by Nishi Amane for describing Western philosophy as opposed to traditional Asian thought.

<text>Monster Magnet is an American rock band, founded in Red Bank, New Jersey in 1989 by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar) and Tim Cronin (vocals and drums). The band has since gone through several lineup changes, leaving Wyndorf as the only constant member. Monster Magnet has released eleven studio albums to date, and are best known for their 1990s hits &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead&quot; and &quot;Space Lord&quot;. The band has also been credited for developing and popularizing the stoner rock genre, along with Masters of Reality, Kyuss, Fu Manchu and Sleep.

==History==
=== Beginnings and &quot;Spine of God&quot; (1989–1992) ===
Original names for the band were Dog of Mystery, Airport 75, Triple Bad Acid and King Fuzz before finally settling on Monster Magnet, taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child.

In 1989, Monster Magnet released two demo cassettes: &quot;Forget About Life, I&#x27;m High on Dope&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Stoned, What Ya Gonna Do About It?&quot;. The band&#x27;s first &quot;official&quot; release was a single &quot;Lizard Johnny/Freakshop USA&quot; on Long Island-based Circuit Records. The first demo and single were recorded as a three piece (McBain, bass, Wyndorf, guitar and vocals, Cronin, drums and vocals). Before the second demo Tom Diello joined on drums, McBain and Cronin switched to guitar and bass respectively. Thus the lineup was composed of McBain on guitar, Wyndorf on guitar and vocals, Cronin on bass and vocals, and Diello on drums. The EP &quot;Monster Magnet&quot; followed, on Glitterhouse Records of Germany, containing the songs &quot;Snake Dance&quot; and &quot;Nod Scene&quot;, (both of which would appear again on &quot;Spine of God&quot;), and &quot;Tractor&quot;, (which would be re-recorded later for &quot;Powertrip&quot;).

In 1990, the band signed with Caroline Records and released a single &quot;Murder/Tractor&quot;. Cronin left shortly after; although he would remain in the background, particularly at live shows, contributing to auditory effects, lights, and visuals, for many years. After Cronin&#x27;s departure, Joe Calandra joined on bass. In 1991, Monster Magnet released their first full-length album, &quot;Spine of God&quot;, on the labels Go Get Organized/Atypeek Music, Primo Scree, Glitterhouse Records, Caroline Records. Shortly after, drummer Tom Diello left the band and was replaced by Jon Kleiman. Although it was not a commercial success, &quot;Spine of God&quot; was praised by critics and is hailed as one of the classics of the stoner rock genre, in addition to being considered a major influence on the genre. The album contained the single &quot;Medicine&quot; (which would be re-recorded ten years later on &quot;God Says No&quot;), which was also the band&#x27;s first music video. The band followed with a tour alongside rising grunge band Soundgarden. The tour helped the band get a recording contract with major record label A&amp;M Records.

Their final release with Caroline Records was an EP titled &quot;Tab&quot; which included, among two other marathon-length songs, a 32-minute track called &quot;Tab...&quot;. The &quot;Tab&quot; EP was recorded before &quot;Spine of God&quot;, yet released after it. McBain quit the band soon after and was replaced by Atomic Bitchwax guitarist Ed Mundell.

=== A&amp;M Records-era and popularity (1992–2002) ===
In 1992, Monster Magnet was signed to A&amp;M Records, and their first album on the label, &quot;Superjudge&quot;, was released the following year. Despite being released on a major label, it fared poorly commercially. Like its predecessor, &quot;Superjudge&quot; became an influential release in the stoner rock genre. The songs &quot;Twin Earth&quot; and &quot;Face Down&quot; were released as singles (with accompanying videos), but it did little to help promote the album. In 1995, Monster Magnet released their third studio album, &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;. The album included the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead&quot;, which benefitted from a music video that received regular rotation on MTV. Still, the album was not as successful as the band had hoped.

After touring in support of &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;, Wyndorf moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to begin working on &quot;Powertrip&quot; (1998), a breakthrough hit that finally earned the band a gold record. Guitarist Phil Caivano joined the band in 1998. &quot;Space Lord&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was a major radio hit and the band went on tour with successful bands Aerosmith, Metallica and Rob Zombie. The band also toured as one of the opening acts of the bands Hole and Marilyn Manson on their Beautiful Monsters Tour. Following the well-publicized falling out between the outspoken vocalists of Hole and Marilyn Manson, Monster Magnet continued touring with Manson and opened the first three shows of his Rock is Dead Tour. The songs &quot;Powertrip&quot;, &quot;Temple of Your Dreams&quot;, and &quot;See You In Hell&quot; also received airplay on rock radio stations. The album charted at No. 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and later went multi-platinum.

After a two-year tour supporting &quot;Powertrip&quot;, the band released &quot;God Says No&quot; (2001), charting at No. 153 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. However, it failed to match the commercial success of the band&#x27;s previous release. After the release, Joe Calandra and Jon Kleiman left the band. They would be replaced by Jim Baglino and Michael Wildwood who recorded &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; and, after a short stint, Wildwood was replaced by former Love Among Freaks drummer Bob Pantella, respectively. The band also left A&amp;M Records during this period.

Following the split from A&amp;M Records, Monster Magnet wrote and performed &quot;Live For The Moment&quot;, which was the former entrance theme of WWE wrestler Matt Hardy from 2002 to 2010. The song also appeared on the &quot;WWF Forceable Entry&quot; compilation.

=== &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; and &quot;4-Way Diablo&quot; (2003–2008) ===
In 2003, Monster Magnet released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a double album featuring their best songs, some rarities, and music videos from their time with A&amp;M. They then signed to the European label SPV, and in early 2004 released &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; throughout Europe. The US release followed in May on SPV America. The band had a minor hit with the song &quot;Unbroken (Hotel Baby)&quot;.

In March 2005, Caivano departed after seven years service in a split described as amicable by Wyndorf. A followup to &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; was expected in March 2006, to coincide with their European tour, along with re-releases of &quot;Spine of God&quot; and &quot;Tab&quot;, both featuring new artwork and liner notes; however the tour and album releases failed to materialize.

On February 27, 2006, Dave Wyndorf overdosed on prescription drugs and was hospitalized.

In 2007, it was announced that Monster Magnet would release a new album, &quot;4-Way Diablo&quot;, which had been put back for a year because of Wyndorf&#x27;s overdose. It was released later that year. Later in 2007, another greatest hits collection, &quot;20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection: The Best of Monster Magnet&quot;, was released. &quot;Powertrip&quot; was used as the official theme song for the WWE pay-per-view event No Way Out 2007.

Prior to Monster Magnet&#x27;s 2008 European tour, Caivano returned to the band.

===&quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Last Patrol&quot; and &quot;Mindfucker&quot; (2009–2019)===
On November 24, 2009, it was announced that Monster Magnet had signed a new deal with Napalm Records. The band also announced that they would enter the studio in January 2010 to record a new album for a summer release. According to Wyndorf, the band is very pleased with the label, which is &quot;doing a good job&quot;.

The new album, &quot;Mastermind&quot;, was released in October 2010. The band embarked on a massive European tour, in August and then in November–December 2010, to promote their new album. After the tour, Ed Mundell left the band after 18 years &quot;to collaborate with other musicians and producers&quot;, forming The Ultra Electric Mega Galactic. Wyndorf stated that Garrett Sweeny (Riotgod) replaced Ed on the tour.

In the fall of 2011, Monster Magnet toured and performed the seminal &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; record in its entirety throughout Europe. One year later they did the same thing with their 1992 album &quot;Spine of God&quot;.

&quot;Last Patrol&quot; was released in North America on October 15, 2013. Monster Magnet&#x27;s website also announced a North American tour for the album, their first in ten years. However, the remaining shows in mid-December got cancelled because of Wyndorf&#x27;s influenza. The tour resumed in Europe in January and continued through February. Wyndorf stated that the band would play at each show the entire &quot;Last Patrol&quot;.

In November 2014 a reworked version of &quot;Last Patrol&quot; called &quot;Milking the Stars: A Re-Imagining of Last Patrol&quot; was released, and in October 2015, a reworked version of &quot;Mastermind&quot; called &quot;Cobras and Fire (The Mastermind Redux)&quot; was released. Featuring re-recordings and new arrangements, they contained a less polished, psychedelic production. In 2016, the band reissued the A&amp;M era LPs with bonus content via Spinefarm Records. They toured Europe again.

Monster Magnet&#x27;s first studio album in five years, &quot;Mindfucker&quot;, was released on March 23, 2018.

===&quot;A Better Dystopia&quot; (2020–present)===
By December 2020, Monster Magnet had been working on their eleventh studio album. That same month, &quot;Loudwire&quot; included it in their &quot;88 of 2021&#x27;s Most Anticipated Rock + Metal Albums&quot; list. The band released the first single of the album &quot;A Better Dystopia&quot;, a collection of song covers, on March 23, 2021: &quot;Mr. Destroyer&quot;, a cover of the Poobah song. &quot;A Better Dystopia&quot; was released two months later. Monster Magnet toured Europe in the fall of 2024 as part of the band&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The last 10 dates of the 35th anniversary European tour were cancelled due to Wyndorf falling ill.

==Musical style and influences==

Monster Magnet is noted for having a &quot;heavy and spacy sound&quot;. They have been described as a &quot;space-metal outfit [that] helped codify the stoner-rock template with their landmark efforts in the early 1990s&quot;. The album &quot;Superjudge&quot;, according to &quot;Metal Injection&quot;, &quot;helped forge a sound that crafted a band &quot;and&quot; a genre.&quot; Their sound has been described as &quot;heady heavy metal&quot;. Additionally, Monster Magnet is regarded as space rock, hard rock, &quot;psychedelic metal&quot;, and as part of the first wave of alternative metal. Their style is heavily influenced by 1970s space rock bands such as Hawkwind and psychedelia.

In addition to recording covers such as Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Into the Void&quot; (&quot;Master of Reality&quot;, 1971) and Hawkwind&#x27;s &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (&quot;Doremi Fasol Latido&quot;, 1972), Wyndorf sometimes incorporated elements of space rock staples into his own songs. For instance, the &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; title track borrows some of its lyrics from &quot;Lord of Light&quot; (&quot;ibid.&quot;), and &quot;Superjudge&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Twin Earth&quot; is a reinterpretation of Captain Beyond&#x27;s &quot;Mesmerization Eclipse&quot; (&quot;Captain Beyond&quot;, 1972). The main guitar riff to the track Dopes To Infinity is lifted from The Sir Lord Baltimore song &quot;Woman Tamer&quot; (&quot;Sir Lord Baltimore&quot;, 1971). The band has cited the British band Depeche Mode as an influence on its music. They covered Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Black Celebration&quot; for &quot;For the Masses&quot;, a 1998 Depeche Mode tribute album.

Wyndorf is a fan of 1960s comic books, particularly ones by Jack Kirby. He mentions Kirby in the song &quot;Melt&quot; from &quot;God Says No&quot;. He mentions Marvel Comics characters MODOK (on &quot;Baby Götterdämmerung&quot; from &quot;Powertrip&quot;) and Ego the Living Planet (on &quot;Ego, The Living Planet&quot; from &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;). &quot;Mindless Ones&quot; from the album &quot;Last Patrol&quot; mentions the race of the same name, Dormammu, Vishanti and The Ancient One from Marvel&#x27;s Doctor Strange mythos. &quot;All Shook Out&quot; from &quot;God Says No&quot; mentions &quot;children of the atom&quot;, a reference to the X-Men. Marvel&#x27;s Fantastic Four are mentioned in the song &quot;The Titan Who Cried Like a Baby&quot; on &quot;Mastermind&quot;.

==In other media==

===Television===
The television drama series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; used Monster Magnet tracks frequently. Those featured include &quot;Monolithic&quot; in season 1 (episode 10), &quot;Radiation Day&quot;, &quot;Slut Machine&quot; and &quot;Freeze and Pixelate&quot; in season 2 (episodes 1, 4 and 13), and &quot;100 Million Miles&quot; in season 3 (episode 12).

Tracks from the 2001 album &quot;God Says No&quot; have been used in television series, including the sci-fi TV series &quot;Alphas&quot; (&quot;Heads Explode&quot;), and &quot;The Shield&quot;, which featured the track &quot;God Says No&quot; in an early episode.

The reality series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; used several tracks from &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot;, such as &#x27;Slut Machine&#x27;, &#x27;Supercruel&#x27;, and &#x27;Unbroken&#x27; during multiple episodes.

===Film===
Tracks from the 1995 album &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; were included on the soundtrack for &quot;The Matrix&quot; (&quot;Look to Your Orb for the Warning&quot;) and &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; (&quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;). The soundtrack of the 1994 movie &quot;S.F.W.&quot; features an early, otherwise-unreleased version of a song originally from &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;, &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead&quot;. The 1999 film Beowulf features the track &quot;Lord 13&quot; from Monster Magnet&#x27;s early 1990s EP &quot;Tab&quot; during its end credits. The film &quot;Boys&quot; (1996) features the track &quot;The Secret&quot;.

Several tracks from the 1998 Monster Magnet album &quot;Powertrip&quot; have been featured in film soundtracks, including &quot;See You in Hell&quot; in &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (1998), &quot;Powertrip&quot; in &quot;Soldier&quot; (1998), &quot;Crop Circle&quot; in &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), and &quot;Space Lord&quot; in &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006). &quot;Big God&quot;, the bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album (and also B-side to &quot;Space Lord&quot;), appears in &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot; (2000).

Tracks from the 2001 album &quot;God Says No&quot; have also been used in films. &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; (2000) includes &quot;Silver Future&quot;; &quot;Made&quot; (2001) includes &quot;Down in the Jungle&quot;; and &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; (2000) includes &quot;Heads Explode&quot;, and part of the music video for &quot;Heads Explode&quot; is also shown in &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. The 2004 mountain bike film &quot;New World Disorder V - Disorderly Conduct&quot; features &quot;Radiation Day&quot; and &quot;Slut Machine&quot; on its soundtrack.

Monster Magnet contributed a cover of the MC5 song &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; to the &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; soundtrack. They also performed their track &quot;Master of Light&quot; from &quot;Monolithic Baby!&quot; live in a scene in the movie &quot;Torque&quot;.

The Marvel Comics character Negasonic Teenage Warhead, featured in the 2016 film &quot;Deadpool&quot; and its sequel, is named after the song of the same name from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot;.

===Timeline===
==Members&#x27; other projects==
As teenagers, Wyndorf and Caivano played in punk/power pop band Shrapnel from the late 1970s until 1985. The band was managed by Legs McNeil, put out two indie singles and an EP on Elektra Records, played with the Ramones at CBGB, featured guitar from future producer Daniel Rey, and appeared on the Uncle Floyd Show and in a Frank Miller issue of Amazing Spider-Man.

Founding member John McBain joined the psychedelic/ garage influenced bands Hater, Wellwater Conspiracy and Devilhead after quitting Monster Magnet, playing along members of Soundgarden, Malfunkshun, The Walkabouts, Pearl Jam, and other well-known Seattle bands and releasing several albums until the early 2000s. He also contributed to projects like The Desert Sessions and The Freeks, and released the solo album &quot;The In-Flight Feature&quot; in 2006 with guest appearances by Cronin on guitar and Kleiman on drums.

Since the mid-1990s, Cronin and Kleiman have fronted The Ribeye Bros. In 2003, Pantella mixed and plays bass on The Glasspack&#x27;s &quot;Bridgeburner&quot; album. Mundell also played lead guitar on The Glasspack&#x27;s track &quot;Peepshow&quot;. The album was released on Small Stone Records in May 2004.

In 2010, Ed Mundell left Monster Magnet to collaborate with new musicians and producers. In 2011 he formed The Ultra Electric Mega Galactic, and has contributed to albums for Sasquatch, Abrahma, 9 Chambers. His solo album &quot;Space Time Employment Agency&quot; is slated for 2013.

In 2007 Pantella joined The Atomic Bitchwax. Also in 2007, Pantella and Baglino formed RIOTGOD, along with Garrett Sweeny (of Psycho Daisy), and Mark Sunshine.

In 2010, Pantella appeared on LadyKiller&#x27;s debut self-titled release. He is credited as having played drums on 13 of the 16 songs, in addition to having tracked more than half of the album at his recording studio in Sayerville, New Jersey.

In 2010, the first single &quot;American Dream&quot; was released on One Voice by Capricorn, a band formed by Phil Caivano, Todd Youth (of Murphy&#x27;s Law, Danzig, Ace Frehley, Glen Campbell and The Chelsea Smiles) and Karl Rosqvist (of Danzig, The Chelsea Smiles and Michael Monroe).

Chris Kosnik has played in The Atomic Bitchwax since its formation in 1993.

<text>The National Soccer Hall of Fame is a public-private partnership among FC Dallas, the City of Frisco, Frisco Independent School District, and the U.S. Soccer Federation, and currently located in Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. It honors soccer achievements in the United States. Induction is the highest honor in American soccer.

==History==
The Hall of Fame was founded in 1950 by the Philadelphia &quot;Old-timers&quot; Association, a group of former professional and amateur soccer players that wanted to recognize the achievements of soccer in America.

===Museum===
The Hall of Fame museum opened on June 12, 1999, in Oneonta, New York. The museum featured the hall of fame, a library, and an interactive soccer play area.
The United States National Soccer Team Players Association partnered with the Hall of Fame to create the Time In program, which honored people with a connection to soccer battling leukemia. Since the disease disproportionately targets children, a majority of the honorees were youth soccer players.

Prior to the 2005 induction of the &quot;Magnificent Five&quot;, individuals from the early and mid 20th century had been largely ignored. This change was brought about by the acquisition of a large volume of historical records relating to this period. These records combined with previously developed eligibility criteria led to the induction of Tommy Fleming, Alex McNab, Johnny Nelson, Werner Nilsen and Fabri Salcedo, five players whose notable careers all took place prior to 1950. The &quot;Magnificent Five&quot; were inducted posthumously into the Hall of Fame in August 2005.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported on September 4, 2009 that the Hall would be closing to the public outside of certain match days. As a result of financial difficulties, the Hall cut six of its nine employees during that same month. The director of the Hall of Fame for almost ten years, Jack Huckel, left his position on December 18, 2009. On February 10, 2010, it was announced that the Hall would close its facility, though inductions will continue.

In September 2015, it was announced that a new Hall of Fame museum would be built at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, the home of Major League Soccer club FC Dallas. The new museum opened during the 2018 Enshrinement Ceremony on October 20, 2018. This new facility features additional memorabilia from soccer legends and high-tech, interactive exhibits.
===Archive===
After the museum was closed, a collection of more than 80,000 items was distributed to various locations across the country, including the headquarters of Eurosport, a long-term corporate sponsor, in Hillsborough, North Carolina. The collection includes the following notable items:
*The oldest soccer ball made in the United States
*The 1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Trophies
*The North American Soccer League archive
*The 1994 FIFA World Cup U.S. archive
*A rare soccer photography collection from New York depression-era photographer John Albok
*Materials from the U.S. national teams in World Cup competition
*Artifacts from the American Soccer League of the 1920s and 1950s
*Pelé’s New York Cosmos jersey
*The Lamar Hunt Open Cup trophy
*Mia Hamm’s cleats
*Commemorations of the first U.S. World Cup team in 1930

==Eligibility==
Eligible individuals may be inducted into one of three categories: Player, Builder and Veteran (player). New individuals are inducted annually.

===Players===
To be eligible in the Player category, an individual must have met number 1, and either number 2 or number 3, of the following three criteria:

# Retired as a player for at least three years, but for no more than 10 years.
# Played at least 20 full international games for the United States. This requirement is reduced to 10 games if the games were prior to 1990.
# Played at least five seasons in an American first-division professional league (currently MLS or NWSL), and won either the league championship, or the U.S. Open Cup, or was selected as a league all-star at least once.

===Veterans===
Players who have met either no. 2 or no. 3 but who retired more than 10 years ago are automatically placed on the Veteran eligibility list.

===Builders===
To be eligible in this category, an individual must have had a major, sustained and positive impact on soccer in the United States at a national or first division professional level in non-playing capacity. Due to the broad, general nature of the criteria, nominations for this category may be considered. Nominations are screened by the Hall of Fame Historian and Researcher who submit their recommendations to the Hall as to the appropriateness of the nominee&#x27;s inclusion on the eligibility list.

==Medal of Honor==
The National Soccer Hall of Fame&#x27;s Medal of Honor is the highest honor given to people who have grown the sport of soccer in the United States. The Medal is awarded to individuals who has &quot;demonstrated vision and played an historic role in changing the course of soccer in America.&quot; The Medal has been given out only four times in history.

<text>The Cato Institute is an American libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1977 by Ed Crane, Murray Rothbard, and Charles Koch, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Koch Industries. Cato was established to focus on public advocacy, media exposure, and societal influence. 

Cato advocates for a limited governmental role in domestic and foreign affairs and strong protection of civil liberties, including support for lowering or abolishing most taxes, opposition to the Federal Reserve system and the Affordable Care Act, the privatization of numerous government agencies and programs including Social Security and the United States Postal Service, demilitarization of the police, open borders and adhering to a non-interventionist foreign policy.

According to the 2019 Global &quot;Go to Think Tank Index Report&quot; (revised June 2020, Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), Cato was number 20 in the &quot;Top Think Tanks Worldwide&quot; and number 13 in the &quot;Top Think Tanks in the United States&quot;.

==History==
===20th century===
The institute was founded in January 1977 in San Francisco, California; named at the suggestion of cofounder Rothbard after &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;, a series of British essays penned in the early 18th century by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon.

In 1981, Murray Rothbard was removed from the Cato Institute by the board. That same year, Cato relocated to Washington, D.C., settling initially in a historic house on Capitol Hill. The institute moved to its current location on Massachusetts Avenue in 1993.

===21st century===
In 2009, Cato Institute was ranked the fifth-ranked think tank in the world in a study of think tanks by James G. McGann, at the University of Pennsylvania, based on a criterion of excellence in &quot;producing rigorous and relevant research, publications and programs in one or more substantive areas of research&quot;.

The Cato Institute had a budget of $23 million in 2012. In 2015, Cato&#x27;s revenue exceeded $37 million, and the organization had 124 employees on staff. In 2024, its revenue was reported at more than $71 million.

==Activities==
Various Cato Institute programs were favorably ranked in a survey on think tanks published by the University of Pennsylvania in 2012.

===Publications===
The Cato Institute publishes policy studies, briefing papers, periodicals, and books. Journals and periodicals include &quot;Cato Journal&quot;
(since 1981), &quot;Regulation&quot; magazine (acquired in 1990), &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letter&quot;, &quot;Cato Supreme Court Review&quot;, &quot;Cato Policy Report&quot;, Cato published &quot;Inquiry Magazine&quot; from 1977 to 1982 (before transferring it to the Libertarian Review Foundation) &quot;Literature of Liberty&quot; (from 1978 to 1979 before transferring it to the Institute for Humane Studies, which ended its publication in 1982).

Cato also co-publishes the annual &quot;Human Freedom Index&quot; with the Fraser Institute, and is the co-publisher with Fraser of the U.S. edition of the &quot;Economic Freedom of the World&quot; annual report.

==Ideological relationships==

===Libertarianism and classical liberalism===
Many Cato scholars have advocated support for civil liberties, liberal immigration policies, drug liberalization, and the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell and laws restricting consensual sexual activity. The Cato Institute officially resists being labeled as part of the conservative movement because &quot;&#x27;conservative&#x27; smacks of an unwillingness to change, of a desire to preserve the status quo&quot;.

Cato has strong ties to the political philosophy of classical liberalism. According to executive vice president David Boaz, libertarians are classical liberals who strongly emphasize the individual right to liberty. He argues that, as the term &quot;liberalism&quot; became increasingly associated with government intervention in the economy and social welfare programs, some classical liberals abandoned the old term and began to call themselves “libertarians”. Officially, Cato admits that the term “classical liberal” comes close to the mark of labeling its position, but fails to capture the contemporary vibrancy of the ideas of freedom. According to Cato&#x27;s mission statement, the Jeffersonian philosophy that animates Cato&#x27;s work has increasingly come to be called &#x27;libertarianism&#x27; or &#x27;market liberalism.&#x27; It combines an appreciation for entrepreneurship, the market process, and lower taxes with strict respect for civil liberties and skepticism about the benefits of both the welfare state and foreign military adventurism.

In 2006, Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos proposed the term &quot;Libertarian Democrat&quot; to describe his particular liberal position, suggesting that libertarians should be allies of the Democratic Party. Replying, Cato&#x27;s vice president for research Brink Lindsey agreed that libertarians and liberals should view each other as natural ideological allies, and noted continuing differences between mainstream liberal views on economic policy and Cato&#x27;s &quot;Jeffersonian philosophy&quot;.

Some Cato scholars disagree with conservatives on neo-conservative foreign policy, albeit that this has not always been uniform.

===Objectivism===
The relationship between Cato and the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) improved with the nomination of Cato&#x27;s new president John A. Allison IV in 2012. He is a former ARI board member and is reported to be an &quot;ardent devotee&quot; of Rand who has promoted reading her books to colleges nationwide. In March 2015, Allison retired as president, remaining on the board; he was succeeded by Peter Goettler.

== Positions ==
The Cato Institute advocates policies that advance &quot;individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and peace&quot;. They are libertarian in their policy positions, typically advocating diminished government intervention in domestic, social, and economic policies and decreased military and political intervention worldwide. Cato was cited by columnist Ezra Klein as nonpartisan, saying that it is &quot;the foremost advocate for small-government principles in American life&quot; and it &quot;advocates those principles when Democrats are in power, and when Republicans are in power&quot;; and Eric Lichtblau called Cato &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most widely cited research organizations.&quot; Nina Eastman reported in 1995 that &quot;on any given day, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas might be visiting for lunch. Or Cato staffers might be plotting strategy with House Majority Leader Dick Armey, another Texan, and his staff.&quot;

=== Defense and foreign policy ===
Cato&#x27;s non-interventionist foreign policy views, and strong support for civil liberties, have frequently led Cato scholars to criticize those in power, both Republican and Democratic. Cato scholars opposed President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1991 Gulf War operations (a position which caused the organization to lose nearly $1 million in funding), President Bill Clinton&#x27;s interventions in Haiti and Kosovo, President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq, and President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2011 military intervention in Libya. As a response to the September 11 attacks, Cato scholars supported the removal of al Qaeda and the Taliban regime from power, but are against an indefinite and open-ended military occupation of Afghanistan. Cato scholars criticized U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

Ted Galen Carpenter, Cato&#x27;s vice president for defense and foreign policy studies, criticized many of the arguments offered to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. One of the war&#x27;s earliest critics, Carpenter wrote in January 2002: &quot;Ousting Saddam would make Washington responsible for Iraq&#x27;s political future and entangle the United States in an endless nation-building mission beset by intractable problems.&quot; Carpenter also predicted: &quot;Most notably there is the issue posed by two persistent regional secession movements: the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south.&quot; But in 2002 Carpenter wrote, &quot;the United States should not shrink from confronting al-Qaeda in its Pakistani lair,&quot; a position echoed in the institute&#x27;s policy recommendations for the 108th Congress. Cato&#x27;s director of foreign policy studies, Christopher Preble, argues in &quot;The Power Problem: How American Military Dominance Makes Us Less Safe, Less Prosperous, and Less Free&quot;, that America&#x27;s position as an unrivaled superpower tempts policymakers to constantly overreach and to redefine ever more broadly the &quot;national interest&quot;.

Christopher Preble has said that the &quot;scare campaign&quot; to protect military spending from cuts under the Budget Control Act of 2011 has backfired.

Cato&#x27;s foreign and defense policies are guided by the view that the United States is relatively secure and so should engage the world, trade freely, and work with other countries on common concerns—but avoid trying to dominate it militarily. As a result, Cato advocates the United States should be an example of democracy and human rights, not their armed vindicator abroad, claiming it has a rich history, from George Washington to Cold War realists like George Kennan. Cato scholars aim to restore this view, with a principled and restrained foreign policy recommendation, to keep the nation out of most foreign conflicts and be cheaper, more ethical, and less destructive of civil liberties.

===Domestic policies===
Cato scholars have consistently called for the privatization of many government services and institutions, including NASA, Social Security, the United States Postal Service, the Transportation Security Administration, public schooling, public transportation systems, and public broadcasting. The institute opposes minimum wage laws, saying that they violate the freedom of contract and thus private property rights, and increase unemployment. 

The institute is opposed to expanding overtime regulations, arguing that it will benefit some employees in the short term, while costing jobs or lowering wages of others, and have no meaningful long-term impact. It opposes child labor prohibitions, opposes public sector unions, and supports right-to-work laws. It opposes universal health care, arguing that it is harmful to patients and an intrusion onto individual liberty. It is against affirmative action. It has also called for total abolition of the welfare state, and has argued that it should be replaced with reduced business regulations to create more jobs, and argues that private charities are fully capable of replacing it. Cato has also opposed antitrust laws.

Cato is an opponent of campaign finance reform, arguing that government is the ultimate form of potential corruption and that such laws undermine democracy by undermining competitive elections. Cato also supports the repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act.

Cato is a fierce foe of the war on drugs, arguing that consenting adults have the right to put any substance they wish to in their bodies and that drug prohibition drives mass incarceration while fueling violent competition between gangs and failing to prevent drug abuse.

Cato has published numerous studies criticizing what it calls &quot;corporate welfare&quot;, the practice of public officials funneling taxpayer money, usually via targeted budgetary spending, to politically connected corporate interests.

Cato has published strong criticisms of the 1998 settlement which many U.S. states signed with the tobacco industry.

Cato president Ed Crane and Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope co-wrote a 2002 op-ed piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling for the abandonment of the Republican energy bill, arguing that it had become little more than a gravy train for Washington, D.C., lobbyists. Again in 2005, Cato scholar Jerry Taylor teamed up with Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club to attack the Republican Energy Bill as a give-away to corporate interests.

In 2003, Cato filed an amicus brief in support of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which struck down the remaining state laws that made private, non-commercial homosexual relations between consenting adults illegal. Cato cited the 14th Amendment, among other things, as the source of their support for the ruling. The amicus brief was cited in Justice Kennedy&#x27;s majority opinion for the Court. 

In 2004, Cato scholar Daniel Griswold wrote in support of President George W. Bush&#x27;s failed proposal to grant temporary work visas to otherwise undocumented laborers which would have granted limited residency for the purpose of employment in the U.S.

In 2004, the institute published a paper arguing in favor of &quot;drug reimportation&quot;.

In 2006, the Cato Institute published a study proposing a Balanced Budget Veto Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In 2006, Cato published a Policy Analysis criticising the Federal Marriage Amendment as unnecessary, anti-federalist, and anti-democratic. The amendment would have changed the United States Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage; the amendment failed in both houses of Congress.

A 2006 Cato report by Radley Balko strongly criticized U.S. drug policy and the perceived growing militarization of U.S. law enforcement.

A 2006 study criticized the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Cato supports same-sex marriage and filed an &quot;amicus&quot; brief in the case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; supporting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

Cato does not formally oppose capital punishment; however, they have frequently criticized the practice.

===Environmental policy===
Cato scholars have written about the issues of the environment, including global warming, environmental regulation, and energy policy. According to social scientists Riley Dunlap and Aaron McCright the Cato Institute is one of the &quot;particularly crucial elements of the denial machine&quot;, that rejects global warming.

PolitiFact.com and &quot;Scientific American&quot; have called Cato&#x27;s work on global warming &quot;false&quot; and based on &quot;data selection&quot;. A December 2003 Cato panel included Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and John Christy. Michaels, Balling and Christy agreed that global warming is related at least some degree to human activity but that many scientists and the media have overstated the danger. The Cato Institute has also criticized political attempts to stop global warming as expensive and ineffective.

Cato scholars have been critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s views on energy policy. In 2003, Cato scholars Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren said the Republican Energy Bill was &quot;hundreds of pages of corporate welfare, symbolic gestures, empty promises, and pork-barrel projects&quot;. They also spoke out against the former president&#x27;s calls for larger ethanol subsidies.

With regard to the &quot;Takings Clause&quot; of the United States Constitution and environmental protection, libertarians associated with Cato contended in 2003 that the Constitution is not adequate to guarantee the protection of private property rights.

In 2019, Cato closed its &quot;Center for the Study of Science&quot;, which E&amp;E News characterized as &quot;a program that for years sought to raise uncertainty about climate science&quot; after its head Pat Michaels had left the institute over disagreements, along with his collaborator Ryan Maue, a meteorologist. By that time, the Cato Institute was also no longer affiliated with its former distinguished fellow Richard Lindzen, another denier of the scientific consensus on climate change.

===Global freedom===
Cato&#x27;s scholars seek to advance policies and support institutions in developing and developed countries that protect human rights and extend the range of personal choices. In particular, Cato&#x27;s research explores the central role that freedom in its various dimensions—economic, civil, and personal—plays in human progress and in solving some of the world&#x27;s most pressing problems, including global poverty. To this end Cato co-publishes the annual &quot;Human Freedom Index&quot; (2015–) with the Fraser Institute and is the co-publisher with Fraser of the U.S. edition of the &quot;Economic Freedom of the World&quot; annual report (1996–).

===Immigration===
Cato argues that most Americans are immigrants or descended from immigrants who sought opportunity and freedom on American shores, and they believe that this continues today with immigrants continuing to become Americans, making the United States a wealthier, freer, and safer country. Cato&#x27;s research indicates that the current US immigration system excludes the most peaceful and healthy immigrants, and urges policymakers to expand and deregulate legal immigration. Further, Cato supports open borders.

===Presidential administrations===
Cato scholars were critical of George W. Bush&#x27;s Republican administration (2001–2009) on several issues, including education, and excessive government spending. On other issues, they supported Bush administration initiatives, most notably health care, Social Security, global warming, tax policy, and immigration.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Cato scholars criticized both major-party candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama.

Cato has criticized President Obama&#x27;s stances on policy issues such as fiscal stimulus, healthcare reform, foreign policy, and drug-related matters, while supporting his stance on the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell and the DREAM Act.

Cato opposed Executive Order 13769, which was enacted in January 2017, which decreased the number of refugees admitted into the United States and suspended entry to individuals whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under U.S. immigration law.

====Trade policy====
Cato advocates that policymakers must be constantly reminded of the benefits of free trade and the costs of protectionism, arguing free trade is the extension of free markets across political borders. It promotes the idea that enlarging markets to integrate more buyers, sellers, investors, and workers enables more refined specialization and economies of scale, which produce more wealth and higher living standards, and argues that Protectionism does the opposite. Cato&#x27;s policy recommendations focus on congress and the administration pursuing policies that expand the freedom of Americans to participate in the international marketplace.

==Funding, tax status, and corporate structure==
The Cato Institute is classified as a 501(c)(3) organization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. For revenue, the institute is largely dependent on private contributions and does not receive government funding. The Cato Institute reported the fiscal year 2015 revenue of $37.3 million and expenses of $29.4 million. According to the organization&#x27;s annual report, $32.1 million came from individual donors, $2.9 million came from foundations, $1.2 million came from program revenue and other income, and $1 million came from corporations.

Sponsors of Cato have included FedEx, Google, CME Group and Whole Foods Market. &quot;The Nation&quot; reported support for Cato from the tobacco industry in a 2012 story.

===Funding details===
Funding details as of FYE March 2020:


Net assets as of FYE March 2020: $81,391,000.

===Shareholder dispute and departure of Ed Crane===
In 2011, there were four shareholders of the Cato Institute: Charles and David Koch, Ed Crane, and William A. Niskanen. Niskanen died in October 2011. In March 2012, a dispute broke out over the ownership of Niskanen&#x27;s shares. Charles and David Koch filed suit in Kansas, seeking to void his shareholder seat. The Kochs argued that Niskanen&#x27;s shares should first be offered to the board of the institute, and then to the remaining shareholders, while Crane contended that Niskanen&#x27;s shares belonged to his widow, Kathryn Washburn, and that the move by the Kochs was an attempt to turn Cato into &quot;some sort of auxiliary for the G.O.P ... It&#x27;s detrimental to Cato, it&#x27;s detrimental to Koch Industries, it&#x27;s detrimental to the libertarian movement.&quot; Those who supported Cato&#x27;s existing management rallied around the &quot;Save Cato&quot; banner, while those who supported the Koch brothers, called &quot;For a Better Cato&quot;.

In June 2012, Cato announced an agreement in principle to settle the dispute by changing the institute&#x27;s governing structure. Under the agreement, a board replaced the shareholders and Crane, who at the time was also chief executive officer, retired. Former BB&amp;T bank CEO John A. Allison IV replaced him. The Koch brothers agreed to drop two lawsuits.

In 2018, several former Cato employees alleged longtime sexual harassment by Crane, going back to the 1990s and continuing until his departure in 2012. &quot;Politico&quot; reported that he settled one such claim in 2012. Crane denied the allegations.

<text>Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, also called François Lecoq de Boisbaudran (18 April 1838 – 28 May 1912), was a self-taught French chemist known for his discoveries of the chemical elements gallium, samarium and dysprosium. He developed methods for separation and purification of the rare earth elements and was one of the pioneers of the science of spectroscopy.

==Biography==
Lecoq de Boisbaudran was a member of a noble family of Huguenots from the French provinces of Poitou and Angoumois. The Huguenots were French Protestants, a population that was devastated during the French Wars of Religion (1561–1598). The Edict of Nantes (1598) granted substantial civil rights to the Huguenots even though it maintained Catholicism&#x27;s position as the established religion of France. The Edict of Nantes was overturned by the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which officially sanctioned persecution of Protestants. The Lecoq de Boisbaudran family was of considerable fortune until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, after which much of their property was confiscated and sold.

Paul-Émile (Francois) Lecoq de Boisbaudran was a son of Paul Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1801–1870) and his wife Anne Louise. Paul Lecoq de Boisbaudran established a successful wine business in Cognac, benefiting from the hard work of the entire family including young Paul-Émile.

Anne Louise Lecoq de Boisbaudran was well educated and taught her son Paul-Émile history and foreign languages, including English. He obtained the syllabus of the École Polytechnique, and he studied the books assigned in its courses. In this way, he was self-taught as a scientist. As such, de Boisbaudran is an example of an autodidact. With the support of his family, he assembled a modest chemical laboratory on the second floor of their home on the Rue de Lusignan. In this laboratory, he repeated the experiments that he had studied in books. Through these experiments, he developed his theories of spectroscopy and made most of his discoveries, including the isolation of gallium.

Lecoq de Boisbaudran married Jeannette Nadault-Valette (1852–1926) on 27 December 1897. They had no children. He developed ankylosis of the joints, and failing health hindered his work after 1895. He died in 1912, at the age of 74.

==Research==
Lecoq de Boisbaudran&#x27;s early investigations focused on understanding the phenomenon of supersaturation, in which substances can exist in solution in higher concentrations than is possible under normal conditions. He showed that contact of supersaturated solutions with crystals of an isomorphous salt causes the substance to precipitate from the solution. He further showed that many anhydrous salts can be dissolved to create a supersaturated solution. These investigations were carried out from 1866 to 1869.

In 1874 Lecoq de Boisbaudran found that certain crystal faces dissolve more rapidly than other crystal faces. Specifically, he found that octahedral faces are less readily soluble than cubic faces in the case of ammonium alum crystals.

Lecoq de Boisbaudran made major contributions to the then-new science of spectroscopy, which relates to the interaction of light and matter. He applied spectroscopy to characterize elements, particularly the rare-earth elements. He developed a theoretical framework of spectroscopy, based on molecular vibrations. Theorizing that spectral frequencies relate to the atomic weight of an element, he recognized spectral trends based upon atomic masses.

Boisbaudran developed new experimental apparatus and used these to carry out spectral analyses of various chemical elements. Through systematic experimentation, he analysed spectra of 35 elements, using the Bunsen burner, electric spark or both to induce luminescence of samples of the elements. The results of his early investigations were published in his &quot;Spectres lumineux : spectres prismatiques et en longueurs d&#x27;ondes destinés aux recherches de chimie minérale&quot; (1874).

To observe spark spectra in his experimental protocols, he typically placed a solution of a salt in a sealed glass tube, with a platinum wire in the solution as a negative pole, and another platinum wire above the surface of the liquid as a positive pole. In 1885, he experimented with reversing the polarity of the electric current. In this way, he obtained phosphorescent bands in the spectra providing further insight into the spectral characteristics of various chemical elements. Using this apparatus, he discovered the lanthanides samarium (1880), dysprosium (1886) and europium (1890). In 1885, he also spectroscopically characterized gadolinium in 1885, an element previously discovered in 1880 by J. C. Galissard de Marignac.

=== Samarium ===

Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered samarium in 1879 after first isolating samarium oxide. He identified the presence of a new element by using spectroscopy to observe its characteristic sharp optical absorption lines.

He named his new element &quot;samarium&quot; after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named for a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets.

=== Gallium ===

A significant achievement of Lecoq de Boisbaudran was his discovery of the element gallium in 1875. Beginning in 1874, Lecoq de Boisbaudran investigated a sample of 52 kg of the mineral ore sphalerite obtained from the Pierrefitte mine in the Pyrenees. From it, he extracted several milligrams of gallium chloride. Using spectroscopic methods, he observed what appeared to be two previously unreported lines in the sample&#x27;s spectrum, at wavelengths of 4170 and 4031 angstroms.
He continued his experiments using several hundred kilograms of crude zinc ore and in the same year isolated more than one gram of a near-pure metal by electrolysis of a solution of the metal in its form as a hydroxide compound, dissolved in potassium hydroxide solution. Later he prepared 75 grams of gallium using more than 4 tonnes of crude ore. He confirmed its spectral characteristics, consisting of two spectral lines in the violet portion of the spectrum of the mineral sphalerite. In this way, he ruled out the possibility that the spectral characteristics were an accident of the extraction process, rather than being an indication of a new element.

He named his discovery &quot;gallium&quot;, from the Latin &quot;Gallia&quot; meaning Gaul, in honor of his native land of France. It was later suggested that Lecoq de Boisbaudran had named the element after himself, since &quot;gallus&quot; is the Latin translation of the French &quot;le coq&quot;. Lecoq de Boisbaudran denied this suggestion in an article in 1877. He published an account of his investigations on the new element in &quot;Sur un nouveau metal, le gallium&quot; (1877).

De Boisbaudran calculated the atomic mass of gallium as 69.86, close to the currently accepted value of 69.723. Unknown to Lecoq de Boisbaudran, the existence of gallium had been predicted during 1871 by Dmitri Mendeleev, who gave it the name &quot;eka-aluminium&quot;. De Boisbaudran&#x27;s discovery of gallium was significant support for Mendeleev&#x27;s theory of the periodicity of the elements.

=== Dysprosium ===

Lecoq de Boisbaudran experimented with the precipitation of rare earth compounds from water solution using potassium sulfate to induce precipitation. He then measured the spectra of solutions in which the liquid served as a positive pole. Lecoq de Boisbaudran noted a spectral band in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum, indicative of a new element. In 1886 he succeeded in isolating a purified sample of the source of the new spectral band. He named the element dysprosium, meaning &quot;difficult to obtain&quot; in the Greek language.

=== Periodic classification of elements ===
Lecoq de Boisbaudran contributed to the development of the periodic classification of elements. This contribution occurred when he proposed that the newly discovered element argon was a member of a new, previously unrecognized, chemical series of elements that came to be known as the noble gases.

==Awards and honors==
For his accomplishments, Lecoq de Boisbaudran was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honour (1876), 
the Bordin Prize from the French Academy of Sciencies (1872), 
the Davy Medal (1879)
and the Prix Lacaze of 10,000 francs (1879). In 1888 he was elected a foreign member of the British Royal Society.

<text>Rongorongo ( or ; Rapa Nui: ) is a system of glyphs discovered in the 19th century on Easter Island that has the appearance of writing or proto-writing. Numerous attempts at decipherment have been made, but none have been successful. Although some calendrical and what might prove to be genealogical information has been identified, none of the glyphs can actually be read. If rongorongo does prove to be writing and to be an independent invention, it would be one of very few inventions of writing in human history.

Two dozen wooden objects bearing rongorongo inscriptions, some heavily weathered, burned, or otherwise damaged, were collected in the late 19th century and are now scattered in museums and private collections. None remain on Easter Island. The objects are mostly tablets shaped from irregular pieces of wood, sometimes driftwood, but include a chieftain&#x27;s staff, a &quot;tangata manu&quot; statuette, and two &quot;reimiro&quot; ornaments. There are also a few petroglyphs which may include short rongorongo inscriptions. Oral history suggests that only a small elite was ever literate and that the tablets were sacred.

Authentic rongorongo texts are written in alternating directions, a system called reverse boustrophedon. In a third of the tablets, the lines of text are inscribed in shallow fluting carved into the wood. The glyphs themselves are outlines of human, animal, plant, artifact and geometric forms. Many of the human and animal figures, such as glyphs and have characteristic protuberances on each side of the head, possibly representing eyes.

Individual texts are conventionally known by a single uppercase letter and a name, such as Tablet C, the &quot;Mamari&quot; Tablet. The somewhat variable names may be descriptive or indicate where the object is kept, as in the Oar, the Snuffbox, the Small Santiago Tablet, and the Santiago Staff.

== Etymology and variant names ==
&quot;Rongorongo&quot; is the modern name for the inscriptions. In the Rapa Nui language, or means &quot;to recite, to declaim, to chant out&quot;.

The original name—or perhaps description—of the script is said to have been , &quot;lines incised for chanting out&quot;, shortened to or &quot;lines [for] chanting out&quot;. There are also said to have been more specific names for the texts based on their topic. For example, the (&quot;lines of years&quot;) were annals, the (&quot;lines of fishes&quot;) were lists of persons killed in war ( &quot;fish&quot; was homophonous with or used figuratively for &quot;war casualty&quot;), and the &quot;lines of fugitives&quot; were lists of war refugees.

Some authors have understood the in to refer to a separate form of writing distinct from . Barthel recorded that &quot;The Islanders had another writing (the so-called &#x27; script&#x27;) which recorded their annals and other secular matters, but this has disappeared.&quot; But Steven Roger Fischer writes that &quot;the was originally a type of inscription. In the 1880s, a group of elders invented a derivative &#x27;script&#x27; [also] called with which to decorate carvings in order to increase their trading value. It is a primitive imitation of .&quot; An alleged third script, the or described in some mid-20th-century publications, was &quot;an early twentieth-century geometric [decorative] invention&quot;.

==Form and construction==

The forms of the glyphs are standardized contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running the length of the tablets, as can be seen in the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.

===Writing media===

Except for a few possible glyphs cut in stone (see petroglyphs), and one possibility on barkcloth, all surviving secure texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. However, Catherine Orliac (2005b) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and L) with stereo optical and scanning electron microscopes and determined that all were instead made from Pacific rosewood (&quot;Thespesia populnea&quot;); the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This tree, known as &quot;Pacific rosewood&quot; for its color and called in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African yellowwood (&quot;Podocarpus latifolius&quot;) and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as &quot;a damaged and reshapen European or American oar&quot;, as are A (which is European ash, &quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat was said to have been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled driftwood. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of ligatures and potentially a telegraphic style of writing that would complicate textual analysis.

William J. Thomson reported a calabash, now lost, that had been found in a tomb and was &quot;covered with hieroglyphics similar to those found on the incised tablets.&quot; During the early missionary period that began in 1864, it was reported that women wore bark cloth decorated with &quot;symbols&quot;; a fragment of one of these survives, and appears to be rongorongo.

Oral tradition holds that, because of the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development in the evolution of the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.

Barthel speculated that the banana leaf might even have served as a prototype for the tablets, with the fluted surface of the tablets an emulation of the veined structure of a leaf:

===Direction of writing===

Rongorongo glyphs were written in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom left-hand corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, as can be seen in the image .

However, the writing continues onto the second side of a tablet at the point where it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, as is the case with tablets K, N, P, and Q, the second will start at the &quot;upper&quot; left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom.

Larger tablets and staves may have been read without turning, if the reader were able to read upside-down.

The direction of writing was determined by such clues as glyphs that twist as the line changes direction, glyphs that were squashed to fit in at the end of a text, and, when a particular tablet does not have such clues, parallel passages between tablets.

===Writing instruments ===

According to oral tradition, scribes used obsidian flakes or small shark teeth, presumably the hafted tools still used to carve wood in Polynesia, to flute and polish the tablets and then to incise the glyphs. The glyphs are most commonly composed of deep smooth cuts, though superficial hair-line cuts are also found. In the closeup image at right, a glyph is composed of two parts connected by a hair-line cut; this is a typical convention for this shape. Several researchers, including Barthel, believe that these superficial cuts were made by obsidian, and that the texts were carved in a two-stage process, first sketched with obsidian and then deepened and finished with a worn shark tooth. The remaining hair-line cuts were then either errors, design conventions (as at right), or decorative embellishments. Vertical strings of chevrons or lozenges, for example, are typically connected with hair-line cuts, as can be seen repeatedly in the closeup of one end of tablet B below. However, Barthel was told that the last literate Rapanui king, Ngaara, sketched out the glyphs in soot applied with a fish bone and then engraved them with a shark tooth.

Tablet N, on the other hand, shows no sign of shark teeth. Haberlandt noticed that the glyphs of this text appear to have been incised with a sharpened bone, as evidenced by the shallowness and width of the grooves. N also &quot;displays secondary working with obsidian flakes to elaborate details within the finished contour lines. No other &quot;rongo-rongo&quot; inscription reveals such graphic extravagance&quot;.

Other tablets appear to have been cut with a steel blade, often rather crudely. Although steel knives were available after the arrival of the Spanish, this does cast suspicion on the authenticity of these tablets.

===Glyphs===
The glyphs are stylized human, animal, vegetable and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented head up and are either seen face on or in profile to the right, in the direction of writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.

==Origin==
Oral tradition holds that either Hotu Matua or Tuu ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous plants such as the toromiro. But no homeland is likely to have had a tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterward in the resulting epidemics.

===Dating the tablets===
Little direct dating has been done. The start of forest-clearing for agriculture on Easter Island, and thus presumably the first settlements on the island, has been dated to &quot;circa&quot; 1200, implying a date for the invention of rongorongo no earlier than the 13th century. Tablet Q (Small Saint Petersburg) is the sole item that has been carbon dated, but the results only constrain the date to sometime after 1680. Glyph 67 () is thought to represent the extinct Easter Island palm, which disappeared from the island&#x27;s pollen record &quot;circa&quot; 1650, suggesting that the script itself is at least that old.

Texts A, P, and V can be dated to the 18th or 19th century by virtue of being inscribed on European oars. Orliac (2005) argues that the wood for tablet C () was cut from the trunk of a tree some tall, and Easter Island has long been deforested of trees that size. Analysis of charcoal indicates that the forest disappeared in the first half of the 17th century. Jakob Roggeveen, who discovered Easter Island in 1722, described the island as &quot;destitute of large trees&quot; and in 1770 Felipe González de Ahedo wrote, &quot;Not a single tree is to be found capable of furnishing a plank so much as six inches [15cm] in width.&quot; Forster, with James Cook&#x27;s expedition of 1774, reported that &quot;there was not a tree upon the island which exceeded the height of 10feet [3m].&quot;

All of these methods date the wood, not the inscriptions themselves. Pacific rosewood is not durable, and is unlikely to survive long in Easter Island&#x27;s climate.

The tablets preserved in Rome were carbon-dated in a study published February 2, 2024 in &quot;Nature&quot;. Most dated to the 19th century. One was securely dated to the mid-15th century, suggesting that rongorongo may have been in use well before European contact. It was noted the dating was of the wooden tablet, not of the writing upon it, which could be younger.

===1770 Spanish expedition===

In 1770 the Spanish annexed Easter Island under Captain González de Ahedo. A signing ceremony was held in which a treaty of annexation was signed by an undisclosed number of chiefs &quot;by marking upon it certain characters in their own form of script&quot; (reproduction at right).

Several scholars have suggested that rongorongo may be an invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script until Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. These researchers&#x27; hypothesis is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the &quot;concept&quot; of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own writing system. If so, rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than 100 years.

Known cases of the diffusion of writing, such as Sequoyah&#x27;s invention of the Cherokee syllabary after observing English-language newspapers, or Uyaquk&#x27;s invention of the Yugtun script after being inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, as might be expected for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. That the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the (scribes) by the time Rapa Nui society collapsed following Peruvian slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud&#x27;s day. Orliac points out that Tablet C appears to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.

===Petroglyphs ===

Easter Island has the richest assortment of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been carved, including the stone walls of some houses and a few of the famous &quot;moai&quot; statues and their fallen topknots. Around 1,000 sites with over 4,000 glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of chimeric bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the &quot;tangata manu&quot; (&quot;bird-man&quot;) cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopuses (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over 500 (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots (&quot;cupules&quot;) in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with . Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.

Several of the anthropomorphic and animal-form petroglyphs have parallels in rongorongo, for instance a double-headed frigatebird (glyph 680) on a fallen &quot;moai&quot; topknot, a figure which also appears on a dozen tablets. McLaughlin (2004) illustrates the most prominent correspondences with the petroglyph corpus of Georgia Lee (1992). But these are mostly isolated glyphs; few text-like sequences or ligatures have been found among the petroglyphs. This has led to the suggestion that rongorongo must be a recent creation, perhaps inspired by petroglyph designs or retaining individual petroglyphs as logograms (Macri 1995), but not old enough to have been incorporated into the petroglyphic tradition. The most complex candidate for petroglyphic rongorongo is what appears to be a short sequence of glyphs, one a ligature, carved on a cave wall. But the sequence does not appear to have been carved in a single hand (see image at right), and the cave is near the house that produced the &quot;Poike&quot; tablet, a crude imitation of rongorongo, so the petroglyphs may not be authentic.

==Historical record==

===Discovery===
Eugène Eyraud, a lay friar of the Congrégation de Picpus, landed on Easter Island on January 2, 1864, on the 24th day of his departure from Valparaíso. He was to remain on Easter Island for nine months, evangelizing its inhabitants. He wrote an account of his stay in which he reports his discovery of the tablets that year:

There is no other mention of the tablets in his report, and the discovery went unnoticed. Eyraud left Easter Island on October 11 1864, in extremely poor health. Ordained a priest in 1865, he returned to Easter Island in 1866 where he died of tuberculosis in August 1868, aged48.

===Destruction===
In 1868 the Bishop of Tahiti, Florentin-Étienne &quot;Tepano&quot; Jaussen, received a gift from the recent Catholic converts of Easter Island. It was a long cord of human hair, a fishing line perhaps, wound around a small wooden board covered in hieroglyphic writing. Stunned at the discovery, he wrote to Father Hippolyte Roussel on Easter Island to collect all the tablets and to find natives capable of translating them. But Roussel could only recover a few, and the islanders could not agree on how to read them.

However, Eyraud had seen hundreds of tablets only four years earlier. What happened to the missing tablets is a matter of conjecture. Eyraud had noted how little interest their owners had in them. Stéphen Chauvet reports that:

Orliac has observed that the deep black indentation, about long, on lines 5 and 6 of the recto of tablet H is a groove made by the rubbing of a fire stick, showing that tablet H had been used for fire-making. Tablets S and P had been cut into lashed planking for a canoe, which fits the story of a man named Niari who made a canoe out of abandoned tablets.

As European-introduced diseases and raids by Peruvian slavers, including a final devastating raid in 1862 and a subsequent smallpox epidemic, had reduced the Rapa Nui population to under two hundred by the 1870s, it is possible that literacy had been wiped out by the time Eyraud discovered the tablets in 1864.

Thus in 1868 Jaussen could recover only a few tablets, with three more acquired by Captain Gana of the Chilean corvette &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&quot; in 1870. In the 1950s Barthel found the decayed remains of half a dozen tablets in caves, in the context of burials. However, no glyphs could be salvaged.

Of the 26 commonly accepted texts that survive, only half are in good condition and authentic beyond doubt.

===Anthropological accounts===
British archaeologist and anthropologist Katherine Routledge undertook a 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui with her husband to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly &quot;tapu&quot;, that recorded the island&#x27;s history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.

==Corpus==
The 26 rongorongo texts with letter codes are inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and components of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly oblong wooden tablets, with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain&#x27;s staff known as the Santiago Staff; J and L, inscribed on &quot;reimiro&quot; pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, inscribed on various parts of a &quot;tangata manu&quot; statuette; and Y, a European snuff box assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names in the same manner as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.

===Classic texts ===
Barthel referred to each of 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts have been added to the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A &quot;(Tahua),&quot; side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an idiosyncratic numbering system.

Crude glyphs have been found on a few stone objects and some additional wooden items, but most of these are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.

===Additional texts===
In addition to the petroglyphs mentioned above, there are a few other very short uncatalogued texts that may be rongorongo. Fischer reports that &quot;many statuettes reveal or -like glyphs on their crown.&quot; He gives the example of a compound glyph, , on the crown of a statuette. Many human skulls are inscribed with the single &#x27;fish&#x27; glyph 700 , which may stand for &quot;war casualty&quot;. There are other designs, including some tattoos recorded by early visitors, which are possibly single rongorongo glyphs, but since they are isolated and pictographic, it is difficult to know whether or not they are actually writing. In 2018, a possibly authentic ink-on-barkcloth sequence dating from 1869, dubbed the &quot;Raŋitoki fragment&quot;, was recognized.

===Glyphs===
The only published reference to the glyphs which is even close to comprehensive remains Barthel (1958). Barthel assigned a three-digit numeric code to each glyph or to each group of similar-looking glyphs that he believed to be allographs (variants). In the case of allography, the bare numeric code was assigned to what Barthel believed to be the basic form (&quot;Grundtypus&quot;), while variants were specified by alphabetic suffixes. Altogether he assigned 600 numeric codes. The hundreds place is a digit from 0 to 7, and categorizes the head, or overall form if there is no head: 0 and 1 for geometric shapes and inanimate objects; 2 for figures with &quot;ears&quot;; 3 and 4 for figures with open mouths (they are differentiated by their legs/tails); 5 for figures with miscellaneous heads; 6 for figures with beaks; and 7 for fish, arthropods, etc. The digits in tens and units places were allocated similarly, so that, for example, glyphs 206, 306, 406, 506, and 606 all have a downward-pointing wing or arm on the left, and a raised four-fingered hand on the right:

There is some arbitrariness to which glyphs are grouped together, and there are inconsistencies in the assignments of numerical codes and the use of affixes which make the system rather complex. However, despite its shortcomings, Barthel&#x27;s is the only effective system ever proposed to categorize rongorongo glyphs.

Barthel (1971) claimed to have parsed the corpus of glyphs to 120, of which the other 480 in his inventory are allographs or ligatures. The evidence was never published, but similar counts have been obtained by other scholars, such as Pozdniakov &amp; Pozdniakov (2007).

===Published corpus===

For almost a century only a few of the texts were published. In 1875, the director of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his (&quot;Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script&quot;) which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel&#x27;s line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.

Fischer (1997) published new line drawings. These include lines scored with obsidian but not finished with a shark tooth, which had not been recorded by Barthel because the rubbings he used often did not show them, for example on tablet N. (However, in line Gv4 shown in the section on writing instruments above, the light lines were recorded by both Fischer and Barthel.) There are other omissions in Barthel which Fischer corrects, such as a sequence of glyphs at the transition from line Ca6 to Ca7 which is missing from Barthel, presumably because the carving went over the side of the tablet and was missed by Barthel&#x27;s rubbing. (This missing sequence is right in the middle of Barthel&#x27;s calendar.) However, other discrepancies between the two records are straightforward contradictions. For instance, the initial glyph of I12 (line 12 of the Santiago Staff) in Fischer does not correspond with that of Barthel or Philippi, which agree with each other, and Barthel&#x27;s rubbing (below) is incompatible with Fischer&#x27;s drawing. Barthel&#x27;s annotation, &quot;Original doch 53.76!&quot; (&quot;original indeed 53.76!&quot;), suggests that he specifically verified Philippi&#x27;s reading:

In addition, the next glyph (glyph 20, a &quot;spindle with three knobs&quot;) is missing its right-side &quot;sprout&quot; (glyph 10) in Philippi&#x27;s drawing. This may be the result of an error in the inking, since there is a blank space in its place. The corpus is thus tainted with quite some uncertainty. It has never been properly checked for want of high-quality photographs.

==Decipherment==

As with most undeciphered scripts, there are many fanciful interpretations and claimed translations of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar and a possible genealogy, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapa Nui language, since modern Rapa Nui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.

The prevailing opinion is that rongorongo is not true writing but proto-writing, or even a more limited mnemonic device for genealogy, choreography, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. For example, the &quot;Atlas of Languages&quot; states, &quot;It was probably used as a memory aid or for decorative purposes, not for recording the Rapanui language of the islanders.&quot; If this is the case, then there is little hope of ever deciphering it. For those who believe it to be writing, there is debate as to whether rongorongo is essentially logographic or syllabic, though it appears to be compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary.

==Computer encoding==
The Unicode Consortium has tentatively allocated range 1CA80–1CDBF of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane for encoding the Rongorongo script. An encoding proposal has been written by Michael Everson.
