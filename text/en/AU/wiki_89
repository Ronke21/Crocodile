<text>Star Control: Famous Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict, Volume IV is an action-strategy video game developed by Toys for Bob and published by Accolade. It was originally released for MS-DOS and Amiga in 1990, followed by ports for the Sega Genesis and additional platforms in 1991. The story is set during an interstellar war between two space alien factions, with humanity joining the Alliance of Free Stars to defeat the invading Ur-Quan Hierarchy. Players can choose to play as either faction, each with seven different alien starships which are used during the game&#x27;s combat and strategy sections.

The game was created by designer-artist Paul Reiche III and programmer-engineer Fred Ford. Initially, the concept was based on the space combat seen in &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962), combined with the action-strategy gameplay seen in &quot;&quot; (1983). The alternate title, &quot;StarCon&quot;, was a play on words referring to Reiche&#x27;s prior work on &quot;Archon,&quot; adapted into a science fiction setting. After developing the core space combat system, Reiche and Ford created an assortment of ships, abilities, and character designs. The project was completed with additional artwork from Greg Johnson and Erol Otus.

&quot;Star Control&quot; was a critical and commercial success upon its release, leading to two sequels, &quot;Star Control II&quot; in 1992 (and the free open-source remake &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; in 2002), and &quot;Star Control 3&quot; in 1996. It has since been ranked among the best games of all time by &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment,&quot; remembered for the replay value of its combat, as well as the colorful worldbuilding that gave rise to its acclaimed sequel. Years after its release, game designers have continued to cite &quot;Star Control&quot; as an influence on their work, including &quot;Mass Effect&quot; (2007), and &quot;Stellaris&quot; (2016).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Star Control&quot; is a combination of a strategy game and real-time one-on-one ship combat game. The ship combat is based on the game &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, while the turn-based strategy is inspired by Paul Reiche III&#x27;s 1983 game &quot;&quot;. Players have the option to play the full game with the turn-based campaign, or practice the one-on-one ship battles. The game can be played by one player against the computer, or two players head to head. The player can also assign the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence to take over the strategy gameplay, the combat gameplay, or both.

The strategy campaign consists of several selectable scenarios, with nine missions on home computers, and fifteen on the Sega Genesis. Each turn-based strategy mission begins with opposing fleets arranged on a rotating star map, with each player controlling a faction of their choice. Each player has up to three ship actions per turn, which are used to explore new stars and colonize or fortify worlds. These colonies provide resources to the player&#x27;s ships, such as currency and crew. The goal is to move one&#x27;s ships across the galaxy, claim planets along the way, and destroy the player&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s star base.

When two rival starships meet on the battlefield, an arcade-style combat sequence begins. Each battle takes place on a single screen with an overhead view, zooming in as the two ships approach each other. The battlefield includes a planet as a gravity well, which ships can either crash into, or glide nearby to gain momentum. There are 14 different ships to choose from, with unique abilities for each. Ships typically have a unique firing attack, as well as some kind of secondary ability. For example, the Yehat Terminator has a forcefield, while the VUX Intruder can launch limpets that slow rival ships down. Using these weapons and abilities will consume the ship&#x27;s battery, which recharges automatically (with few exceptions). Ships also have a limited amount of crew, representing the total damage a ship can take before being destroyed. This ties into the strategic meta-game between combat, where the crew can be replenished at colonies.

The different starships are organized into two warring factions, the Ur-Quan Hierarchy, and the Alliance of Free Stars. Each ship has different strengths and weaknesses, determined by their unique weapons and abilities, as well as their speed, battery, crew (health), and cost. Ship selection has a major influence over combat, and players can discover matchups that give them an advantage. While expensive ships are usually more powerful, the weaker ships can still win in the hands of a skilled player. The screen also displays a cockpit animation for each player, with unique character design for each alien and ship. The ships also have distinct sound deign, such as the barking Chenjesu drones, or the Ur-Quan Dreadnaught bellowing &quot;launch fighters&quot; when it initiates a strike.

As was typical of copy protection at the time, &quot;Star Control&quot; requested a special pass phrase that players found by using a three-ply code wheel, called &quot;Professor Zorq&#x27;s Instant Etiquette Analyzer&quot;.

== Plot ==
&quot;Star Control&quot; reveals its plot through each scenario in the game&#x27;s campaign, as well as the game&#x27;s instruction manual. The story takes place during a war between two interstellar factions of alien species: the peaceful Alliance of Free Stars, and the invading Ur-Quan Hierarchy.

=== Characters ===
The Ur-Quan is the oldest and most advanced species in known space, resembling giant predatory caterpillars with a rigid social order. As slavers, the Ur-Quan recruit other species into their Hierarchy as serfs, which includes their genetically engineered translators, the Talking Pets. The mollusk-like Spathi are cowardly by nature, and were easily coerced into the Hierarchy. The fungoid Mycon joined the Hierarchy freely and fanatically, while the blobbish Umgah joined out of boredom, amused by the war as a great interstellar prank. Two Hierarchy species hold a grudge against Earth, including the humanoid Androsynth who escaped Earth as renegade clones, and the one-eyed VUX, who were insulted by a human during their first contact.

The Chenjesu are the most powerful members of the Alliance, a species of crystalline philosophers who consume electrical energy. Earth joined the Alliance as a multinational crew under their planetary defense organization, Star Control. The Alliance includes the marsupial Shofixti, a brave warrior species who were technologically uplifted by the Yehat, a militant species of avian dinosaurs. The allied Mmrnmhrm are robots with transforming ships, while the Syreen are female humanoids who use their psychic abilities to hypnotize enemy crew. The Arilou are a race of &quot;space elves&quot; with hyper-jump capable vessels, who also have a history of &quot;tormenting&quot; Earth.

Throughout the campaign, each side discovers powerful relics belonging to the Precursors, an unknown lost species who once inhabited nearby space, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

=== Story ===
Humanity encounters a first alien contact near their Ceres outpost, where they receive an urgent warning from the Chenjesu. The crystalline aliens explain that the Ur-Quan Hierarchy is annihilating them and their allies. The Alliance council previously decided that Earth was not strong enough to make a difference, but now the Ur-Quan slavers and their minions have broken through the Alliance defenses, and are approaching the Solar System. The diplomats of Earth agree to join the Alliance, earning a position on the Alliance council, and an Alliance pact to defend Earth and its space colonies.

The campaign begins with a lone Syreen Penetrator vessel attempting to stop the Androsynth from redeploying. The first full battle breaks out where both spheres of influence meet with a mix of combatants, followed by a single Ur-Quan dreadnaught trying to stamp out a fleet of Shofixti scouts. The next encounter takes place in an uncolonized sector between Hierarchy and Alliance starbases. By the fifth and sixth scenarios, the war has escalated to multi-ship battles, including an Ur-Quan armada rampaging towards an Alliance stronghold. The final encounters of the campaign feature a Spathi assault on a Mmrnmhrm mining cluster, and two battles between all members of each faction, with and without starbase support.

The Sega Genesis version features additional scenarios. In neutral space, an Alliance task force attempts to stop the spread of Mycon colonies. Where the Hierarchy has the advantage, they attempt to conquer Earth&#x27;s surrounding solar system. Meanwhile, a lone Chenjesu Broodhome finds itself outnumbered by a Hierarchy force, while the Hierarchy tries to defend its colonies from an invading fleet of Syreen Penetrators. There are also scenarios that favor the Alliance, where they defend a stronghold against a VUX incursion, and also confront a Hierarchy fleet pressing deep into Alliance territory.

==Development==
=== Conception ===

&quot;Star Control&quot; was created by Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford, who both attended the University of California Berkeley around the same time, and both entered the video game industry in the early 1980s. Reiche had started his career working for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; publisher TSR, before developing PC games for Free Fall Associates. After releasing &quot;World Tour Golf&quot;, Reiche created an advertising mock-up for what would become &quot;Star Control&quot;, showing a dreadnaught and some ships fighting. He pitched the game to Electronic Arts, before instead securing an agreement with Accolade as a publisher, thanks to Reiche&#x27;s former producer taking a job there. Meanwhile, Ford had started his career creating games for Japanese personal computers before transitioning to more corporate software development. After a few years working at graphics companies in Silicon Valley, Ford realized he missed working in the game industry. At this point, Reiche needed a programmer-engineer and Ford was seeking a designer-artist, so their mutual friends set up a gaming night to re-introduce them. The meeting was hosted at game designer Greg Johnson&#x27;s house, and one of the friends who encouraged the meeting was fantasy artist Erol Otus.
&quot;Star Control&quot; began as an evolution of concepts that Reiche created in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot;. The project would adapt the action-strategy gameplay of &quot;Archon&quot; into a science fiction setting, where unique combatants fight space battles using distinct abilities. Also called &quot;StarCon&quot;, the title was a play on words. According to Ford, &quot;&quot;StarCon&quot; is really just &quot;Archon&quot; with an S-T in front of it&quot;, pointing to the one-on-one combat and strategic modes of both games. &quot;Star Control&quot; would base its combat sequences on the classic game &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, as well as the core experience of space combat game &quot;Star Raiders&quot;.

This was the first collaboration between Ford and Reiche, who decided to limit the game&#x27;s scope to establish an effective workflow. Releasing the game under their personal names, they also began referring to their partnership as Toys for Bob. Programmer Robert Leyland and artist Erol Otus had both worked with Ford at his previous place of employment, and joined him as he began work on &quot;Star Control&quot;.

=== Design and production ===
Fred Ford&#x27;s first prototype was a two-player action game where the VUX and Yehat ships blow up asteroids, which led them to build the entire universe around that simple play experience. Ford designed the Yehat starship with a crescent-shape, and the ship&#x27;s shield-generator led them to optimize the ship for close combat. They built on these two original ships with many additional ships and character concepts, and play-tested them with friends such as Greg Johnson and Robert Leyland. The team preferred to iterate on ship designs rather than plan them, as they discovered different play-styles during testing. The asymmetry between the combatants became essential to the experience. Ford explained: &quot;Our ships weren&#x27;t balanced at all, one on one... but the idea was, your fleet of ships, your selection of ships in total was as strong as someone else&#x27;s, and then, it came down to which matchup did you find&quot;. Still, the ships were still given some balance by having their energy recharge at different rates.

Although the story does not factor heavily into the game, the character concepts were created based on the ship designs. The team would begin with paper illustrations, followed by logical abilities for those ships, and a character concept that suited the ship&#x27;s look-and-feel. The first ship sketches were based on popular science fiction, such as &quot;SpaceWar!&quot; or &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and slowly evolved into original designs as they discussed why the ships were fighting each other. Reiche describes their character creation process: &quot;I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. &#x27;What do you guys do?&#x27; And they tell me&quot;. By the end of this process, they wrote a short summary for each alien, describing their story and personality.

After creating a large ship that launches fighters on command, Reiche and Ford decided this would be a dominating race. These antagonists would be called the Ur-Quan, with a motivation to dominate the galaxy to hunt for slaves, and an appearance based on a National Geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey. They decided to organize the characters into nominally &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; factions, each with seven unique races and ships, with the humans on the good side. As they were creating the alien characters based on the ship abilities, the Spathi&#x27;s cowardly personality was inspired by their backwards-shooting missiles. A more robotic ship inspired an alien race called the Androsynth, whose appearance was imagined as Devo flying a spaceship. Reiche and Ford were also inspired by character concepts in David Brin&#x27;s &quot;The Uplift War&quot;. The designers asked what kind of race would be uplifted by the fiercely heroic Yehat, and decided to create the Shofixti as a ferocious super rodent. The team also decided that the game would need more humanoid characters, and created the Syreen as a powerful and attractive humanoid female race. When they saw that the Syreen ship resembled a cross between a rocket ship and a ribbed condom, Fred Ford suggested calling it the Syreen Penetrator, which coincidentally happened moments before the 1989 San Francisco Earthquake.

The game&#x27;s file size was largely devoted to sound effects, with audio sampled from famous science fiction media, as well as original sound designs for other alien ships. Each alien race also has a short victory theme song, composed by Reiche&#x27;s friend Tommy Dunbar of The Rubinoos. The longer Ur-Quan theme played at the end of the game was composed by fantasy artist Erol Otus.

=== Porting and compatibility ===
The number of visible colors was a major technological limitation at the time, and the team created different settings for CGA, EGA, and VGA monitors. A separate team ported a stripped down version of the game to the Commodore 64, Amstrad, and ZX Spectrum, which meant reducing the number of ships to eight, as well introducing new bugs and balance issues. Additional problems were caused by the number of simultaneous key-presses required for a multiplayer game, which required Ford to code a solution that would work across multiple different computer keyboards.

&quot;Star Control&quot; was ported to the Sega Genesis, in a team led by Fred Ford. Because the Genesis port was a cartridge-based game with no battery backup, it lacked the scenario-creator of the PC version, but it came pre-loaded with a few additional scenarios not originally in the game. Where the PC version featured synthesized audio, the team discovered the digital MOD file format to help port the music to console, which would become the core music format for the sequel. It took nearly five months to convert the code and color palettes, leaving little time to optimize the game under Accolade&#x27;s tight schedule, leading to slowdown issues. Released under Accolade&#x27;s new &quot;Ballistic&quot; label for high quality games, the game was touted as the first 12-megabit cartridge created for the system. The box art for the Sega version was adapted from the original PC version, this time re-painted by artist Boris Vallejo.

The Genesis port was not authorized by Sega. Frustrated with Sega&#x27;s licensing requirements, Accolade decided to reverse engineer the console to disable the code that locked out unlicensed games. This allowed Accolade to port several games to the Genesis from their previous list of releases, including &quot;Star Control&quot;. Sega responded by suing Accolade for copyright infringement, but the appeal court found that reverse engineering was a fair use exception to copying the code without Sega&#x27;s authorization. The ruling set an influential precedent, allowing other instances of reverse engineering to continue without penalty. Sega eventually settled the lawsuit in Accolade&#x27;s favor, making them a licensed Sega developer.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Control&quot; was a commercial success at the time, reaching the top 5 on the PC sales charts by September 1990. According to a retrospective by Finnish gaming magazine &quot;Pelit&quot;, the game would go on to sell 120,000 copies, leading Accolade to request a sequel from creators Reiche and Ford.

The game earned wide acclaim for its arcade-style combat, including its tactical depth and player-vs-player mode. &quot;MegaTech&quot; enjoyed mastering the different starships, earning the game an editorial Hyper Game Award as &quot;one of the best two-player Mega Drive games ever&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; chose &quot;Star Control&quot; for their editorial &quot;CVG Hit&quot; award, highlighting the variety of weapons, the fun of learning favorable matchups, and the overall playability of the game&#x27;s two-player mode. Italian publication &quot;The Games Machine&quot; celebrated &quot;Star Control&quot; as a modern re-invention of &quot;Spacewar!,&quot; recommending the combat mode for its range of options, its automatic camera zoom, and its implementation of physics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also recommended the game for evolving the &quot;Spacewar!&quot; formula with a variety of unique ships. The arcade combat earned additional praise for its replayability from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, &quot;Digital Press&quot;, &quot;Videogame &amp; Computer World&quot;, and Raze Magazine.

Several publications celebrated &quot;Star Control&quot; for its artistic details, including its character designs and animations. &quot;Digital Press&quot; praised the personality of the alien ships for their portraits, and the lore behind each species. &quot;Strategy Plus&quot; appreciated the unique humor and personality of the aliens, highlighting the design of the Syreen and their Penetrator ship, as well as &quot;silly&quot; names like Chenjesu commander Bzrrak Ktazzz.&quot;Videogame &amp; Computer World&quot; praised the unique animations of the aliens, while &quot;Strategy Plus&quot; declared the game&#x27;s graphics as &quot;truly spectacular in 256 color VGA&quot;. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; celebrated the game&#x27;s many graphical details, particularly the alien pilots. French publication &quot;Joystick&quot; offered its strongest praise for the game&#x27;s art and environment. The game&#x27;s audio design was also highlighted by several publications. Digital Press felt that the sound effects for the Ur-Quan and Chenjesu gave their ships a &quot;fantastic&quot; personality, while &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the audio for drawing on popular science fiction.

Several reviewers were more critical of the game&#x27;s strategic mode. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; found that it lacked depth, and Joystick compared the strategy sections unfavorably to the game&#x27;s combat. Entertainment Weekly criticized the star map as difficult to see, while Raze Magazine found it tedious to operate the strategy game menus on the Sega Genesis.

Originally released for the PC, &quot;Star Control&quot; received criticism for its porting to other platforms. &quot;Advanced Computer Entertainment&quot; called the Amiga version &quot;disappointing&quot;, denouncing the load times and &quot;tacky two-dimensional combat sequences that look as if they&#x27;ve been borrowed from an early Eighties coin-op&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; similarly compared the Amiga version of &quot;Star Control&quot; to the &quot;aging co-op &quot;Spacewar!&quot;&quot;. While reviewing the Sega Genesis version, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described the graphics as inferior to other titles on the console. &quot;Raze Magazine&quot; felt that it lacked the polish and depth of the original PC version, criticizing the sprites and environments, while still offering praise for the detailed portraits.

The year of the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; gave &quot;Star Control&quot; an award for &quot;Best Computer Science Fiction Game&quot;, noting that &quot;the two creators have put together a game that is great either as a full simulation or an action-combat contest&quot;. They later highlighted the game in a list of science fiction releases, proclaiming &quot;Reiche and Ford&#x27;s action-strategy tour de force is one of the most absorbing and challenging science fiction games of all-time&quot;. The game was additionally nominated for Best Action/Arcade Program at the 1991 Spring Symposium of the Software Publishers Association.

=== Legacy and impact ===
&quot;Star Control&quot; has been received several retrospective awards from gaming publications. In 1996, &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; ranked it as the 127th best game, describing it as &quot;&quot;Space War&quot; enters the 90s with a touch of humor&quot;. In 2001, &quot;PC Gameplay&quot; ranked &quot;Star Control&quot; as the 45th most influential game of all time, based on a survey of dozens of game studios. In 2017, &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked it as number 253 in their top 500 games of all time, arguing that &quot;as a melee or strategic game, it helped define the idea that games can be malleable and dynamic and players can make an experience wholly their own&quot;. Journalist Jamie Lendino also noted &quot;Star Control&quot; among the most significant PC games of the early 1990s, for successfully combining an action game with science fiction strategy. The game is also celebrated for the debut of the Ur-Quan, as &quot;one of the all-time villainous races in the history of computer games&quot;.

Years after its release, &quot;Pelit&quot; recalled the original &quot;Star Control&quot; for its polished combat system, as well as the creativity of its character designs. In 2005, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; described &quot;Star Control&quot; as &quot;a textbook example of good game design&quot;, where &quot;two genres were brilliantly combined, making for a finely balanced and well-rounded game experience&quot;. The publication further highlighted the many &quot;elements that gave &quot;Star Control&quot; &#x27;soul&#x27;&quot;, describing it as &quot;the seed from which the vastly expanded narrative found in &quot;Star Control II&quot; grew&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; celebrated &quot;Star Control&quot; as a &quot;special game&quot; for &quot;its colorful universe and superb combat system&quot;, which laid the foundation for its acclaimed sequel &quot;Star Control II&quot;. In a retrospective, Hardcore Gaming 101 attributed the game&#x27;s legacy to its combat system, and the story and characters that would be further developed in the sequel.

Founder of BioWare, Ray Muzyka, has cited the original &quot;Star Control&quot; as an inspiration for the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series of games, stating that &quot;the uncharted worlds in &quot;Mass Effect&quot; comes from imagining what a freely explorable universe would be like inside a very realistic next-gen game&quot;. Former BioWare writer Mike Laidlaw praised the creativity of the &quot;Star Control&quot; ship designs, and credited the game with laying the foundation for its sequel, which influenced him as a writer on &quot;Mass Effect&quot;. Creative producer Henrik Fahraeus has also cited the game&#x27;s influence on Paradox Interactive&#x27;s character designs in &quot;Stellaris,&quot; particularly the bird-like and mushroom-like aliens.

==Sequels and open-source remake==
===&quot;Star Control II&quot;===

&quot;Star Control II&quot; is an action-adventure science fiction game, set in an open world. The game was originally published by Accolade in 1992 for MS-DOS, and was later ported to the 3DO with enhanced multimedia elements. Created by Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III, it vastly expands on the story and characters introduced in the first game. When the player discovers that Earth has been encased in a slave shield, they must recruit allies to liberate the galaxy. The game features ship-to-ship combat based on the original &quot;Star Control&quot;, but removes the first game&#x27;s strategy elements to focus on story and dialog. &quot;Star Control II&quot; has earned critical acclaim and is considered one of the best games of all time through the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. It is also ranked among the best games in several creative areas, including writing, world design, character design, and music.

===&quot;Star Control 3&quot;===

&quot;Star Control 3&quot; is an adventure science fiction video game developed by Legend Entertainment, and published by Accolade in 1996. The story takes place after the events of &quot;Star Control II&quot; when the player must travel deeper into the galaxy to investigate the mysterious collapse of hyperspace. Several game systems from &quot;Star Control II&quot; are changed. Hyperspace navigation is replaced with instant fast travel, and planet landing is replaced with a colony system inspired by the original &quot;Star Control&quot;. Accolade hired Legend Entertainment to develop the game after original creators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford decided to pursue other projects. Though the game was considered a critical and commercial success upon release, it would receive unfavourable comparisons to &quot;Star Control II,&quot; with some fans regarding it as non-canonical&quot;.&quot;

===Cancelled &quot;Star Control 4&quot;===
In January 1998, Accolade announced that they were developing &quot;Star Control 4&quot;. Also known as &quot;StarCon&quot;, it was designed as a 3D space combat game. By this time, Electronic Arts had agreed to become the distributor for all games developed by Accolade. Accolade producer George MacDonald announced that &quot;we want to move away from the adventure element and concentrate on what it seems the players really want – action!&quot; Though heavier on combat than previous titles, players would still have the opportunity to fly to planets and communicate with different aliens. The team also created a Star Control History Compendium, to help them resolve storylines from the previous games. In a playable alpha version of the game, players could control a fleet carrier, with the ability to launch a fighter that could be controlled by either the same player or a second player. The game was later announced for the PlayStation home console with plans for release in 1999, featuring a 40-hour variable storyline, and both competitive and co-operative multiplayer. Electronic Arts and Accolade promoted the choice of playing as &quot;one of two alliances (Hyperium or Crux)&quot;, with the option of operating a fighter, carrier, or turrets. Another publication described the ability to select from three different alien factions, with different missions that impact the storyline, and the ability to destroy entire planets.

Development on the game was halted at the end of 1998. Not satisfied with the game&#x27;s progress, Accolade put the project on hold with intentions to re-evaluate their plans for the &quot;Star Control&quot; license. In 1999, Accolade was acquired by Infogrames SA for $50 million, as one of many corporate restructurings that eventually led to Infogrames merging with Atari and re-branding under a revived Atari brand. &quot;Star Control 3&quot; became the last official installment of the series.

=== &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; ===

By the early 2000s, Accolade&#x27;s copyright license for &quot;Star Control&quot; expired, triggered by a contractual clause when the games were no longer generating royalties. As the games were no longer available for sale, Reiche and Ford wanted to keep their work in the public eye, to maintain an audience for a potential sequel. Reiche and Ford still owned the copyrights in &quot;Star Control&quot; and its sequel &quot;Star Control II&quot;, but they could not successfully purchase the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark from Accolade, leading them to consider a new title for a potential follow-up.&quot;&quot; This led them to remake &quot;Star Control II&quot; as &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot;, which they released in 2002 as a free download under an open source copyright license. The official free release is maintained by an active fan community.

=== &quot;Free Stars: Children of Infinity&quot; ===

On October 24, 2023, Pistol Shrimp Games developers, consisting of Fred Ford, Paul Reiche III, Ken Ford and Dan Gerstein, announced the new name of the sequel, &quot;Free Stars: Children of Infinity&quot;, and launched its corresponding website. A Kickstarter campaign was launched on April 16, 2024 to further the game development of the sequel. Within 3 hours, they met their initial $100,000 USD goal. The planned date for the release of the game is August 2025. The fans started to call the game &quot;the real &quot;Star Control 3&quot;&quot; due to its creation by Reiche and Ford.

==Aftermath==
Fans continued to demand a new &quot;Star Control&quot; game well into the 2000s. Reiche and Ford expressed interest in creating either an updated &quot;Star Control II&quot; or an alternate &quot;Star Control 3&quot;, particularly if they found the right publisher. During this time, thousands of fans started a petition in hopes of inspiring a sequel. Toys for Bob producer Alex Ness responded in April 2006 with an article on the company website, stating that &quot;if enough of you people out there send me emails requesting that Toys For Bob do a legitimate sequel to &quot;Star Control 2&quot;, I&#x27;ll be able to show them to Activision, along with a loaded handgun, and they will finally be convinced to roll the dice on this thing&quot;. In the months that followed, Ness announced the petition&#x27;s impact, reporting that &quot;there did honestly seem to be some real live interest on [Activision&#x27;s] part. At least on the prototype and concept-test level. This is something we may in fact get to do when we finish our current game&quot;. In a 2011 interview about their next game &quot;&quot;, Reiche declared that they will one day make the real sequel.

=== Intellectual property split ===

By the early 2000s, the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark was held by Infogrames Entertainment. &quot;Star Control&quot; publisher Accolade had sold their company to Infogrames in 1999, who merged with Atari and re-branded under the Atari name in 2003. In September 2007, Atari released an online Flash game with the name &quot;Star Control&quot;, created by independent game developer Iocaine Studios. Atari ordered the game to be delivered in just four days, which Iocaine produced in two days. Also in September, Atari applied to renew the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, citing images of Iocaine&#x27;s flash game to demonstrate their declaration of use in commerce.

Atari declared bankruptcy in 2013, and their assets were listed for auction. When Stardock became the top bidder for Atari&#x27;s &quot;Star Control&quot; assets, Paul Reiche indicated that he still owned the copyrighted materials from the first two &quot;Star Control&quot; games, which implied that Stardock must have purchased the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark and the copyright in any original elements of &quot;Star Control 3&quot;. Stardock confirmed this intellectual property split soon after. As Stardock began developing their new &quot;Star Control&quot; game, they re-iterated that they did not acquire the copyright to the first two games, and that they would need a license from Reiche and Ford to use their content and lore. Reiche and Ford echoed this understanding in their 2015 Game Developers Conference interview, stating that Stardock&#x27;s game would use the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark only. After a lawsuit, the parties agreed on the same separation of rights, with Stardock using the &quot;Star Control&quot; name, and Reiche and Ford announcing a sequel to &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; after a mandated quiet period.

<doc id="156254" wikidata="Q1145030" url="?curid=156254" title="Cape Guardafui">
<text>Cape Guardafui is a headland in the federal state of Puntland in Somalia. Coextensive with Puntland&#x27;s Gardafuul administrative province, it forms the geographical apex of the Horn of Africa. Its shore at 51°27&#x27;52&quot;E is the second easternmost point on mainland Africa after Ras Hafun. The offshore oceanic strait Guardafui Channel (or &quot;Marinka Gardafuul&quot;) is named after it.

==Location==
Cape Guardafui is located at , next to the Guardafui Channel. The archipelago of Socotra lies off the cape in the north of the Somali Sea.

Fifteen leagues (45 miles) west of Guardafui is Ras Filuk, a steep cliff jutting into the Gulf of Aden from flatland. The mountain is believed to correspond with the ancient &quot;Elephas Mons&quot; or &quot;Cape Elephant&quot; (&quot;Ras Filuk&quot; in Arabic) described by Strabo.

==History==

Referred to as &quot;Aromata promontorium&quot; (Greek: Αρώματον ἄκρον) by the ancient Greeks, Guardafui was described as early as the 1st century CE in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, along with other flourishing commercial settlements on the northern Somali littoral.

The name &quot;Guardafui&quot; originated during the late Middle Ages by sailors using the Mediterranean Lingua Franca: &quot;guarda fui&quot; in ancient Italian means &quot;look and escape&quot;, as a reference to the danger of the cape.

In the early 19th century, Somali seamen barred entry to their ports along the coast, while engaging in trade with Aden and Mocha in adjacent Yemen using their own vessels.

Due to the frequency of shipwrecks in the treacherous seas near Cape Guardafui, the British signed an agreement with sultan Osman Mahamuud of the Majeerteen Sultanate, which controlled much of the northeastern Somali seaboard during the 19th century. The agreement stipulated that the British would pay annual subsidies to protect shipwrecked British crews and guard wrecks against plunder. The agreement, however, remained unratified, as the British feared that doing so would &quot;give other powers a precedent for making agreements with the Somalis, who seemed ready to enter into relations with all comers.&quot;

Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo, which also controlled a portion of the coast, later granted concessions to an Aden-based French hotel proprietor and a former French Army officer to construct a lighthouse in Cape Guardafui. Capital for the project was raised by a firm in Marseille, but the deal subsequently fell through.

===Lighthouse &quot;Francesco Crispi&quot;===
Britain ceded to Italy sovereignty over the disputed region where Cape Guardafui is located in 1894. Starting in 1899, the Italians undertook detailed studies and surveys to build a lighthouse and the first concrete project came out in 1904. Italy wanted the construction and maintenance costs of the future lighthouse to be shared by the maritime powers which would benefit most from the new lighthouse but Britain, which suspected that Italy also intended to build a coaling station that would compete with Aden, finally refused to contribute.

Thus, it is only in the early 1920s that the authorities of Italian Somaliland finally made good on their promise to build a lighthouse. The first one, inaugurated in April 1924 as the Francesco Crispi Lighthouse, was a simple, functional metal-framed lighthouse built atop the headland. Simultaneously, a wireless station to monitor maritime traffic, which had been built in the nearby village of Tohen, was activated.

A large-scale rebellion against Italian rule in that part of Italian Somaliland was underway at the time and troops guarding the new lighthouse and the wireless station repelled two attacks by several hundred rebels in November 1925 and January 1926. 
The lighthouse had suffered some damages during the attacks and this was one of the reasons that prompted the authorities to build a stronger, stone and reinforced concrete lighthouse, which was inaugurated in 1930. The striking new lighthouse was built in the shape of an Italian fascist &quot;Fascio littorio&quot;. The lighthouse, which is no longer in use, still has the huge stone axe blade characteristic of fascist symbolism.

A stone lighthouse and radio station were eventually built in the headland, with the former named after Francesco Crispi in 1930.

The lighthouse has an original &quot;Fascio littorio&quot; exterior stone as a decoration, that is typical of fascist architecture promoted by Benito Mussolini. Italian authorities have requested a study to declare the lighthouse an &quot;historical monument&quot; of Somalia and a proposed World Heritage Site.

==Demography==
Ras Asir holds resonance among Somalis, it represents the tip of the African continent. Many nomads that traverse here are also fisherman due to the abundance of fish off its shores. With the usage of binoculars, the vessels that traverse the Guardafui Channel can sometimes be seen.

==Geography==

Six miles south of Ras Asir there are mimosa trees with water streams called Wadi Tuhom. The offshore Guardafui Channel connects the Gulf of Aden with the Somali Sea. A sighting of Ras Asir represents a milestone for passing vessels, due to a sharp westerly change in direction and a changing contrast between the hazardous currents to Ras Asir&#x27;s east, and the comparatively calm seas to its north, especially during the south-west monsoon. On April 8, 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region coextensive with Cape Guardafui named &quot;Gardafuu&quot;. Carved out of the Bari region, it consists of four districts (Baargaal, Bereeda, Alula, and Gumbah) and has its capital at Alula. It has the longest coastline of Puntlands 9 regions (on both the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden).

<text>The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) is a British symphony orchestra based in London. Founded in 1904, the LSO is the oldest of London&#x27;s symphony orchestras. The LSO was created by a group of players who left Henry Wood&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services. The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members. From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines, with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season. This practice continued for the orchestra&#x27;s first four decades.

The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras, to which it lost players and bookings: the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War. The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time. In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea. By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position, which it has retained subsequently. In 1966, to perform alongside it in choral works, the orchestra established the LSO Chorus, originally a mix of professional and amateur singers, later a wholly amateur ensemble.

As a self-governing body, the orchestra selects the conductors with whom it works. At some stages in its history it has dispensed with a principal conductor and worked only with guests. Among conductors with whom it is most associated are, in its early days, Hans Richter, Sir Edward Elgar, and Sir Thomas Beecham, and in more recent decades Pierre Monteux, André Previn, Claudio Abbado, Sir Colin Davis, and Valery Gergiev.

Since 1982, the LSO has been based in the Barbican Centre in the City of London. Among its programmes there have been large-scale festivals celebrating composers as diverse as Berlioz, Mahler and Leonard Bernstein. The LSO claims to be the world&#x27;s most recorded orchestra; it has made gramophone recordings since 1912 and has played on more than 200 soundtrack recordings for the cinema, of which the best known include the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. 
==History==
===Background===

At the turn of the twentieth century there were no permanent salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen&#x27;s Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to deputise for him at the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: &quot;A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don&#x27;t mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.&quot; There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.

In 1904, the manager of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, Robert Newman and the conductor of his promenade concerts, Henry Wood, agreed that they could no longer tolerate the deputy system. After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with dozens of unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came to the platform and announced: &quot;Gentlemen, in future there will be &quot;no&quot; deputies! Good morning!&quot; This caused a furore. Orchestral musicians were not highly paid, and removing their chances of better-paid engagements permitted by the deputy system was a serious financial blow to many of them. While travelling by train to play under Wood at a music festival in the north of England in May 1904, soon after Newman&#x27;s announcement, some of his leading players discussed the situation and agreed to try to form their own orchestra. The principal movers were three horn players (Adolf Borsdorf, Thomas Busby, and Henri van der Meerschen) and a trumpeter, John Solomon.

===Foundation===

Busby organised a meeting at St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall, not far from the Queen&#x27;s Hall. Invitations were sent to present and former members of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra. About a hundred players attended. Busby explained the scheme: a new ensemble, the London Symphony Orchestra, to be run on co-operative lines, &quot;something akin to a Musical Republic&quot;, with a constitution that gave the organisation independence. At concerts promoted by the LSO the members played without fee, their remuneration coming at the end of each season in a division of the orchestra&#x27;s profits. This worked well in good years, but any poorly-patronised series left members out of pocket, and reliant on the LSO&#x27;s engagements to play for provincial choral societies and other managements. The proposal was approved unanimously, and a management committee was elected, comprising the four original movers and Alfred Hobday (viola) and E F (Fred) James (bassoon). Busby was appointed chief executive, a post variously titled &quot;Secretary&quot;, &quot;managing director&quot;, &quot;general secretary&quot; and &quot;general manager&quot; over the years.

Borsdorf was a player of international reputation, and through his influence, the orchestra secured Hans Richter to conduct its first concert. Newman held no grudge against the rebels and made the Queen&#x27;s Hall available to them. He and Wood attended the LSO&#x27;s first concert, on 9 June 1904. The programme consisted of the prelude to &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, music by Bach, Mozart, Elgar and Liszt, and finally Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony. In a favourable review in &quot;The Times&quot;, J A Fuller Maitland noted that 49 members of the new orchestra were rebels against Newman&#x27;s no-deputy rule, 32 had left the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra earlier, and the other 21 had no connection with Wood and Newman.

In a profile of the orchestra in 1911, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented:
===Early years===
The orchestra made its first British tour in 1905, conducted by Sir Edward Elgar. Elgar&#x27;s conducting was highly praised; as to the orchestra, Ernest Newman wrote in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;Its brass and its wood-wind were seen to be of exceptional quality, but the strings, fine as they are, have not the substance nor the colour of the Hallé strings.&quot; The following year the LSO played outside Britain for the first time, giving concerts in Paris, conducted by Edouard Colonne, Sir Charles Stanford and André Messager. Richard Morrison, in his centenary study of the LSO, writes of &quot;stodgy programmes of insipid Cowen, worthy Stanford, dull Parry and mediocre Mackenzie&quot;; they put the Parisian public off to a considerable degree, and the players ended up out of pocket.
In its early years Richter was the LSO&#x27;s most frequently-engaged conductor, with four or five concerts every season; the orchestra&#x27;s website and Morrison&#x27;s 2004 book both count him as the orchestra&#x27;s first chief conductor, though the 1911 &quot;Musical Times&quot; article indicates otherwise. Richter retired from conducting in 1911, and Elgar was elected conductor-in-chief for the 1911–12 season. Elgar conducted six concerts, Arthur Nikisch three, and Willem Mengelberg, Fritz Steinbach and Gustave Doret one each. As a conductor Elgar did not prove to be a big enough box-office draw, and after one season he was replaced by the charismatic Hungarian maestro Nikisch.

Nikisch was invited to tour North America in 1912, and despite his long association with the Berlin Philharmonic and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, he insisted that the LSO should be contracted for the tour. The orchestra, 100-strong (all men except for the harpist), was booked to sail on the Titanic, but the tour schedule was changed at the last minute, and the players sailed safely on the Baltic. The tour was arduous, but a triumph. &quot;The New York Press&quot; said, &quot;The great British band played with a vigor, force and temperamental impetuousness that almost lifted the listener out of his seat.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised all departments of the orchestra, though, like &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, it found the strings &quot;brilliant rather than mellow&quot;. The paper had a little fun at the LSO&#x27;s expense: from the viewpoint of a country that had long enjoyed permanent, salaried orchestras such as the Boston Symphony, it gently mocked the LSO&#x27;s &quot;bold stand for the sacred right of sending substitutes&quot;

===First World War and 1920s===
Shortly after the beginning of the war the board of the orchestra received a petition from rank and file players protesting about Borsdorf&#x27;s continued membership of the LSO. Although he had done as much as anyone to found the orchestra, had lived in Britain for 30 years and was married to an Englishwoman, Borsdorf was regarded by some colleagues as an enemy alien and was forced out of the orchestra.
During the war the musical life of Britain was drastically curtailed. The LSO was helped to survive by large donations from Sir Thomas Beecham, who also subsidised the Hallé and the Royal Philharmonic Society. For a year he took the role, though not the title, of chief conductor of the LSO. In 1916 his millionaire father died and Beecham&#x27;s financial affairs became too complicated for any further musical philanthropy on his part. In 1917 the LSO&#x27;s directors agreed unanimously that they would promote no more concerts until the end of the war. The orchestra played for other managements, and managed to survive, although the hitherto remunerative work for regional choral societies dwindled to almost nothing.

When peace resumed many of the former players were unavailable. A third of the orchestra&#x27;s pre-war members were in the armed forces, and rebuilding was urgently needed. The orchestra was willing to allow the ambitious conductor Albert Coates to put himself forward as chief conductor. Coates had three attractions for the orchestra: he was a pupil of Nikisch, he had rich and influential contacts, and he was willing to conduct without fee. He and the orchestra got off to a disastrous start. Their first concert featured the premiere of Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto. Apart from the concerto, which the composer conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar&#x27;s. Lady Elgar wrote, &quot;that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing.&quot; In &quot;The Observer&quot; Newman wrote, &quot;There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself.&quot; Coates remained as chief conductor for two seasons, and after the initial debacle is credited by Morrison with &quot;breathing life and energy into the orchestra&quot;.

After Coates left, the orchestra reverted to its preferred practice of engaging numerous guest conductors rather than a single principal conductor. Among the guests were Elgar, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin. Revenues were substantial, and the orchestra seemed to many to be entering into a golden age. In fact, for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s, the LSO allowed its standards of playing to slip. In 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic, under Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London. Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London&#x27;s orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways. In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. The prospect of joining a permanent, salaried orchestra was attractive enough to induce some LSO players to defect. The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that contrasted starkly with the severe press criticisms of the LSO&#x27;s playing. According to the critic W J Turner the LSO&#x27;s problem was not that its playing had deteriorated, but that it had failed to keep up with the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras.

===1930s===
In 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent&#x27;s patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham had in mind a reorganised version of the LSO, but the orchestra baulked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO&#x27;s leading members.
To try to raise its own standards the LSO had engaged Mengelberg, a famous orchestral trainer, known as a perfectionist. He made it a precondition that the deputy system must be abandoned, which occurred in 1929. He conducted the orchestra for the 1930 season, and music critics commented on the improvement in the playing. Nonetheless, as patently the third-best orchestra in London, the LSO lost work it had long been used to, including the Covent Garden seasons, the Royal Philharmonic Society concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts. The orchestra persuaded Sir Hamilton Harty, the popular conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, to move from Manchester to become the LSO&#x27;s principal conductor. Harty brought with him eight of the Hallé&#x27;s leading players to replenish the LSO&#x27;s ranks, depleted by defections to the BBC and Beecham. Critics including Neville Cardus recognised the continued improvement in the LSO&#x27;s playing: &quot;On this evening&#x27;s hearing the London Symphony Orchestra is likely, after all, to give its two rivals a gallant run. Under Sir Hamilton it will certainly take on a style of sincere expression, distinguished from the virtuoso brilliance cultivated by the B.B.C. Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Beecham.&quot; Among the milestones on the orchestra&#x27;s path to recovery were the premieres of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1930) and First Symphony (1934), showing the orchestra &quot;capable of rising to the challenge of the most demanding contemporary scores&quot; (Morrison).

The foundation of the Glyndebourne Festival in 1934 was another good thing for the LSO, as its players made up nearly the entirety of the festival orchestra. An important additional source of income for the orchestra was the film industry. In March 1935 the LSO recorded Arthur Bliss&#x27;s incidental music for Alexander Korda&#x27;s film &quot;Things to Come&quot;. According to the LSO&#x27;s website the recording took 14 full orchestral sessions and &quot;started a veritable revolution in film production history. ... For the first time, music for the cinema, previously regarded as a lowly art form, captured the attention of classical music scholars and enthusiasts, music critics and the film and music public. The LSO had begun its long historic journey as the premier film orchestra.&quot;

In London Harty did not prove to be a box-office draw, and according to Morrison, he was &quot;brutally and hurtfully&quot; dropped in 1934, as his LSO predecessor Elgar had been in 1912. After this the orchestra did not appoint a chief conductor for nearly 20 years. By 1939 the orchestra&#x27;s board was planning an ambitious programme for 1940, with guests including Bruno Walter, Leopold Stokowski, Erich Kleiber and George Szell.

===1940s and 50s===
When the Second World War broke out the orchestra&#x27;s plans had to be almost completely changed. During the First World War the public&#x27;s appetite for concert-going diminished drastically, but from the start of the Second it was clear that there was a huge demand for live music. The LSO arranged a series of concerts conducted by Wood, with whom the orchestra was completely reconciled. When the BBC evacuated its orchestra from London and abandoned the Proms, the LSO took over for Wood. The Carnegie Trust, with the support of the British government, contracted the LSO to tour Britain, taking live music to towns where symphony concerts were hitherto unknown.

The orchestra&#x27;s loss of manpower was far worse in the Second World War than in the First. Between 1914 and 1918 there were 33 members of the LSO away on active service; between 1939 and 1945 there were more than 60, of whom seven were killed. The orchestra found replacements wherever it could, including the bands of army regiments based in London, whose brass and woodwind players were unofficially recruited.

During the war it had become clear that private patronage was no longer a practical means of sustaining Britain&#x27;s musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.
At the end of the war the LSO had to face new competition. The BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra had survived the war intact, the latter, abandoned by Beecham, as a self-governing body. All three were quickly overshadowed by two new orchestras: Walter Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia and Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. To survive, the LSO played in hundreds of concerts of popular classics under undistinguished conductors. By 1948 the orchestra was anxious to resume promoting its own concert series. The players decided to accept the Arts Council&#x27;s conditions for subsidy, and changed the LSO&#x27;s constitution to replace profit-sharing with salaries. With a view to raising its playing standards it engaged Josef Krips as conductor. His commitments in Vienna preventing him from becoming the LSO&#x27;s chief conductor until 1950, but from his first concert with the orchestra in December 1948 he influenced the playing for the better. His chosen repertoire was good for the box office: cycles of Beethoven symphonies and concertos (the latter featuring Wilhelm Kempff in one season and Claudio Arrau in another) helped restore the orchestra&#x27;s finances as well as its musical standards. With Krips and others the orchestra recorded extensively for the Decca Record Company during the early 1950s. The orchestra&#x27;s workload in these years was second only to the other self-governing London orchestra, the LPO: the LPO played 248 concerts in the 1949–50 season; the LSO 103; the BBC SO 55; the Philharmonia and RPO 32 each. When the Royal Festival Hall opened in 1951 the LSO and LPO engaged in a mutually bruising campaign for sole residency there. Neither was successful, and the Festival Hall became the main London venue for both orchestras and for the RPO and Philharmonia.

Krips left the LSO in 1954, and the following year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued that the future of the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished to be free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash of dates. The LSO&#x27;s board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned &quot;en masse&quot;, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.

To replace the departing principals the LSO recruited rising young players including Hugh Maguire, Neville Marriner and Simon Streatfeild in the string sections, Gervase de Peyer and William Waterhouse in the woodwinds, and Barry Tuckwell and Denis Wick in the brass. With the new intake the orchestra rapidly advanced in standards and status. The average age of the LSO players dropped to about 30. In 1956 the orchestra visited South Africa to play at the Johannesburg Festival. The players were impressed by the dynamic director of the festival, Ernest Fleischmann, and engaged him as general secretary of the orchestra when the post fell vacant in 1959. He was the LSO&#x27;s first professional manager; all his predecessors as secretary/managing director had been orchestral players combining the duties with their orchestral playing.

===1960s===
To raise the profile and prestige of the orchestra, Fleischman strove to attract top soloists and conductors to work with the LSO. After Krips&#x27;s resignation the orchestra had worked with a few leading conductors, including Klemperer, Stokowski, Jascha Horenstein and Pierre Monteux, but also with many less eminent ones. Fleischmann later said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t difficult to change the list of conductors that the orchestra worked with, because one couldn&#x27;t do much worse, really&quot;. A rising conductor of a younger generation, Georg Solti, began working with the LSO; Fleischmann persuaded the management of the Vienna Festival to engage the LSO with Solti, Stokowski and Monteux for the 1961 Festwochen.
While in Vienna, Fleischmann persuaded Monteux to accept the chief conductorship of the orchestra. Though 86 years old, Monteux asked for, and received, a 25-year contract with a 25-year option of renewal. He lived for another three years, working with the LSO to within weeks of his death. Members of the LSO believed that in those few years he had transformed the orchestra; Neville Marriner said that Monteux &quot;made them feel like an international orchestra ... He gave them extended horizons and some of his achievements with the orchestra, both at home and abroad, gave them quite a different constitution.&quot; Announcing Monteux&#x27;s appointment, Fleischmann added that the LSO would also work frequently with Antal Doráti and the young Colin Davis.

Together with Tuckwell, chairman of the orchestra, Fleischmann worked to create the LSO Trust, a fund to finance tours and provide sick and holiday pay for LSO players, thus ending, as Morrison says, &quot;nearly sixty years of &#x27;no play, no pay&#x27; ... this was a revolution.&quot; They also pioneered formal sponsorship by commercial firms: the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Peter Stuyvesant&quot; concerts, underwritten by the tobacco company of that name, were given in London, Guildford, Bournemouth, Manchester and Swansea. The company also sponsored LSO commissions of new works by British composers.

In 1964, the LSO undertook its first world tour, taking in Israel, Turkey, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and the United States. The following year István Kertész was appointed principal conductor. Negotiations with the Corporation of the City of London with a view to establishing the LSO as the resident orchestra of the planned Barbican Centre began in the same year. In 1966 Leonard Bernstein conducted the LSO for the first time, in Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall. This was another coup for Fleischmann, who had to overcome Bernstein&#x27;s scorn for the inadequate rehearsal facilities endured by London orchestras. Bernstein remained associated with the LSO for the rest of his life, and was its president from 1987 to 1990.

Mindful of the enormous success of the Philharmonia Chorus, founded in 1957 by Legge to work with his Philharmonia Orchestra, the LSO decided to establish its own chorus. The LSO Chorus (later called the London Symphony Chorus) was formed in 1966 under John Alldis as chorus master. Its early years were difficult; Kertész did not get on with Alldis, and there were difficulties within the chorus. Most of its members were amateurs, but at first, they were reinforced by a small number of professionals. This led to disputes over the balance between amateurs and professionals. There was a brief crisis, after which the professional element was removed, and the LSO chorus became, and remains, an outstanding amateur chorus.

By 1967 many in the LSO felt that Fleischmann was seeking to exert too much influence on the affairs of the orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.

By the Previn era the LSO was being described as the finest of the London orchestras. A reviewer of an Elgar recording by one of the other orchestras remarked, &quot;these symphonies really deserve the LSO at its peak.&quot; The implication that the LSO was not always at its peak was illustrated when Sir Adrian Boult, who was recording Elgar and Vaughan Williams with the LSO, refused to continue when he discovered that five leading principals had absented themselves. EMI took Boult&#x27;s side, and the orchestra apologised.

===1970s and 80s===
In 1971, John Culshaw of BBC television commissioned &quot;André Previn&#x27;s Music Night&quot;, bringing classical music to a large new audience. Previn would talk informally direct to camera and then turn and conduct the LSO, whose members were dressed in casual sweaters or shirts rather than formal evening clothes. The programme attracted unprecedented viewing figures for classical music; Morrison writes, &quot;More British people heard the LSO play in &quot;Music Night&quot; in one week than in sixty-five years of LSO concerts.&quot; Several series of the programme were screened between 1971 and 1977. Previn&#x27;s popularity with the public enabled him and the LSO to programme works that under other conductors could have been box-office disasters, such as Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalila&quot; Symphony. In the early 1970s the LSO recorded two firsts for a British orchestra, appearing at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Previn, Seiji Ozawa and Karl Böhm, in 1973, and playing at the Hollywood Bowl the following year.
The lack of good rehearsal facilities to which Bernstein had objected was addressed in the 1970s when, jointly with the LPO, the LSO acquired and restored a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.

In 1978, two aspects of the LSO&#x27;s non-symphonic work were recognised. The orchestra shared in three Grammy awards for the score to &quot;Star Wars&quot;; and the LSO &quot;Classic Rock&quot; recordings, in the words of the orchestra&#x27;s website, became hugely popular and provided handsome royalties. The recordings led to &quot;Classic Rock&quot; tours by the orchestra, characterised by Morrison as &quot;enormously lucrative but artistically demeaning.&quot;

Claudio Abbado, principal guest conductor since 1971, succeeded Previn as chief conductor in the orchestra&#x27;s diamond jubilee year, 1979. In a 1988 study of the LSO in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine James Jolly wrote that Abbado was in many ways the antithesis of Previn in terms of style and repertoire, bringing to the orchestra a particular authority in the Austro-German classics as well as a commitment to the avant-garde. From the orchestra&#x27;s point of view there were disadvantages to his appointment. His relationship with the players was distant and he was unable to impose discipline on the orchestra in rehearsals. He insisted on conducting without a score, and many times this led to barely-avoided disaster in concerts. Abbado had considerable international prestige, but this too had its downside for the LSO: he frequently made his major recordings with the Boston or Chicago Symphony Orchestras or the Vienna Philharmonic. One of the LSO&#x27;s principals commented, &quot;Although we were sweating our guts playing those vast Mahler symphonies for ... Abbado, he would go and record them with other orchestras, which made us feel like second, maybe even third choice&quot;.

In 1982, the LSO took up residence at the Barbican. In the first years of the residency, the orchestra came close to financial disaster, primarily because of over-ambitious programming and the poor ticket sales that resulted. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that the LSO &quot;were tempted by their own need for challenge (and a siren chorus of critics) to begin a series of more modern and adventurous music: six nights a week of Tippett, Berlioz, Webern, Stockhausen designed to draw in a new public. Instead it put an old audience to flight.&quot; The LSO&#x27;s difficulties were compounded by the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, which ran a series of defamatory articles about the orchestra. The articles were almost wholly untrue and the magazine was forced to pay substantial libel damages, but in the short term serious damage was done to the orchestra&#x27;s reputation and morale.
In August 1984, the orchestra&#x27;s managing director, Peter Hemmings, resigned. For the first time since 1949, the orchestra appointed one of its players to the position. Clive Gillinson, a cellist, took over at a bad time in the LSO&#x27;s fortunes, and played a central role in turning them round. He negotiated what Morrison calls &quot;a dazzling series of mega-projects, each built around the personal enthusiasm of a &#x27;star&#x27; conductor or soloist&quot;, producing sell-out houses. In 1985 the orchestra mounted &quot;Mahler, Vienna and the Twentieth Century&quot;, planned by Abbado, followed the next year by an equally successful Bernstein festival.

During 1988 the orchestra adopted an education policy which included the establishment of &quot;LSO Discovery&quot;, offering &quot;people of all ages, from babies through music students to adults, an opportunity to get involved in music-making&quot;. The programme is still in place in 2022, benefiting more than 60,000 people every year.

In September 1988, Michael Tilson Thomas succeeded Abbado as chief conductor.

In 1989, the Royal Philharmonic Society established its Orchestra Award for &quot;excellence in playing and playing standards&quot;; the LSO was the first winner.

===1990s to the present===
The LSO visited Japan in 1990 with Bernstein and Tilson Thomas. The conductors and players took part in the inaugural Pacific Music Festival in Sapporo, teaching and giving masterclasses for 123 young musicians from 18 countries. Colin Matthews was appointed as the orchestra&#x27;s associate composer in 1991, and the following year Richard McNicol became LSO Discovery&#x27;s first music . Gillison secured increased funding from the Arts Council, the City of London Corporation and commercial sponsors, enabling the orchestra to set up a system of joint principals, attracting top musicians who could play in the LSO without having to give up their solo or chamber careers.

In 1993, the LSO again featured in a British television series, playing in &quot;Concerto!&quot; with Tilson Thomas and Dudley Moore. Among those appearing were Alicia de Larrocha, James Galway, Steven Isserlis, Barry Douglas, Richard Stoltzman and Kyoko Takezawa. The series received an Emmy Award. In 1994 the orchestra and the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), resident at the Barbican Theatre, came under threat from a new managing director of the Barbican Centre, Baroness O&#x27;Cathain, an economist with no cultural background. O&#x27;Cathain, described by Morrison as &quot;a Thatcherite free marketeer&quot;, dismissed the LSO and RSC as &quot;arty-farty types&quot;, and opposed public subsidy. Such was the press and public reaction that she was obliged to seek a vote of confidence from the LSO and RSC; failing to gain it, she resigned, and was succeeded by John Tusa, whom Morrison calls &quot;steeped in culture.&quot; The danger that the concert hall would become a conference centre was averted.
In 1995, Sir Colin Davis was appointed chief conductor. He had first conducted the LSO in 1959, and had been widely expected to succeed Monteux as principal conductor in 1964. Among the most conspicuous of Davis&#x27;s projects with the orchestra was the LSO&#x27;s most ambitious festival thus far, the &quot;Berlioz Odyssey&quot;, in which all Berlioz&#x27;s major works were given. The festival continued into 2000. Many of the performances, including &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, were recorded for the orchestra&#x27;s new CD label, LSO Live, launched in 2000. &quot;Les Troyens&quot; won two Grammy awards.

In 2003, with backing from the banking firm UBS, the orchestra opened LSO St Luke&#x27;s, its music education centre, in a former church near the Barbican. The following year the orchestra celebrated its centenary, with a gala concert attended by the LSO&#x27;s Patron, the Queen. After serving as managing director for 21 years, Clive Gillinson left to become chief executive of Carnegie Hall, New York. His successor was Kathryn McDowell.

In 2006, Daniel Harding joined Michael Tilson Thomas as principal guest conductor. At the end of 2006, Davis stood down as principal conductor and became president of the LSO in January 2007, its first since the death of Bernstein in 1990. Valery Gergiev became principal conductor of the LSO on 1 January 2007. In Gergiev&#x27;s first season in charge a complete cycle of Mahler Symphonies was given, with the Barbican Hall sold out for every concert. In 2009 Davis and the LSO celebrated 50 years of working together. In the same year the LSO took over from the Berlin Philharmonic as the resident orchestra at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, adding to a roster of international residences at venues including the Lincoln Center in New York, the Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Daytona Beach International Festival in Florida. In 2010 the LSO visited Poland and Abu Dhabi for the first time and made its first return to India since the 1964 world tour. The orchestra played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.

In March 2015, the LSO simultaneously announced the departure of Gergiev as principal conductor at the end of 2015, and the appointment of Sir Simon Rattle as its music director from September 2017, with an initial contract of five years. In February 2016, the orchestra announced that beginning with the 2016–17 season Gianandrea Noseda would be titled &quot;Principal Guest Conductor&quot; (joining the orchestra&#x27;s other Principal Guest Conductor, Daniel Harding, who held that post 2006-2017), and that Michael Tilson Thomas would be titled &quot;Conductor Laureate&quot; and Andre Previn would be titled &quot;Conductor Emeritus.&quot; In January 2021, the LSO announced an extension of Rattle&#x27;s contract as music director until the end of the 2023 season, at which time he is scheduled to stand down from the LSO and subsequently to take the title of conductor emeritus for life.

Sir Antonio Pappano first guest-conducted the LSO in 1996. In March 2021, the LSO announced his appointment as its next chief conductor, effective in September 2024. In February 2022, Barbara Hannigan was announced as &quot;Associate Artist&quot; for three years.

==Reputation==
The LSO has, on at least three occasions, been ranked as one of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras. In a 1988 &quot;Gramophone&quot; article James Jolly said of it: 
Some would claim ... that it is the most American of our orchestras, thinking no doubt of the Previn legacy, Bernstein&#x27;s Presidency and Tilson Thomas&#x27;s appointment. Others, looking back further to Pierre Monteux&#x27;s reign, think it our most French orchestra, a quality nurtured by Previn and latterly Claudio Abbado. But what of their essaying of the Slavonic repertoire under Istvan Kertész, or of Mahler, whose idiom has been finely honed by Abbado? No, the LSO remains enigmatic, unpredictable and supremely individual. Of all the London orchestras, the LSO seems to have more &quot;personalities&quot;, more &quot;individuals&quot; and has given the solo world more than its fair share of &quot;star&quot; performers. As an orchestra the LSO has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long (one thinks of Karajan in Berlin, Haitink in Amsterdam or Mravinsky in Leningrad) but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance.

For many years, the LSO had a reputation as an almost exclusively male ensemble (female harpists excepted). Morrison describes the LSO of the 1960s and 1970s as &quot;a rambunctious boys&#x27; club that swaggered round the globe.&quot; Before the 1970s one of the few women to play in the orchestra was the oboist Evelyn Rothwell, who joined in the 1930s and found herself regarded as an outsider by her male colleagues. She was not admitted to full membership of the orchestra: the first woman to be elected as a member of the LSO was Renata Scheffel-Stein in 1975. By that time other British orchestras had left the LSO far behind in this regard.

By 2004, about 20 per cent of the LSO&#x27;s members were women. Some musicians, including Davis, judged that this improved the orchestra&#x27;s playing as well as its behaviour. Others, including Previn and the veteran principal trumpet Maurice Murphy, felt that although the technical standard of playing had improved, the diminution of the orchestra&#x27;s machismo was a matter for regret. Comparing the LSO of 2004 with the orchestra of the 1960s and 1970s, Murphy said, &quot;Now the strings have improved so much, the playing is fantastic, but it has lost something of its gung-ho quality.&quot; The orchestra of the 1960s had a reputation for tormenting conductors it disliked; even such notorious martinets as George Szell were given a hard time. By the 21st century the orchestra had long abandoned such aggression; civilities were maintained even with conductors whom the orchestra took against: they were simply never re-engaged.

==Recordings==
===Audio===
The LSO has made recordings since the early days of recording, beginning with acoustic versions under Nikisch of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot; Overture, Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot; Overture, and Liszt&#x27;s Hungarian Rhapsody in F minor, followed soon after by the overtures to &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27;s Fred Gaisberg, who supervised the sessions, wrote of &quot;virtuoso playing which was unique at that time&quot;. Since then, according to the orchestra&#x27;s website, the LSO has made more recordings than any other orchestra, a claim endorsed by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine. In 1920 the LSO signed a three-year contract with the Columbia Graphophone Company and what Jolly calls &quot;a magnificent series of recordings&quot; followed. Under Felix Weingartner the orchestra recorded Mozart (Symphony No 39), Beethoven (the Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Symphonies) and Brahms&#x27;s First. Other recordings from this period included the premiere recording of Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, conducted by the composer, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; and &quot;Tod und Verklärung&quot;, likewise conducted by their composer.

When Elgar recorded his major works for His Master&#x27;s Voice in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the LSO was chosen for most of the recordings. The LSO&#x27;s pre-war recordings for Decca include Hamilton Harty&#x27;s version of Walton&#x27;s First Symphony, of which &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine said, &quot;There are one or two moments where the LSO are audibly hanging on by the skin of their teeth, but these moments simply add to the ferocious impact of the music&quot;.

In the 1950s and early 1960s, EMI generally made its British recordings with the Royal Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras; the LSO&#x27;s recordings were chiefly for Decca, including a Sibelius symphony cycle with Anthony Collins, French music under Monteux, early recordings by Solti, and a series of Britten&#x27;s major works, conducted by the composer. Of the later 1960s Jolly writes, &quot;Istvan Kertész&#x27;s three-year Principal Conductorship has left a treasure trove of memorable and extraordinarily resilient recordings – the Dvořák symphonies are still competitive ... and his classic disc of Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Duke Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; admirably demonstrates what a superb ensemble the LSO were under his baton.&quot;

Since 2000, the LSO has published commercial CD recordings on its own label, LSO Live. Recordings are made live at the Barbican hall over several dates and are edited in post-production. Initially available on CD they have since been issued on Super Audio CD and also as downloads. LSO Live has published more than 70 recordings featuring conductors including Gergiev, Davis and Bernard Haitink. Gergiev&#x27;s version of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Disc of the Year in 2011, and Davis&#x27;s discs of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; and &quot;Les Troyens&quot; and Dvořák&#x27;s Eighth Symphony were BBC Radio 3&#x27;s top recommendations in comparative reviews of all available versions.

===Film===

Even in the era of silent films the LSO was associated with the cinema. During the 1920s the orchestra played scores arranged and conducted by Eugene Goossens to accompany screenings of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1922), &quot;The Nibelungs&quot; (1924), &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Life of Beethoven&quot; (1929).

Since 1935 the LSO has recorded the musical scores of more than 200 films. The orchestra owed its engagement for its first soundtrack sessions to Muir Mathieson, musical director of Korda Studios. On the LSO&#x27;s website, the film specialist Robert Rider calls Mathieson &quot;the most important single figure in the early history of British film music, who enlisted Bliss to write a score for &quot;Things to Come&quot;, and who was subsequently responsible for bringing the most eminent British 20th-century composers to work for cinema.&quot; Mathieson described the LSO as &quot;the perfect film orchestra&quot;. Among the composers commissioned by Mathieson for LSO soundtracks were Vaughan Williams, Walton, Britten and Malcolm Arnold and lighter composers including Eric Coates and Noël Coward.

As a pinnacle of Mathieson&#x27;s collaboration with the LSO, Rider cites the 1946 film &quot;Instruments of the Orchestra&quot;, a film record of the LSO at work. Sargent conducted the orchestra in a performance of Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot;, composed for the film. Rider adds, &quot;Mathieson&#x27;s documentary, with its close-ups of the musicians and their instruments, beautifully captures the vibrancy and texture of the Orchestra amidst the optimism of the post-Second World War era.&quot;

Another milestone in the LSO&#x27;s history in film music was in 1977 with the recording of John Williams&#x27;s score for the first of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Rider comments that this film and its sequels &quot;attracted a new group of admirers and consolidated the period of film music activity for the Orchestra, which continues unabated to this day&quot;. The LSO also recorded other Williams film scores, including &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978) and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and six of the eight films from the Harry Potter film series.

== Premieres of New Music ==

<text>Price discrimination (&quot;differential pricing&quot;, &quot;equity pricing&quot;, &quot;preferential pricing&quot;, &quot;dual pricing&quot;, &quot;tiered pricing&quot;, and &quot;surveillance pricing&quot;) is a microeconomic pricing strategy where identical or largely similar goods or services are sold at different prices by the same provider to different buyers based on which market segment they are perceived to be part of. Price discrimination is distinguished from product differentiation by the difference in production cost for the differently priced products involved in the latter strategy. Price discrimination essentially relies on the variation in customers&#x27; willingness to pay and in the elasticity of their demand. For price discrimination to succeed, a seller must have market power, such as a dominant market share, product uniqueness, sole pricing power, etc.

Some prices under price discrimination may be lower than the price charged by a single-price monopolist. Price discrimination can be utilized by a monopolist to recapture some deadweight loss. This pricing strategy enables sellers to capture additional consumer surplus and maximize their profits while offering some consumers lower prices.

Price discrimination can take many forms and is common in many industries, such as travel, education, telecommunications, and healthcare.

== Legality ==

Many forms of price discrimination are legal, but in some cases charging consumers different prices for the same goods is illegal. For example, in the United States, the Robinson–Patman Act makes price discrimination illegal in certain anti-competitive interstate sale of commodities.

== Types ==
Within the broader domain of price differentiation, a common classification dating to the 1920s, is:

* &quot;Personalized pricing&quot; (or first-degree price differentiation) – selling to each customer at a different price; this is also called one-to-one marketing. The optimal incarnation of this is called &quot;perfect price discrimination&quot; and maximizes the price that each customer is willing to pay. As such, in &quot;first degree&quot; price differentiation the entire consumer surplus is captured for each individual.
* &quot;Product versioning&quot; or simply &quot;versioning&quot; (or &quot;second-degree&quot; price differentiation) – offering a product line by creating slightly differentiated products for the purpose of price differentiation, i.e. a vertical product line. Another name given to versioning is &quot;menu pricing&quot;.
* &quot;Group pricing&quot; (or &quot;third-degree&quot; price differentiation) – dividing the market into segments and charging a different price to each segment (but the same price to each member of that segment). This is essentially a heuristic approximation that simplifies the problem in face of the difficulties with personalized pricing. Typical examples include student and senior discounts.

==Theoretical basis==
In a theoretical market with perfect information, perfect substitutes, and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange (or re-selling) to prevent arbitrage, price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets, where market power can be exercised. Without market power when the price is higher than the market equilibrium, consumers will switch to sellers selling at the market equilibrium. Moreover, when the seller tries to sell the same good at differentiating prices, the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price with a small discount from the higher price.

Price discrimination requires market segmentation and some means to discourage discount customers from becoming resellers and, by extension, competitors. This usually entails preventing any resale: keeping the different price groups separate, making price comparisons difficult, or restricting pricing information. The boundary set up by the marketer to keep segments separate is referred to as a &quot;rate fence&quot; (a rule that allows consumers to segment themselves based on their needs, behaviour, and willingness to pay). Price discrimination is thus very common in services where resale is not possible; an example is student discounts at museums: Students may get lower prices than others, but do not become resellers, because the service is consumed at point of sale. Another example of price discrimination is intellectual property, enforced by law and by technology. In the market for DVDs, laws require DVD players to be designed and produced with hardware or software that prevents inexpensive copying or playing of content purchased legally elsewhere in the world at a lower price. In the US the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments.

Price discrimination attempts to capture as much consumer surplus as possible. By understanding the elasticity of demand in various segments, a business can price to maximize sales in each segment. When a seller identifies a consumer (or group) that has a lower willingness to pay, price discrimination maximizes profits.

== Market power ==
=== Degrees ===
Market power refers to the ability of a seller to increase price without losing share (sales). Factors that affect market power include:

* Number of competitors
* Product differentiation between suppliers
* Entry restrictions

The degree of market power can usually be divided into 4 categories (listed in the table below in order of increasing market power):

Since price discrimination is dependent on a seller&#x27;s market power, monopolies use price discrimination, however, oligopolies can also use price discrimination when the risk of arbitrage and consumers moving to other competitors is low.

=== Oligopolies ===
When the dominant companies in an oligopoly compete on price, inter-temporal price discrimination (charging a high price initially, then lowering it over time) may be adopted.

Price discrimination can lower profits. For instance, when oligopolies offer a lower price to consumers with high price elasticity (lower disposable income) they compete with other sellers to capture the market until a lower profit is retained. Hence, oligopolies may opt to not use price discrimination.

== Degrees ==
===First degree: perfect price discrimination===
Exercising first degree (or perfect or primary) price discrimination requires the seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price (or reservation price) that every consumer is willing to pay. By knowing the reservation price, the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay (greater or equal to the marginal cost), and thus fully capture consumer surplus. The resulting profit is equal to the sum of consumer surplus and seller surplus. This is the most profitable realm as each consumer buys the good at the highest price they are willing to pay. The marginal consumer is the one whose reservation price equals the seller&#x27;s marginal cost. Sellers that engage in first degree price discrimination produce more product than they would otherwise. Hence first degree price discrimination can eliminate deadweight loss that occurs in monopolistic markets. Examples of first degree price discrimination can be observed in markets where consumers bid for tenders, though, in this case, the practice of collusive tendering could reduce the market efficiency.

===Second degree: quantity discount===
In second-degree price discrimination, the price of the same good varies according to the quantity demanded. It usually comes in the form of a quantity discount that exploits the law of diminishing marginal utility. Diminishing marginal utility claims that consumer utility decreases (diminish) with each successive unit consumed (think bonbons). By offering a quantity discount for a larger quantity the seller is able to capture some of the consumer surplus. This is because diminishing marginal utility may mean the consumer would not be willing to purchase an additional unit without a discount since the marginal utility received from the good or service is no longer greater than the price. However, by offering a discount the seller can capture some of consumers surplus by encouraging them to purchase an additional unit at a discounted price. This is particularly widespread in sales to industrial customers, where bulk buyers enjoy discounts.

Mobile phone plans and subscriptions are instances of second-degree price discrimination. Consumers usually require a one-year subscription to be less expensive than a monthly one. Whether or not consumers need the longer subscription, they are more likely to accept one if the cost is less.

===Third degree: market segregation===
Third-degree price discrimination means charging a different price to a group of consumers based on their different elasticities of demand: the less elastic group is charged a higher price. For example, rail and tube (subway) travelers can be subdivided into commuters and casual travelers, and cinema goers can be subdivided into adults and children. Splitting the market into peak and off-peak use of service is common and occurs with energy and cinema tickets, as well as gym membership and parking.

In order to offer different prices for different groups of people in the aggregate market, the seller has to group its consumers. Prices must be set prices to match to buyer preferences. Sub-markets must be separated by time, physical distance, nature of use, etc. For example, back-to-school pricing may be lower than in other seasons. The markets must be structured so that buyers who purchase at the lower price in the elastic sub-market cannot resell at a higher price in the inelastic sub-market.

===Two-part tariff (razor and blades)===
The two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination wherein the seller charges a low (loss-making) initial fee in hopes of freezing consumer choice while charging a higher secondary fee for continuing to use the product. This pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination. The two-part tariff increases welfare because the monopolistic markup is eliminated. However, an upstream monopolist may set higher secondary prices, which may reduce welfare.

An example of two-part tariff pricing is in the market for razors. The customer pays an initial cost for the razor and then pays for replacement blades. This pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right: since the customer has already paid for the initial blade holder and will continue to buy the blades as long as they are cheaper than alternatives.

===Combination===
These types are not mutually exclusive. Thus a seller may vary pricing by location, while offering bulk discounts as well. Airlines combine types, including:

* Bulk discounts to wholesalers, consolidators, and tour operators
* Incentive discounts for higher sales volumes to travel agents and corporate buyers
* Seasonal discounts, incentive discounts, and location-sensitive prices. The price of a flight from say, Singapore to Beijing can vary widely if one buys the ticket in Singapore compared to Beijing (or New York or Tokyo or elsewhere).
* Discounted tickets requiring advance purchase and/or Saturday stays. Both restrictions have the effect of excluding business travelers, who typically arrange trips on shorter notice.

===User-controlled ===
While conventional theory generally assumes that prices are set by the seller, in one variant prices are set by the buyer, such as pay what you want pricing. Such user-controlled price discrimination exploits similar ability to adapt to varying demand curves or individual price sensitivities, and may avoid the negative perceptions of price discrimination when imposed by a seller.

In the matching markets, the platforms will internalize the impacts in revenue to create a cross-side effects. In return, this cross-side effect will differentiate price discrimination in matching intermediation from the standard markets.

==Png taxonomy==
The first/second/third degree taxonomy of price discrimination is due to Pigou. However, these categories are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Ivan Png suggests an alternative taxonomy:

* Complete discrimination: seller prices each unit at a different price, so that each user purchases up to the point where the user&#x27;s marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the item;

* Direct segmentation: seller conditions price on some attribute (e.g., age or gender) that &quot;directly&quot; segments the buyers;

* Indirect segmentation: seller relies on some proxy (e.g., package size, usage quantity, coupon) to structure a choice that &quot;indirectly&quot; segments the buyers;

* Uniform pricing: seller sets a single price for each unit of the product.

The hierarchycomplete/direct/indirect/uniform pricingis in decreasing order of profitability and information requirement. Complete price discrimination is most profitable, but requires the seller to have the most information about buyers. Next most profitable and in information requirement is direct segmentation, followed by indirect segmentation. Finally, uniform pricing is the least profitable and requires the least information about buyers.

==Consumer surplus==

The purpose of price discrimination is to increase profits by capturing consumer surplus. This surplus arises because, in a market with a single clearing price, some customers (the very low price elasticity segment) would have been prepared to pay more than the market price. Price discrimination transfers some of this surplus from the consumer to the seller. In a perfectly competitive market, price discrimination is not possible, because attempts to increase price for some buyers would be undercut by the competition.

Consumer surplus need not exist, for example in monopolistic markets where the seller can price above the market clearing price. Alternatively, should fixed costs or economies of scale raise the marginal cost of adding more consumers higher than the marginal profit from selling more product, consumer surplus may be captured by the seller. This means that charging some consumers less than an even share of costs can be beneficial. An example is a high-speed internet connection shared by two consumers in a single building; if one is willing to pay less than half the cost of connecting the building, and the other willing to make up the rest but not to pay the entire cost, then price discrimination can allow the purchase to take place. However, this will cost the consumers as much or more than if they pooled their money to pay a non-discriminating price. If the consumer is considered to be the building, then a consumer surplus goes to the inhabitants.

A seller facing a downward sloping demand curve that is convex to the origin always obtains higher revenues under price discrimination than under uniform pricing. In the top diagram, a single price formula_1 is available to all customers. The amount of revenue is represented by area formula_2. The consumer surplus is the area above line segment formula_3 but below the demand curve formula_4.

With price discrimination, (the bottom diagram), the demand curve is divided into segments (formula_5 and formula_6). A higher price formula_7 is charged to the low elasticity segment, and a lower price formula_8 is charged to the high elasticity segment. The total revenue from the first segment is equal to the area formula_9. The total revenue from the second segment is equal to the area formula_10. The sum of these areas will always be greater than formula_2, assuming the demand curve resembles a rectangular hyperbola with unitary elasticity. The more prices that are introduced, the greater the sum of the revenue areas, and the more of the consumer surplus is captured by the seller.

The above requires both first and second degree price discrimination: the right segment corresponds partly to different people than the left segment, partly to the same people, willing to buy more if the product is cheaper.

It is useful for the seller to determine the optimum prices in each market segment. This is shown in the next diagram where each segment is treated as a separate market with its own demand curve. As usual, the profit maximizing output (Qt) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve (MC) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market (MRt).

The seller decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue (profit maximization). This output is then divided between the two markets, at the equilibrium marginal revenue level. Therefore, the optimum outputs are formula_12 and formula_13. From the demand curve in each market the profit can be determined maximizing prices of formula_14 and formula_15.

The marginal revenue in both markets at the optimal output levels must be equal, otherwise the seller could profit from transferring output to whichever market is offering higher marginal revenue.

Given that Market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of formula_16 and Market 2 of formula_17, the optimal pricing ration in Market 1 versus Market 2 is formula_18.

The price in a perfectly competitive market will always be lower than any price under price discrimination (including in special cases like the internet connection example above, assuming that the perfectly competitive market allows consumers to pool their resources). In a market with perfect competition, no price discrimination is possible, and the average total cost (ATC) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve (MC). The price will be the intersection of this ATC/MC curve and the demand line (Dt). The consumer thus buys the product at the cheapest price at which any manufacturer can produce any quantity.

Price discrimination is a sign that the market is imperfect, the seller has some monopoly power, and that prices and seller profits are higher than they would be in a perfectly competitive market.

== Comparisons ==
===Advantages ===

* Sellers that hold some market power can increase their revenue.
* Lower prices (for some) than in a one-price market. Even the lowest &quot;discounted&quot; prices are higher than the price in a competitive market, which is equal to marginal cost. For example, trains tend to be near-monopolies (see natural monopoly). Seniors may get lower train fares than under uniform pricing, because the train operator knows that old people are more likely to be price-elastic buyers. Customers willing to spend time in researching ‘special offers’ get lower prices; their effort acts as an honest signal of their price-sensitivity, reducing their consumer surplus by the value of the time spent hunting.

===Critiques ===

* Higher prices. Under price discrimination, all consumers pay a higher price than in a competitive market. Some consumers also pay higher prices than in a single-price monopoly. 
* Decline in consumer surplus. Price discrimination enables a transfer of money from consumers to sellers.
* Fairness. For example, adults paying a higher price could be unemployed, while senior buyers could be well off.
* Administration costs. Distinguishing submarkets increase (fixed) costs, which could lead to higher prices.

==Examples==
===Retail price discrimination===
Manufacturers may sell their products to similarly situated retailers at different prices based solely on the volume of products purchased. Sometimes, the seller investigate the consumers’ purchase histories which would show the customer&#x27;s unobserved willingness to pay. Each customer has a purchasing score which indicates his or her preferences; consequently, the seller will be able to set the price for the individual customer at the point that minimizes the consumer surplus. Oftentimes, consumers are not aware of the ways to manipulate that score. If he or she wants to do to so, he or she could reduce the demand to reduce the average equilibrium price, which will reduce the seller&#x27;s price discriminating strategy. It is an instance of third-degree price discrimination.

===Travel industry===
Airlines and other travel companies regularly use differentiated pricing to sell travel products and services to different market segments. This is done by assigning capacity to various booking classes with different prices and fare restrictions. These restrictions ensure that market segments buy within their designated booking class range. For example, schedule-sensitive business passengers willing to pay $300 for a seat from city A to city B cannot purchase a $150 ticket because the $150 booking class has restrictions, such as a Saturday-night stay or a 15-day advance purchase, that discourage or prevent sales to business passengers. However, &quot;the seat&quot; is not always the same product. A business person may be willing to pay $300 for a seat on a high-demand morning flight with full refundability and the ability to upgrade to first class for a nominal fee. On the same flight, price-sensitive passengers may not be willing to pay $300 but are willing to fly on a lower-demand flight or via a connection city and forgo refundability.

An airline may also apply differential pricing to &quot;the same seat&quot; over time by discounting the price for early or late bookings and weekend purchases. This is part of an airline&#x27;s strategy to segment price-sensitive leisure travelers from price-inelastic business travelers. This could present an arbitrage opportunity in the absence of restrictions on reselling, but passenger name changes are typically prevented or financially penalized.

An airline may also apply directional price discrimination by charging different roundtrip fares based on passenger origins. For example, passengers originating from City A, with a per capita income $30,000 higher than City B, may pay $5400–$12900 more than those from City B. This is due to airlines segmenting passenger price sensitivity based on the income of route endpoints. Since airlines often fly multi-leg flights and no-show rates vary by segment, competition for seats takes into account the spatial dynamics of the product. Someone trying to fly A-B is competing with people trying to fly A-C through city B on the same aircraft. Airlines use yield management technology to determine how many seats to allot for A-B, B-C, and A-B-C passengers at varying fares, demands, and no-show rates.

With the rise of the Internet and low fare airlines, airfare pricing transparency has increased. Passengers can easily compare fares across flights and airlines, putting pressure on airlines to lower fares. In the recession following the September 11, 2001 attacks, business travelers made it clear they would not buy air travel at rates high enough to subsidize lower fares for non-business travelers. This prediction has come true as many business travelers now buy economy class airfares for business travel.

Finally, there are sometimes group discounts on rail tickets and passes (second-degree price discrimination).

=== Coupons ===
The use of coupons in retail is an attempt to distinguish customers by their reserve price. The assumption is that people who go through the trouble of collecting coupons have greater price sensitivity than those who do not. Thus, making coupons available enables, for instance, breakfast cereal makers to charge higher prices to price-insensitive customers, while still making some profit off customers who are more price-sensitive.

Another example can also be seen in how to collect grocery store coupons before the existence of digital coupons. Grocery store coupons were usually available in the free newspapers or magazines placed at the entrance of the stores. As coupons have a negative relationship with time, customers with a high value of time will not find it worthwhile to spend 20 minutes in order to save $5 only. Meanwhile, customers with a low value of time will be satisfied by getting $5 less from their purchase as they tend to be more price-sensitive. It is an instance of third-degree price discrimination.

===Premium pricing===
For certain products, premium products are priced at a level (compared to &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;economy&quot; products) that is well beyond their marginal cost of production. For example, a coffee chain may price regular coffee at $1, but &quot;premium&quot; coffee at $2.50 (where the respective costs of production may be $0.90 and $1.25). Economists such as Tim Harford in &quot;The Undercover Economist&quot; have argued that this is a form of price discrimination: by providing a choice between a regular and premium product, consumers are being asked to reveal their degree of price sensitivity (or willingness to pay) for comparable products. Similar techniques are used in pricing business class airline tickets and premium alcoholic drinks, for example.They are examples of the third-degree price discrimination.

This effect can lead to (seemingly) perverse incentives for the seller. If, for example, potential business class customers will pay a large price differential only if economy class seats are uncomfortable while economy class customers are more sensitive to price than comfort, airlines may have substantial incentives to purposely make economy seating uncomfortable. In the example of coffee, a restaurant may gain more economic profit by making poor quality regular coffeemore profit is gained from up-selling to premium customers than is lost from customers who refuse to purchase inexpensive but poor quality coffee. In such cases, the net social utility should also account for the &quot;lost&quot; utility to consumers of the regular product, although determining the magnitude of this foregone utility may not be feasible.

===Segmentation by age group, student status, ethnicity and citizenship===
Many movie theaters, amusement parks, tourist attractions, and other places have different admission prices per market segment: typical groupings are Youth/Child, Student, Adult, Senior Citizen, Local and Foreigner. Each of these groups typically have a much different demand curve. Children, people living on student wages, and people living on retirement generally have much less disposable income. Foreigners may be perceived as being more wealthy than locals and therefore being capable of paying more for goods and services – sometimes this can be even 35 times as much. Market stall-holders and individual public transport providers may also insist on higher prices for their goods and services when dealing with foreigners (sometimes called the &quot;White Man Tax&quot;). Some goods – such as housing – may be offered at cheaper prices for certain ethnic groups.

===Discounts for members of certain occupations===
Some businesses may offer reduced prices members of some occupations, such as school teachers (see below), police and military personnel. In addition to increased sales to the target group, businesses benefit from the resulting positive publicity, leading to increased sales to the general public.

===Incentives for industrial buyers===

Many methods exist to incentivize wholesale or industrial buyers. These may be quite targeted, as they are designed to generate specific activity, such as buying more frequently, buying more regularly, buying in bigger quantities, buying new products with established ones, and so on. They may also be designed to reduce the administrative and finance costs of processing each transaction. Thus, there are bulk discounts, special pricing for long-term commitments, non-peak discounts, discounts on high-demand goods to incentivize buying lower-demand goods, rebates, and many others. This can help the relations between the sellers involved. It&#x27;s the example of the second-price discrimination.

===Gender-based examples===

Gender-based price discrimination is the practice of offering identical or similar services and products to men and women at different prices when the cost of producing the products and services is the same. In the United States, gender-based price discrimination has been a source of debate. In 1992, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (&quot;DCA&quot;) conducted an investigation of &quot;price bias against women in the marketplace&quot;. The DCA&#x27;s investigation concluded that women paid more than men at used car dealers, dry cleaners, and hair salons. The DCA&#x27;s research on gender pricing in New York City brought national attention to gender-based price discrimination and the financial impact it has on women.

With consumer products, differential pricing is usually not based explicitly on the actual gender of the purchaser, but is achieved implicitly by the use of differential packaging, labelling, or colour schemes designed to appeal to male or female consumers. In many cases, where the product is marketed to make an attractive gift, the gender of the purchaser may be different from that of the end user.

In 1995, California Assembly&#x27;s Office of Research studied the issue of gender-based price discrimination of services and estimated that women effectively paid an annual &quot;gender tax&quot; of approximately $1,351.00 for the same services as men. It was also estimated that women, over the course of their lives, spend thousands of dollars more than men to purchase similar products. For example, prior to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&quot;Affordable Care Act&quot;), health insurance companies charged women higher premiums for individual health insurance policies than men. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies are now required to offer the same premium price to all applicants of the same age and geographical locale without regard to gender. However, there is no federal law banning gender-based price discrimination in the sale of products. Instead, several cities and states have passed legislation prohibiting gender-based price discrimination on products and services.

In Europe, motor insurance premiums have historically been higher for men than for women, a practice that the insurance industry attempts to justify on the basis of different levels of risk. The EU has banned this practice; however, there is evidence that it is being replaced by &quot;proxy discrimination&quot;, that is, discrimination on the basis of factors that are strongly correlated with gender: for example, charging construction workers more than midwives.

In Chinese retail automobile market, researchers found that male buyers pay less than female buyers for cars with the same characteristics. Although this research documented the existence of price discrimination between locals and non-locals, local men still receive $221.63 discount more than local women and non-local men receive $330.19 discount more than non-local women. The discount represents approximately 10% of average personal budget, considering the per capita GDP for 2018.

===International price discrimination===
Pharmaceutical companies may charge customers living in wealthier countries a much higher price than for identical drugs in poorer nations, as is the case with the sale of antiretroviral drugs in Africa. Since the purchasing power of African consumers is much lower, sales would be extremely limited without price discrimination. The ability of pharmaceutical companies to maintain price differences between countries is often either reinforced or hindered by national drugs laws and regulations, or the lack thereof.

Even online sales for non material goods, which do not have to be shipped, may change according to the geographic location of the buyer, such as music streaming services by Spotify and Apple Music. The users in lower-income countries benefit from price discrimination by paying fewer subscription fees than those in higher-income countries. The researchers also found that the cross-national price differences actually raise the revenue of those companies by about 6% while reducing world users’ welfare by 1%.

===Academic pricing===
Companies will often offer discounted goods and software to students and faculty at school and university levels. These may be labeled as academic versions, but perform the same as the full price retail software. Some academic software may have differing licenses than retail versions, usually disallowing their use in activities for profit or expiring the license after a given number of months. This also has the characteristics of an &quot;initial offer&quot; – that is, the profits from an academic customer may come partly in the form of future non-academic sales due to vendor lock-in.

===Sliding scale fees===
Sliding scale fees are when different customers are charged different prices based on their income, which is used as a proxy for their willingness or ability to pay. For example, some nonprofit law sellers charge on a sliding scale based on income and family size. Thus the clients paying a higher price at the top of the fee scale help subsidize the clients at the bottom of the scale. This differential pricing enables the nonprofit to serve a broader segment of the market than they could if they only set one price.

===Weddings===
Goods and services for weddings are sometimes priced at a higher rate than identical goods for normal customers. The wedding venues and services are usually priced differently depending on the wedding date. For instance, if the wedding is held during the peak seasons (school holidays or festive seasons), the price will be higher than in the off-season wedding months.

===Obstetric service===
The welfare consequences of price discrimination were assessed by testing the differences in mean prices paid by patients from three income groups: low, middle and high. The results suggest that two different forms of price discrimination for obstetric services occurred in both these hospitals. First, there was price discrimination according to income, with the poorer users benefiting from a higher discount rate than richer ones. Secondly, there was price discrimination according to social status, with three high status occupational groups (doctors, senior government officials, and large businessmen) having the highest probability of receiving some level of discount.

===Pharmaceutical industry===
Price discrimination is common in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug-makers charge more for drugs in wealthier countries. For example, drug prices in the United States are some of the highest in the world. Europeans, on average, pay only 56% of what Americans pay for the same prescription drugs.

===Textbooks===
Price discrimination is also prevalent within the textbook publishing industry. Prices for textbooks are much higher in the United States despite the fact that they are produced in the country. Copyright protection laws increase the price of textbooks. Also, textbooks are mandatory in the United States while schools in other countries see them as study aids.

===Two necessary conditions for price discrimination===
There are two conditions that must be met if a price discrimination scheme is to work. First the seller must be able to identify market segments by their price elasticity of demand and second the sellers must be able to enforce the scheme. For example, airlines routinely engage in price discrimination by charging high prices for customers with relatively inelastic demand – business travelers – and discount prices for tourist who have relatively elastic demand. The airlines enforce the scheme by enforcing a no resale policy on the tickets preventing a tourist from buying a ticket at a discounted price and selling it to a business traveler (arbitrage). Airlines must also prevent business travelers from directly buying discount tickets. Airlines accomplish this by imposing advance ticketing requirements or minimum stay requirementsconditions that would be difficult for the average business traveler to meet.

=== Concession and student discounts ===
Sellers often use third degree price discrimination concession and student segments in the market. By offering a perceived discount to market segments which generally have less disposable income, and hence are more price sensitive, the seller is able to capture the revenue from those with higher price sensitivity whilst also charging higher prices and capturing the consumer surplus of the segments with less price sensitivity.

===Counterexamples===
Some pricing patterns appear to be price discrimination but are not.

====Congestion pricing====

Price discrimination only happens when the &quot;same&quot; product is sold at more than one price. Congestion pricing is not price discrimination. Peak and off-peak fares on a train are not the same product; some people have to travel during rush hour, and travelling off-peak is not equivalent to them.

Some companies have high fixed costs (like a train operator, which owns a railway and rolling stock, or a restaurant, which has to pay for premises and equipment). If these fixed costs permit the operator to additionally provide less-preferred products (like mid-morning meals or off-peak rail travel) at little additional cost, it can profit both seller and buyer to offer them at lower prices. Providing more product from the same fixed costs increases both producer and consumer surplus. This is not technically price discrimination (unlike, say, giving menus with higher prices to richer-looking customers, which the poorer-looking ones get an ordinary menu).

If different prices are charged for products that only some consumers will see as equivalent, the differential pricing can be used to manage demand. For instance, airlines can use price discrimination to encourage people to travel at unpopular times (early in the morning). This helps avoid over-crowding and helps to spread out demand. The airline gets better use out of planes and airports, and can thus charge less (or profit more) than if it only flew peak hours.

<doc id="156261" wikidata="Q315715" url="?curid=156261" title="Los Angeles Philharmonic">
<text>The Los Angeles Philharmonic (LA Phil) is an American orchestra based in Los Angeles, California. The orchestra holds a regular concert season from October until June at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and a summer season at the Hollywood Bowl from July until September. Gustavo Dudamel is the current Musical Director, while Esa-Pekka Salonen serves as Conductor Laureate, Zubin Mehta as Conductor Emeritus, and Susanna Mälkki as Principal Guest Conductor. John Adams is the orchestra’s current Composer-in-Residence.

This orchestra has been received well among critics, with some stating it as &quot;contemporary minded&quot;, &quot;forward thinking&quot;, &quot;talked about and innovative&quot;, and &quot;venturesome and admired&quot;. &quot;We are interested in the future&quot;, Conductor Salonen said, &quot;We are not trying to re-create the glories of the past, like so many other symphony orchestras&quot;.

The orchestra&#x27;s former chief executive officer, Deborah Borda, said, &quot;Our intention has been to integrate 21st-century music into the orchestra&#x27;s everyday activity, especially since we moved into the new hall&quot;.

Since the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 23, 2003, the Los Angeles Philharmonic has presented 57 world premieres, one North American premiere, and 26 U.S. premieres, and has commissioned or co-commissioned 63 new works.

==History==

=== 1919–1933: Founding the Philharmonic ===

The orchestra was founded and single-handedly financed in 1919 by William Andrews Clark, Jr., a copper baron, arts enthusiast, and part-time violinist. He originally asked Sergei Rachmaninoff to be the Philharmonic&#x27;s first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected Walter Henry Rothwell, former assistant to Gustav Mahler, as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony. The orchestra played its first concert in the Trinity Auditorium in the same year, eleven days after its first rehearsal. Clark himself would sometimes sit and play with the second violin section.

After Rothwell&#x27;s death in 1927, subsequent Music Directors in the decade of the 1920s included Georg Schnéevoigt and Artur Rodziński.

===1933–1950: Harvey Mudd rescues orchestra===
Otto Klemperer became Music Director in 1933, part of the large group of German emigrants fleeing Nazi Germany. He conducted many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to new works by Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg. The orchestra responded well to his leadership, but Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes.

The situation grew more challenging when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created with the goal to stabilize the orchestra&#x27;s funding, with the association&#x27;s president, Harvey Mudd, stepping up to personally guarantee Klemperer&#x27;s salary. The Philharmonic&#x27;s concerts at the Hollywood Bowl also brought in much needed revenue. As a result, the orchestra navigated the challenges of the Great Depression and remained intact.

After completing the 1939 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl, Klemperer visited Boston, where he was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma. Brain surgery left him partially paralyzed in the face and with impaired hearing in his right ear. He went into a depressive state and was institutionalized. When he escaped, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a cover story declaring him missing. After he was found in New Jersey, a picture of him behind bars was printed in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He subsequently lost the post of Music Director, though he still would occasionally conduct the Philharmonic. He led some notable concerts, including the orchestra&#x27;s premiere performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; in 1946.

John Barbirolli was offered the position of Music Director after his contract with the New York Philharmonic expired in 1942. He declined the offer and chose to return to England instead. The following year, Alfred Wallenstein was chosen by Mudd to lead the orchestra. The former principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, he had been the youngest member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when it was founded in 1919. He turned to conducting at the suggestion of Arturo Toscanini. He had conducted the L.A. Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl on a number of occasions and, in 1943, took over as Music Director. Among the highlights of Wallenstein&#x27;s tenure were recordings of concertos with fellow Angelenos, Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein.

===1951–1968: Dorothy Buffum Chandler&#x27;s influence===
By the mid-1950s, department store heiress and wife of the publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Dorothy Buffum Chandler became the de facto leader of the orchestra&#x27;s board of directors. She led on efforts to create a performing arts center for the city, which would eventually become the Los Angeles Music Center and serve as the Philharmonic&#x27;s new home. In addition, she and others sought a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra. Following Wallenstein&#x27;s departure, Chandler led efforts to hire Eduard van Beinum, then principal conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, as the LAPO music director. The Philharmonic&#x27;s musicians, management and audience all held Beinum in high regard, but in 1959, he suffered a fatal heart attack while on the podium during a rehearsal of the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

In 1960, the orchestra, under Chandler&#x27;s leadership, signed Georg Solti to a three-year contract as music director. This followed his guest conducting appearances in winter concerts downtown, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in other Southern California locations including CAMA concerts in Santa Barbara. Solti was scheduled to officially begin his tenure in 1962, and the Philharmonic anticipated he would lead the orchestra when it moved into its new home at the then yet-to-be-completed Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. He had even began appointing musicians to the orchestra. However, in 1961, Solti abruptly resigned the before officially taking the post after claiming that the Philharmonic board of directors did not consult him before naming then 26-year-old Zubin Mehta to be assistant conductor of the orchestra. Mehta was subsequently named to replace Solti.

===1969–1997: Ernest Fleischmann&#x27;s tenure===
In 1969, the orchestra hired Ernest Fleischmann to be Executive Vice President and General Manager. During his tenure, the Philharmonic instituted several ideas, including the creation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group and its &quot;Green Umbrella&quot; concerts. These adjunct groups, composed of the orchestra&#x27;s musicians, offered performance series separate and distinct from traditional Philharmonic concerts. These initiatives were later adopted by other orchestras worldwide. This concept, considered innovative for its time, stemmed from Fleischmann&#x27;s philosophy, which he articulated in his May 16, 1987, commencement address at the Cleveland Institute of Music titled, &quot;The Orchestra is Dead. Long Live the Community of Musicians.&quot;

When Zubin Mehta left for the New York Philharmonic in 1978, Fleischmann convinced Carlo Maria Giulini to take over as Music Director. Giulini&#x27;s tenure with the orchestra was well regarded, but he resigned after his wife became ill and returned to Italy.

In 1985, Fleischmann turned to André Previn, hoping that his conducting credentials and experience at Hollywood Studios would bring a local flair and strengthen the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn&#x27;s tenure was musically solid, other conductors including Kurt Sanderling, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, achieved greater box office success. Previn frequently clashed with Fleischmann, notably over Fleischmann’s decision to name Salonen as &quot;Principal Guest Conductor&quot; without consulting Previn. This mirrored the earlier Solti/Mehta controversy. Due to Previn&#x27;s objections, the offer of the position and an accompanying Japan tour to Salonen was withdrawn. Shortly after, in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially assuming the post in October 1992. Salonen&#x27;s U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.

Salonen&#x27;s tenure began with a residency at the 1992 Salzburg Festival in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; by Olivier Messiaen. This marked the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later led the orchestra on numerous tours across the United States, Europe, and Asia, as well as residencies at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, The Proms in London, a festival in Cologne dedicated to Salonen&#x27;s own works, and in 1996 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez. During the Paris residency, key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics, inspiring renewed fundraising efforts for the soon-to-be-built Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Under Salonen&#x27;s leadership, the Philharmonic became known as a highly innovative and respected orchestra. Alex Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said:

===1998–2009===
When Fleischmann decided to retire in 1998 after 28 years at the helm, the orchestra named Willem Wijnbergen as its new Executive Director. Wijnbergen, a Dutch pianist and arts administrator, was the managing director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. Initially, his appointment was hailed as a major coup for the orchestra. One notable decision during his tenure was to revise Hollywood Bowl programming by increasing the number of jazz concerts and appointing John Clayton as the orchestra&#x27;s first Jazz Chair. In addition, he established a new World Music series with Tom Schnabel as programming director. Despite some successes, Wijnbergen departed the orchestra in 1999 after a year marked by controversy. It remains unclear whether he resigned or was dismissed by the Philharmonic&#x27;s board of directors.

Later that year, Deborah Borda, then Executive Director of the New York Philharmonic, was hired to lead the orchestra&#x27;s executive management. She began her tenure in January 2000 and was later given the title of President and Chief Executive Officer. Following the financial challenges of Wijnbergen&#x27;s brief tenure, Borda focused on stabilizing the organization&#x27;s finances. Described as &quot;a formidable executive who runs the orchestra like a lean company, not like a flabby non-profit,&quot; she is credited with putting the &quot;organization on solid financial footing.&quot; Borda is widely recognized, along with Salonen, Frank Gehry, and Yasuhisa Toyota, for the orchestra&#x27;s successful transition to Walt Disney Concert Hall, and for supporting and complementing Salonen&#x27;s artistic vision. One example cited by Alex Ross:

Perhaps Borda&#x27;s boldest notion is to give visiting composers such as [John] Adams and Thomas Adès the same royal treatment that is extended to the likes of Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell; Borda talks about &quot;hero composers.&quot; A recent performance of Adams&#x27;s monumental California symphony &quot;Naïve and Sentimental Music&quot; in the orchestra&#x27;s Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda&#x27;s big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra&#x27;s long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer Brett Dean recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a double-take, saying that it was the largest new-music audience he&#x27;d ever seen.

On July 13, 2005, Gustavo Dudamel made his debut with the LA Philharmonic at the orchestra&#x27;s summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. On January 4, 2007, Dudamel made his Walt Disney Concert Hall debut with the LA Philharmonic. On April 9, 2007, the symphony board announced the departure of Esa-Pekka Salonen as music director at the end of the 2008–2009 season, and the appointment of Dudamel as Salonen&#x27;s successor. In 2007, two years before Dudamel&#x27;s officially became music director, the LA Philharmonic established YOLA (Youth Orchestra Los Angeles). &quot;The model for YOLA – a nonprofit initiative that supplies underprivileged children with free instruments, instruction, and profound lessons about pride, community, and commitment – is El Sistema, Venezuela&#x27;s national music training program which, 27 years ago, nurtured the talents of a 5-year-old violin prodigy named Gustavo.&quot; On May 11, 2009, shortly before the start of his inaugural season with the LA Philharmonic, Dudamel, was included as a finalist in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Time 100: The World&#x27;s Most Influential People.&quot;

===2009–present===
Dudamel began his official tenure as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009 with concerts at both the Hollywood Bowl (¡Bienvenido Gustavo!) on October 3, 2009 and the Inaugural Gala at Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 8, 2009. In 2010 and 2011, Dudamel and the LA Phil received the Morton Gould Award for Innovative Programming by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and in 2012 Dudamel and the orchestra won the first place Award for Programming Contemporary Music by ASCAP.

In 2012, Dudamel, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela performed all nine of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies over three weeks in Los Angeles and one week in Caracas. The project was described as both &quot;a mammoth tribute to the composer&quot; and &quot;an unprecedented conducting feat for the conductor.&quot; That same year, the orchestra launched a three-year project to present the Mozart/Da Ponte operas, directed by Christopher Alden with each designed in collaboration with famous architects (sets) and clothing designers. The series launched in 2012 with Frank Gehry and Rodarte designing &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and continued in 2013 with Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa designing &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;. In 2014, the featured designers for the &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; production were Zaha Hadid and Hussein Chalayan.

In October 2011, Dudamel was named Gramophone Artist of the Year. In 2012, Dudamel and the LA Phil were awarded a Grammy award for Best Orchestral Performance for their recording of Brahms&#x27; Fourth Symphony. Dudamel was also named Musical America&#x27;s 2013 Musician of the Year. In 2020 and 2021, Dudamel and the LA Phil were awarded consecutive Grammy awards for Best Orchestral Performance for their recordings of Andrew Norman&#x27;s &quot;Sustain&quot; (2020), and for the collected symphonies of Charles Ives (2021). In 2024, Dudamel and the LA Phil won the Best Orchestral Performance Grammy award for a fourth time, with their performance of Adès: Dante (2020) by Thomas Adès.

In February 2023, the orchestra announced that Dudamel is to conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of his current contract, at the end of the 2025–2026 season. In May 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Kim Noltemy as its next president and chief executive officer, effective July 2024.

==Performance venues==

The orchestra played its first season at Trinity Auditorium at Grand Ave and Ninth Street. In 1920, it moved to Fifth Street and Olive Ave, in a venue that had previously been known as Clune&#x27;s Auditorium, but was renamed Philharmonic Auditorium. From 1964 to 2003, the orchestra played its main subscription concerts in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. In 2003, it moved to the new Walt Disney Concert Hall designed by Frank Gehry adjacent to the Chandler. Its current &quot;winter season&quot; runs from October through late May or early June.

Since 1922, the orchestra has played outdoor concerts during the summer at the Hollywood Bowl, with the official &quot;summer season&quot; running from July through September.

The LA Philharmonic has played at least one concert a year in its sister city, Santa Barbara, presented by the Community Arts Music Association (CAMA), along with other regular concerts throughout various Southern California cities such as Costa Mesa as part of the Orange County Philharmonic Society&#x27;s series, San Diego, Palm Springs, among many others. In addition, the orchestra plays a number of free community concerts throughout Los Angeles County.

===Conductor Laureate===
*2009–present Esa-Pekka Salonen

Before Salonen&#x27;s last concert as Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic on April 19, 2009, the orchestra announced his appointment as its first ever &quot;Conductor Laureate&quot; &quot;as acknowledgement of our profound gratitude to him and to signify our continuing connection.&quot; In response, Salonen said:

When the Board asked me if I would accept the position of Conductor Laureate I was overwhelmed. This organization has been at the very center of my musical life for 17 years. I am very proud and honored that they would even consider me for such a prestigious title and it gives me great pleasure to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic will always play an important role in my life and this is a symbol of our continuing relationship.

===Conductor Emeritus===
*2019–present Zubin Mehta

During the intermission of a concert on January 3, 2019, Simon Woods, CEO of the orchestra, announced that Zubin Mehta has been awarded the title of &quot;Conductor Emeritus.&quot; Woods remarked on Mehta&#x27;s contributions to the orchestra, noting: &quot;Zubin Mehta is one of the treasures of the classical world. He was responsible for hiring over 80 musicians during his tenure at the LA Philharmonic, and it was during this remarkable era that the orchestra rose to a position of international prominence and launched a commitment to deep community engagement that was truly ahead of its time. Today&#x27;s appointment is an acknowledgment of that incredible past and rich present, and a signal of our profound gratitude for the role he has played in shaping this orchestra.&quot;

Mehta commented: &quot;This is indeed a great honor and I&#x27;m very pleased to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has always held a very special place in my heart; they took a chance and accepted me as a very young conductor. I remain grateful to the orchestra and I&#x27;m happy to continue our relationship in this way.&quot;

===Principal Guest Conductors===
Rattle and Tilson Thomas were named Principal Guest Conductor concurrently under Carlo Maria Giulini, though Tilson Thomas&#x27;s tenure ended much earlier. Until 2016, they were the only two conductors to officially hold the title as such (though as stated above, Esa-Pekka Salonen was initially offered the position under Previn before having the offer withdrawn).

Beginning in the summer of 2005, the Philharmonic created the new position of &quot;Principal Guest Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. Leonard Slatkin was initially given a two-year contract, and in 2007 he was given a one-year extension. In March 2008, Bramwell Tovey was named to the post for an initial two-year contract beginning Summer of 2008; he subsequently received a one-year extension. After Tovey&#x27;s term ended, no conductor has since held the position at the Hollywood Bowl.

In April 2016, the LA Phil announced Susanna Mälkki as the orchestra&#x27;s next principal guest conductor, becoming first woman to hold the post. Her tenure began with the 2017–2018 season under an initial contract of three years. She held the post through the 2021–2022 season.

===Other notable conductors===
Other conductors with whom the orchestra has had close ties include Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter, Leopold Stokowski, Albert Coates, Fritz Reiner, and Erich Leinsdorf; more recently, others have included Kurt Sanderling, Pierre Boulez, Leonard Bernstein, Charles Dutoit, Christoph Eschenbach, and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos.

Many composers have conducted the Philharmonic in concerts and/or world premieres of their works, including Igor Stravinsky, William Kraft, John Harbison, Witold Lutosławski, Aaron Copland, Pierre Boulez, Steven Stucky, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, John Adams, Thomas Adès, and Esa-Pekka Salonen.

A number of the Philharmonic&#x27;s Assistant/Associate Conductors have gone on to have notable careers in their own rights. These include Lawrence Foster, Calvin E. Simmons, and William Kraft under Mehta, Sidney Harth and Myung-whun Chung under Giulini, Heiichiro Ohyama and David Alan Miller under Previn, and Grant Gershon, Miguel Harth-Bedoya, Kristjan Järvi, and Alexander Mickelthwate under Salonen. Lionel Bringuier was originally named Assistant Conductor under Salonen before being promoted to Associate Conductor and, finally, Resident Conductor under Dudamel; since then, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla has served as Assistant Conductor and Associate Conductor under Dudamel.

==Other resident artists==

===Composers===
* 1981–1985: William Kraft
* 1985–1988: John Harbison
* 1987–1989: Rand Steiger
* 1988–2009: Steven Stucky
* 2009–present: John Adams

Kraft and Harbison held the title &quot;Composer-in-Residence&quot; as part of a Meet the Composer (MTC) sponsorship. Steiger was given the title &quot;Composer-Fellow&quot;, serving as an assistant to both Harbison and Stucky.

Stucky was also a MTC &quot;Composer-in-Residence&quot; from 1988 to 1992, but was kept on as &quot;New Music Advisor&quot; after his official MTC-sponsored tenure ended; in 2000, his title was again changed to &quot;Consulting Composer for New Music.&quot; In the end, his 21-year residency with the orchestra was the longest such relationship of any composer with an American orchestra.

Adams has been named the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Creative Chair&quot; beginning in Fall 2009.

===Artistic director and creative chairs for Jazz===
* 2002–2006: Dianne Reeves
* 2006–2010: Christian McBride
* 2010–present: Herbie Hancock

Reeves was named the first &quot;Creative Chair for Jazz&quot; in March 2002. Instead of just focusing on summer programming, the new position involved the scheduling of jazz programming and educational workshops year round; as such, she led the development of the subscription jazz series the orchestra offered when it moved into Walt Disney Concert Hall. In addition, she was the first performer at the 2003 inaugural gala at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Her contract was initially for two years, and was subsequently renewed for an additional two years.

McBride took over the position in 2006 for an initial two-year position that was subsequently renewed for an additional two years through to the start of the 2010 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2009, the orchestra introduced Hancock as McBride&#x27;s eventual replacement.

In 1998, prior to the establishment of the Creative Chair for Jazz, John Clayton was given the title &quot;Artistic Director of Jazz&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl for a three-year term beginning with the 1999 summer season. His band, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, acted as the resident jazz ensemble.

==Recordings==
The orchestra occasionally made 78-rpm recordings and LPs in the early years with Alfred Wallenstein and Leopold Stokowski for Capitol Records, and began recording regularly in the 1960s, for London/Decca, during the tenure of Zubin Mehta as music director. A healthy discography continued to grow with Carlo Maria Giulini on Deutsche Grammophon and André Previn on both Philips and Telarc Records. Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard Bernstein, and Sir Simon Rattle also made several recordings with the orchestra in the 1980s, adding to their rising international profile. In recent years, Esa-Pekka Salonen has led recording sessions for Sony and Deutsche Grammophon. A recording of the &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; by Béla Bartók released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2007 was the first recording by Gustavo Dudamel conducting the LA Phil.

The Los Angeles Philharmonic has performed music for motion pictures, such as the 1963 Stanley Kramer film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (composed by Ernest Gold), the pilot film of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV show (composed by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson), and the most recent 2021 film version of the Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; (composed by Leonard Bernstein). The LA Philharmonic also performed the first North American concert for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise game music, &quot;Dear Friends: Music From Final Fantasy&quot; by Nobuo Uematsu. The orchestra has most recently recorded the sound track for the video game: &quot;BioShock 2&quot; as composed by Garry Schyman.

The album &quot;Fandango&quot; includes a performance of Alberto Ginastera&#x27;s &quot;Four Dances from Estancia,&quot; recorded live at Walt Disney Concert Hall in October 2022 and Arturo Márquez&#x27;s new violin concerto &quot;Fandango&quot;, written for violinist Anne Akiko Meyers.

<text>Cosplay, a blend word of &quot;costume play&quot;, is an activity and performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term &quot;cosplay&quot; applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga, television series, rock music performances, video games and in some cases, original characters. The term has been adopted as slang, often in politics, to mean someone pretending to play a role or take on a personality disingenuously.

Cosplay grew out of the practice of fan costuming at science fiction conventions, beginning with Morojo&#x27;s &quot;futuristicostumes&quot; created for the 1st World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939. The Japanese term was coined in 1984. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very popular among all genders, and it is not unusual to see crossplay, also referred to as gender-bending.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;cosplay&quot; is a Japanese blend word of the English terms costume and play. The term was coined by of Studio Hard after he attended the 1984 World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) in Los Angeles and saw costumed fans, which he later wrote about in an article for the Japanese magazine &quot;&quot;. Takahashi decided to coin a new word rather than use the existing translation of the English term &quot;masquerade&quot; because that translates into Japanese as &quot;an aristocratic costume party&quot;, which did not match his experience of the Worldcon. The coinage reflects a common Japanese method of abbreviation in which the first two moras of a pair of words are used to form an independent compound: &#x27;costume&#x27; becomes &quot;kosu&quot; (コス) and &#x27;play&#x27; becomes &quot;pure&quot; (プレ).

==History==

===Pre-20th century===

Masquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. They were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance, generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, which were particularly popular in Venice.

In April 1877, Jules Verne sent out almost 700 invitations for an elaborate costume ball, where several of the guests showed up dressed as characters from Verne&#x27;s novels.

Costume parties (American English) or fancy dress parties (British English) were popular from the 19th century onwards. Costuming guides of the period, such as Samuel Miller&#x27;s &quot;Male Character Costumes&quot; (1884) or Ardern Holt&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1887), feature mostly generic costumes, whether that be period costumes, national costumes, objects or abstract concepts such as &quot;Autumn&quot; or &quot;Night&quot;. Most specific costumes described therein are for historical figures although some are sourced from fiction, like &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; or Shakespeare characters.

By March 1891, a literal call by one Herbert Tibbits for what would today be described as &quot;cosplayers&quot; was advertised for an event held from 5–10 March that year at the Royal Albert Hall in London, for the so-named &quot;Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete&quot; based on a science fiction novel and its characters, published two decades earlier.

===Fan costuming===
A.D. Condo&#x27;s science fiction comic strip character Mr. Skygack, from Mars (a Martian ethnographer who comically misunderstands many Earthly affairs) is arguably the first fictional character that people emulated by wearing costumes, as in 1908 Mr. and Mrs. William Fell of Cincinnati, Ohio, are reported to have attended a masquerade at a skating rink wearing Mr. Skygack and Miss Dillpickles costumes. Later, in 1910, an unnamed woman won first prize at masquerade ball in Tacoma, Washington, wearing another Skygack costume.

The first people to wear costumes to attend a convention were science fiction fans Forrest J Ackerman and Myrtle R. Douglas, known in fandom as Morojo. They attended the 1939 1st World Science Fiction Convention (Nycon or 1st Worldcon) in the Caravan Hall, New York, US dressed in &quot;futuristicostumes&quot;, including green cape and breeches, based on the pulp magazine artwork of Frank R. Paul and the 1936 film &quot;Things to Come&quot;, designed and created by Douglas. 

Ackerman later stated that he thought everyone was supposed to wear a costume at a science fiction convention, although only he and Douglas did.

Fan costuming caught on, however, and the 2nd Worldcon (1940) had both an unofficial masquerade held in Douglas&#x27; room and an official masquerade as part of the programme. David Kyle won the masquerade wearing a Ming the Merciless costume created by Leslie Perri, while Robert A. W. Lowndes received second place with a Bar Senestro costume (from the novel &quot;The Blind Spot&quot; by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint). Other costumed attendees included guest of honor E. E. Smith as Northwest Smith (from C. L. Moore&#x27;s series of short stories) and both Ackerman and Douglas wearing their futuristicostumes again. Masquerades and costume balls continued to be part of World Science Fiction Convention tradition thereafter. Early Worldcon masquerade balls featured a band, dancing, food and drinks. Contestants either walked across a stage or a cleared area of the dance floor.

Ackerman wore a &quot;Hunchbackerman of Notre Dame&quot; costume to the 3rd Worldcon (1941), which included a mask designed and created by Ray Harryhausen, but soon stopped wearing costumes to conventions. Douglas wore an Akka costume (from A. Merritt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon Pool&quot;), the mask again made by Harryhausen, to the 3rd Worldcon and a Snake Mother costume (another Merritt costume, from &quot;The Snake Mother&quot;) to the 4th Worldcon (1946). Terminology was yet unsettled; the 1944 edition of Jack Speer&#x27;s &quot;Fancyclopedia&quot; used the term costume party.
Rules governing costumes became established in response to specific costumes and costuming trends. The first nude contestant at a Worldcon masquerade was in 1952; but the height of this trend was in the 1970s and early 1980s, with a few every year. This eventually led to &quot;No Costume is No Costume&quot; rule, which banned full nudity, although partial nudity was still allowed as long as it was a legitimate representation of the character. Mike Resnick describes the best of the nude costumes as Kris Lundi wearing a harpy costume to the 32nd Worldcon (1974) (she received an honorable mention in the competition). Another costume that instigated a rule change was an attendee at the 20th Worldcon (1962) whose blaster prop fired a jet of real flame; which led to fire being banned. At the 30th WorldCon (1972), artist Scott Shaw wore a costume composed largely of peanut butter to represent his own underground comix character called &quot;The Turd&quot;. The peanut butter rubbed off, doing damage to soft furnishings and other peoples&#x27; costumes, and then began to go rancid under the heat of the lighting. Food, odious, and messy substances were banned as costume elements after that event.

Costuming spread with the science fiction conventions and the interaction of fandom. The earliest known instance of costuming at a convention in the United Kingdom was at the London Science Fiction Convention (1953) but this was only as part of a play. However, members of the Liverpool Science Fantasy Society attended the 1st Cytricon (1955), in Kettering, wearing costumes and continued to do so in subsequent years. The 15th Worldcon (1957) brought the first official convention masquerade to the UK. The 1960 Eastercon in London may have been the first British-based convention to hold an official fancy dress party as part of its programme.
The joint winners were Ethel Lindsay and Ina Shorrock as two of the titular witches from the novel &quot;The Witches of Karres&quot; by James H. Schmitz.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions began in 1969 and major conventions began in 1972 and they have featured cosplay throughout.

In Japan, costuming at conventions was a fan activity from at least the 1970s, especially after the launch of the Comiket convention in December 1975. Costuming at this time was known as . The first documented case of costuming at a fan event in Japan was at Ashinocon (1978), in Hakone, at which future science fiction critic Mari Kotani wore a costume based on the cover art for Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;A Fighting Man of Mars&quot;. In an interview Kotani states that there were about twenty costumed attendees at the convention&#x27;s costume party—made up of members of her &quot;Triton of the Sea&quot; fan club and , antecedent of the Gainax anime studio—with most attendees in ordinary clothing. One of the Kansai group, an unnamed friend of Yasuhiro Takeda, wore an impromptu Tusken Raider costume (from the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;) made from one of the host-hotel&#x27;s rolls of toilet paper. Costume contests became a permanent part of the Nihon SF Taikai conventions from Tokon VII in 1980.

Possibly the first costume contest held at a comic book convention was at the 1st Academy Con held at Broadway Central Hotel in New York in August 1965. Roy Thomas, future editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics but then just transitioning from a fanzine editor to a professional comic book writer, attended in a Plastic Man costume.

The first Masquerade Ball held at San Diego Comic-Con was in 1974 during the convention&#x27;s 6th event. Voice actress June Foray was the master of ceremonies. Future scream queen Brinke Stevens won first place wearing a Vampirella costume. Ackerman (who was the creator of Vampirella) was in attendance and posed with Stevens for photographs. They became friends and, according to Stevens &quot;Forry and his wife, Wendayne, soon became like my god parents.&quot; Photographer Dan Golden saw a photograph of Stevens in the Vampirella costume while visiting Ackerman&#x27;s house, leading to him hiring her for a non-speaking role in her first student film, &quot;Zyzak is King&quot; (1980), and later photographing her for the cover of the first issue of &quot;Femme Fatales&quot; (1992). Stevens attributes these events to launching her acting career.

As early as a year after the 1975 release of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, audience members began dressing as characters from the movie and role-playing (although the initial incentive for dressing-up was free admission) in often highly accurate costumes.

Costume-Con, a conference dedicated to costuming, was first held in January 1983. The International Costumers Guild, Inc., originally known as the Greater Columbia Fantasy Costumer&#x27;s Guild, was launched after the 3rd Costume-Con (1985) as a parent organization and to support costuming.

===Cosplay===
Costuming had been a fan activity in Japan from the 1970s, and it became much more popular in the wake of Takahashi&#x27;s report. The new term did not catch on immediately, however. It was a year or two after the article was published before it was in common use among fans at conventions. It was in the 1990s, after exposure on television and in magazines, that the term and practice of cosplaying became common knowledge in Japan.

The first cosplay cafés appeared in the Akihabara area of Tokyo in the late 1990s. A temporary maid café was set up at the Tokyo Character Collection event in August 1998 to promote the video game &quot;Welcome to Pia Carrot 2&quot; (1997). An occasional Pia Carrot Restaurant was held at the shop Gamers in Akihabara in the years up to 2000. Being linked to specific intellectual properties limited the lifespan of these cafés, which was solved by using generic maids, leading to the first permanent establishment, Cure Maid Café, which opened in March 2001.

The first World Cosplay Summit was held on 12 October 2003 at the Rose Court Hotel in Nagoya, Japan, with five cosplayers invited from Germany, France and Italy. There was no contest until 2005, when the World Cosplay Championship began. The first winners were the Italian team of , Francesca Dani and Emilia Fata Livia.

Worldcon masquerade attendance peaked in the 1980s and started to fall thereafter. This trend was reversed when the concept of cosplay was re-imported from Japan.

==Practice of cosplay==
Cosplay costumes vary greatly and can range from simple themed clothing to highly detailed costumes. It is generally considered different from Halloween and Mardi Gras costume wear, as the intention is to replicate a specific character, rather than to reflect the culture and symbolism of a holiday event. As such, when in costume, some cosplayers often seek to adopt the affect, mannerisms, and body language of the characters they portray (with &quot;out of character&quot; breaks). The characters chosen to be cosplayed may be sourced from any movie, TV series, book, comic book, video game, music band, anime, or manga. Some cosplayers even choose to cosplay an original character of their own design or a fusion of different genres (e.g., a steampunk version of a character), and it is a part of the ethos of cosplay that anybody can be anything, as with genderbending, crossplay, or drag, a cosplayer playing a character of another ethnicity, or a hijabi portraying Captain America. 

===Costumes===


Cosplayers obtain their apparel through many different methods. Manufacturers produce and sell packaged outfits for use in cosplay, with varying levels of quality. These costumes are often sold online, but also can be purchased from dealers at conventions. Japanese manufacturers of cosplay costumes reported a profit of 35 billion yen in 2008. A number of individuals also work on commission, creating custom costumes, props, or wigs designed and fitted to the individual. Other cosplayers, who prefer to create their own costumes, still provide a market for individual elements, and various raw materials, such as unstyled wigs, hair dye, cloth and sewing notions, liquid latex, body paint, costume jewelry, and prop weapons.

Cosplay represents an act of embodiment. Cosplay has been closely linked to the presentation of self, yet cosplayers&#x27; ability to perform is limited by their physical features. The accuracy of a cosplay is judged based on the ability to accurately represent a character through the body, and individual cosplayers frequently are faced by their own &quot;bodily limits&quot; such as level of attractiveness, body size, and disability that often restrict and confine how accurate the cosplay is perceived to be. Authenticity is measured by a cosplayer&#x27;s individual ability to translate on-screen manifestation to the cosplay itself. Some have argued that cosplay can never be a true representation of the character; instead, it can only be read through the body, and that true embodiment of a character is judged based on nearness to the original character form. Cosplaying can also help some of those with self-esteem problems.

Many cosplayers create their own outfits, referencing images of the characters in the process. In the creation of the outfits, much time is given to detail and qualities, thus the skill of a cosplayer may be measured by how difficult the details of the outfit are and how well they have been replicated. Because of the difficulty of replicating some details and materials, cosplayers often educate themselves in crafting specialties such as textiles, sculpture, face paint, fiberglass, fashion design, woodworking, and other uses of materials in the effort to render the look and texture of a costume accurately. Cosplayers often wear wigs in conjunction with their outfit to further improve the resemblance to the character. This is especially necessary for anime and manga or video-game characters who often have unnaturally colored and uniquely styled hair. Simpler outfits may be compensated for their lack of complexity by paying attention to material choice and overall high quality.

To look more like the characters they are portraying, cosplayers might also engage in various forms of body modification. Cosplayers may opt to change their skin color utilizing make-up to more simulate the race of the character they are adopting. Contact lenses that match the color of their character&#x27;s eyes are a common form of this, especially in the case of characters with particularly unique eyes as part of their trademark look. Contact lenses that make the pupil look enlarged to visually echo the large eyes of anime and manga characters are also used. Another form of body modification in which cosplayers engage is to copy any tattoos or special markings their character might have. Temporary tattoos, permanent marker, body paint, and in rare cases, permanent tattoos, are all methods used by cosplayers to achieve the desired look. Permanent and temporary hair dye, spray-in hair coloring, and specialized extreme styling products are all used by some cosplayers whose natural hair can achieve the desired hairstyle. It is also commonplace for them to shave off their eyebrows to gain a more accurate look.

Some anime and video game characters have weapons or other accessories that are hard to replicate, and conventions have strict rules regarding those weapons, but most cosplayers engage in some combination of methods to obtain all the items necessary for their costumes; for example, they may commission a prop weapon, sew their own clothing, buy character jewelry from a cosplay accessory manufacturer, or buy a pair of off-the-rack shoes, and modify them to match the desired look.

===Presentation===

Cosplay may be presented in a number of ways and places. A subset of cosplay culture is centered on sex appeal, with cosplayers specifically choosing characters known for their attractiveness or revealing costumes. However, wearing a revealing costume can be a sensitive issue while appearing in public. People appearing naked at American science fiction fandom conventions during the 1970s were so common, a &quot;no costume is no costume&quot; rule was introduced. Some conventions throughout the United States, such as Phoenix Comicon (now known as Phoenix Fan Fusion) and Penny Arcade Expo, have also issued rules upon which they reserve the right to ask attendees to leave or change their costumes if deemed to be inappropriate to a family-friendly environment or something of a similar nature.

====Conventions====
The most popular form of presenting a cosplay publicly is by wearing it to a fan convention. Multiple conventions dedicated to anime and manga, comics, TV shows, video games, science fiction, and fantasy may be found all around the world. Cosplay-centered conventions include Cosplay Mania in the Philippines and EOY Cosplay Festival in Singapore.

The single largest event featuring cosplay is the semiannual &quot;doujinshi&quot; market, Comic Market (Comiket), held in Japan during summer and winter. Comiket attracts hundreds of thousands of manga and anime fans, where thousands of cosplayers congregate on the roof of the exhibition center. In North America, the highest-attended fan conventions featuring cosplayers are San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic Con held in the United States, and the anime-specific Anime North in Toronto, Otakon held in Washington, D.C. and Anime Expo held in Los Angeles. Europe&#x27;s largest event is Japan Expo held in Paris, while the London MCM Expo and the London Super Comic Convention are the most notable in the UK. Supanova Pop Culture Expo is Australia&#x27;s biggest event.

Star Trek conventions have featured cosplay for many decades. These include Destination Star Trek, a UK convention, and Star Trek Las Vegas, a US convention.

In different comic fairs, &quot;Thematic Areas&quot; are set up where cosplayers can take photos in an environment that follows that of the game or animation product from which they are taken. Sometimes the cosplayers are part of the area, playing the role of staff with the task of entertaining the other visitors. Some examples are the thematic areas dedicated to Star Wars or to Fallout. The areas are set up by not for profit associations of fans, but in some major fairs it is possible to visit areas set up directly by the developers of the video games or the producers of the anime.

====Photography====
The appearance of cosplayers at public events makes them a popular draw for photographers. As this became apparent in the late 1980s, a new variant of cosplay developed in which cosplayers attended events mainly for the purpose of modeling their characters for still photography rather than engaging in continuous role play. Rules of etiquette were developed to minimize awkward situations involving boundaries. Cosplayers pose for photographers and photographers do not press them for personal contact information or private sessions, follow them out of the area, or take photos without permission. The rules allow the collaborative relationship between photographers and cosplayers to continue with the least inconvenience to each other.

Some cosplayers choose to have a professional photographer take high quality images of them in their costumes posing as the character. Cosplayers and photographers frequently exhibit their work online and sometimes sell their images.

===Competitions===
As the popularity of cosplay has grown, many conventions have come to feature a contest surrounding cosplay that may be the main feature of the convention. Contestants present their cosplay, and often to be judged for an award, the cosplay must be self-made. The contestants may choose to perform a skit, which may consist of a short performed script or dance with optional accompanying audio, video, or images shown on a screen overhead. Other contestants may simply choose to pose as their characters. Often, contestants are briefly interviewed on stage by a master of ceremonies. The audience is given a chance to take photos of the cosplayers. Cosplayers may compete solo or in a group. Awards are presented, and these awards may vary greatly. Generally, a best cosplayer award, a best group award, and runner-up prizes are given. Awards may also go to the best skit and a number of cosplay skill subcategories, such as master tailor, master weapon-maker, master armorer, and so forth.

The most well-known cosplay contest event is the World Cosplay Summit, selecting cosplayers from 40 countries to compete in the final round in Nagoya, Japan. Some other international events include European Cosplay Gathering (finals taking place at Japan Expo in Paris), EuroCosplay (finals taking place at London MCM Comic Con), and the Nordic Cosplay Championship (finals taking place at NärCon in Linköping, Sweden).
====Common cosplay judging criteria====
This table contains a list of the most common cosplay competition judging criteria, as seen from World Cosplay Summit, Cyprus Comic Con, and ReplayFX.
===Gender issues===
Portraying a character of the opposite sex is called crossplay. The practicality of crossplay and cross-dress stems in part from the abundance in manga of male characters with delicate and somewhat androgynous features. Such characters, known as (lit. &quot;pretty boy&quot;), are Asian equivalent of the elfin boy archetype represented in Western tradition by figures such as Peter Pan and Ariel.

Male to female cosplayers may experience issues when trying to portray a female character because it is hard to maintain the sexualized femininity of a character. Male cosplayers may also be subjected to discrimination, including homophobic comments and being touched without permission. This affects men possibly even more often than it affects women, despite inappropriate contact already being a problem for women who cosplay, as is &quot;slut-shaming&quot;.

&quot;Animegao kigurumi&quot; players, a niche group in the realm of cosplay, are often male cosplayers who use zentai and stylized masks to represent female anime characters. These cosplayers completely hide their real features so the original appearance of their characters may be reproduced as literally as possible, and to display all the abstractions and stylizations such as oversized eyes and tiny mouths often seen in Japanese cartoon art. This does not mean that only males perform &quot;animegao&quot; or that masks are only female.

=== Harassment issues ===

&quot;Cosplay Is Not Consent&quot;, a movement started in 2013 by Rochelle Keyhan, Erin Filson, and Anna Kegler, brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment in the convention attending cosplay community. Harassment of cosplayers include photography without permission, verbal abuse, touching, and groping. Harassment is not limited to women in provocative outfits as male cosplayers talked about being bullied for not fitting certain costume and characters.

Starting in 2014, New York Comic Con placed large signs at the entrance stating that &quot;Cosplay is Not Consent&quot;. Attendees were reminded to ask permission for photos and respect the person&#x27;s right to say no. The movement against sexual harassment against cosplayers has continued to gain momentum and awareness since being publicized. Traditional mainstream news media like &quot;The Mercury News&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; have reported on the topic, bringing awareness of sexual harassment to those outside of the cosplay community.

===Ethnicity issues===
As cosplay has entered more mainstream media, ethnicity becomes a controversial point. Cosplayers of different skin color than the character are often ridiculed for not being &#x27;accurate&#x27; or &#x27;faithful&#x27;. Many cosplayers feel as if anyone can cosplay any character, but it becomes complicated when cosplayers are not respectful of the character&#x27;s ethnicity. These views against non-white cosplayers within the community have been attributed to the lack of representation in the industry and in media. Issues such as blackface, brownface, and yellowface are still controversial since a large part of the cosplay community see these as separate problems, or simply an acceptable part of cosplay.

===Cosplay models===

Cosplay has influenced the advertising industry, in which cosplayers are often used for event work previously assigned to agency models. Some cosplayers have thus transformed their hobby into profitable, professional careers. Japan&#x27;s entertainment industry has been home to the professional cosplayers since the rise of Comiket and Tokyo Game Show. The phenomenon is most apparent in Japan but exists to some degree in other countries as well. Professional cosplayers who profit from their art may experience problems related to copyright infringement.

A cosplay model, also known as a cosplay idol, cosplays costumes for anime and manga or video game companies. Good cosplayers are viewed as fictional characters in the flesh, in much the same way that film actors come to be identified in the public mind with specific roles. Cosplayers have modeled for print magazines like &quot;Cosmode&quot; and a successful cosplay model can become the brand ambassador for companies like Cospa. Some cosplay models can achieve significant recognition. While there are many significant cosplay models, Yaya Han was described as having emerged &quot;as a well-recognized figure both within and outside cosplay circuits&quot;. Jessica Nigri, used her recognition in cosplay to gain other opportunities such as voice acting and her own documentary on Rooster Teeth. Liz Katz used her fanbase to take her cosplay from a hobby to a successful business venture, sparking debate through the cosplay community whether cosplayers should be allowed to fund and profit from their work.

In the 2000s, cosplayers started to push the boundaries of cosplay into eroticism paving the way to &quot;erocosplay&quot;. The advent of social media coupled with crowdfuding platforms like Patreon and OnlyFans have allowed cosplay models to turn cosplay into profitable full-time careers.

==Cosplay by country or region==

===Cosplay in Japan===
Cosplayers in Japan used to refer to themselves as , pronounced &quot;layer&quot;. Currently in Japan, cosplayers are more commonly called , pronounced &quot;ko-su-pray&quot;, as &quot;reiyā&quot; is more often used to describe layers (i.e. hair, clothes, etc.). Words like cute (&quot;kawaii&quot; (可愛い)) and cool (&quot;kakko ī&quot; (かっこ いい)) were often used to describe these changes, expressions that were tied with notions of femininity and masculinity. Those who photograph players are called &quot;cameko&quot;, short for &quot;camera kozō&quot; or &quot;camera boy&quot;. Originally, the cameko gave prints of their photos to players as gifts. Increased interest in cosplay events, both on the part of photographers and cosplayers willing to model for them, has led to formalization of procedures at events such as Comiket. Photography takes place within a designated area removed from the exhibit hall. In Japan, costumes are generally not welcome outside of conventions or other designated areas.

Since 1998, Tokyo&#x27;s Akihabara district contains a number of cosplay restaurants, catering to devoted anime and cosplay fans, where the waitresses at such cafés dress as video game or anime characters; maid cafés are particularly popular. In Japan, Tokyo&#x27;s Harajuku district is the favorite informal gathering place to engage in cosplay in public. Events in Akihabara also draw many cosplayers.

 is a form of Japanese cosplay where the players use body paint to make their skin color match that of the character they are playing. This allows them to represent anime or video game characters with non-human skin colors.

A 2014 survey for the Comic Market convention in Japan noted that approximately 75% of cosplayers attending the event are female.

===Cosplay in other Asian countries===
Cosplay is common in many East Asian countries. For example, it is a major part of the Comic World conventions taking place regularly in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Historically, the practice of dressing up as characters from works of fiction can be traced as far as the 17th century late Ming dynasty China.

===Cosplay in Western countries===

Western cosplay&#x27;s origins are based primarily in science fiction and fantasy fandoms. It is also more common for Western cosplayers to recreate characters from live-action series than it is for Japanese cosplayers. Western costumers also include subcultures of hobbyists who participate in Renaissance faires, live action role-playing games, and historical reenactments. Competition at science fiction conventions typically include the masquerade (where costumes are presented on stage and judged formally) and hall costumes

The increasing popularity of Japanese animation outside of Asia during the late 2000s led to an increase in American and other Western cosplayers who portray manga and anime characters. Anime conventions have become more numerous in the West in the previous decade, now competing with science fiction, comic book and historical conferences in attendance. At these gatherings, cosplayers, like their Japanese counterparts, meet to show off their work, be photographed, and compete in costume contests. Convention attendees also just as often dress up as Western comic book or animated characters, or as characters from movies and video games.

Differences in taste still exist across cultures: some costumes that are worn without hesitation by Japanese cosplayers tend to be avoided by Western cosplayers, such as outfits that evoke Nazi uniforms. Some Western cosplayers have also encountered questions of legitimacy when playing characters of canonically different racial backgrounds, and people can be insensitive to cosplayers playing as characters who are canonically of other skin color. Western cosplayers of anime characters may also be subjected to particular mockery.

In contrast to Japan, the wearing of costumes in public is more accepted in the UK, Ireland, US, Canada and other western countries. These countries have a longer tradition of Halloween costumes, fan costuming and other such activities. As a result, for example, costumed convention attendees can often be seen at local restaurants and eateries, beyond the boundaries of the convention or event.

==Media==
===Magazines and books===
Japan is home to two especially popular cosplay magazines, &quot;Cosmode&quot; (コスモード) and ASCII Media Works&#x27; &quot;Dengeki Layers&quot; (電撃Layers). &quot;Cosmode&quot; has the largest share in the market and an English-language digital edition. Another magazine, aimed at a broader, worldwide audience is &quot;CosplayGen&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Cosplay Culture&quot; began publication in February 2015. Other magazines include &quot;CosplayZine&quot; featuring cosplayers from all over the world since October 2015, and &quot;Cosplay Realm Magazine&quot; which was started in April 2017. There are many books on the subject of cosplay as well.

<doc id="156269" wikidata="Q3228694" url="?curid=156269" title="Nifty Fifty">
<text>In the United States, the term Nifty Fifty was an informal designation for a group of roughly fifty large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960s and 1970s that were widely regarded as solid buy and hold growth stocks, or &quot;Blue-chip&quot; stocks. These fifty stocks are credited by historians with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s, while their subsequent crash and underperformance through the early 1980s are an example of what may occur following a period during which many investors ignore fundamental stock valuation metrics, to instead make decisions on popular sentiment. Roughly half of the Nifty Fifty have since recovered and are solid performers, although a few are now defunct or otherwise worthless. 

Investor Howard Marks reports that about half of the Nifty Fifty &quot;compiled respectable returns for 25 years, even when measured from their pre-crash highs, suggesting that very high valuations can be fundamentally justified.&quot; On the other hand, Professor Jeremy Siegel analyzed the Nifty Fifty era in his book &quot;Stocks for the Long Run&quot;, and determined companies that routinely sold for P/E ratios above 50 consistently performed worse than the broader market (as measured by the S&amp;P 500) in the next 25 years, with only a few exceptions.

==Characteristics==
The stocks were often described as &quot;one-decision&quot;, as they were viewed as extremely stable, even over long periods of time.

The most common characteristic by the constituents were solid earnings growth for which these stocks were assigned extraordinary high price–earnings ratios. Trading at fifty times earnings or higher was common, far above the long-term market average of about 15 to 20.

== U.S. bear market of the 1970s ==
The long bear market of the 1970s which began with the 1973–74 stock market crash and lasted until 1982 caused valuations of the nifty fifty to fall to low levels along with the rest of the market, with most of these stocks under-performing the broader market averages. A notable exception was Wal-Mart, the best performing stock on the list, with a 29.65% compounded annualized return over a 29-year period. However, Wal-Mart&#x27;s initial public offering was in 1970 and only started trading on the NYSE on August 25, 1972, at the end of the bull market.

Because of the under-performance of most of the nifty fifty list, it is often cited as an example of unrealistic investor expectations for growth stocks.

<text>The Philadelphia Orchestra is an American symphony orchestra, based in Philadelphia. One of the &quot;Big Five&quot; American orchestras, the orchestra is based at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, where it performs its subscription concerts, numbering over 130 annually, at Marian Anderson Hall (formerly Verizon Hall).

From its founding until 2001, the Philadelphia Orchestra gave its concerts at the Academy of Music. The orchestra continues to own the Academy, and returns there one week per year for the Academy of Music&#x27;s annual gala concert and concerts for school children. The Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s summer home is the Mann Center for the Performing Arts. It also has summer residencies at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and since July 2007 at the Bravo! Vail Valley Festival in Vail, Colorado. The orchestra also performs an annual series of concerts at Carnegie Hall. From its earliest days the orchestra has been active in the recording studio, primarily for RCA Victor and Columbia Records.

Yannick Nézet-Séguin has been serving as the orchestra&#x27;s music director since 2012. Matías Tarnopolsky was appointed president and CEO in August 2018.

==History==
===20th century===
In 1900, the Philadelphia Orchestra was founded in 1900 by Fritz Scheel, who also acted as its first conductor. The orchestra had its beginnings with a small group of musicians led by the pianist F. Cresson Schell (1857–1942). In 1904, Richard Strauss guest conducted the orchestra in a program of his compositions, and in 1906 the Polish pianist Arthur Rubinstein made his American debut with the orchestra. Additionally in 1906, the orchestra traveled to the White House to perform in a concert.

In February 1907, Leandro Campanari took over and served as interim conductor for a short time during Scheel&#x27;s illness and after his death. A flutist in the orchestra, August Rodemann, stood in before Campanari&#x27;s arrival. He started sabotaging the performances and Campanari was obliged to remove himself from a bad situation.

In 1907, Karl Pohlig became music director and served until 1912. New music he programmed was unpopular with audiences, and revelations that he had an extra-marital affair with his secretary caused outrage. The orchestra cancelled his contract and gave him a year&#x27;s salary ($12,000) in severance to avoid a suit from Pohlig alleging a conspiracy to oust him.

Leopold Stokowski became music director in 1912, and brought the orchestra to national prominence. Under his guidance, the orchestra gained a reputation for virtuosity, and developed what is known as the &quot;Philadelphia Sound.&quot; Stokowski left the orchestra in 1941, and did not return as a guest conductor for nearly 20 years.
In 1936, Eugene Ormandy joined the organization, and jointly held the post of principal conductor with Stokowski until 1938 when he became its sole music director. He remained as music director until 1980, after which he became Conductor Laureate. Ormandy conducted many of the orchestra&#x27;s best-known recordings and took the orchestra on its historic 1973 tour of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, making it the first Western orchestra to visit the country. The tour was highly successful and it has since returned for thirteen additional successful tours.

Riccardo Muti became principal guest conductor of the orchestra in the 1970s, and assumed the role as Music Director from Ormandy in 1980, serving through 1992. His recordings with the orchestra included the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, and Alexander Scriabin, for the EMI and Philips labels.

Wolfgang Sawallisch succeeded Muti as music director from 1993 to 2003. He made a number of recordings with the orchestra of music of Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner, among other composers, for the EMI label. However, the orchestra lost its recording contract with EMI during this time, which led to a musicians&#x27; strike for 64 days in 1996. Near the end of Sawallisch&#x27;s tenure, the orchestra released a self-produced set of recordings of the Schumann symphonies with Sawallisch conducting. In 2003, Sawallisch was named Conductor Laureate, and held the title until his death in 2013.

===21st century===
In 2003, Christoph Eschenbach succeeded Sawallisch as music director. This appointment was controversial because Eschenbach had not conducted the orchestra in over four years and there was a perceived lack of personal chemistry between him and the musicians prior to the appointment. At least one early report tried to downplay this concern. The orchestra returned to commercial recordings with Eschenbach, on the Ondine label. However, in October 2006, Eschenbach and the orchestra announced the conclusion of his tenure as music director in 2008, for a total of five years, the shortest tenure as music director in the history of the Philadelphia Orchestra, along with Pohlig.

After Eschenbach&#x27;s departure, the Philadelphia Orchestra was without a music director for four years. In February 2007, Charles Dutoit was appointed chief conductor and artistic adviser for four seasons, starting in the fall of 2008 and running through the 2011–2012 season. This move was made to provide an &quot;artistic bridge&quot; while the orchestra searched for its eighth music director. According to news articles from August 2007, the orchestra had now devised a search process in which each musician in the orchestra would have a say in the choice of the next Music Director.
In December 2008, at the invitation of Dutoit, Yannick Nézet-Séguin made his first guest-conducting appearance with the orchestra. He returned for a second series of concerts in December 2009. In June 2010, Nézet-Séguin was appointed Music Director Designate, with a scheduled duration under that title from 2010 to 2012, with 2 weeks of scheduled appearances in the 2010–2011 season, and 5 weeks of scheduled appearances in the 2011–2012 season. Eventually, in 2012, he was appointed music director, succeeding Dutoit, who subsequently was named conductor laureate of the orchestra. Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s initial contract as music director was for 5 seasons, with 7 weeks of scheduled concerts in the 2012–2012 season, 15 weeks in the next 2 seasons, and 16 weeks in the subsequent 2 seasons of his Philadelphia contract. In January 2015, the orchestra announced the extension of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s contract to the 2021–22 season. In June 2016, the orchestra announced a further extension of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s contract through the 2025–2026 season. In December 2017, the orchestra announced the discontinuation of its relationship with Dutoit and the revocation of his title as its conductor laureate, with immediate effect, in the wake of allegations against him of sexual assault.

The Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s current concertmaster is David Kim. Past concertmasters have included Norman Carol and Erez Ofer. Past Associate Conductors of the orchestra have included William Smith, Luis Biava, and Rossen Milanov. In 2014, Stéphane Denève was appointed principal guest conductor, Cristian Măcelaru as conductor-in-residence, and Lio Kuokman as assistant conductor. In 2016, Kensho Watanabe succeeded Kuokman as assistant conductor. Erina Yashima has served as assistant conductor since 2019. Denève served as principal guest conductor from 2014 through 2020.

As of June 2016, the orchestra does not have its own chorus. The orchestra formerly worked with the Philadelphia Singers as its resident chorus until the Philadelphia Singers disbanded in May 2015.

===Bankruptcy and industrial action===
On April 16, 2011, the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s board of directors voted to file for Chapter 11 reorganization due to the organization&#x27;s large operational deficit. This was the first time that a major U.S. orchestra had filed for bankruptcy. Amid mounting dissent from the musicians, Nézet-Séguin volunteered in August 2011 to add a week in his 2011–2012 season appearances. On July 30, 2012, the orchestra announced that it had officially emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, effective that day.

On September 30, 2016, the orchestra&#x27;s players went out on strike, one hour before its scheduled Opening Night Gala concert. The musicians issued a statement: &#x27;We can no longer remain silent while we continue in a downward spiral.&#x27; The players rejected 1–2 percent per year increases offered by management. The base pay rate was noted as less than what other similar orchestras are offering. The strike was settled after three days when musicians approved a new contract on October 2, 2016. The new agreement is scheduled to raise the base salary to $137,800 and to increase the size of the orchestra to 97 over three years.

===Recent history===
In March 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Matías Tarnopolsky as its next president and chief executive officer, in succession to Allison Vulgamore, who held the posts from 2010 through December 2017. In December 2020, the orchestra announced the appointment of Nathalie Stutzmann as its next principal guest conductor, the first female conductor ever named to this Philadelphia post, effective with the 2021–2022 season, with a contract of 3 years. In February 2023, the orchestra announced a further extension of Nézet-Séguin&#x27;s contract, through the 2029–2030 season, along with a change in his title to music and artistic director. In January 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Marin Alsop as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2024–2025 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons. In December 2024, the orchestra announced that Tarnopolsky is to stand down as its president and chief executive officer at the close of 2024.

===Firsts===
The Philadelphia Orchestra boasts a number of significant media firsts. It was the first symphony orchestra to make electrical recordings (in 1925). It was the first orchestra to make a commercially sponsored radio broadcast (on NBC in 1929) and the first to appear on a television broadcast (on CBS in 1948). The Philadelphia was the first American orchestra to make a digital recording of the complete Beethoven symphonies on compact disc (in 1988), and the first major orchestra to give a live cybercast of a concert on the internet (in 1997). In 2006, the orchestra was the first to offer downloads of music from its own website without a distributor.

In other firsts, in 1999, under Wolfgang Sawallisch, it became the first American orchestra to visit Vietnam. In 2006, the orchestra appointed Carol Jantsch principal tuba as of 2006–2007, the orchestra&#x27;s first ever female principal tuba player and the first in a full-time American orchestra.

===Rachmaninoff===
The Orchestra was known for its special relationship with the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, due primarily to Stokowski&#x27;s championship. In his first season, on January 3, 1913, Stokowski conducted &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;. Later, in an all-Rachmaninoff programme on February 3, 1920, Stokowski gave the U.S. premiere of &quot;The Bells&quot; and accompanied the composer in his 3rd Piano Concerto. In 1924 they collaborated on an acoustically recorded 78rpm set of the 2nd Piano Concerto, re-recording it electrically in 1929. On March 18, 1927, Stokowski conducted the world premieres of the &quot;Three Russian Folk Songs&quot;, of which he was the dedicatee, and the 4th Piano Concerto, again with the composer at the keyboard. Another world premiere took place on November 7, 1934, when Stokowski conducted the composer in the &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, with the two musicians making its first recording shortly afterwards.

Rachmaninoff himself also took on the role of conductor with the Philadelphia Orchestra, recording &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Vocalise&quot; with them in 1929, followed ten years later by a 78rpm set of his 3rd Symphony, a work that Stokowski had premiered on November 6, 1936. In particular, he and Ormandy were also close associates and Rachmaninoff was supposed to have said that in his American years he composed with the sound of the Philadelphia Orchestra in his head. The many recordings of the music of Rachmaninoff by Ormandy were noted as being closest to the composer&#x27;s desire. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;, Op. 45, his last work, was premiered by Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, to whom it is dedicated, on January 3, 1941.

=== Role in U.S.-China relations ===
The Orchestra has played an important role in U.S.-China relations. It made diplomatic history in 1973 when it became the first American orchestra to tour the People&#x27;s Republic of China, performing in Beijing&#x27;s Great Hall of the People and Shanghai. It has since returned 12 times, a decision that Orchestra president and CEO Matías Tarnopolsky described in a November 2023 &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece as &quot;not a signal of approval of China’s policies but rather, &quot;our journeys to China signify a belief in the possibility of change through dialogue.&quot; In November 2023, as part of the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Global Music Diplomacy Initiative and ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden&#x27;s meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in San Francisco, 14 musicians traveled to China for a series of performances amid a low point in US-China relations, recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Orchestra&#x27;s cultural exchanges with China, winning praise from both Biden and Xi for its use of music diplomacy in improving bilateral relations. U.S. Ambassador to China R. Nicholas Burns described the visit as &quot;a very important&quot; and &quot;perfectly timed event,&quot; noting that it &quot;turned the page&quot; on a four-year period of cultural disengagement between the American and the Chinese people caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Recordings==
The Orchestra&#x27;s first recordings were made for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, in 1917, when Leopold Stokowski conducted performances of two of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot;. The historic first electrical recordings were also made at Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church Studio in Camden, in April 1925; Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Danse macabre&quot; was the first to be recorded. Later, in 1926, Victor began recording the Orchestra in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Stokowski led the ensemble in experimental long-playing, high-fidelity, and even stereophonic sessions in the early 1930s for RCA Victor and Bell Laboratories. During 1939–40, Stokowski and the orchestra recorded the soundtrack for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; in multi-track stereophonic sound.

Arturo Toscanini made a series of recordings for RCA Victor with the orchestra in 1941 and 1942; the master discs for these records were supposedly damaged during processing, resulting in unusually high surface noise and distortion and they were not approved for release at the time. In 1963, after extensive electronic editing, RCA Victor issued one of the recordings on LP, Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in C major. In 1977, all of the recordings were finally issued in a 5-LP boxed set; they were later digitally remastered and reissued twice on compact disc by RCA Victor in 1992 and again in 2006.

During the 1942–44 AFM Recording Ban, the orchestra&#x27;s contract with RCA Victor expired; following the settlement of the strike in November, 1944, the orchestra joined Columbia Records, recording some of the dances from Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. The Philadelphians remained with Columbia for the next 23 years. In 1968, Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra returned to RCA Victor and made their first digital recording, Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;, for the label in 1979. The Orchestra has also recorded for EMI and Teldec.

From 1935 to 1976, The Philadelphia Orchestra performed as The Robin Hood Dell Orchestra for a summer concert series held at Robin Hood Dell, an outdoor stage in Fairmount Park. Close to 50 recordings were released under The Robin Hood Dell Orchestra name.

In May 2005, the Philadelphia Orchestra announced a three-year recording partnership with the Finnish label Ondine, the Orchestra&#x27;s first recording contract in 10 years. The resumption of a regular recording program was one of Christoph Eschenbach&#x27;s stated priorities as music director. Eight recordings were released after November 2005 to largely positive reviews.

On September 21, 2006, the Philadelphia Orchestra became the first major United States orchestra to sell downloads of its performances directly from the orchestra&#x27;s website. While other American orchestras had downloads of their music on the internet, the Philadelphia Orchestra said it was the first to offer the downloads without a distributor. In 2010, the orchestra abandoned this practice and formed a partnership with IODA, a digital distribution company with downloads available through a variety of online retailers, including iTunes, Amazon.com, Rhapsody, and eMusic.

In other media, musicians from the orchestra were featured in a documentary film by Daniel Anker, &quot;Music from the Inside Out&quot;, which received theatrical release and television airings.

The orchestra received a Grammy Award in 2022, for their recording of the first and third symphonies of Florence Price.

<doc id="156273" wikidata="Q1052769" url="?curid=156273" title="Long Island iced tea">
<text>The Long Island iced tea, or Long Island ice tea, is an IBA official cocktail, typically made with vodka, tequila, light rum, triple sec, gin, and a splash of cola. Despite its name, the cocktail does not typically contain iced tea, but is named for having the same amber hue as iced tea. 

The drink has a much higher alcohol concentration (approximately 22 percent) than most highball drinks due to the relatively small amount of mixer.

==Origin==
There are two competing origin stories for the Long Island iced tea, one from Long Island, Tennessee, and one from Long Island, New York.

Robert &quot;Rosebud&quot; Butt claims to have invented the Long Island iced tea as an entry in a contest to create a new mixed drink with triple sec in 1972 while he worked at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York.

A slightly different drink is claimed to have been invented in the 1920s during Prohibition by an &quot;Old Man Bishop&quot; in a local community named Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee. The drink was then tweaked by Ransom Bishop, Old Man Bishop&#x27;s son, by adding cola, lemon, and lime. Old Man&#x27;s version included whiskey, maple syrup, varied quantities of the five liquors, and no triple sec, rather than the modern one with cola and five equal portions of the five liquors. It was prepared in the following way:

* Squeeze a fresh lemon and a fresh lime into a glass
* Add rum, oz. gin, oz tequila, vodka, 1 oz. whiskey, and oz. maple syrup
* Mix, then add of cola

It is unknown what the quantities of the original recipe were, when and how it was changed, and how and why the varied alcoholic ingredients were distilled all in the same place or otherwise acquired during Prohibition.

While some sources say there was a recipe for Long Island iced tea in the 1961 edition of &quot;Betty Crocker&#x27;s New Picture Cook Book&quot;, no such recipe can actually be found there.

== Reception ==
The cocktail is considered a favorite of university students in the United States and it has thus garnered negative connotations as &quot;an act of mixological atrocity favored by college students and wastrels&quot;, in the words of one food critic.

The variety of spirits needed to prepare the drink means that one can prepare many other types of cocktails if they have the ingredients for a Long Island already.

The cocktail&#x27;s flavor has been described as &quot;bright and refreshing&quot;. It is easy to drink, making it &quot;dangerously &quot;.

== Recipes and variations ==
The International Bartenders Association (IBA)&#x27;s recipe calls for equal parts vodka, tequila, white rum, cointreau, gin, 2 parts lemon juice, syrup topped with cola. After stirring gently, the drink may also be garnished with a lemon slice. Robert Butt&#x27;s recipe uses sour mix instead of lemon juice and simple syrup, and he has stated that only a small amount of Coke is used, to give color. A more complex recipe published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; differs from the IBA recipe in that it uses maple syrup instead of simple syrup, uses both lemon and lime juice, and adds salt. 
However, there are many similar cocktails due to the popularity of the cocktail and the large number of ingredients that can be substituted with alternatives. Some variations include:

* Boston Tea Party, also called a Walk Me Down or an Adios Motherfucker, is a variation of the Long Island iced tea with blue curaçao substituting for the triple sec, and with lemon-lime soda substituting for the cola.
* Grateful Dead (also known as the Black Widow), which uses the same mix as a Long Island but the triple sec is replaced with raspberry liqueur and the cola with lemon-lime soda.
* Hawaiian iced tea is made by replacing the cola with pineapple juice.
* If cranberry juice is substituted for cola, the result is a Long Beach iced tea.
* If Midori is substituted in for the triple sec and lemon-lime soda replaces the Coca-Cola the result is a Tokyo iced tea, and has a greenish color.
* Tennessee tea replaces the gin with Tennessee whiskey and does not use tequila.
* Texas tea is created by adding whiskey.

<text>Table Bay (Afrikaans: &quot;Tafelbaai&quot;) is a natural bay on the Atlantic Ocean overlooked by Cape Town (founded 1652 by Van Riebeeck) and is at the northern end of the Cape Peninsula, which stretches south to the Cape of Good Hope. It was named because it is dominated by the flat-topped Table Mountain.
==History==
Bartolomeu Dias was the first European to explore this region in 1486. The bay, although famous for centuries as a haven for ships, is actually a rather poor natural harbour and is exposed to storm waves from the northwest. Many sailing ships seeking refuge in the bay during the 17th and 18th centuries were driven ashore by winter storms.

The Dutch colonists nevertheless persisted with their efforts on the shores of Table Bay, because good natural harbours along this coastline are almost non-existent. The best of them, Saldanha Bay, lacked fresh water. Simon&#x27;s Bay was well protected from westerly winter storms and swells, but more exposed to summer southeasterly storms and difficult to access overland from Cape Town. Hout Bay was small and exposed to the prevailing southwesterly swell. Eventually a harbour was built in Table Bay by a process of land reclamation and was protected from storm waves by breakwaters. The older part of this development is called the Victoria Dock; the newer part, the Duncan Dock. Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for decades, is in this bay.

The bay&#x27;s beaches were oiled following an accident involving the Dutch tanker Sliedrecht in November 1953. The vessel moved offshore to pump out 1,000 tonnes of oil that had been fouled with seawater after the initial impact.

<text>Tikal (; &quot;Tik&#x27;al&quot; in modern Mayan orthography) is the ruin of an ancient city, which was likely to have been called Yax Mutal, found in a rainforest in Guatemala. It is one of the largest archeological sites and urban centers of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization. It is located in the archeological region of the Petén Basin in what is now northern Guatemala. Situated in Petén Department, the site is part of Guatemala&#x27;s Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Tikal was the capital of a state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya. Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC, Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period, c. 200 to 900. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. There is evidence that one of Tikal&#x27;s great ruling dynasties was founded by conquerors from Teotihuacan in the 4th century AD. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site&#x27;s abandonment by the end of the 10th century.

Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces.
==Etymology==
The name Tikal may be derived from &quot;ti ak&#x27;al&quot; in the Yucatec Maya language; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning &quot;at the waterhole&quot;. The name was apparently applied to one of the site&#x27;s ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning &quot;the place of the voices&quot; in the Itza Maya language. Tikal, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s. Hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as &quot;Yax Mutal&quot; or &quot;Yax Mutul&quot;, meaning &quot;First Mutal&quot;. Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name.
The kingdom as a whole was simply called &quot;Mutul&quot;, which is the reading of the &quot;hair bundle&quot; emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure.

== Geography ==

The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa Elena, approximately by road to the southwest. Tikal is approximately north of Guatemala City. It is south of the contemporary Maya city of Uaxactun and northwest of Yaxha. The city was located southeast of its great Classic Period rival, Calakmul, and northwest of Calakmul&#x27;s ally Caracol, now in Belize.

The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than that included about 3,000 structures. The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands. The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised causeways spanning the swamps. The area around Tikal has been declared as the Tikal National Park and the preserved area covers . It was created on 26 May 1955 under the auspices of the Instituto de Antropología e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala.

The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland Maya civilization. The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils, and may have dominated a natural east–west trade route across the Yucatán Peninsula. Conspicuous trees at the Tikal park include gigantic Kapok tree (&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;) the sacred tree of the Maya; tropical cedar (&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;), and Honduras mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;). Regarding the fauna, agoutis, white-nosed coatis, gray foxes, Geoffroy&#x27;s spider monkeys, howler monkeys, harpy eagles, falcons, ocellated turkeys, guans, toucans, green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly. Jaguars, ocelots, and cougars are also said to roam in the park.

Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs. Archeologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use. The average annual rainfall at Tikal is . However, the arrival of rain was often unpredictable, and long periods of drought could occur before the crops ripened, which severely threatened the inhabitants of the city.

==Population==

Population estimates for Tikal vary from 10,000 to as high as 90,000 inhabitants. The population of Tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the Preclassic Period (approximately 2000 BC – AD 200), with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830, followed by a sharp decline. For the area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer (1340 per square mile). In an area within a radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer (689 per square mile). In a region within a radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high.

==History==

===Preclassic===

There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC, in the Middle Preclassic. A cache of Mamon ceramics dating from about 700–400 BC were found in a sealed chultun, a subterranean bottle-shaped chamber.

Major construction at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400–300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire Yucatán Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.

Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled superstructures that may have been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red.

In the 1st century AD, rich burials first appeared and Tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined. At the end of the Late Preclassic, the Izapan style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal, as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city.

===Early Classic===

Dynastic rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty was founded by Yax Ehb Xook, perhaps in the 1st century AD. At the beginning of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at Tikal and Calakmul, in the core of the Maya heartland.

Tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large Preclassic states such as El Mirador. In the Early Classic Tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region, stimulating the development of other nearby Maya cities.

The site, however, was often at war and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states, including Uaxactun, Caracol, Naranjo and Calakmul. The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by Caracol, which rose to take Tikal&#x27;s place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands. The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its neighbor Uaxactun, with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from Tikal.

There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317, when Lady Unen Bahlam conducted a Kʼatun-ending ceremony, apparently as queen of the city.

====Tikal and Teotihuacan====
As early as 200 AD, Teotihuacan had embassies in Tikal.

The fourteenth king of Tikal was Chak Tok Ichʼaak (Great Jaguar Paw). Chak Tok Ichʼaak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about Chak Tok Ichʼaak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD. On the same day, Siyaj Kʼakʼ (Fire Is Born) arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of Tikal, on 8 January. On Stela 31 he is named as &quot;Lord of the West&quot;. Siyaj Kʼakʼ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non-Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan. These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyaj Kʼakʼ led a Teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native Tikal king, who was captured and immediately executed. Siyaj Kʼakʼ appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of Teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including Uaxactun, where he became king, but did not take the throne of Tikal for himself. Within a year, the son of Spearthrower Owl by the name of Yax Nuun Ahiin I (First Crocodile) had been installed as the fifteenth king of Tikal while he was still a boy, being enthroned on 13 September 379. He reigned for 47 years as king of Tikal, and remained a vassal of Siyaj Kʼakʼ for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that Yax Nuun Ayiin I took a wife from the preexisting, defeated, Tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son, Siyaj Chan Kʼawiil II.

Río Azul, a small site northeast of Tikal, was conquered by the latter during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The site became an outpost of Tikal, shielding it from hostile cities further north, and also became a trade link to the Caribbean.

Although the new rulers of Tikal were foreign, their descendants were rapidly Mayanized. Tikal became the key ally and trading partner of Teotihuacan in the Maya lowlands. After being conquered by Teotihuacan, Tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern Peten. Uaxactun, together with smaller towns in the region, were absorbed into Tikal&#x27;s kingdom. Other sites, such as Bejucal and Motul de San José near Lake Petén Itzá became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north. By the middle of the 5th century Tikal had a core territory of at least in every direction.

Around the 5th century, an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of Tikal&#x27;s hinterland, joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city. Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south. These defenses protected Tikal&#x27;s core population and agricultural resources, encircling an area of approximately . Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose.

====Tikal and Copán====
In the 5th century, the power of the city reached as far south as Copán, whose founder Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Mo&#x27; was clearly connected with Tikal. Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal. Kʼinich Yax Kukʼ Moʼ arrived in Copán in December 426, and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal. An individual known as Ajaw Kʼukʼ Mo&#x27; (lord Kʼukʼ Moʼ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person. His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan. Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as &quot;Lord of the West&quot;, much like Siyaj Kʼakʼ. At the same time, in late 426, Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá, possibly sponsored by Tikal itself. The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal&#x27;s authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region. The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries.

A long-running rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul began in the 6th century, with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long-running war between two Maya superpowers. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title &quot;kaloomteʼ&quot;, a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to &quot;high king&quot;.

The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot;, who was very likely a daughter of Chak Tok Ichʼaak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers. The first of these was Kaloomteʼ Bʼalam, who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord &quot;Bird Claw&quot;, who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler.

===Late Classic===

====Tikal hiatus====

In the mid 6th century, Caracol seems to have allied with Calakmul and defeated Tikal, closing the Early Classic. The &quot;Tikal hiatus&quot; refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large-scale construction at Tikal. In the latter half of the 6th century AD, a serious crisis befell the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal&#x27;s comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal. The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562. It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal, with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city. Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal&#x27;s population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with Janaabʼ Pakal of Palenque, another of Calakmul&#x27;s victims. Calakmul itself thrived during Tikal&#x27;s long hiatus period.

The beginning of the Tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which archeologists commonly subdivide the Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology into the Early and Late Classic.

====Tikal and Dos Pilas====

In 629, Tikal founded Dos Pilas, some to the southwest, as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the Pasión River. Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four, in 635. When he was older, for many years he served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother, the king of Tikal. Roughly twenty years later, Dos Pilas was attacked by Calakmul and was soundly defeated. Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil was captured by the king of Calakmul but, instead of being sacrificed, he was re-instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy.

He attacked Tikal in 657, forcing Nuun Ujol Chaak, then king of Tikal, to temporarily abandon the city. The first two rulers of Dos Pilas continued to use the Mutal emblem glyph of Tikal, and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of Tikal itself. For some reason, Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil was not installed as the new ruler of Tikal; instead he stayed at Dos Pilas. Tikal counterattacked against Dos Pilas in 672, driving Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil into an exile that lasted five years. Calakmul tried to encircle Tikal within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, Dos Pilas, and Caracol.

In 682, Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of &quot;kaloomteʼ&quot;, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a program of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory.

====Tikal after Teotihuacan====
By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I and his heir Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Petén Itzá. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today.

In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal&#x27;s key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal&#x27;s southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.

In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers.

===Terminal Classic===

By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal&#x27;s supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city&#x27;s major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th Kʼatun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bakʼtun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal&#x27;s control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel Kʼawiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal&#x27;s once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.

As Tikal and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered deforestation, soil erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels. Recent analysis also indicates that the city&#x27;s freshwater sources became highly contaminated with mercury, phosphate and cyanobacteria leading to the accumulation of toxins. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.
In the latter half of the 9th century, there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal&#x27;s population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city&#x27;s ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal&#x27;s population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century.

The most likely cause of collapse at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having been at the forefront of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal, fouling some reservoirs near the temple and palace with algae blooms, while other reservoirs remained drinkable. Buildings were painted with mercury-bearing cinnabar, which were washed off by rain and polluted some reservoirs. 
Works of Kohler and colleagues showed that this city reached an unsustainable level of inequalities at the end.

===Modern history===

In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed within a few kilometers of the ruins of Tikal but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño became lost in the Petén forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that may well have been Tikal.

As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839–40 travels in the region). Because of the site&#x27;s remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881–82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.

In 1951, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days&#x27; travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In 1956 the Tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From 1956 through 1970, major archeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. Shook and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969. The Tikal Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site. In 1979, the Guatemalan government began a further archeological project at Tikal, which continued through to 1984.

Filmmaker George Lucas used Tikal as a filming location for the fictional moon Yavin 4 in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, which premiered in 1977.

Temple I at Tikal was featured on the reverse of the 50 centavo banknote.

Eon Productions used the site for the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

Tikal is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park. A site museum has been built at Tikal; it was completed in 1964.

==Site description==
Tikal has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala. It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas. The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over high, large royal palaces, in addition to a number of smaller pyramids, palaces, residences, administrative buildings, platforms and inscribed stone monuments. There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail, originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors. There are also seven courts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza, a unique feature in Mesoamerica.

The limestone used for construction was local and quarried on-site. The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs, together with some waterproofed natural depressions. The main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs.

The residential area of Tikal covers an estimated , much of which has not yet been cleared, mapped, or excavated. The area around the site core has been intensively mapped; it may have enclosed an area of some (see below). A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. Puleston and Donald Callender in the 1960s rings Tikal with a wide trench behind a rampart. Recently, a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequential as a defensive feature. In addition, some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system. The earthwork of Tikal varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and multifaceted than originally thought.

===Causeways===

By the Late Classic, a network of &quot;sacbeob&quot; (causeways) linked various parts of the city, running for several kilometers through its urban core. These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 (located about to the west) and the Temple of the Inscriptions (about to the southeast). These broad causeways were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archeologists; the Maler, Maudslay, Tozzer and Méndez causeways. They assisted the passage of everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams.

The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas-relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic.

The Maudsley Causeway runs northeast from Temple IV to Group H.

The Mendez Causeway runs southeast from the East Plaza to Temple VI, a distance of about .

The Tozzer Causeway runs west from the Great Plaza to Temple IV.

=== Water reservoirs ===
Water reservoirs played a critical role in the development and maintenance of both Tikal and other Maya cities. Though evidently serving as a body of water to draw from during the dry season and drought periods, water reservoirs also possessed a cultural and political significance. Hence, noteworthy investment was made by Maya societies into their reservoirs to ensure high water quality as well as consolidate political power.

Aside from Tikal, notable reservoirs are also present at Calakmul, Caracol, and Naranjo, among others.

==== Water quality maintenance ====
Human manipulation of the natural environment can result in unintended consequences. For instance, storing water not only can result in decreased water quality but also enable endemic diseases and pests, such as parasite-ridden flies and malaria-bearing mosquitoes, to flourish. Additionally, fungal species can proliferate in improperly stored or stressed maize which can produce chemicals like aflatoxin, a deadly liver carcinogen. However, the Maya were adept in constructing reservoirs that could guarantee high water quality. The Maya applied their knowledge of wetland biosphere ecology and ensured a balance of hydrophytic and macrophytic plants and other organisms. For example, the Maya widely adopted the dotleaf waterlily, &quot;Nymphaea ampla,&quot; in their reservoirs&#x27; bodies of water. Dotleaf waterlilies, have bluish undersides that prevent passage of light and thus minimizes algae growth, inhibits evaporation, provides shade for predators of pests, removes nitrogen through their roots, and serves as an indicator of acidic conditions as water lilies cannot tolerate low pH levels; low pH levels have been linked to tooth corrosion and disruption of gut homeostasis. Lastly, lining the reservoir with clay was also intelligently applied to help stabilize water pH.

==== Role in political power ====
A significant proportion of royal power rested in what the ruling party could materially provide for their subjects (i.e. water during annual drought through massive artificial reservoirs). Hence, water and by extension, reservoirs became a significant part of the Maya power structure. This also means that a way for Maya rulers to concentrate their power would be through proper water management. This created a feedback loop in which tools associated with water management became associated with Maya rulers. The association of clean water, water lilies, and royal power is amply illustrated in the iconography.

This also means that when water was mismanaged, the rulers were blamed for it. For example, in the Maya city of Caracol droughts peaked in the years 806, 829, 842, 857, 895, 909 921 and 935 A.D. Most importantly, the years between A.D. 804 and 938 show a 36% to 56% drop in precipitation. While the rulers were blamed and eventually moved away, the common people stayed.

===Architectural groups===

The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple-pyramids. On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis.

The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza.

The North Acropolis, together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south, is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area; the Tikal Project excavated a massive trench across the complex, thoroughly investigating its construction history. It is a complex group with construction beginning in the Preclassic Period, around 350 BC. It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured , gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods. By the 9th century AD, 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period.
The South Acropolis is found next to Temple V. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than .

The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis. It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples, by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side.

The Mundo Perdido is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal. The complex was organized as a large E-Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples. The Mundo Perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history. By AD 250–300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, including the use of the &quot;talud-tablero&quot; form. During the Early Classic period (c. 250–600) the Mundo Perdido became one of the twin foci of the city, the other being the North Acropolis. From AD 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis. The Mundo Perdido complex was given its name by the archeologists of the University of Pennsylvania; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it. To the south of Mundo Perdido, recent 2021 excavations have revealed a one-third size replication of La Ciudadela, or The Citadel, in Teotihuacan. This area may have been used as a diplomatic headquarters and as an effort to further stamp Teotihuacan culture upon the residents of Tikal.

Group G lies just south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace-type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper story. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.

Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza. It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic.
There are nine Twin-pyramid complexes at Tikal, one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east–west axis. These pyramids are flat-topped and have stairways on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids. Lying roughly equidistant from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20-year (or &quot;k&#x27;atun&quot;) intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin-pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as Yaxha and Ixlu, and they may reflect the extent of Tikal&#x27;s political dominance in the Late Classic.

Group Q is a twin-pyramid complex, and is one of the largest at Tikal. It was built by Yax Nuun Ayiin II in 771 in order to mark the end of the 17th K&#x27;atun. Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re-erected.

Group R is another twin-pyramid complex, dated to 790. It is close to the Maler Causeway.

===Structures===
There are thousands of ancient structures at Tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated, after decades of archeological work. The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids, labelled Temples I – VI, each of which support a temple structure on their summits. Some of these pyramids are over high. They were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site. It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years.

Temple I (also known as the &quot;Temple of Ah Cacao&quot; or &quot;Temple of the Great Jaguar&quot;) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to Jasaw Chan Kʼawil, who was entombed in the structure in AD 734, the pyramid was completed around 740–750. The temple rises high. The massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives. The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved and rubbed with vermilion, as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink. The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams. The outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved, some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown, while others were taken to museums in Europe.
Temple II (also known as the &quot;Temple of the Mask&quot;) it was built around AD 700 and stands high. Like other major temples at Tikal, the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels, only the middle of which was carved. The temple was dedicated to the wife of Jasaw Chan Kʼawil, although no tomb was found. The queen&#x27;s portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine. One of the beams from this lintel is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

Temple III (also known as the &quot;Temple of the Jaguar Priest&quot;) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at Tikal. It stood tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel, possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD 810. The temple shrine possesses two chambers.

Temple IV is the tallest temple-pyramid at Tikal, measuring from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb. Temple IV marks the reign of Yikʼin Chan Kawil (Ruler B, the son of Ruler A or Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I) and two carved wooden lintels over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid&#x27;s summit record a long count date (9.15.10.0.0) that corresponds to CE 741 (Sharer 1994:169). Temple IV is one of the largest pyramids built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century, and it stands as one of the tallest pre-Columbian structures in the Americas, only surpassed by the Great Pyramid of Toniná (75 meters) and La Danta pyramid of El Mirador (72 meters) while the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan may originally have been taller (71 meters).

Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler. The temple stands high, making it the second tallest structure at Tikal – only Temple IV is taller. The temple has been dated to about AD 700, in the Late Classic period, via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of Nun Bak Chak in the second half of the 7th century.

Temple VI is also known as the &quot;Temple of the Inscriptions&quot; and was dedicated in AD 766. It is notable for its high roof-comb. Panels of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof-comb. The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is unrestored.

Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of Siyaj Chan Kʼawiil I (known as Burial 48) in the North Acropolis. It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway. Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure (Burial 23). While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb (Burial 24) was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing tall. The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction.

Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other.
Structure 5D-43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre-existing twin-pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a &quot;talud-tablero&quot; platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajín and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical &quot;tablero&quot; panels are set between sloping &quot;talud&quot; panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping &quot;talud&quot; panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.

Structure 5C-49 possesses a clear Teotihuacan-linked architectural style; it has balustrades, an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region, and a &quot;talud-tablero&quot; façade; it dates to the 4th century AD. It is located near to the Lost World pyramid.

Structure 5C-53 is a small Teotihuacan-style platform that dates to about AD 600. It had stairways on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure.
The Lost World Pyramid (Structure 5C-54) is the largest structure in the Mundo Perdido complex. It lies in the southwest portion of Tikal&#x27;s central core, south of Temple III and west of Temple V. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late Preclassic; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un-impacted by later building activity at Tikal. By the end of the Late Preclassic this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region. It attained its final form during the reign of Chak Tok Ichʼaak in the 4th century AD, in the Early Classic, standing more than high with stairways on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from perishable materials. Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration, the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex adheres to the layout that defines the so-called E-Groups, identified as solar observatories.

Structure 5D-96 is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull-and-crossbones motifs.

Group 6C-16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated. It lies a few hundred m south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks, ballplayer murals, relief sculptures and buildings with Teotihuacan characteristics.

The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis.

The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III. It has two storeys, with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey, which has been restored. The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows.

Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III. The complex dates to AD 711.

In 2018, 60,000 uncharted structures were revealed by archeologists with help of Lidar. Thanks to the new findings, some archeologists believe that 7–11 million Maya people inhabited in the northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like Tikal were bigger than previously thought. The project was mapped near the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the Petén region of Guatemala.

===Altars===

Altar 5 is carved with two nobles, one of whom is probably Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman. Altar 5 was found in Complex N, which lies to the west of Temple III.

Altar 8 is sculpted with a bound captive. It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.

Altar 9 is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive. It is located in front of Temple VI.

Altar 10 is carved with a captive tied to a scaffold. It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q, a twin-pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion.

Altar 35 is a plain monument associated with Stela 43. The stela-altar pair is centrally located at the base of the stairway of Temple IV.

===Lintels===

At Tikal, beams of sapodilla wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples. These are the most elaborately carved wooden lintels to have survived anywhere in the Maya region.

Lintel 3 from Temple IV was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the 19th century. It was in almost perfect condition and depicts Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil seated on a palanquin.

===Stelae===

Stelae are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at Tikal follows:

Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king Siyaj Chan Kʼawiil II in a standing position.

Stela 4 is dated to AD 396, during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the intrusion of Teotihuacan in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tláloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.

Stela 5 was dedicated in 744 by Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil.

Stela 6 is a badly damaged monument dating to 514 and bears the name of the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot; who celebrated the end of the 4th Kʼatun in that year.

Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged. It described the accession of Kaloomteʼ Bʼalam in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career, including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument.

Stela 11 was the last monument ever erected at Tikal; it was dedicated in 869 by Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil II.

Stela 12 is linked to the queen known as the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot; and king Kaloomteʼ Bʼalam. The queen is described as performing the year-ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king.

Stela 16 was dedicated in 711, during the reign of Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I. The sculpture, including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text, are limited to the front face of the monument. It was found in Complex N, west of Temple III.

Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by Yax Nuun Ayiin I to celebrate the &quot;kʼatun&quot;-ending of AD 396. It was re-erected at the base of Temple 34, his funerary shrine.

Stela 19 was dedicated in 790 by Yax Nuun Ayiin II.

Stela 20 was found in Complex P, in Group H, and was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.

Stela 21 was dedicated in 736 by Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil. Only the bottom of the stela is intact, the rest having been mutilated in ancient times. The surviving sculpture is of fine quality, consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text. The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI.

Stela 22 was dedicated in 771 by Yax Nuun Ahiin II in the northern enclosure of Group Q, a twin-pyramid complex. The face of the figure on the stela has been mutilated.

Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re-erected in a residential complex. The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so-called &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot;, a daughter of Chak Tok Ichʼaak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right, being paired with male co-rulers. It dates to the early 6th century.

Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in 810, accompanied by Altar 7. Both were broken into fragments in ancient times, although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments.

Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34, underneath a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine.

Stela 29 bears a Long Count (8.12.14.8.15) date equivalent to AD 292, the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding the head of an underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archeologists in 1959.

Stela 30 is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography is similar to that of Caracol, one of the more important of Tikal&#x27;s enemies.
Stela 31 is the accession monument of Siyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil II, also bearing two portraits of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, as a youth dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of Tláloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah Kʼakʼ at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.

Stela 32 is a fragmented monument with a foreign Teotihuacan-style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god Tláloc, including his goggle eyes and tasselled headdress.

Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ichʼaak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling the figure of a bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text on the back of the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Kʼatun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ichʼaak I&#x27;s father as Kʼinich Muwaan Jol.

Stela 40 bears a portrait of Kan Chitam and dates to AD 468.

Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35. It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV.

===Burials===
Burial 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb, with the handle formed from three-dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two-dimensional body painted on the lid.

Burial 10 is the tomb of Yax Nuun Ahiin I. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb contained a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner in the shape of an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.

Burial 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of Sihyaj Chan Kʼawiil II. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king&#x27;s skeleton was missing its skull, its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact.

Burial 85 dates to the Late Preclassic and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb Xook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.

Burial 116 is the tomb of Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, below the level of the Great Plaza. The tomb contained rich offerings of jadeite, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.

Burial 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god Kʼawiil, the wooden originals long gone.

Burial 196 is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a jade mosaic vessel topped with the head of the Maize God.

<text>The Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) is a Canadian orchestra based in Toronto, Ontario. Founded in 1906, the TSO gave regular concerts at Massey Hall until 1982, and since then has performed at Roy Thomson Hall. The TSO also manages the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra (TSYO). Peter Oundjian was the music director from 2004 to 2018. Sir Andrew Davis, conductor laureate of the TSO, was the orchestra&#x27;s interim artistic director from 2018 to 2020. Gustavo Gimeno has been the music director of the TSO since the 2020–2021 season.

==History==
The TSO was founded in 1922 as the New Symphony Orchestra, and gave its first concert at Massey Hall in April 1923 with 58 musicians. The first conductor was Luigi von Kunits, and that season there were twenty concerts, as well as a performance at a spring festival.

In the summer of 1924, the symphony performed at the Canadian National Exhibition. Shortly thereafter, they began holding children&#x27;s concerts. The orchestra changed its name to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1927. In 1929, the TSO made its radio debut with a one-hour broadcast on CBC Radio from the Arcadian Court.

After von Kunits&#x27; death in 1931, Ernest MacMillan served as music director for 25 years. In 1951, the orchestra made headlines when it declined to renew the contracts of musicians, thereafter known as the Symphony Six, who had been denied entry to the United States on suspicion of communist activities, during the McCarthy Era.

Andrew Davis was the TSO&#x27;s music director from 1975 to 1988. The TSO subsequently granted Davis the title of conductor laureate.

The orchestra had financial and audience size problems during the 1990s, and in 1992, TSO musicians accepted a 16% pay cut because of a threat of bankruptcy to the orchestra, with a promise from management to make up the loss in subsequent contract negotiations. By 1999, this pay restoration had not happened, which led to an 11-week musicians&#x27; strike that autumn. Relations between the musicians and management deteriorated, and the music director at the time, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, offered to serve as mediator in the situation. In addition, there was a lack of public sympathy to the orchestra musicians&#x27; situation. By 2001, the TSO had debt of $7 million CAD, and both executive director Ed Smith and music director Saraste had left the ensemble.

Peter Oundjian was appointed as music director in January 2003 and became music director in the 2004–2005 season. The 2005 documentary film &quot;Five Days in September: The Rebirth of an Orchestra&quot; recorded the first days of the TSO&#x27;s inaugural season with Oundjian as its new music director. His contract was extended through to the 2017-2018 season. He concluded his TSO tenure at the close of the 2017-2018 season and was given the title of conductor emeritus. With Oundjian, the TSO made commercial recordings for its own TSO Live label and for other labels such as Chandos Records.

By the 2006–2007 season, the subscriber base had increased to about 25,000, and the audience average capacity also increased to 84%. In November 2008, the orchestra reported its third consecutive year of budget surpluses, with average audience attendance of 88% (excluding concerts for schoolchildren), although the orchestra still retained overall debt of $8.9 million CAD in 2008. In 2022, the TSO ended the season with its first net surplus since 1979.

In April 2015, controversy ensued after the TSO cancelled the appearance of Valentina Lisitsa, citing Twitter postings by her in relation to the war in Donbas which were seen as conducive to &quot;public incitement of hatred&quot; under the Criminal Code of Canada. 

In January 2017, the TSO announced its participation in the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Canada, with a cross-country celebration of Canadian music funded by the Canadian government.

In May 2017, the TSO announced the return of Davis to the orchestra as its interim artistic director, beginning with the 2018-2019 season, for a period of two seasons. In April 2018, the TSO announced the appointment of Matthew Loden as its chief executive officer (CEO), effective July 2018.

In February 2018, Gustavo Gimeno guest-conducted the TSO for the first time. On the basis of this appearance, the TSO announced the appointment of Gimeno as its next music director, effective in the 2020-2021 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.

In July 2020, the TSO announced the cancellation of its originally scheduled 2020-2021 concert season, with plans for replacement concerts on a smaller scale in various Toronto venues, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021, the TSO announced that Matthew Loden was to stand down as its CEO, effective 22 September 2021. In January 2022, the TSO announced the appointment of Mark Williams as its next chief executive officer, effective April 2022. In November 2022, the TSO announced the extension of Gimeno&#x27;s contract as its music director through 2030.

<doc id="156282" wikidata="Q369617" url="?curid=156282" title="Jon Lech Johansen">
<text>Jon Lech Johansen (born November 18, 1983, in Harstad, Norway), also known as DVD Jon, is a Norwegian programmer who has worked on reverse engineering data formats. He wrote the DeCSS software, which decodes the Content Scramble System used for DVD licensing enforcement. Johansen is a self-trained software engineer, who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006. He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.

==Early life and education==
Jon Lech Johansen was born in Harstad to a Norwegian father and a Polish mother. The family later moved to Lardal, where he grew up. At the age of twelve, Johansen began learning programming. He attended Thor Heyerdahl Upper Secondary School in Larvik.

In a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (&quot;Programming the 8086/8088&quot;), the web (&quot;Fravia&#x27;s site was a goldmine&quot;) and IRC (&quot;Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.&quot;)

== DeCSS prosecution ==
After Johansen released DeCSS, he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (&quot;Økokrim&quot; in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US DVD Copy Control Association (DVD-CCA) and the Motion Picture Association (MPA). Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The trial opened in the Oslo District Court on December 9, 2002, with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else&#x27;s information, since Johansen owned the DVDs himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on January 7, 2003, acquitting Johansen of all charges.

Two further levels of appeals were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. Økokrim filed an appeal on January 20, 2003, and it was reported on February 28 that the Borgarting Court of Appeal had agreed to hear the case. Johansen&#x27;s second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on December 2, 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on December 22, 2003. Økokrim announced on January 5, 2004, that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

==Other projects==
In the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen&#x27;s career has included many other projects.

===2001===
In 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.

===2003===
In November 2003, Johansen released QTFairUse, an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the digital rights management (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, Apple Computer&#x27;s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple&#x27;s encryption.

===2004===
Johansen had by now become a VideoLAN developer, and had reverse engineered FairPlay and written VLC&#x27;s FairPlay support. It has been available in VideoLAN CVS since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).

===2005===
On March 18, 2005, Travis Watkins and Cody Brocious, along with Johansen, wrote PyMusique, a Python based program which allows the download of purchased files from the iTunes Music Store without DRM encryption. This was possible because Apple Computer&#x27;s iTunes software adds the DRM to the music file after the music file is downloaded. On March 22, Apple released a patch for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.

On June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google&#x27;s new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google&#x27;s servers.

In late 2005, Håkon Wium Lie, the Norwegian CTO of Opera Software, co-creator of Cascading Style Sheets and long-time supporter of open source, named Johansen a &quot;hero&quot; in a net meeting arranged by one of Norway&#x27;s biggest newspapers. On September 2, 2005, &quot;The Register&quot; published news that DVD Jon had defeated encryption in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Player by reverse engineering a proprietary algorithm that was ostensibly used to protect Windows Media Station NSC files from engineers sniffing for the files&#x27; source IP address, port or stream format. Johansen had also made a decoder available.

In September 2005, Johansen announced the release of SharpMusique 1.0, an alternative to the default iTunes program. The program allows Linux and Windows users to buy songs from the iTunes music store without copy protection. In 2005, Johansen worked for MP3tunes in San Diego as a software engineer. His first project was a new digital music product, code-named Oboe.

====Sony BMG DRM rootkit====
In November 2005, a Slashdot story claimed that Sony-BMGs Extended Copy Protection (XCP) DRM software includes code and comments (such as &quot;copyright (c) Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.&quot;) illegally copied from an iTunes DRM circumvention program by Johansen. A popular claim was that, using the criteria that RIAA uses in its copyright lawsuits, Johansen could sue for billions of dollars in damages.

===2006===
On January 8, 2006, Johansen revealed his intent to defeat the encryption of next-generation DVD encryption, Advanced Access Content System (AACS). On June 7, 2006, he announced that he had moved to San Francisco and was joining DoubleTwist Ventures. In October 2006, Johansen and DoubleTwist Ventures announced they had reverse engineered Apple Computer&#x27;s DRM for iTunes, called FairPlay. Rather than allow people to strip the DRM, DoubleTwist would license the ability to apply FairPlay to media companies who wanted their music and videos to play on the iPod, without having to sign a distribution contract with Apple.

===2007===
In July 2007, Johansen managed to allow the iPhone to work as an iPod with WiFi, without AT&amp;T activation.

===2008===
On February 2, 2008, Johansen launched doubleTwist, which allows customers to route around DRM in music files and convert files between various formats. The software converts digital music of any bitrate encoded with any popular codec into a format that can be played on any device.

=== 2009 ===
In June, he managed to get an advertisement for his application doubleTwist on the wall of the Bay Area Rapid Transit exit outside the San Francisco Apple Store, just days before the 2009 WWDC event. On June 9, it was reported that the advertisement was removed by BART for allegedly &quot;being too dark&quot; and not allowing enough light into the adjoining transit station. The advertisement was later redesigned and redeployed with a transparent background.

<doc id="156292" wikidata="Q863397" url="?curid=156292" title="London Philharmonic Orchestra">
<text>The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) is a British orchestra based in London. One of five permanent symphony orchestras in London, the LPO was founded by the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Malcolm Sargent in 1932 as a rival to the existing London Symphony and BBC Symphony Orchestras.

The founders&#x27; ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war, the orchestra&#x27;s private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years, the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals, the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic. Founded respectively in 1945 and 1946, these orchestras achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older groups, including the LPO.

By the 1960s, the LPO had regained its earlier standards, and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the Glyndebourne Festival during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, one of London&#x27;s major concert venues. Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia. In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne, the LPO performs regularly at the Congress Theatre, Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome, and tours nationally and internationally.

Since Beecham, the orchestra has had ten principal conductors, including Sir Adrian Boult, Bernard Haitink, Sir Georg Solti, Klaus Tennstedt and Vladimir Jurowski. The orchestra has been active in recording studios since its earliest days, and has played on hundreds of sets made by EMI, Decca and other companies. Since 2005 the LPO has had its own record label, issuing live recordings of concerts. The orchestra has played on numerous film soundtracks, including &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–03).

==History==
===Background===
In the 1920s, the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) was the city&#x27;s best-known concert and recording orchestra. Others were the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra, the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the BBC&#x27;s Wireless Symphony Orchestra and Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra. All except the last of these were essentially &quot;ad hoc&quot; ensembles, with little continuity of personnel, and none approached the excellence of the best continental and American orchestras. This became obvious in 1927 when the Berlin Philharmonic, under Wilhelm Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; later commented, &quot;the British public ... was electrified when it heard the disciplined precision of the Berlin Philharmonic ... This apparently was how an orchestra could, and, therefore, ought to sound&quot;. After the Berliners, London heard a succession of major foreign orchestras, including the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam under Willem Mengelberg and the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York under Arturo Toscanini.
Among those determined that London should have a permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.

In 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent&#x27;s patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the LSO, but the orchestra, a self-governing body, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932, Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. With the BBC having attracted a large number of the finest musicians from other orchestras, many in the musical world doubted that Beecham could find enough good players. He was fortunate in the timing of the enterprise: the depressed economy had severely reduced the number of freelance dates available to orchestral players. Moreover, Beecham himself was a strong attraction to many musicians: he later commented, &quot;I always get the players. Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me.&quot; In a study of the foundation of the LPO, David Patmore writes, &quot;The combination of steady work, occasionally higher than usual rates, variety of performance and Beecham&#x27;s own magnetic personality would make such an offering irresistible to many orchestral musicians.&quot;

Beecham and Sargent had financial backing from leading figures in commerce, including Samuel Courtauld, Robert Mayer and Baron Frédéric d&#x27;Erlanger, and secured profitable contracts to record for Columbia and play for the Royal Philharmonic Society, the Royal Choral Society, the Courtauld-Sargent Concerts, Mayer&#x27;s concerts for children, and the international opera season at Covent Garden.

During his earlier negotiations with the BBC, Beecham had proposed the title &quot;London Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;, which was now adopted for the new ensemble. With the aid of the impresario Harold Holt and other influential and informed contacts he recruited 106 players. They included a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO&#x27;s leading members. During the early years, the orchestra was led by Paul Beard and David McCallum, and included leading players such as James Bradshaw, Gwydion Brooke, Geoffrey Gilbert, Léon Goossens, Gerald Jackson, Reginald Kell, Anthony Pini and Bernard Walton. Holt became the LPO&#x27;s business manager, and the management board included the orchestra&#x27;s principal benefactors: Courtauld, Mayer and d&#x27;Erlanger.

===Early years===
After twelve rehearsals, the orchestra made its debut at the Queen&#x27;s Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. but now he assumed a new seriousness, always arriving punctually. After the first item, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Roman Carnival Overture&quot;, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Ernest Newman wrote, &quot;Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience could not have been greater.&quot; In &quot;The Times&quot; H C Colles said that the LPO was &quot;as fine an instrument as could be wished for&quot;; Neville Cardus wrote in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna&quot;; and W J Turner, of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, praised the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;youthful dash and virtuosity ... at last we have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra&quot;.

In its first season, the LPO played at eighteen concerts in the Courtauld-Sargent series; ten Royal Philharmonic Society concerts; fifteen &quot;International Celebrity Tours&quot; and sixteen Sunday afternoon concerts for Holt&#x27;s agency, as well as Robert Mayer&#x27;s children&#x27;s concerts, Royal Choral Society evenings and other engagements. Soloists in the first season included the singer Eva Turner and the pianists Harriet Cohen and Clifford Curzon. In November 1932 the sixteen-year-old Yehudi Menuhin played a programme of violin concertos; those by Bach and Mozart were conducted by Beecham, and the Elgar concerto was conducted by the composer.

During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen&#x27;s Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society, played for Beecham&#x27;s opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. The total number of works, as opposed to discs, recorded by the LPO and Beecham was less than a hundred. There were a few guest conductors for the Sunday concerts, but most were conducted by Beecham. In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including Bruno Walter, George Szell, Fritz Busch and Igor Stravinsky.

In addition to London engagements, the orchestra played regularly in the larger provincial cities and towns. Its first tour, in March and April 1933, started in Bristol and ended in Manchester, taking in thirteen other venues in England, Ireland and Scotland. After the last concert, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&#x27;s&quot; reviewer wrote:
Beecham took the orchestra on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored the custom of playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from Hitler&#x27;s government not to play the &quot;Italian&quot; Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet among some of the players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.

===War and post-war years===
As his sixtieth birthday approached in 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year&#x27;s break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure the future of the orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.

During the war, the LPO played in the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, including 50 under Richard Tauber, bringing orchestral concerts to places where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players&#x27; instruments were lost when the Queen&#x27;s Hall was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.

On Beecham&#x27;s return to England in 1944, the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO).

Among the conductors making guest appearances in the early post-war period were Walter, Furtwängler, Victor de Sabata and Sergiu Celibidache. Such starry events were the exception; as a rule the orchestra worked with less eminent conductors, giving an unprecedented number of performances. In 1949–50 they gave 248 concerts, compared with 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra and 32 each by the Philharmonia Orchestra and RPO. After a seven-year interregnum, the LPO engaged a new principal conductor, Eduard van Beinum, in 1947. He was initially able to work with the orchestra for only six months of the year, because of restrictions on work permits for foreign nationals. Guest conductors stood in during his absences. In 1947, the London Philharmonic Choir was founded as the chorus for the LPO.

===1950s===
Van Beinum&#x27;s poor health obliged him to resign in 1950. Sir Adrian Boult accepted an invitation from the LPO&#x27;s managing director, Thomas Russell, to take up the principal conductorship. With Boult the LPO began a series of commercial recordings, beginning with Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot; with the mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven&#x27;s First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by reviewers. Of the Elgar, the reviewer in &quot;The Gramophone&quot; wrote, &quot;I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult&#x27;s] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably&quot;.

In January 1951, Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Boult&#x27;s biographer Michael Kennedy as &quot;gruelling&quot;, with twelve concerts in as many days. The symphonies they played were Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;London&quot;, No 104, Brahms&#x27;s First, Schumann&#x27;s Fourth and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C major&quot;. The other works were Elgar&#x27;s Introduction and Allegro, Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot; ballet music, Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot;. Conductors of the 1951–52 season other than Boult included Ralph Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten and William Walton.

In 1952, the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records that was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 percent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra&#x27;s funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the Cold War began, some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell&#x27;s private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor, initially stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult&#x27;s change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be &quot;seriously jeopardized financially&quot; if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO&#x27;s chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.

The following year, the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams. In 1956 the LPO toured the Soviet Union, the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst, and the soloists were Alfredo Campoli and Moura Lympany. After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained closely associated with the orchestra, and was made its President in 1965. Most of his stereophonic recordings for EMI were made with the LPO.

Through the middle and late 1950s, the LPO worked with new conductors including Constantin Silvestri and Josef Krips. This was a bad period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement. Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to be Boult. A historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having been on an upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra &quot;was at best marking time&quot;.

In 1958, the LPO appointed William Steinberg, also music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, as chief conductor. He was a noted orchestral trainer, and did much to restore playing standards to their former levels. Steinberg resigned the LPO post after two seasons, advised by his doctor to restrict his activities.

===1960s and 70s===
In 1962, the LPO undertook its first tour of India, Australia, and the Far East. The conductors were Sargent and John Pritchard. The latter was appointed the LPO&#x27;s chief conductor in 1962, presiding over what one player described as &quot;an era of supremely good taste&quot;. From its outset in 1932, harpists (traditionally female) excepted, the orchestra had maintained Beecham&#x27;s &quot;men only&quot; regime; in 1963 the rule was dropped, the first woman violinist was recruited, and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues.

Pritchard was also music director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne&#x27;s resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra&#x27;s finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett. Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.

In 1967, the LPO appointed Bernard Haitink as its principal conductor. He remained with the orchestra for twelve years, to date (2018) the longest tenure of the post. His concerts made a strong impression with the public, and within months the LPO was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the Festival Hall, far outstripping the other London orchestras. Among the composers with whom Haitink was associated were Bruckner and Mahler, whose symphonies featured frequently in the LPO&#x27;s concerts during the Haitink period, as did those of Shostakovich, particularly the Tenth, which Pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor. With Vladimir Ashkenazy, Haitink and the LPO gave a six-concert cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos, for which the Festival Hall was full to capacity. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Joan Chissell described the orchestra&#x27;s playing as &quot;worthy of any festival&quot;. There was some discontent within the LPO that Haitink&#x27;s prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Pirouet comments that as Haitink recorded exclusively for the Dutch firm Philips it was to be expected that the Amsterdam orchestra would be preferred, and in any case the LPO was recording extensively with Boult, Solti, Daniel Barenboim and many others. In the 1970s international tours continued, with itineraries taking in the US, Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and, in 1972, China, long inaccessible to Western musicians, where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome.

In 1973, the LPO was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.

One of the constant difficulties of London orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.

Guest conductors in the 1970s included Erich Leinsdorf, Carlo Maria Giulini, Eugen Jochum, Riccardo Chailly, Klaus Tennstedt and Solti. When Haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season, Solti, who had been principal guest conductor since 1971, agreed to succeed him.

===1980s and 90s===
In 1982, the orchestra celebrated its golden jubilee. At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments that with the exception of Delius&#x27;s &quot;Brigg Fair&quot;, the music was as ideally suited to Solti&#x27;s musical persona as to Beecham&#x27;s. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Edward Greenfield wrote, &quot;I doubt if the LPO has ever played so beautifully, even in the days of Beecham&quot;.

Solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season, and was succeeded by Klaus Tennstedt, of whom &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible, and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors&quot;. His time as chief conductor (1983–87) was celebrated for its musical achievements, but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations. As with Haitink and Solti, Bruckner and Mahler were prominent in the LPO&#x27;s concerts with Tennstedt. Unlike his two predecessors Tennstedt preferred to record with the LPO rather than major continental or American orchestras; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies for EMI. In 1984 the LPO and the Philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an Arts Council proposal to name one London orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the Festival Hall, with concomitant extra funding. The two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency, but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented. From the outset of the LPO&#x27;s existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939, its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra&#x27;s ranks. In 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of John Willan, a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the Royal Academy of Music and a successful recording producer for EMI.

In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, with the title of &quot;conductor laureate&quot;; in 1989 Richard Morrison of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than for anyone else. Tennstedt&#x27;s resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, and there was no obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, Riccardo Muti and Simon Rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and those possible contenders such as Semyon Bychkov and Franz Welser-Möst were largely unknown in London. No successor was appointed until 1990 when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname &quot;Frankly Worse than Most&quot; and many harshly critical reviews. He brought with him a recording contract with EMI, but management turnover, financial stresses, and political disputes at the Southbank Centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra. There were complaints that the orchestra&#x27;s high standards of playing were not consistently maintained.

Welser-Möst&#x27;s period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the LPO as the sole resident orchestra of the Festival Hall. This proved a mixed blessing: the Southbank Centre management now had a say over concert programming, and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers which did severe damage to box-office receipts. In 1993 another official attempt to create a &quot;super-orchestra&quot; at the expense of one or more of the existing London ensembles briefly damaged relations between the LPO and the Philharmonia, but the idea was quickly abandoned, and in 1995, with the consent of the Arts Council, the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the Festival Hall.

In 1993, with the government of South Africa now moving towards majority rule, the orchestra accepted an invitation to tour there. Welser-Möst concluded his LPO tenure in 1996, after what &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled.&quot;

===21st century===
After the departure of Welser-Möst, the LPO was without a principal conductor for four years. During the interregnum, the orchestra inaugurated its &quot;Roots Classical Fusions&quot; series, which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra. Kurt Masur was the LPO&#x27;s principal conductor from 2000 to 2007. Under Masur, known for his performances of the German symphonic repertoire, the orchestra regained its musical form, and the critic Richard S Ginell commented that Vladimir Jurowski, who took over in 2007 &quot;has inherited an LPO in splendid technical shape, probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under Masur&quot;.

In 2000, the LPO performed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony under Gilbert Levine, joining the Berlin Philharmonic under Bernard Haitink, the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur, and the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, in a gala series of concerts celebrating the reign of Krakow as the European Cultural Capital in the Millennium Year. The concert was broadcast internationally including on PBS marking the orchestra&#x27;s television debut in the United States.

Jurowski had first conducted the LPO at the Royal Festival Hall in December 2001, as an emergency substitute for Yuri Temirkanov. Jurowski became principal guest conductor in 2003, and conducted the orchestra in June 2007 during the concerts marking the re-opening of the refurbished Festival Hall. In September 2007, Jurowski became the LPO&#x27;s eleventh principal conductor. Like his LPO predecessors Pritchard and Haitink, Jurowski also served as music director of Glyndebourne (2001–2013), where he conducted the LPO there in operas by Britten, Mozart, Puccini, Richard Strauss, Verdi, Wagner, and others. During Jurowski&#x27;s LPO tenure, principal guest conductors of the LPO have included Yannick Nézet-Séguin and Andrés Orozco-Estrada. Jurowski concluded his LPO tenure at the close of the 2020-2021 season, and now has the title of conductor emeritus of the LPO.

In 2003, Edward Gardner first guest-conducted the LPO. In July 2019, the LPO announced the appointment of Gardner as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2021-2022 season, with an initial contract of five years. In October 2018, Karina Canellakis first guest-conducted the LPO. In April 2020, the LPO announced the appointment of Canellakis as its new principal guest conductor, the first female conductor ever named to the post, effective from September 2020. In February 2024, the LPO announced the extension of Canellakis&#x27; contract as principal guest conductor for an additional three years. In September 2024, the LPO announced the extension of Gardner&#x27;s contract as principal conductor for an additional two years.

==Recordings==
In its early years, the LPO recorded exclusively for Columbia, a division of EMI. The orchestra&#x27;s first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;The Creation&quot; at Kingsway Hall in September 1932. The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood. Beecham&#x27;s first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite &quot;The Origin of Design&quot;, arranged from music by Handel. From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra. Other conductors who worked in the EMI studios with the orchestra in its early years included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky. Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists Artur Schnabel and Alfred Cortot and the violinists Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz.

In 1946, the orchestra began recording for Decca, EMI&#x27;s rival. The LPO&#x27;s first recording for the label, Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, conducted by Ernest Ansermet, was followed by a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war. Among those who recorded with the orchestra for Decca were van Beinum, Sargent, de Sabata, Furtwängler, Charles Munch, Clemens Krauss, Hans Knappertsbusch, Erich Kleiber and the young Solti. The orchestra&#x27;s first stereophonic recording was made for Decca in 1956, with Boult in Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Eighth Symphony.

Unlike its London rivals, the RPO and the Philharmonia (both of whom recorded for many years only for EMI and its associates, with the rarest of exceptions), the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, CBS, RCA, Chandos and many other labels. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name &quot;the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra&quot; in some of its recordings. In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with Lyrita, an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire. In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra.

The LPO plays on many opera recordings, some taped live at Glyndebourne and the Festival Hall and others in the studios of Decca and EMI. They range from early works such as Cavalli&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ormindo&quot; (recorded 1968) and Glydebourne&#x27;s staging of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Theodora&quot; (1996) to central repertoire such as &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1974), &quot;Carmen&quot; (1975 and 2002) and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; (2011), and première recordings of 20th-century works including Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1972), Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; (1979) and Eötvös&#x27;s &quot;Love and Other Demons&quot; (2008).

In a discography of the LPO published in 1997, Philip Stuart listed 280 recordings made at Kingsway Hall and 353 at Abbey Road. By the early 2000s the late 20th-century boom in classical recordings had ended, and with studio work in decline for all orchestras, the LPO set up its own CD label in 2005, featuring recordings taken mainly from live concerts. With the exception of Steinberg, all the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductors from Beecham to Jurowski are represented in the label&#x27;s releases. The orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, conducted by Tennstedt, and works by Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky with Jurowski.

===Film scores and other non-classical recordings===
Although not rivalling the LSO&#x27;s total of more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, starting in 1936 with &quot;Whom the Gods Love&quot;. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). Later scores have included those for &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1972), &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; (1988), &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1993), the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (2012–14). In 2013, the LPO recorded several new arrangements of rock songs by Japanese rock star Yoshiki on his studio album &quot;Yoshiki Classical&quot;.

The orchestra has made many non-classical recordings, including such titles as &quot;Hawaiian Paradise&quot; (1959), &quot;Evita&quot; (1976), &quot;Broadway Gold&quot; (1978), &quot;Folk Music of the Region of Asturias&quot; (1984), &quot;Academy Award Themes&quot; (1984), &quot;Japanese Light Music&quot; (1993), &quot;The Symphonic Music of Pink Floyd&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Symphonic Music of The Who&quot; (1995). In May 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems to be used at medal ceremonies at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London the following year.

<doc id="156300" wikidata="Q2069787" url="?curid=156300" title="Pyrokinesis">
<text>Pyrokinesis is a psychic ability allowing a person to create and control fire with the mind. As with other parapsychological phenomena, there is no conclusive evidence in support of the actual existence of pyrokinesis. Many alleged cases are hoaxes; the result of trickery.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pyrokinesis&quot; (from Greek &quot;pyr&quot; meaning fire, &quot;kinesis&quot; meaning movement) was popularized by horror novelist Stephen King in his 1980 novel &quot;Firestarter&quot; to describe the ability to create and control fire with the mind, though its use predates the novel. The word is intended to be parallel to &quot;telekinesis&quot;, with S. T. Joshi describing it as a &quot;singularly unfortunate coinage&quot; and noting that the correct analogy to telekinesis would &quot;not be &#x27;pyrokinesis&#x27; but &#x27;telepyrosis&#x27; (fire from a distance)&quot;.

==History==
A. W. Underwood, a 19th-century African American, achieved minor celebrity status with the ability to set items ablaze. Magicians and scientists have suggested concealed pieces of phosphorus may have instead been responsible. The phosphorus could be readily ignited by breath or rubbing. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that Underwood may have used a &quot;chemical-combustion technique, and still other means. Whatever the exact method — and the phosphorus trick might be the most likely — the possibilities of deception far outweigh any occult powers hinted at by Charles Fort or others.&quot;

The medium Daniel Dunglas Home was known for performing fire feats and handling a heated lump of coal taken from a fire. The magician Henry R. Evans wrote that the coal handling was a juggling trick, performed by Home using a hidden piece of platinum. Hereward Carrington described Evans hypothesis as &quot;certainly ingenious&quot; but pointed out William Crookes, an experienced chemist, was present at a séance whilst Home performed the feat and would have known how to distinguish the difference between coal and platinum. Frank Podmore wrote that most of the fire feats could have easily been performed by conjuring tricks and sleight of hand but hallucination and sense-deception may have explained Crookes&#x27; claim about observing flames from Home&#x27;s fingers.

Joseph McCabe has written that Home&#x27;s alleged feats of pyrokinesis were weak and unsatisfactory, he noted that they were performed in dark conditions amongst unreliable witnesses. McCabe suggested the coal handling was probably a &quot;piece of asbestos from Home&#x27;s pocket&quot;.

Sometimes claims of pyrokinesis are published in the context of fire ghosts, such as Canneto di Caronia fires and the 1982 Italian case of a young Scottish nanny, Carole Compton.

In March 2011, a three-year-old girl in Antique, a Philippines province with important mysticism and folklore, gained local media attention for the supposed supernatural power to predict or create fires. The town mayor said he witnessed a pillow ignite after the girl said &quot;fire... pillow.&quot; Others claimed to have witnessed the girl either predicting or causing fire without any physical contact with the objects. A pastor claimed to have exorcised the girl and police failed to find anything abnormal although a paranormal proponent claimed that she must have inherited those powers from a previous life. The story of the alleged &quot;fire starter&quot; was featured on the June 22, 2020 &quot;Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho&quot; show. Since several objects around the house were ignited, local residents flocked to the girl&#x27;s house to learn of the circumstances and emergency services visited the house to investigate.

There is no scientifically known method for the brain to trigger explosions or fires.

<text>Hadda Brooks (October 29, 1916 – November 21, 2002) was an American pianist, vocalist and composer, who was billed as &quot;Queen of the Boogie&quot;. She was Inducted in the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Career==
Brooks became a singer during the mid-1940s.

In the 1970s, she commuted to Europe for performances in nightclubs and festivals. She performed rarely in the United States, and moved to Australia. &quot;Queen of the Boogie&quot;, a compilation of recordings from the 1940s, was released in 1984. Two years later her manager Alan Eichler brought her out of a 16-year retirement before she went on tour. She sang at Hawaii&#x27;s statehood ceremony in 1959 and was asked for a private audience by Pope Pius XII.

She resumed her recording career with the 1994 album &quot;Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere&quot; for DRG. Virgin Records acquired the old Modern catalogue and, thanks to Brooks&#x27; new-found success, issued a compilation of her 1940s and 1950s recordings entitled &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;. The label signed her to record three songs for the Christmas album &quot;Even Santa Gets the Blues&quot;, made more unusual by the fact she had releases on the same label 50 years apart. &quot;Time Was When&quot; (Virgin, 1996) included Al Viola (guitar), Eugene Wright (bass) and Richard Dodd (cello), and she wrote two of its songs: &quot;You Go Your Way and I&#x27;ll Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Concerts were held at Michael&#x27;s Pub in New York City, and the Vine St. Bar and Grill.

In 2007, a 72-minute documentary on Brooks&#x27;s life, &quot;Queen of the Boogie&quot;, directed by Austin Young and Barry Pett, was presented at the Los Angeles Silver Lake Film Festival.

==Personal==
Jules Bihari gave her the recording name &quot;Hadda Brooks&quot;.

In 1940, Brooks married Earl &quot;Shug&quot; Morrison, of the Harlem Globetrotters, but was widowed within a year and never re-married. 

Brooks died at the age of 86 at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles after open-heart surgery.

<text>In botany, the radicle is the first part of a seedling (a growing plant embryo) to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. The radicle is the embryonic root of the plant, and grows downward in the soil (the shoot emerges from the plumule). Above the radicle is the embryonic stem or hypocotyl, supporting the cotyledon(s).

It is the embryonic root inside the seed. It is the first thing to emerge from a seed and down into the ground to allow the seed to suck up water and send out its leaves so that it can start photosynthesizing.

The radicle emerges from a seed through the micropyle. Radicles in seedlings are classified into two main types. Those pointing away from the seed coat scar or hilum are classified as &quot;antitropous&quot;, and those pointing towards the hilum are &quot;syntropous&quot;.

If the radicle begins to decay, the seedling undergoes pre-emergence damping off. This disease appears on the radicle as darkened spots. Eventually, it causes death of the seedling.

The plumule is the baby shoot. It grows after the radicle.

In 1880, Charles Darwin published a book about plants he had studied, The Power of Movement in Plants, where he mentions the radicle.

<doc id="156314" wikidata="Q1823273" url="?curid=156314" title="Light in August">
<text>Light in August is a 1932 novel by American author William Faulkner. It belongs to the Southern gothic and modernist literary genres.

Set in the author&#x27;s present day, the interwar period, the novel centers on two strangers, a pregnant white woman and a man who passes as white but who believes himself to be of mixed ethnicity. In a series of flashbacks, the story reveals how these two people are connected to another man who has deeply impacted both their lives. 

In a loose, unstructured modernist narrative style that draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class, and religion in the American South. By focusing on characters who are misfits, outcasts, or otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner&#x27;s style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel has come to be considered one of the most important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.

== Plot ==

The novel is set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane&#x27;s Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job in Doane&#x27;s Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner&#x27;s fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way, but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.

The novel then switches to the second plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown&#x27;s partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas has been on the run for years, ever since at least injuring, perhaps even killing his strict Presbyterian adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, work. 

The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas&#x27;s bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.

The novel leaves readers uncertain whether Joe Christmas or Joe Brown is the murderer. Brown is Christmas&#x27; business partner in bootlegging and is leaving Joanna&#x27;s burning house when a passing farmer stops to investigate and pull Joanna&#x27;s body from the fire. The sheriff at first suspects Joe Brown, but initiates a manhunt for Christmas after Brown claims that Christmas is black. The manhunt is fruitless until Christmas arrives undisguised in Mottstown, a neighboring town; he is on his way back to Jefferson, no longer running. In Mottstown, he is arrested and jailed, then moved to Jefferson. His grandparents arrive in town and visit Gail Hightower, the disgraced former minister of the town and friend of Byron Bunch. Bunch tries to convince Hightower to give the imprisoned Joe Christmas an alibi, but Hightower initially refuses. Though his grandfather wants Christmas lynched, his grandmother visits him in the Jefferson jail and advises him to seek help from Hightower. As police escort him to the local court, Christmas breaks free and runs to Hightower&#x27;s house. A childishly cruel white vigilante, Percy Grimm, follows him there and, over Hightower&#x27;s protest, shoots and castrates Christmas. Having redeemed himself at last, Hightower is then depicted as falling into a deathlike swoon, his whole life flashing before his eyes, including the past adventures of his Confederate grandfather, who was killed while stealing chickens from a farmer&#x27;s shed.

Before Christmas&#x27; escape attempt, Hightower delivers Lena&#x27;s child in the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch to come and see her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Byron, then skillfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.

== Characters ==

=== Major characters ===

* Lena Grove – a young pregnant woman from Alabama who has traveled to Jefferson while looking for Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child.
* Byron Bunch – a bachelor who works at the planing mill in Jefferson, who meets and falls in love with Lena when she arrives in town. She has been told that a man named Bunch works at the mill and assumes it is Lucas Burch, because the name sounds similar.
* Gail Hightower – the former minister of Jefferson, forced to retire after his wife was discovered to be having an affair in Memphis and committed suicide. He is a friend and mentor to Byron.
* Lucas Burch/Joe Brown – the young man who fathered Lena&#x27;s child in Alabama and ran away when she told him she was pregnant. He has been living in Jefferson with Joe Christmas in a cabin on Joanna Burden&#x27;s property under the name Joe Brown and working with Christmas and Byron at the planing mill. He is also a bootlegger.
* Joe Christmas – a man who came to Jefferson three years prior to the events in the novel. He lives in a cabin on the property of Joanna Burden and has a secret sexual relationship with her. Although he has light skin and is an orphan with no knowledge of his family background, he believes that one of his parents is of African-American ancestry, and this secret has caused him to be a habitual wanderer. He is employed at the planing mill until he begins to make a profit as a bootlegger.
* Joanna Burden – the sole survivor in Jefferson of a family of abolitionists from New England who came to Jefferson after the Civil War. She is unmarried, lives alone in a manor house outside of Jefferson, and is secretly engaged in a sexual relationship with Joe Christmas. She is murdered, presumably by Christmas, at the start of the novel, and her house is burned down.

=== Secondary characters ===

* Eupheus &quot;Doc&quot; Hines – the grandfather of Joe Christmas. He hates Christmas and gives him away to an orphanage when he is born, staying on as a janitor there in order to monitor the boy. Later, when he hears that Christmas is being held on suspicion of murdering Joanna Burden, he travels to Jefferson with his wife and begins to incite a lynch mob to kill Christmas.
* Mrs. Hines – the grandmother of Joe Christmas. She has never seen Christmas after the night of his birth and travels to Jefferson to ensure that her husband does not successfully have him lynched, because she wants to see him again once more before he is tried for murder.
* Milly Hines – the teenage mother of Joe Christmas. She conceives after a tryst with a member of a traveling circus, whom she claims is Mexican. She dies in childbirth after Eupheus Hines refuses to call a doctor for her.
* Mr. McEachern – the adoptive father of Joe Christmas. He is a devout Presbyterian who tries to instill religion, even with repeated, abusive whipping, in the young defiant orphan he has adopted. He disapproves of Christmas&#x27;s growing disobedience and is himself beaten (and presumably killed) in a rage by Joe Christmas when he is 18. This abusive relationship of his childhood sheds important light on the formation of Christmas as a tortured and often cruel personality in his adulthood. 
* Mrs. McEachern – the adoptive mother of Joe Christmas. She tries to protect Christmas, though he hates her and pulls away from her attempts to be kind to him.
* The dietitian – a woman who worked at the orphanage where Joe Christmas was raised. After he accidentally sees her with a man in her room, she tries unsuccessfully to have him transferred to an all-black orphanage.
* Mr. Armstid – a man who picks up Lena on her way to Jefferson, lets her spend the night at his house, and then gives her a ride to the city on his wagon. 
* Mrs. Armstid – Armstid&#x27;s wife, who gives Lena money in spite of her disdain for the young woman.
* Bobbie – a waitress at a restaurant in Memphis whom the adolescent Joe Christmas falls in love with and proposes to on the night that he kills his father at a local dance. She scorns him and leaves him.
* Gavin Stevens – an educated man and district attorney who lives in Jefferson and offers commentary on some of the events at the end of the novel.
* Percy Grimm – the captain of the State National Guard who kills Joe Christmas and castrates him.

== Style and structure ==

Due to its naturalistic, violent subject matter and obsession with the ghosts of the past, &quot;Light in August&quot; is characterized as a Southern gothic novel, a genre also exemplified by the works of Faulkner&#x27;s contemporary Carson McCullers, and by later Southern writers like Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and Truman Capote. However, critics like Diane Roberts and David R. Jarraway view Faulkner&#x27;s use of Southern gothic genre tropes, such as the dilapidated plantation house and the focus on mystery and horror, as self-conscious modernist commentary on man&#x27;s &quot;warped relationship with the past&quot; and the impossibility of determining true identity.

According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner&#x27;s literary style gradually developed from 19th century Victorian to modernist, with &quot;Light in August&quot; more firmly grounded in the tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polarities—light and dark, good and evil—the burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, &quot;Light in August&quot; does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.

=== Title ===
The title refers to the fire of the house that is at the center of the story. The whole novel revolves around one event, the fire, which is visible for miles around, and happens in August.

Some critics have speculated that the meaning of the title derives from a colloquial use of the word &quot;light&quot; to mean giving birth—typically used to describe when a cow will give birth and be &quot;light&quot; again—and connect this to Lena&#x27;s pregnancy. Speaking of his choice of title, Faulkner denied this interpretation and stated,

 ... in August in Mississippi there&#x27;s a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when suddenly there&#x27;s a foretaste of fall, it&#x27;s cool, there&#x27;s a lambence, a soft, a luminous quality to the light, as though it came not from just today but from back in the old classic times. It might have fauns and satyrs and the gods and—from Greece, from Olympus in it somewhere. It lasts just for a day or two, then it&#x27;s gone... the title reminded me of that time, of a luminosity older than our Christian civilization.&quot;

Within the novel itself, the title is alluded to when Gail Hightower sits at his study window waiting for his recurring vision of his grandfather&#x27;s last raid. The vision always occurs in &quot;that instant when all light has failed out of the sky and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire, making still a little light on earth though night itself has come.&quot; The story that would eventually become the novel, started by Faulkner in 1931, was originally titled &quot;Dark House&quot; and began with Hightower sitting at a dark window in his home. However, after a casual remark by his wife Estelle on the quality of the light in August, Faulkner changed the title.

== Themes ==

=== Alienation ===
All of the protagonists in the novel are misfits and social outcasts surrounded by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded by the people of Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.

=== Christian allegory ===
There are a variety of parallels with Christian scripture in the novel. The life and death of Joe Christmas is reminiscent of the passion of Christ, Lena and her fatherless child parallel Mary and Christ, and Byron Bunch acts as a Joseph figure. Christian imagery such as the urn, the wheel, and the shadow, can be found throughout.

&quot;Light in August&quot; has 21 chapters, as does the Gospel of St. John. As Virginia V. James Hlavsa points out, each chapter in Faulkner corresponds to themes in John. For example, echoing John&#x27;s famous, &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God&quot;, is Lena&#x27;s insistent faith in the &quot;word&quot; of Lucas, who is, after all, the father. John 5, the healing of the lame man by immersion, is echoed by Christmas&#x27;s repeatedly being immersed in liquids. The teaching in the temple in John 7 is echoed by McEachern&#x27;s attempts to teach Christmas his catechism. The crucifixion occurs in John 19, the same chapter in which Christmas is slain and castrated. However, the Christian references are dark and disturbing—Lena is obviously not a virgin, Christmas is an enraged murderer—and may be more appropriately viewed as pagan idols mistakenly worshipped as saints.

=== Race and sex ===
Faulkner is considered one of the foremost American writers on race in the United States, and his novels, including &quot;Light in August&quot;, often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the South that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 20th century. Christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets, and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised called him &quot;nigger.&quot; Chapter 6 begins with the oft-cited sentence: &quot;Memory believes before knowing remembers,&quot; and gives an account of the five-year-old Christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children. The first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor. However suspicion must fall on Doc Hines, Joe&#x27;s deranged grandfather, who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman. It is he who may have whispered the lie about the little boy&#x27;s origins to the other children. Because of this, Joe Christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some African American blood, which Faulkner never confirms, and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth. Because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities, black and white, Christmas lives his life always on the road. The secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes; he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white Northern woman reacts nonchalantly. Though Christmas is guilty of violent crimes, Faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological forces that are beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from Southern history.

Christmas exemplifies how existing outside of categorization, being neither black nor white, is perceived as a threat by society that can only be reconciled with violence. He is also perceived as neither male nor female, just as Joanna Burden, whom Faulkner portrays as &quot;masculinized,&quot; is also neither male nor female and is rejected by her community. Because of this, an early critic concluded that blackness and women were the &quot;&#x27;twin Furies of the Faulknerian deep Southern Waste Land&#x27;&quot; and reflected Faulkner&#x27;s animosity toward life.

However, while women and minorities are both viewed as &quot;subversive&quot; and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel, Lena Grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people who hate and mistrust her, because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a woman&#x27;s wellbeing. Thus, she is the only stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of Jefferson, because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life. This romantic view of women in the novel posits that men have lost their innocent connection to the natural world, while women instinctively possess it.

=== Class and religion ===
In &quot;Light in August,&quot; as in most of the other novels set in Yoknapatawpha County, Faulkner focuses mainly on poor white Southerners, both from the upper and lower classes, who struggle to survive in the ruined post-war economy of the South. The characters in &quot;Light in August&quot;—who are mostly from the lower classes, with the exception of Reverend Hightower and Joanna Burden—are united by poverty and Puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like Lena Grove with disdain. Faulkner shows the restrictiveness and aggression of their Puritanical zeal, which has caused them to become &quot;deformed&quot; in their struggle against nature.

== Reception ==
When it was first published in 1932, the novel was moderately successful; 11,000 copies were initially printed, with a total of four printings by the end of the year, although a significant number of copies from the fourth printing had not been sold by 1936. In 1935, Maurice-Edgar Coindreau translated the novel into French. In the same year, it was translated into German along with several other of Faulkner&#x27;s novels and short stories. These works initially met with approval from the Nazi censors and received much attention from German literary critics, because they assumed that Faulkner was a conservative agrarian positively depicting the struggle for racial purity; soon after, however, Faulkner&#x27;s works were banned by the Nazis, and post-war German criticism reappraised him as an optimistic Christian humanist. Faulkner&#x27;s books were not available in Germany until 1951 because US army censors also did not approve of his work.

According to Michael Millgate, though it is not typically considered Faulkner&#x27;s best novel, &quot;Light in August&quot; was recognized early on as being &quot;a major text, central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole.&quot; He argues that many of the early American critics, most of whom were urban Northerners who viewed the South as backward and reactionary, focused on Faulkner&#x27;s technical innovation in the field of narrative but missed or ignored the regional details and interconnectedness of the characters and setting to other works by the author. Some reviewers saw Faulkner&#x27;s narrative techniques not as innovations but as errors, offering Faulkner recommendations on how to improve his style and admonishing him for his European modernist &quot;tricks&quot;. Critics were also displeased with the violence depicted in the novel, pejoratively labeling it &quot;gothic fantasy,&quot; despite the fact that lynching was a reality in the South. In spite of these complaints, the novel came to be viewed positively because of its violence and dark themes, as this was a contrast to the sentimental, romantic Southern literature of the time.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.

<text>Alternative Tentacles is an independent record label established in 1979 by Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra and guitarist East Bay Ray in San Francisco, California, with the intention to release the Dead Kennedys&#x27; self-produced single &quot;California Über Alles&quot;. After realizing the potential for an independent label, they released records for other bands as well. They would go on to release albums by artists such as Dead Kennedys, NoMeansNo, D.O.A., Alice Donut, Lard, the Dicks, Butthole Surfers, 7 Seconds, Neurosis, Wesley Willis, Half Japanese, Blowfly, Subhumans (Canada), the Crucifucks, Victims Family, Pansy Division, Zolar X, Culture Shock, World/Inferno Friendship Society, Itchy-O, ArnoCorps, the Darts, Tsunami Bomb, and many more.
In the mid-1980s Jello Biafra became the sole owner of Alternative Tentacles.

==History==

The origins of Alternative Tentacles trace back to June 1979. The name Alternative Tentacles was used as the label name on Dead Kennedys&#x27; self-produced debut single, &quot;California Uber Alles&quot;. In true independent spirit, the band had saved their gig money for a year to produce their own record instead of waiting for an established label to sign them. The single would do better than anyone expected, garnering considerable attention throughout the U.S. and Europe. At the same time, lead singer Jello Biafra&#x27;s 1979 mayoral campaign in San Francisco helped kick-start interest from the British music press that culminated in a very successful British and European tour in the fall of 1980, upon the release of their full-length debut, &quot;Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables&quot;.

The original idea was for Alternative Tentacles to be based in Europe only, and concentrate on European released and exposure for then-unknown American bands after Biafra found many Dead Kennedys fans were far more interested in the American underground than the overseas labels and press were.

The result was the &quot;Let Them Eat Jellybeans&quot; compilation album. This was quickly followed with singles by D.O.A., Bad Brains, Black Flag, Flipper, TSOL, Voice Far, Husker Du, and more. But the impact of &quot;Jellybeans&quot; and Alternative Tentacles turned out to be even greater outside Great Britain. &quot;Jellybeans&quot; and Dead Kennedys&#x27; follow-up &#x27;81 European tour is credited with breaking open the still strong underground scenes in Finland, Italy, Germany, and even behind the Iron Curtain.

Meanwhile, &quot;Jellybeans&quot; was also gaining steam in America. Many Americans were picking up import copies as a way of tuning in to the ongoing underground explosion in the States. Alternative Tentacles U.S. was off and running with domestic releases of new albums by D.O.A., TSOL, Dead Kennedys, Butthole Surfers, the Dicks, the Crucifucks and many more.

At the same time a friend in San Francisco, Ruth Schwartz, was starting Mordam Records label and distribution. They partnered with Alternative Tentacles Records to handle global distribution in 1983.

As the label progressed, an increasing divide between Biafra and Ray developed, stemming from a combination of personal, financial, and philosophical differences over the direction of the label. Biafra had a strong vision for the label&#x27;s direction, focusing on politically charged and experimental acts prioritizing a more avant-garde and activist-focused roster and Ray was feeling that was increasingly too narrow of a direction. Also feeling that there was an increasing conflict of interest between the interest of Dead Kennedys and the label, Ray sold his stake in the mid-1980s, allowing Jello Biafra to maintain full creative control over Alternative Tentacles, while Ray focused on the running of the band’s partnership.

In addition to musical acts, Alternative Tentacles has also published spoken word albums, many by Jello Biafra himself. Another common theme of Alternative Tentacles records over the years has been the artwork of Winston Smith, which has appeared on many of their records, catalogs, posters and shirts. Smith also designed the original Alternative Tentacles logo in 1981.

&quot;From the very beginning, everyone agreed that the label should treat the bands fairly and decently,&quot; says Greg Werckman, who managed AT from 1989-1997. &quot;It was never hip to be on Alternative Tentacles the way it was to be on Sub Pop. That was its appeal to me. We stayed true to our vision.&quot;

Alternative Tentacles has had a number of locations around San Francisco over the years. The first office was in Dead Kennedys tour manager Mike Bonnano’s bedroom at the A-Hole, a punk rock household at Third and Bryant in San Francisco. They then went on to share offices with Mordam Records on Rodgers Street South of Market, then on Shipley Street still in the South of Market neighborhood shared with Mordam, then moved to the Mission District with Mordam Records on Folsom Street.

In 1995, Alternative Tentacles moved to their own office in the Noe Valley neighborhood in San Francisco, before relocating to Emeryville, California, across the Bay in October 2002 and the label has continued its operation there to present day.

In 2009, following the closure of Lumberjack Mordam Music Group, Alternative Tentacles Records switched global distribution to San Francisco based Revolver/Mid-Heaven.

In 2006 they re-released some classic early-1980s recordings in its &quot;Re-issues Of Necessity&quot; series by the likes of JFA, the Dicks, BGK, the Fartz, Los Olvidados, Drunk Injuns, Free Beer, False Prophets, Amebix, M.I.A., Nausea, Mentally Ill, and the classic compilation &quot;Not So Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. 

In April 2019 Kerrang ran a long form feature called &quot;An Oral History of Alternative Tentacles&quot;. 

In March 2020, Bandcamp ran a feature on their site entitled &quot;The Lesser-Known Classics of Alternative Tentacles Records&quot; as part of their label profile series.

In 2023 Alternative Tentacles announced that they would be once again releasing the entire Nomeansno catalog on the label after the band had left the label in 2002, starting with the 7&quot; &quot;Dad/Revenge&quot;. This was followed by the release of their 1989 full length, &quot;Wrong&quot;, in 2024.

Through 2024, the label has released over 500 recordings and has made a push to reissue some of the most popular releases on vinyl, releasing limited edition color versions both as pre-orders through their website and through a Patreon program they launched in October of 2023.

==United Kingdom branch==

In the early 1980s, Alternative Tentacles opened an office in the UK (eventually settling at 64 Mountgrove Road in London) to release special editions of American punk records that were unavailable in Europe, many of which were licensed from other independent U.S. labels. Among these were releases by SST Records&#x27; groups Black Flag and Hüsker Dü, the Dischord Records compilation &quot;Flex Your Head&quot;, and an EP of tracks from the Bad Brains eponymous 1982 album, as well as U.K. pressings of all American Dead Kennedys releases. It was also a distribution hub for Elemental Records until closed in 1994.

==Controversies==

In 1985, Los Angeles prosecutors charged Biafra with &quot;distributing harmful matter to minors&quot; for artwork contained in the Dead Kennedys album &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;. The artwork was a poster reproduction of the painting &quot;Work 219: Landscape XX&quot;, also known as &quot;Penis Landscape&quot; by H.R. Giger. The case ended in a hung jury and charges were not re-filed. Biafra presented a detailed account of the trial on his second spoken word album, &quot;High Priest of Harmful Matter − Tales from the Trial&quot;.

In 1994 in the wake of the punk zine &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; taking Alternative Tentacles to task over Alternative Tentacles and Dead Kennedys working with EMI-owned distributor Caroline through Mordam, and banning ads and reviews from the label, Jello Biafra was assaulted at the Gilman St. in Berkeley, California, by a group of people chanting “Rich Rock Star”. 

&quot;Of course, it was easy to label me as a sell-out because I was part of the neighborhood,&quot; says Biafra of the MRR row. &quot;It was one crab trying to pull another crab back in the bucket. For me, using a major distributor is more like the martial arts principle of using the enemy&#x27;s strength against them. I want my work to be available in remote small towns and cultural ghettos. People have to have that opportunity.&quot;

In early 2000, the label and Biafra were named in a lawsuit brought by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates. The suit claimed that Biafra had failed to pay the band&#x27;s members a decade&#x27;s worth of royalties on the band&#x27;s albums, totaling some $76,000. 

All sides agreed the initial underpayment of royalties was due to an accounting error and Biafra himself had also not been paid from those royalties. However, the jury ultimately ruled that Alternative Tentacles and Biafra were &quot;guilty of malice, oppression and fraud&quot; by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the matter and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. The other Dead Kennedys members only learned of the royalty underpayment from a whistleblower at the record label. 

A 2003 appeal upheld the verdict and judgment against Biafra and the record label of $200,000 in compensation and punitive damages. The result of the case saw the rights to the Dead Kennedys albums turned over to Decay Music, a partnership of all four members of the band (including Biafra himself), the majority of which voted to pull the records from Alternative Tentacles and license them to Manifesto Records in the United States (and to other labels in the rest of the world). This was a blow to Alternative Tentacles, leading to financial uncertainty for the label.

In 2009 while speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Biafra described losing the Kennedys from Alternative Tentacles as &quot;like getting some of your limbs blown off&quot;. 

&quot;I&#x27;ve used my own money to keep the label afloat. Now many of our label peers are down to one or two employees or pulling the plug altogether. That scares the living shit out of me in some ways, but I think we&#x27;re better equipped because we already know how to survive hard times. It got awfully tempting to just crack up once and for all and turn into Syd Barrett after what they did to me,&quot; he admits. &quot;But I have so many unrecorded songs and ideas that I can&#x27;t not continue to make new work.&quot;

<doc id="156318" wikidata="Q2340312" url="?curid=156318" title="Rupert Giles">
<text>Rupert Giles is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character is portrayed by Anthony Stewart Head. He serves as Buffy Summers&#x27; mentor and surrogate father figure. The character proved popular with viewers, and Head&#x27;s performance in the role was well received. Following &quot;Buffy&quot;″s run, Whedon intended to launch a television spin-off focused on the character, but rights issues prevented the project from developing. Outside of the television series, the character has appeared substantially in Expanded Universe material such as novels, comic books, and short stories.

Giles&#x27; primary role in the series is Watcher to Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) in her capacity as vampire Slayer; he is in the employ of the Watchers&#x27; Council, a British organisation that attempts to oversee the actions of the Slayer. From youth, Giles was expected to follow the family tradition and become a Watcher, though as a teenager and young adult he rebelled, dropping out of Oxford University to experiment in dark magic and the rock music scene, until a bereavement brought him to his senses. In adulthood, his loyalty to Buffy and her group of friends costs him his job for a time. As the series progresses, Giles increasingly becomes a father figure to Buffy and her friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendon). His encyclopedic knowledge, affinity for magic, moderate fighting skills and willingness to kill when necessary make him an asset to Buffy in her fight against the supernatural evils that plague Sunnydale, California.

Following &quot;Buffy&quot;″s conclusion in 2003, Whedon intended to continue Giles&#x27; story as a spin-off series, &quot;Ripper&quot;, which he intended to produce with the BBC. The series was to depict Giles in ghost stories set in present-day England, coping with loneliness as well as figurative ghosts from his own chequered past. Over several years Whedon restated his commitment to the project, though announced it would take the form of a one-off TV movie. Despite Head&#x27;s availability and the BBC&#x27;s willingness to fund the project, rights issues concerning the character ultimately led to it not developing further. Canonically, the character&#x27;s story is continued in the comic book &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011) and subsequent stories. The &quot;Season Eight&quot; sequel &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; (2011–) heavily features Giles and utilizes ideas and characters from the proposed &quot;Ripper&quot; spin-off.

==Biography==
===Character history===
Rupert Edmund Giles (most frequently called &quot;Giles&quot;) was born circa 1955 in England. His family has worked within the Council of Watchers for at least three generations; both his father and grandmother, Edna Giles (&quot;née&quot; Fairweather), were also Watchers. As a child, Giles dreamt of being either &quot;a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer&quot;, but he soon learned that being a Watcher is a , much as being a Slayer is, and Rupert&#x27;s father explained his destiny to him when he was ten years old (revealed in &quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date&quot;).

Although the Scooby Gang later joked that he wore tweed nappies as a child, Giles was in fact a rebellious youth, rejecting his responsibility as a Watcher and dropping out of Oxford University, where he was studying history, when he was twenty-one. During this time, Giles claimed to be a founding member of Pink Floyd in order to impress girls (although since Pink Floyd was founded in 1965, when Giles would have been around ten years old, it was not a particularly credible claim), and may have delved into criminal activity (he remarks that hot-wiring a car is &quot;like riding a bloody bicycle&quot;, and a psychologically younger Giles has no qualms about breaking into a clothing store and attacking a police officer). He is a talented singer and guitar player (as Head is in real life) which the gang discovered, to their astonishment, when they saw him singing &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; by The Who in &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;. Spike also saw him singing &quot;Free Bird&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd in &quot;The Yoko Factor&quot;.

He began to explore dark magic and befriended a group of young people who delved into the dark arts for fun or money: Ethan Rayne, Philip Henry, Dierdre Page, Thomas Sutcliff, and Randall. Giles gained the nickname &quot;Ripper&quot; during this time. Together, the group summoned a demon called Eyghon, who would possess and eventually destroy Randall.
Following Randall&#x27;s death, Ethan and the others failed to exorcise Eyghon, and Giles accepted his destiny of becoming a Watcher. Before becoming a fully-fledged Watcher, he also worked as &quot;the curator of a British museum, maybe &quot;the&quot; British Museum&quot; as Willow says (&quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;), although, given the context, she may well have been repeating a rumor that was going around the school.

===Sunnydale===
At the behest of the Watchers&#x27; Council, Giles travels to Sunnydale, California, and works as the librarian at the local secondary school. There he meets the current Slayer, Buffy Summers, whom he begins training. The library, a quasi-command centre for Buffy&#x27;s demon-hunting gang, sits right above the Hellmouth.

As the Watcher, librarian, and general authority figure, Giles often delivers exposition. He is a father figure to Buffy and her friends Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg, together forming the &quot;core four&quot; of the Scooby Gang. Giles is often portrayed as something of a &quot;straight man&quot; and his &quot;stuffy&quot; Oxford sensibility serves as counterpoint to the stereotypical Southern Californian characters and setting. He makes a &quot;weird cluck-cluck sound with his tongue&quot; when he is angry but is &quot;too English to say anything&quot; (&quot;Faith, Hope &amp; Trick&quot;). He admits to being technophobic, a fact which often brings him into conflict with technopagan and computer science teacher, Jenny Calendar. However, after Jenny aids him in casting the demon Moloch out of the Internet, the pair reach an understanding and begin a romantic relationship. Despite his obvious fear with modern technology, Giles is quite adept with computers, which is required in his occupation as a librarian (season 3 episode &quot;Gingerbread&quot;) and likely had received this training while earning his master&#x27;s degree in library and information science. It was never revealed of which library school Giles attended or whether he had pursued his PhD in this field.

In season 2, Giles&#x27; dark side is revealed and his relationship with Jenny deepens. In &quot;The Dark Age&quot;, Ethan Rayne comes to Sunnydale to flee the demon Eyghon. Giles ashamedly admits to Buffy that he was responsible for summoning the demon in his youth, and is horrified when Jenny becomes possessed by Eyghon. Although Eyghon is defeated, Jenny takes time to cope with her ordeal, remaining distant from Giles in the meantime. When new Slayer Kendra Young arrives in Sunnydale, Giles shares with her an appreciation for obscure texts, resulting in Buffy nicknaming her the &quot;She-Giles.&quot; Giles feels betrayed when Jenny reveals she is actually a member of the Kalderash gypsy clan, sent to keep an eye on Buffy&#x27;s relationship with the vampire Angel. When Angel loses his soul he reverts to his evil, sadistic alter ego Angelus. Angelus murders Jenny, leaving her corpse for Giles to find in a romantic setting in his apartment (&quot;Passion&quot;), Giles seeks revenge by burning down Angelus&#x27; base. Angelus later kidnaps and tortures him, and Drusilla hypnotizes him into thinking she is Jenny so he will reveal how to awake Acathla. Buffy is forced to kill Angel to save the world, despite Willow&#x27;s restoring his soul, and subsequently leaves Sunnydale.

In season 3, Giles&#x27;s paternal feelings for Buffy strengthen significantly. He spends the summer desperately following up every clue as to Buffy&#x27;s whereabouts, and is overjoyed when she finally returns months later. Giles briefly serves as Watcher for Kendra&#x27;s replacement Slayer, Faith Lehane. The Scoobies are given another disturbing glimpse in Giles&#x27; past when, along with every other adult in Sunnydale, he reverts to being a teenager by enchanted band candy supplied by Ethan Rayne. He indulges in theft and vandalism, and makes out with and has sex with Buffy&#x27;s mother, Joyce Summers. When Buffy keeps Angel&#x27;s return from hell a secret from the other Scoobies, Giles feels betrayed by her love for the man who tortured him and murdered Jenny, but later agrees to help Angel in &quot;Amends&quot;.

As Buffy&#x27;s Cruciamentum approaches (a brutal tradition of the Watchers&#x27; Council in which a depowered Slayer is forced to battle a particularly dangerous vampire using only her wits), Giles struggles to cope with the guilt of betraying Buffy&#x27;s trust. Despite describing the test as &quot;an archaic exercise in cruelty&quot;, he secretly injects Buffy with muscle relaxants and adrenaline suppressors, which weaken her significantly, before finally coming clean when the vampire she is meant to fight escapes. Buffy is disgusted, but is later moved when Giles interferes to save her life and is subsequently dismissed for having a father&#x27;s love for her. Giles is fired, and replaced with Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, but continues to act as Buffy&#x27;s unofficial Watcher, proving especially helpful when Wesley turns out to be an incompetent coward. When Buffy briefly finds herself endowed with telepathic powers, she &#x27;hears&#x27; her mother remembering that Giles was &quot;like a stevedore&quot; during sex. In a battle with the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale, Giles presses the trigger which destroys the Mayor and Sunnydale High, putting himself out of a job.

In season 4, Giles must cope with unemployment and a growing awareness that Buffy no longer needs him. He continues a sexual relationship with his old friend Olivia. Lacking a sense of purpose, he spends most of his time lounging around his apartment, watching &quot;Passions&quot; with Spike. He gets depressed, especially when the Scoobies fail to keep him in the loop regarding Buffy&#x27;s new boyfriend Riley Finn and his membership in the Initiative. In the episode &quot;Something Blue&quot;, Giles becomes blind as a result of a faulty spell cast by Willow Rosenberg. When Ethan Rayne casts a spell on Giles which turns him into a Fyarl demon (&quot;A New Man&quot;), he must enlist Spike&#x27;s help to escape the Initiative and Buffy, which believes him to be a demon who murdered Giles. Buffy, about to kill him, at the last moment recognizes his eyes and &quot;annoyed&quot; expression, and Ethan is taken into custody by the Initiative. In order to defeat the cyber-demonoid Adam, Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles cast a spell to combine their strength. Giles provides the &quot;mind,&quot; and Buffy is able to defeat Adam.

At the beginning of season 5, Giles no longer sees his place in Sunnydale and decides to go back to England, telling no one except Willow, whom he needs to organize the research documents for the Scoobies. He quickly abandons this decision when Buffy asks him to be her Watcher again, confessing that she needs him, both emotionally and in order to discover more about what being a Slayer means.

When the owner of The Magic Box is killed by vampires, Giles is convinced by the shop&#x27;s high profit margins to buy it, hiring Anya as his overly enthusiastic assistant. Buffy learns that her sister, Dawn Summers, is actually the Key: mystical energy disguised in human form to conceal it from the hell-god Glory. Buffy initially confides only in Giles about Dawn&#x27;s true nature, and he decides to contact the Watchers&#x27; Council for more information about Glory. In &quot;Checkpoint&quot;, Quentin Travers tries to coerce Buffy to obey the Council&#x27;s demands, by threatening to have Giles deported. Buffy stands up to the Council, pointing out that without her there is no need for a Council, and tells them to give her all information concerning Glory and to reinstate Giles as her official Watcher. Travers reluctantly agrees, and leaves.

As the Scoobies labor to find a way to defeat Glory, Giles brings up the difficult idea of killing Dawn to end Glory&#x27;s plans to take over the world. Buffy vows to protect Dawn at all costs. Glory shares her body with an innocent human named Ben, and can be killed if Ben dies. In the final battle against Glory, Buffy abandons the fight when Glory turns back into a wounded Ben, so that she can save Dawn. Giles is less merciful. Explaining that Buffy is a hero and therefore different from the rest of humanity, he suffocates Ben with his bare hands (&quot;The Gift&quot;).

Season 6 sees Giles reluctantly stepping back to allow Buffy to gain independence. One hundred and forty-seven days after her death, Giles decides to return to England. On the very day he leaves, Willow, Xander, Anya and Tara resurrect Buffy, and he comes back as soon as he hears of this. Despite being overjoyed to have Buffy back, he is furious at Willow for invoking such dark magic, and angrily dismisses her as &quot;a rank, arrogant amateur.&quot; While the other Scoobies believe Buffy was in Hell, Giles is not convinced, and his suspicions prove true when a demon&#x27;s musical spell causes Buffy to reveal to them all that she was indeed in Heaven. As Buffy begins to rely excessively on Giles for financial and emotional support, he decides his presence is preventing her assuming responsibility for her life. He leaves again for his native England, moving to a place near Bath, where he works with a powerful local coven.

A few months later, Tara is killed by a stray bullet as Warren Mears attacks Buffy. Willow, still recovering from an addiction to magic, suffers a relapse, kills Warren and attempts to kill his former partners in crime, before resolving to end humanity&#x27;s pain (and her own) by destroying the world. Hearing of a dark power rising in Sunnydale, Giles teleports back there, wielding great magical power borrowed from the Devon Coven. As Dark Willow boasts of her indestructibility, Giles knocks her to the floor with a blast of magic energy, saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to test that theory&quot; (&quot;Two to Go&quot;). After being filled in on everything that has happened to the Scoobies in his absence, Giles apologizes to Buffy, insisting that he never should have left them, but Buffy assures him that he did the right thing. Knowing that Willow is too strong to defeat, he tricks her into draining him of his white magics, which brings him near death. It also allows Xander to reason with Willow as the good magic brings out her natural love and compassion, eating away at the evil within her.

Giles returns to England with Willow for her rehabilitation. A few months later, he brings Potential Slayers to Sunnydale to protect them from the First Evil and its Bringers. Giles had removed a few volumes from the headquarters of the Watchers&#x27; Council, which is soon afterward destroyed by Caleb, an agent of the First. An injured Watcher named Robson witnessed Giles about to be decapitated by a Bringer before blacking out. When the Scoobies hear about this, they worry that Giles may have been killed and the First is merely impersonating him. They are relieved when Anya, Dawn, Xander and Andrew tackle him to the ground, proving he is corporeal and therefore not the First. Giles later loses Buffy&#x27;s trust somewhat when he takes part in a scheme with Robin Wood to kill Spike (&quot;Lies My Parents Told Me&quot;). Buffy tells him, &quot;I think you&#x27;ve taught me everything I need to know.&quot; Giles believes that Buffy kept Spike around for personal reasons rather than tactical ones; this is confirmed when she talks to Spike the night before the final battle under the Hellmouth. In the series finale, Giles participates in the battle of the Hellmouth, and survives.

Shortly after &quot;Buffy&quot; ended its seven-year televised run, there was talk of a Giles-based spin-off series for the BBC entitled &quot;Ripper&quot;. At Comicon in 2007, Joss Whedon stated that &quot;Ripper&quot; was still planned and in the pipeline, but as of 2012, nothing has come of the project.

In season 5 of &quot;Angel&quot;, Angel contacts Giles via phone twice. It is established that, after the events of &quot;Chosen&quot;, Giles travels to Europe with Buffy to train new Slayers. He also takes Andrew Wells under his wing, training him to be a Watcher. In &quot;Damage&quot;, Andrew claims to be &quot;faster, stronger and 82% more manly&quot; as a result of Giles&#x27; mentoring. Later in &quot;A Hole in the World&quot;, after Fred dies, Angel phones Giles, desperate to get in contact with Willow, who cannot be located. After Angel confirms that he still works for Wolfram &amp; Hart, Giles coldly hangs up on him. Originally, Giles was to appear in &quot;A Hole in the World&quot; as the one whom Angel and Spike approached in an attempt to save Fred, because Whedon needed a character who would be instantly believed (by the characters and by the audience) when he said there was no way to save Fred. As it was too expensive for Anthony Stewart Head to fly out to Los Angeles to guest-star, Whedon created Drogyn the Battlebrand, who was mystically compelled to tell the truth.

===Literature===
A main character from the beginning of the series, Giles has appeared in most of the spin-off books published based on the series. He plays a particularly key role in &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; series, where a chain of events lead to Buffy (from a point early in the fourth season) being projected into the body of her twenty-four-year-old self in a timeline where Giles was turned into a vampire by the followers of an Aztec bat god, forcing Buffy to face a foe who knows her every technique before she manages to find a way to return to the past and prevent Giles being captured and turned.

In the canonical comic book continuation of the series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, the Scooby Gang has expanded into a global organization, training approximately five hundred Slayers spread over ten squads. Giles is head of the Slayer operations in England, parallel with Andrew&#x27;s operations in Italy and Buffy and Xander&#x27;s in Scotland, and he keeps in close contact with Xander and Andrew, discussing issues. In the Season Eight arc, &quot;No Future For You&quot;, he comes to Faith to request her assistance assassinating another Slayer, who will bring about the Apocalypse if left unchecked. After they are both forced to make the difficult decisions to kill the rogue Slayer Gigi and her mentor Roden, they decide to work together in the future as equal partners, keeping Slayers from turning down the dark path that both Faith and Gigi walked. As a result of their covert operation, Buffy and Giles are no longer on speaking terms.

In the story &quot;Safe,&quot; Giles and Faith hear of a &quot;Slayer Sanctuary&quot; in a town called Hanselstadt from a young Slayer named Courtney. There, Giles encounters Duncan Fillworthe, a former Watcher, who claims vampires do not dare to enter the town because they know the town contains an army of Slayers. Later, as Giles argues that a stalemate is not a solution to the vampire problem, Duncan reveals that in fact the town is feeding the Slayers who come seeking sanctuary to an ancient demon. The fear of the demon is what really keeps the vampires from entering. Giles goes to warn Faith as Duncan states this is the fate that Slayers deserve for rejecting the Watchers Council, especially Buffy, reminding Giles that Buffy&#x27;s relationship with Angel resulted in Jenny Calendar&#x27;s death. Giles finds Faith already in combat with the demon, which feeds on beings who feel regret and fear. While trying to free Courtney from the demon, Duncan intercepts Giles. During their skirmish, the demon devours Duncan and Giles saves Courtney while Faith kills the demon. The stalemate ended, Giles and Faith rally the reluctant townspeople against the coming vampires, telling them if they want to live, they&#x27;ll have to fight. After Harmony Kendall&#x27;s reality show establishes a new pro-vampire, anti-Slayer world order, Faith and Giles are in hiding in the Führerbunker in the &quot;Retreat&quot; storyline. Once their underground hideout is compromised by demons, they retreat to Scotland to reunite with Buffy. Giles and Buffy are driven to reconcile by Twilight&#x27;s attacks. The entire group are later transported to Oz in Tibet to learn how to suppress magic to stop Twilight tracking them.

In the penultimate issue of &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Angel is possessed by a powerful mystical entity known as Twilight, and while under its influence, murders Giles, after Giles deliberately put himself in harm&#x27;s way to provoke Buffy to action. Angel does so by snapping Giles&#x27; neck, homaging Angelus&#x27; murder of Jenny Calendar. While Angelus killed Jenny in vampiric face—a result of Joss not wanting the audience to truly hate Angel&#x27;s face—Giles is murdered while Angel&#x27;s face is in human form. Afterwards, it is revealed that Giles has left to Faith his entire estate in his will (with the exception of the &#x27;Vampyr&#x27; book from the first episode of the series, which he leaves to Buffy), and Faith assures Buffy this doesn&#x27;t mean Giles cared about her less but rather felt Faith needed it more.

In a 2011 interview, Whedon stated that his decision to kill off Giles could not be discussed in detail &quot;because ripples from that event&quot; will also be a large part of both &quot;Buffy Season Nine&quot; and &quot;Angel and Faith&quot;. However, he was able to explain other motivations; he felt that from a writing perspective, Giles did not work in the comic book medium where he had flourished on the television show. His primary roles - provider of narrative exposition, and paternal figure - didn&#x27;t work well in the comic book format. Whedon killed off Giles where he did so that it might have a greater effect on the coming season, &quot;because [he] wanted to make all this matter&quot;.

In the follow-up comic series &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Angel makes it his personal mission to bring Giles back to life. Over the course of several arcs Giles&#x27; life before Sunnydale is shown in flashbacks as Angel and Faith gather pieces of Giles&#x27; soul from demons or magical objects that were significant in Giles&#x27; life. These parts of his soul are absorbed into Angel&#x27;s body using the mystical Tooth of Ammuk. They are joined by Rupert&#x27;s great-aunts Lavinia and Sophronia Fairweather, two depowered witches who used magic to remain young, and an old friend of Giles named Alasdair Coames who is a depowered magical archmage and collector of magical artifacts. In the &quot;Death and Consequences&quot; arc Angel and Faith discover Giles is not buried in his grave. It has been possessed by the demon Eyghon who had survived &quot;The Dark Age&quot;. Because Giles had sold his soul to Eyghon in his youth, he did not move on even though he died a natural death, and the core of his soul went to Eyghon, while smaller parts broke off and attached themselves to the things Angel &amp; Faith had found. Thus, it is possible for Giles to be resurrected from a natural death in a world with no current source of magic. Angel recruits Spike to help him kill Eyghon and a group of British Slayers reluctantly agree to work with them to save their friends who are still alive from Eyghon&#x27;s control. The presence of three beings inside Angel&#x27;s body (himself, Angelus and Giles) prevent Eyghon from controlling Angel, and Giles speaks through him as Angel kills Eyghon and therefore has all of Giles&#x27; soul. It is later transferred out of Angel to a mystical vessel. Using a mystical item to restore Giles&#x27; corpse to full health and Coames&#x27; collection of artifacts to provide magic for a resurrection spell, Angel, Faith, Coames and the Fairweathers try to bring him back to life. The group is shocked when Giles comes back to life with all his memories intact, but in the body of a 12-year-old boy due to his Aunts thinking of him as a child during the ritual. Giles is grateful to be free of Eyghon but furious at the age of his body and they have been trying to bring him back and not stopping a plot by villains Whistler (Buffyverse), Pearl and Nash to mutate humans into a magical species at the cost of a few billion lives. Before confronting them, Giles says to Faith she has grown into a fine woman and they may have wanted him back, but none of the group needs him like they used to. The villains plan to unleash their plague by releasing an orb of pure magic into the upper atmosphere. Giles is able to use ambient magic to attack Nash with a fireball causing him to drop the orb but it also mutates a nearby crowd. Nash is killed causing Pearl to flee. Whistler sees the error of his ways and sacrifices his life to destroy the orb. In the aftermath of the battle, Giles wants Faith to keep his money. He decides to return to America because he was at his best with Buffy, not noticing he has hurt Faith&#x27;s feelings. He parts on good terms with Angel who is staying in London&#x27;s new Magic Town suburb.

While resenting the challenges of his youthful body compared to his adult mind, Giles adapts to his new situation, particularly with the discovery that his command of magic is more potent in his youthful body; his aunts speculate that he is tapping into the full potential that he repressed to focus on his studies as a Watcher.

==Powers and abilities==
Giles has extensive knowledge of demonology and Slayer combat (including at least a theoretical knowledge of jujutsu and aikido, but excelling at the art of fencing), mainly due to his training as a Watcher. His youthful interest in witchcraft and sorcery has endured into his adult life; though his natural aptitude for it is only moderate (much less than that of Willow), he does have a high amount of magical knowledge. Giles is proficient in several languages, including Latin, ancient Greek, Sumerian (&quot;Primeval&quot;), Japanese (&quot;Checkpoint&quot;), and possibly Gaelic (&quot;Fear, Itself&quot;), but weak in German (&quot;Gingerbread&quot;), Mandarin and Cantonese (&quot;First Date&quot;). While he has no prominent supernatural powers of his own, his extensive experience with dealing with vampires, demons, and other creatures makes him capable of handling them effectively.

Giles has moderate skill in hand-to-hand combat, as well as various melee weapons. While his demeanor is typically mild and polite, Giles is not above using raw violence to solve a problem, such as physically threatening Principal Snyder into readmitting Buffy to school after her expulsion (&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;), pummeling Angelus senseless with a flaming baseball bat and burning down his hideout upon discovering that he had killed Jenny Calendar (&quot;Passion&quot;), manhandling Spike while ordering him to get over his feelings for Buffy (&quot;I Was Made to Love You&quot;), forcing Glory&#x27;s minion Slook to talk by inflicting a painful-sounding injury offscreen (&quot;Tough Love&quot;), severely beating up Ethan Rayne for information (&quot;Halloween&quot;), and suffocating a critically injured Ben with his bare hands to keep Glory from awakening in his body. (&quot;The Gift&quot;). Typically, however, Giles&#x27; calm demeanor and professionalism offer him a detached state of authority even in the face of fearsome monsters, as demonstrated during his confrontation with a violent demon in &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;. He is also shown to be able to quickly hotwire a car in the episode &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;.

In the season 6 finale, Giles was temporarily endowed with powers of the Devon Coven in an attempt to stop Willow. During this time, he demonstrated powers such as teleportation, telekinesis, and energy projection. He lost all of these powers when Willow drained him and left him on the brink of death, but he recovered immediately after Xander calmed her down from her rampage. His moderate proficiency in magic combined with his natural acumen and intelligence still make him quite formidable; in &quot;Season Eight&quot;&#x27;s &quot;No Future for You&quot;, he kills the warlock Roden, who could fly and conjure easily, through using a spell inventively. After being resurrected in the form of an adolescent, Giles displays much more magical aptitude, which is briefly lost when Willow temporarily ages him back into an adult form. Sophronia and Lavinia theorised that if Giles had been tutored in magic by them rather than being trained as a Watcher at the wishes of his father and grandmother, he would have become an extremely powerful magician, and could achieve this potential in his new life.

Despite his vast intelligence, Giles is not what one would call technology-savvy and is, by his own admission, somewhat technophobic. However, being a librarian, his occupation requires the use of up-to-date technology and skills to further a library service&#x27;s goals to serve its patrons efficiently, and in one episode (&quot;Gingerbread&quot;), shows that Giles is proficient with computers at least on a basic level. However, he is dependent on Willow for tasks that are beyond his computer skill set. It&#x27;s important to mention his taste in capable transportation.

Despite his lack of tech savviness, his choice in transportation is very wise. He drives a 1963 Citroen DS 21, a notably resilient and reliable car, even for its age. It won several grueling and hazardous motorsports events, including the Monte Carlo Rally in France and 1000 Lakes Rally. It even protected a French President against an assassination attempt without any armor.

==Reception==
Head&#x27;s portrayal of Giles was largely well received by television critics. An article for &quot;The Wrap&quot; summarized, &quot;For more than five seasons, the British actor added depth and charm to Joss Whedon&#x27;s groundbreaking 1997-2003 series as mild-mannered librarian Rupert Giles.&quot; Head was nominated in for the 2001 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, but lost out to co-star James Marsters.

<text>Isaac Deutscher (; 3 April 1907 – 19 August 1967) was a Polish Marxist writer, journalist and political activist who moved to the United Kingdom before the outbreak of World War II. He is best known as a biographer of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin and as a commentator on Soviet affairs.

His scholarly biographies of Trotsky and Stalin have received widespread acclaim, with several reviewers ranking his three-volume &quot;Prophet&quot; trilogy among the greatest of political biographies. However, some criticism has been directed at his overly sympathetic tone for the subject matter. His three-volume biography of Trotsky was also highly influential among the British New Left in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life and communist involvement in Poland==

Deutscher was born in Chrzanów, a town in the Galicia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in southern Poland), into a family of religiously observant Jews. He studied with a Hasidic rebbe and was acclaimed as a prodigy in the study of the Torah and the Talmud. He lived through three pogroms in 1918 that followed the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. By the time of his bar mitzvah, however, he had lost his faith. He &quot;tested God&quot; by eating non-kosher food at the grave of a tzadik (holy person) on Yom Kippur. When nothing happened, he became an atheist. Deutscher first attracted notice as a poet, when he began publishing poems in Polish literary periodicals at the age of sixteen. His verse, in Yiddish and Polish, concerned Jewish and Polish mysticism, history and mythology, and he attempted to bridge the gulf between the Polish and Yiddish cultures. He also translated poetry from Hebrew, Latin, German, and Yiddish into Polish.

Deutscher studied literature, history, and philosophy as an extramural student at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. Soon he left Kraków for Warsaw, where he studied philosophy, economics and Marxism. Around 1927, he joined the illegal Communist Party of Poland (KPP) and became the editor of the party&#x27;s underground press. He wrote for the Jewish &quot;Nasz Przegląd&quot; (&quot;Our Review&quot;) and for the Marxist &quot;Miesięcznik Literacki&quot; (&quot;The Literary Monthly&quot;). In 1931 he toured the Soviet Union, seeing the economic conditions under the first Five Year Plan. The University of Moscow and the University of Minsk offered him posts as professor of history of socialism and of Marxist theory, but he declined the offers and returned to Poland. Deutscher co-founded the first anti-Stalinist group in the Communist Party of Poland, protesting the party view that Nazism and social democracy were &quot;not antipodes but twins.&quot; This contradicted the then official communist line, according to which social democrats were &quot;social fascists&quot;, the greatest enemies of the communist party. In an article &quot;The Danger of Barbarism over Europe&quot;, Deutscher urged the formation of a united front of socialists and communists against Nazism. He was expelled from the KPP in 1932, officially for &quot;exaggerating the danger of Nazism and spreading panic in the communist ranks.&quot;

==Move to Britain and journalism (1939–1947)==

In April 1939, Deutscher left Poland for London as a correspondent for a Polish-Jewish newspaper for which he had worked as a proof reader for fourteen years. This move saved his life and paved the way for his future career. He never returned to Poland and never saw any of his family again. He became a British subject in 1949, taking his oath of allegiance on 12 May 1949.

Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 and Deutscher&#x27;s connection with his newspaper was severed. He taught himself English and began writing for English magazines. He was soon a regular correspondent for the leading weekly &quot;The Economist&quot;. He joined the Trotskyist Revolutionary Workers League. In 1940, he joined the Polish Army in Scotland, but was interned as a dangerous subversive. Released in 1942, he joined the staff of &quot;The Economist&quot; and became its expert on Soviet affairs and military issues, and its chief European correspondent. He also wrote for &quot;The Observer&quot; as a roving European correspondent under the pen-name &quot;Peregrine&quot;. He was one of the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a restaurant in Soho) of left-leaning and emigre journalists that included Sebastian Haffner (also on &quot;The Observer&quot;), E. H. Carr, George Orwell, Barbara Ward and Jon Kimche.

He left journalism in 1946–47 to write books. Deutscher&#x27;s name (with the remark &quot;Sympathiser only&quot;) subsequently appeared on Orwell&#x27;s list, a list of people (including many writers and journalists) which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government. Orwell considered the listed people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be inappropriate to write for the IRD.

==Biographer and academic (1947–1967)==

Deutscher published his first major work, &quot;Stalin, A Political Biography&quot; in 1949. In the book he gave Stalin what he saw as his due for building a form of socialism in the Soviet Union, even if it was, in Deutscher&#x27;s view, a perversion of the vision of , Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. The Stalin biography made Deutscher a leading authority on Soviet affairs and the Russian Revolution. He followed it up with his most ambitious work, a three-volume biography of Trotsky: &quot;The Prophet Armed&quot; (1954), &quot;The Prophet Unarmed&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Prophet Outcast&quot; (1963). These books were based on detailed research into the Trotsky Archives at Harvard University. Much of the material contained in the third volume was previously unknown, since Trotsky&#x27;s widow, Natalia Sedova, gave Deutscher access to the closed section of the archives. Deutscher planned to conclude his series with a study of Lenin, but &quot;The Life of Lenin&quot; remained incomplete at the time of Deutscher&#x27;s death, partly due to a politically motivated denial of a university position to him. As later revealed, Isaiah Berlin, who was asked to evaluate the academic credentials of Deutscher, argued against such a promotion because of the profoundly pro-communist militancy of the candidate.

In the 1960s, the upsurge of left-wing sentiment that accompanied the Vietnam War made Deutscher a popular figure on university campuses in both Britain and the United States. By this time Deutscher had broken with conventional Trotskyism, although he never repudiated Trotsky himself and remained a committed Marxist. In 1965, Deutscher took part in the first &quot;Teach-In&quot; on Vietnam at the University of California, Berkeley, where thousands of students listened to his indictment of the Cold War. He was G. M. Trevelyan Lecturer at the University of Cambridge for 1966–67 and also lectured for six weeks at the State University of New York. In spring 1967, he guest-lectured at New York University, Princeton, Harvard and Columbia. The G. M. Trevelyan Lectures, under the title &quot;The Unfinished Revolution&quot;, were published after Deutscher&#x27;s sudden and unexpected death in Rome in 1967, where he went for an Italian TV broadcast. It was a play about the fall of Trotsky, written and directed by Marco Leto, starring Franco Parenti as Trotsky and Renzo Giovampietro as Stalin. A memorial prize honouring Deutscher, called the Deutscher Memorial Prize, is awarded annually to a book &quot;which exemplifies the best and most innovative new writing in or about the Marxist tradition&quot;. In his works Deutscher made the distinction between classical Marxism and vulgar Marxism.

==Relation to Judaism and Zionism==

Despite being an atheist, Deutscher emphasised the importance of his Jewish heritage. He coined the expression &quot;non-Jewish Jew&quot;, to apply to himself and other humanistic Jews. Deutscher admired Elisha ben Abuyah, a Jewish heretic of the 2nd century AD. However, he did not engage in specifically Jewish politics. In Warsaw, he joined the communist party, not the Jewish Bund, whose &quot;Yiddishist&quot; views he opposed. Deutscher wrote: &quot;Religion? I am an atheist. Jewish nationalism? I am an internationalist. In neither sense am I therefore a Jew. I am, however, a Jew by force of my unconditional solidarity with the persecuted and exterminated. I am a Jew because I feel the pulse of Jewish history; because I should like to do all I can to assure the real, not spurious, security and self-respect of the Jews.&quot;

Before World War II, Deutscher opposed Zionism as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of international socialism. But in the aftermath of the Holocaust he regretted his pre-war views, lamenting that &quot;If, instead of arguing against Zionism in the 1920s and 1930s, I had urged European Jews to go to Palestine, I might have helped to save some of the lives that were to be extinguished in Hitler&#x27;s gas chambers.&quot; He argued the case for establishing Israel as a &quot;historic necessity&quot;, to provide a home for the surviving Jews of Europe; and said that his anti-Zionism, which &quot;I have, of course, long since abandoned ... was based on a confidence in the European labour movement, or, more broadly, a confidence in European society and civilisation which that society and civilisation have not justified.&quot; In the 1960s, he became more critical of Israel for its failure to recognise the dispossession of the Palestinians, and after the Six-Day War of 1967 he demanded that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories. &quot;This &quot;six-day wonder&quot;&quot;, he commented, &quot;the latest, all-too-easy triumph of Israeli arms will be seen one day ... to have been a disaster in the first instance for Israel itself.&quot;

Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Deutscher wrote the following allegory: &quot;A man once jumped from the top floor of a burning house in which many members of his family had already perished. He managed to save his life; but as he was falling he hit a person standing down below and broke that person&#x27;s legs and arms. The jumping man had no choice; yet to the man with the broken limbs he was the cause of his misfortune. If both behaved rationally, they would not become enemies. The man who escaped from the blazing house, having recovered, would have tried to help and console the other sufferer; and the latter might have realized that he was the victim of circumstances over which neither of them had control. But look what happens when these people behave irrationally. The injured man blames the other for his misery and swears to make him pay for it. The other, afraid of the crippled man&#x27;s revenge, insults him, kicks him, and beats him up whenever they meet. The kicked man again swears revenge and is again punched and punished. The bitter enmity, so fortuitous at first, hardens and comes to overshadow the whole existence of both men and to poison their minds.&quot;

Deutscher wrote the following passages in &quot;The Israeli Arab War, June 1967&quot; (1967):
&quot;Still we must exercise our judgment and must not allow it to be clouded by emotions and memories, however deep or haunting. We should not allow even invocations of Auschwitz to blackmail us into supporting the wrong cause.&quot; (Quoted in &quot;Prophets Outcast&quot;, p. 184, Nation Books, 2004.)
&quot;To justify or condone Israel&#x27;s wars against the Arabs is to render Israel a very bad service indeed and to harm its own long-term interest. Israel&#x27;s security, let me repeat, was not enhanced by the wars of 1956 and 1967; it was undermined and compromised by them. The &#x27;friends of Israel&#x27; have in fact abetted Israel in a ruinous course.&quot; (Quoted in &quot;Prophets Outcast&quot;, p. 184, Nation Books, 2004.)

<doc id="156327" wikidata="Q917495" url="?curid=156327" title="Criticism of copyright">
<text>Criticism of copyright, or anti-copyright sentiment, is a dissenting view of the current state of copyright law or copyright as a concept. Critics often discuss philosophical, economical, or social rationales of such laws and the laws&#x27; implementations, the benefits of which they claim do not justify the policy&#x27;s costs to society. They advocate for changing the current system, though different groups have different ideas of what that change should be. Some call for remission of the policies to a previous state—copyright once covered few categories of things and had shorter term limits—or they may seek to expand concepts like fair use that allow permissionless copying. Others seek the abolition of copyright itself.

Opposition to copyright is often a portion of platforms advocating for broader social reform. For example, Lawrence Lessig, a free-culture movement speaker, advocates for loosening copyright law as a means of making sharing information easier or addressing the orphan works issue and the Swedish Pirate Party has advocated for limiting copyright to five year terms.

==Economic arguments==

===Non-scarcity===

There is an argument that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state. The argument claims that, infringing on copyright, unlike theft, does not deprive the victim of the original item.

===Historical comparison===
It is unclear if copyright laws are economically stimulating for most authors, and it is uncommon for copyright laws to be evaluated based on empirical studies of their impacts.

==Information technology related concerns==

One of the founders of Piratbyrån, Rasmus Fleischer, argues that copyright law simply seems unable to cope with the Internet, and hence is obsolete. He argues that the Internet, and particularly Web 2.0 have brought about the uncertain status of the very idea of &quot;stealing&quot; itself, and that instead business models need to adapt to the reality of the Darknet. He argues that in an attempt to rein in Web 2.0, copyright law in the 21st century is increasingly concerned with criminalising entire technologies, leading to recent attacks on different kinds of search engines, solely because they provide links to files which may be copyrighted. Fleischer points out that Google, while still largely uncontested, operates in a gray zone of copyright (e.g. the business model of Google Books is to display millions of pages of copyrighted and uncopyrighted books as part of a business plan drawing its revenue from advertising). In contrast, others have pointed out that Google Books blocks out large sections of those same books, and they say that does not harm the legitimate interests of rightsholders.

==Cultural arguments==

===Freedom of knowledge===

Groups such as &quot;Hipatia&quot; advance anti-copyright arguments in the name of &quot;freedom of knowledge&quot; and argue that knowledge should be &quot;shared in solidarity&quot;. Such groups may perceive &quot;freedom of knowledge&quot; as a right, and/or as fundamental in realising the right to education, which is an internationally recognised human right, as well as the right to a free culture and the right to free communication. They argue that current copyright law hinders the realisation of these rights in today&#x27;s knowledge societies relying on new technological means of communication and see copyright law as preventing or slowing human progress.

===Authorship and creativity===
Lawrence Liang, founder of the Alternative Law Forum, argues that current copyright is based on a too narrow definition of &quot;author&quot;, which is assumed to be clear and undisputed. Liang observes that the concept of &quot;the author&quot; is assumed to make universal sense across cultures and across time. Instead, Liang argues that the notion of the author as a unique and transcendent being, possessing originality of spirit, was constructed in Europe after the Industrial Revolution, to distinguish the personality of the author from the expanding realm of mass-produced goods. Hence works created by &quot;authors&quot; were deemed original, and merges with the doctrine of property prevalent at the time.

Liang argues that the concept of &quot;author&quot; is tied to the notion of copyright and emerged to define a new social relationship—the way society perceives the ownership of knowledge. The concept of &quot;author&quot; thus naturalised a particular process of knowledge production where the emphasis on individual contribution and individual ownership takes precedence over the concept of &quot;community knowledge&quot;. Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive. Liang challenges this logic, arguing that &quot;many authors who have little hope of ever finding a market for their publications, and whose copyright is, as a result, virtually worthless, have in the past, and even in the present, continued to write.&quot; Liang points out that people produce works purely for personal satisfaction, or even for respect and recognition from peers. Liang argues that the 19th Century saw the prolific authorship of literary works in the absence of meaningful copyright that benefited the author. In fact, Liang argues, copyright protection usually benefited the publisher, and rarely the author.

===Preservation of cultural works===
The Center for the Study of Public Domain has raised concerns on how the protracted copyright terms in the United States have caused historical films and other cultural works to be destroyed due to disintegration before they can be digitized. The center has described the copyright terms as &quot;absurdly long&quot; which hold little economic benefit to rights holders and prevents efforts to preserve historical artefacts. Director Jennifer Jenkins has said that by the time artefacts enter the public domain in the United States after 95 years, many culturally significant works such as old films and sound recordings have already been lost as a consequence of the long copyright terms.

==Ethical issues==
The institution of copyright brings up several ethical issues. 

=== Censorship ===

Critics of copyright argue that copyright has been abused to suppress free speech, as well as business competition, academic research and artistic expression. As a consequence, copyright legislation such as DMCA has enabled copyright owners to &quot;censor academic discussions and online criticism&quot;.

=== Philosophical arguments ===
Selmer Bringsjord argues that all forms of copying are morally permissible (without commercial use), because some forms of copying are permissible and there is not a logical distinction between various forms of copying.

Edwin Hettinger argues that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak and the philosophical tradition justifying property can not guide us in thinking about intellectual property. Shelly Warwick believes that copyright law as currently constituted does not appear to have a consistent ethical basis.

==Organisations and scholars==

===Groups advocating the abolition of copyright===

Pirate Cinema and groups like The League of Noble Peers advance more radical arguments, opposing copyright per se. A number of anti-copyright groups have recently emerged in the argument over peer-to-peer file sharing, digital freedom, and freedom of information; these include the Association des Audionautes and the Kopimism Church of New Zealand.

In 2003, Eben Moglen, a professor of Law at Columbia University, published The , which re-interpreted the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; by Karl Marx in the light of the development of computer technology and the internet; much of the re-interpreted content discussed copyright law and privilege in Marxist terms.

Recent developments related to BitTorrent and peer-to-peer file sharing have been termed by media commentators as &quot;copyright wars&quot;, with The Pirate Bay being referred to as &quot;the most visible member of a burgeoning international anti-copyright—or pro-piracy—movement&quot;. One well-publicised instance of electronic civil disobedience (ECD) in the form of large scale intentional copyright infringement occurred on February 24, 2004, in an event called Grey Tuesday. Activists intentionally violated EMI&#x27;s copyright of &quot;The White Album&quot; by distributing MP3 files of a mashup album called &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, in an attempt to draw public attention to copyright reform issues and anti-copyright ideals. Reportedly over 400 sites participated including 170 that hosted the album with some protesters stating that The Grey Album illustrates a need for revisions in copyright law to allow sampling under fair use of copyrighted material, or proposing a system of fair compensation to allow for sampling.

===Groups advocating changes to copyright law===
French group Association des Audionautes is not anti-copyright per se, but proposes a reformed system for copyright enforcement and compensation. Aziz Ridouan, co-founder of the group, proposes for France to legalise peer-to-peer file sharing and to compensate artists through a surcharge on Internet service provider fees (i.e. an alternative compensation system). Wired magazine reported that major music companies have equated Ridouan&#x27;s proposal with legitimising piracy. In January 2008, seven Swedish members of parliament from the Moderate Party (part of the governing coalition), authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete decriminalisation of file sharing; they wrote that &quot;Decriminalising all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution. It&#x27;s the only solution, unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the Internet.&quot;

In June 2015 a WIPO article, &quot;Remix culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma&quot;, acknowledged the &quot;age of remixing&quot; and the need for a copyright reform while referring to recent law interpretations in &quot;Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.&quot; and Canada&#x27;s Copyright Modernization Act.

===Groups advocating using existing copyright law===

Groups that argue for using existing copyright legal framework with special licences to achieve their goals, include the copyleft movement and Creative Commons. Creative Commons is not anti-copyright per se, but argues for use of more flexible and open copyright licences within existing copyright law. Creative Commons takes the position that there is an unmet demand for flexibility that allows the copyright owner to release work with only &quot;some rights reserved&quot; or even &quot;no rights reserved&quot;. According to Creative Commons many people do not regard default copyright as helping them in gaining the exposure and widespread distribution they want. Creative Commons argue that their licences allow entrepreneurs and artists to employ innovative business models rather than all-out copyright to secure a return on their creative investment.

===Scholars and commentators===

Scholars and commentators in this field include Lawrence Liang, Jorge Cortell, Rasmus Fleischer, Stephan Kinsella, and Siva Vaidhyanathan.

Traditional anarchists, such as Leo Tolstoy, expressed their refusal to accept copyright.

<text>Thomas Gold (May 22, 1920 – June 22, 2004) was an Austrian-born astrophysicist, who also held British and American citizenship. He was a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the Royal Society (London). Gold was one of three young Cambridge scientists who in 1948 proposed the now mostly abandoned &quot;steady state&quot; hypothesis of the universe. Gold&#x27;s work crossed boundaries of academic and scientific disciplines, into biophysics, astronomy, aerospace engineering, and geophysics.

==Early life==
Gold was born on May 22, 1920, in Vienna, Austria, to Max Gold, a wealthy Jewish industrialist (pre-war) who ran one of Austria&#x27;s largest mining and metal fabrication companies, and German former actress Josefine Martin. Following the economic downfall of the European mining industry in the late 1920s, Max Gold moved his family to Berlin, where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company. Following the start of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler&#x27;s anti-Jewish campaigns in 1933, Gold and his family left Germany because of his father&#x27;s heritage. The family travelled through Europe for the next few years. Gold attended boarding school at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz in Zuoz, Switzerland, where he quickly proved to be a clever, competitive and physically and mentally aggressive individual. Gold finished his schooling at Zuoz in 1938, and fled with his family to England after the German invasion of Austria in early 1938. Gold entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences. In May 1940, just as Hitler was commencing his advance in Belgium and France, Gold was sent into internment as an enemy alien by the British government. It was on the first night of internment, at an army barracks in Bury St Edmunds, that he met his future collaborator and close friend, Hermann Bondi.

Gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in Canada, after which he returned to England and reentered Cambridge University, where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics. After graduating with a pass (Ordinary) degree in June 1942, Gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern England before joining Bondi and Fred Hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near Dunsfold, Surrey. The three men would spend their off-duty hours in &quot;intense and wide-ranging scientific discussion&quot; on topics such as cosmology, mathematics and astrophysics. Within months, Gold was placed in charge of constructing new radar systems. Gold determined how landing craft could use radar to navigate to the appropriate landing spot on D-Day and also discovered that the German navy had fitted snorkels to its U-boats, making them operable underwater while still taking in air from above the surface.

==Schooling and work in England==
Immediately after the war, Hoyle and Bondi returned to Cambridge, while Gold stayed with naval research until 1947. He then began working at Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory to help construct the world&#x27;s largest magnetron, a device invented by two British scientists in 1940 that generated intense microwaves for radar. Soon after, Gold joined R. J. Pumphrey, a zoologist at the Cambridge Zoology Laboratory who had served as the deputy head of radar naval research during the war, to study the effect of resonance on the human ear.

===Theory of human hearing===

Via simple experimentation in 1946, Gold found that the degree of resonance observed in the cochlea was not in accordance with the level of damping that would be expected from the viscosity of the watery liquid that fills the inner ear. As recounted by Freeman Dyson, who was one of the fellow students at Cambridge whom Gold experimented on, the procedure was &quot;simple, elegant, and original.&quot; Gold built his experimental apparatus out of war surplus Navy electronics and headphones. This was equipment that Gold had used during his World War II assignment to the Royal Navy as a radar and radio communications specialist.

In 1948 he published two papers on his results; one described the theory and the other reporting the experimental results. His theory was that the ear operates instead in the same way as does a &quot;regenerative radio receiver&quot; by adding energy at the same frequency it is trying to detect. (Later this became known as otoacoustic emission.) Although Gold won a prize fellowship from Trinity College for his thesis on this proposed mechanism of hearing and obtained a junior lectureship at the Cavendish Laboratory, his theory was widely ignored by ear specialists and physiologists, such as future (1961) Nobel Prize winner Georg von Békésy, who did not believe the cochlea operated under a feedback system. Later, however, researchers discovered that Gold&#x27;s hypothesis had been correct. As reported in one of the science obituaries published about Gold in 2004, &quot;Ignored for over 30 years, his research was rediscovered in the 1970s when physiologists discovered the tiny hair cells that act as amplifiers in the inner ear.&quot;

===Steady-state theory===

Gold began discussing problems in physics with Hoyle and Bondi again, centering on the issues over redshift and Hubble&#x27;s law. This led the three to all start questioning the Big Bang theory originally proposed by Georges Lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by George Gamow, which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today. As recounted in a 1978 interview with physicist and historian Spencer R. Weart, Gold believed that there was reason to think that the creation of matter was &quot;done all the time and then none of the problems about fleeting moments arise. It can be just in a steady state with the expansion taking things apart as fast as new matter comes into being and condenses into new galaxies&quot;.

Two papers were published in 1948 discussing the &quot;steady-state theory&quot; as an alternative to the Big Bang: one by Hermann Bondi and Gold, the other by Fred Hoyle. In their seminal paper, Bondi and Gold asserted that although the universe is expanding, it nevertheless does not change its look over time; it has no beginning and no end. They proposed the perfect cosmological principle as the underpinning of their theory, which held that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space and time. On the large scale, they argued that there &quot;is nothing outstanding about any place in the universe, and that those differences which do exist are only of local significance; that seen on a large scale the universe is homogeneous.&quot; However, since the universe was not characterized by a lack of evolution, distinguishing features or recognizable direction of time, they postulated that there had to be large-scale motions in the universe. They highlighted two possible types of motion: large-scale expansion and its reverse, large-scale contraction. They estimated that within the expanding universe, hydrogen atoms were being created out of a vacuum at a rate of one atom per cubic meter per 109 years. This creation of matter would keep the density of the universe constant as it expanded. Gold and Bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by Hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory.

It was not until the 1960s that major problems with the steady-state theory began to emerge, when observations apparently supported the idea that the universe was in fact changing: quasars and radio galaxies were found only at large distances (therefore existing only in the distant past), not in closer galaxies. Whereas the Big Bang theory predicted as much, steady state predicted that such objects would be found everywhere, including close to our own galaxy, since evolution would be more evenly distributed, not observed only at great distances. In addition, proponents of the theory predicted that in addition to hydrogen atoms, antimatter would also be produced, as with cosmic gamma ray background from the annihilation of protons and antiprotons and X-ray emitting gas from the creation of neutrons.

For most cosmologists, the refutation of the steady-state theory came with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, which was predicted by the Big Bang theory. Stephen Hawking said that the fact that microwave radiation had been found, and that it was thought to be left over from the Big Bang, was &quot;the final nail in the coffin of the steady-state theory.&quot; Bondi conceded that the theory had been disproved, but Hoyle and Gold remained unconvinced for a number of years. Gold even supported Hoyle&#x27;s modified steady-state theory; however, by 1998 he started to express some doubts about the theory, but maintained that despite its faults, the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe.

===Extra-galactic radio signals===

In 1951, at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the Milky Way galaxy, much to the derision of radio astronomer Martin Ryle and several mathematical cosmologists. However, a year later, a distant source was identified and Gold announced at an International Astronomical Union meeting in Rome that his theory had been proven. Ryle would later take Gold&#x27;s argument as proof of extragalactic evolution, claiming that it invalidated the steady-state theory.

===Shock wave origin of magnetic storms===
Gold left Cambridge in 1952 to become the chief assistant to Astronomer Royal Harold Spencer Jones at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux, Sussex, England. While there, Gold attracted some controversy by suggesting that the interaction between charged particles from the Sun with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in creating magnetic storms in the upper atmosphere was an example of a collisionless shock wave. The theory was widely disputed, until American scientists in 1957 discovered that Gold&#x27;s theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube.

==Astrophysics work in the USA==

Gold resigned from the Royal Observatory following Spencer-Jones&#x27;s retirement and moved to the United States in 1956, where he served as Professor of Astronomy (1957–1958) and Robert Wheeler Wilson Professor of Applied Astronomy (1958–1959) at Harvard University. In early 1959, he accepted an appointment at Cornell University, which had offered him the opportunity to set up an interdisciplinary unit for radiophysics and space research, and take charge of the Department of Astronomy. At the time, there was only one other faculty member in the department. Gold would serve as director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research until 1981, establishing Cornell as a leading hub of scientific research. During his tenure, Gold hired famed astronomers Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, helped establish the world&#x27;s largest radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Cornell-Sydney University Astronomy Center with Harry Messel. In addition, Gold served as Assistant Vice President for Research from 1969–1971 and the John L. Wetherill Professor of Astronomy from 1971 until his retirement in 1986.

===Solar nanoflares and Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere===
In 1959, Gold expanded on his previous prediction of a collisionless shock wave, arguing that solar flares would eject material into magnetic clouds to produce a shock front that would result in geomagnetic storms. He also coined the term &quot;magnetosphere&quot; in his paper &quot;Motions in the Magnetosphere of the Earth&quot; to describe &quot;the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the Earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles ... [which was] known to extend out to a distance of the order of 10 Earth radii&quot;. A 2015 paper titled &quot;Modelling nanoflares in active regions and implications for coronal heating mechanisms,&quot; attributes the initial idea of the cause of magnetic storms above Earth to Gold: &quot;The heating of the solar corona by small, impulsive heating events appears to date to a discussion by Gold [1], and the subsequent more quantitative proposal of Levine [2,3] that small coronal current sheets were responsible for the heating.&quot;

===Panspermia and pulsars===

In 1960, Gold collaborated again with Fred Hoyle to show that magnetic energy fueled solar flares and that flares were triggered when opposite magnetic loops interact and release their stored energy.

In 1960, Gold suggested a &quot;garbage theory&quot; for the origin of life, thus constituting a kind of &quot;accidental panspermia&quot;. The theory proposes that life on Earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on Earth long ago by extraterrestrials.

In 1968, a Cambridge radio astronomy postgraduate student Jocelyn Bell Burnell and her doctoral adviser Antony Hewish discovered a pulsing radio source with a period of 1.337 seconds. The source – which was termed &quot;pulsar&quot; – emitted beams of electromagnetic radiation at a very short and consistent interval. Gold proposed that these objects were rapidly rotating neutron stars. Gold argued that due to their strong magnetic fields and high rotational speed, pulsars would emit radiation similar to a rotating beacon. Gold&#x27;s conclusion was initially not well received by the scientific community; in fact, he was refused permission to present his theory at the first international conference on pulsars. However, Gold&#x27;s theory became widely accepted following the discovery of a pulsar in the Crab Nebula using the Arecibo radio telescope, opening the door for future advancements in solid-state physics and astronomy. Anthony Tucker of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that Gold&#x27;s discovery paved the way for Stephen Hawking&#x27;s groundbreaking research into black holes.

===Moon dust and NASA===

From the 1950s, Gold served as a consultant to NASA and held positions on several national space committees, including the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, as the United States tried to develop its space program. At the time, scientists were engaged in a heated debate over the physical properties of the Moon&#x27;s surface. In 1955, he predicted that the Moon was covered by a layer of fine rock powder stemming from &quot;the ceaseless bombardment of its surface by Solar System debris&quot;. This led to the dust being jokingly referred to as &quot;Gold dust&quot; or &quot;Gold&#x27;s dust&quot;. Gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust, but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields, he determined that the astronauts&#x27; boots would sink only three centimeters into the Moon&#x27;s surface. In any case, NASA sent unmanned Surveyors to analyze the conditions on the surface of the Moon. Gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists, not only for his hypothesis, but for the approach he took in communicating NASA&#x27;s concerns to the American public; in particular, some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term &quot;Moon dust&quot; in reference to lunar regolith. When the Apollo 11 crew landed on the Moon in 1969 and brought back the first samples of lunar rocks, researchers found that lunar soil was in fact powdery. Gold said the findings were consistent with his hypothesis, noting that &quot;in one area as they walked along, they sank in between five and eight inches&quot;. However, Gold received little credit for his correct prediction, and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust. Gold had also contributed to the Apollo program by designing the Apollo Lunar Surface Closeup Camera (ALSCC) (a kind of stereo camera) used on the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 missions.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Gold was a vocal critic of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, deriding claims that the agency could fly 50 missions a year or that it could have low budget costs. NASA officials warned Gold that if he testified his concerns before Congress, his research proposals would lose their support from NASA. Gold ignored the warning and testified before a Congressional committee headed by Senator Walter Mondale. In a letter to NASA administrator James C. Fletcher, George Low wrote that &quot;Gold should realize that being funded by the Government and NASA is a privilege, and that it would make little sense for us to fund him as long as his views are what they are now&quot;. Gold recalled the aftermath of his testimony in a 1983 interview with astronomy historian David H. DeVorkin:

I had a very hard time with NASA, year after year. I got some more money, but eventually it fizzled out, after three years or so after this event. My applications, which previously each year had always gone through very smoothly, were turned down. I would then have to go to Washington, discuss it with them. and I then would get a certain fraction of it resurrected. For several years running this happened, and then eventually it fizzled permanently, and I&#x27;ve not tried to get any money out of NASA since.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was certainly regarded as persona non grata with NASA after that. I had a very hard time. Shortly after that Noel Hinners became the Space Science administrator, and he used to joke about it and say, &quot;Oh. Tommy&#x27;s got to come to his annual pilgrimage to Washington,&quot; and regarded it as very funny, but then he&#x27;d always give me some money. But always clearly as a persona non grata.
== Contrarian views in geology and biology ==
===Abiogenic origins of petroleum===
Thomas Gold first became interested in the origins of petroleum in the 1950s, postulating a theory on the abiogenic formation of fossil fuels. Gold engaged in thorough discussion on the matter with Fred Hoyle, who even included a chapter on &quot;Gold&#x27;s Pore Theory&quot; in his 1955 book &quot;Frontiers in Astronomy&quot;.
While Russian scientists had long been at work explicating possible abiogenic origins of petroleum, the Cold War blocked knowledge of their publications until the 1990s. Thus, Thomas Gold was credited with the idea in the United States when current events prompted him to submit an opinion piece to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in June 1977 titled, &quot;Rethinking the origins of oil and gas.&quot; Concern about gasoline shortages that began in 1973 were still troubling the economy. A striking discovery in the deep-sea just four months earlier (February 1977) was another impetus: Exploration and photography of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent showed a dense amount of life living on chemical energy. Stationary organisms depending on vent outflows included albino clams and tube worms larger than ever seen in surface marine ecosystems. Most astonishing was that such ecosystems were based on microbial life living entirely on chemosynthetic rather than photosynthetic ways of capturing energy and building living cells.

Science communicator Paul Davies explained Gold&#x27;s theory in this way: &quot;Conventional wisdom has it that oil and coal are remnants of ancient surface life that became buried and subjected to extremes of temperature and pressure. Gold maintains that these deposits are not fossil fuels in the normal sense, but the products of primordial hydrocarbons dating from the time of the Earth&#x27;s formation. He claims that over the aeons the volatile gases migrate towards the surface through cracks in the crust, and either leak into the atmosphere as methane, become trapped in sub-surface gas fields, or are robbed of their hydrogen to become oil, tar or carbonaceous material like coal.&quot;

As to the ubiquity of abiotic hydrocarbons in the solar system, a 1999 profile of Gold in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted him as saying, &quot;it always seemed absurd to me to see petroleum hydrocarbons on other planets, where there was obviously never any vegetation, even as we insist that on Earth they must be biological in origin.&quot;

===Earthquakes from rising methane===

Having established the theoretical foundations of his abiogenic petroleum hypothesis, Gold began in-depth thinking and research on the kinds of empirical evidence that might land in its favor. First was collaborating with a former graduate student of his at Cornell University: Steven Soter. Soter had received his PhD in astronomy in 1971 and had recently concluded another faculty collaboration at Cornell: working with Carl Sagan in the writing of the television series, &quot;&quot;. Gold and Soter teamed up to investigate the knowns and unknowns about earthquakes from the standpoint of plausible causation by or regular co-occurrence with sudden escape of large volumes of methane gas. The result was a series of papers, including two with &quot;earthquakes&quot; in the title: &quot;North Sea-quakes&quot; (&quot;New Scientist&quot; 1979) and &quot;Fluid Ascent through the Solid Lithosphere and its Relation to Earthquakes&quot; (&quot;Pure and Applied Geophysics&quot; 1985). Their 1980 article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; was titled &quot;The Deep-Earth-Gas Hypothesis&quot; and the explanatory value of the idea was presented as, providing &quot;a unified basis for explaining a number of otherwise rather puzzling phenomena that either give warning of earthquakes or accompany them.&quot; Even so, they cautioned, &quot;The sampling of such gases is just beginning, and the data will not yet support confident conclusions.&quot;

The puzzling phenomena associated with earthquakes include &quot;flames that shoot from the ground, earthquake lights, fierce bubbling in bodies of water, sulfurous air and the strange behavior of animals, loud explosive and hissing noises, and visible waves rolling slowly along alluvial ground.&quot; They constructed a map of the world depicting major oil-producing regions and areas with historical seismic activity. Several oil-rich regions, such as Alaska, Texas, the Caribbean, Mexico, Venezuela, the Persian Gulf, the Urals, Siberia, and Southeast Asia, were shown to be lying on major earthquake belts. Gold and Soter suggested that these belts may explain the upward migration of gases originating at depth. &quot;The fact is that oil and gas fields show a distinct association with such earthquake-prone regions. The association suggests to us that the deep faults may provide a conduit for the continuous input of nonbiological methane streaming up from below. Moreover, the upward migration of methane and other gases in fault zones may contribute to the triggering of earthquakes.&quot;

He also pointed to the abundance of helium in oil and gas reserves as evidence for &quot;a deep source of the hydrocarbons&quot;. Moreover, a few oil reserves thought to have been exhausted were suddenly generating vast amounts of crude oil. From this, Gold proposed that the Earth may possess a virtually endless supply – suggesting as much as &quot;at least 500 million years&#x27; worth of gas&quot; – of fossil fuels.

===The helium anomaly===

In later publications, Gold emphasized that the immense amounts of helium gas that surges upward during commercial petroleum production at some sites is proof in itself that substantial lightweight gases have indeed persisted at depth since the amalgamation of cosmic debris into planet Earth during the birth of this solar system. In his 1998 book, Gold closed his fourth chapter, &quot;Evidence for Deep-Earth Gas,&quot; with a section titled &quot;The Association of Helium with Hydrocarbons.&quot;

===A test: Drilling deep into granite===

Gold began testing his abiogenic petroleum theory in 1986. With the backing of a group of investors, Vattenfall and the Gas Research Institute, drilling of a deep borehole – named Gravberg-1 – commenced into the bedrock near Lake Siljan in Sweden. This was the site of a large meteor crater, which would have &quot;opened channels deep enough for the methane to migrate upward&quot; and formed deposits in caprock just a few miles beneath the surface. He estimated that the fractures near Lake Siljan reached down nearly 40 kilometers into the earth.

In 1987, approximately of drilling lubricant disappeared nearly into the ground, leading Gold to believe that the lubricant had fallen into a methane reservoir. Soon after, the team brought up nearly 100 liters of black oily sludge to the surface. Gold claimed that the sludge contained both oil and remnants of archaebacteria. He argued that &quot;it suggests there is an enormous sphere of life, of biology, at deeper levels in the ground than we have had any knowledge of previously&quot; and that this evidence would &quot;destroy the orthodox argument that since oil contains biological molecules, oil reserves must have derived from biological material&quot;.

The announcement of Gold&#x27;s findings was met with mixed reactions, ranging from &quot;furious incredulity&quot; to &quot;deep skepticism&quot;. Geochemist Geoffrey P. Glasby speculated that the sludge could have been formed from the Fischer–Tropsch process, a catalyzed chemical reaction in which synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is converted into liquid hydrocarbons. Critics also dismissed Gold&#x27;s archaebacteria finding, stating that &quot;since micro-organisms cannot survive at such depth, the bacteria prove that the well has been contaminated from the surface&quot;. Geochemist Paul Philp analyzed the sludge and concluded that he could not differentiate between the samples of sludge and oil seep found in sedimentary shale rocks near the surface. He reasoned that oil had migrated from the shale down to the granite deep in the ground. Gold disputed Philp&#x27;s finding, believing that the oil and gas could have just as easily migrated up to the surface: &quot;They would have it that the oil and gas we found down there was from the five feet of sediments on the top – had seeped all the way down six kilometres down into the granite. I mean, such complete absurdity: you can imagine sitting there with five feet of soil and six kilometres underneath of dense granitic rock, and that methane produced up there has crawled all the way down in preference to water. Absolute nonsense.&quot;

In light of the controversy surrounding the sludge and possible drill contamination, Gold abandoned the project at Gravberg-1, calling it a &quot;complete fiasco&quot;, and redesigned the experiment by replacing his oil-based drilling lubricant with a water-based one.

The drill hit oil in the spring of 1989, but only collected about . Gold stated, &quot;It was not coming up at a rate at which you could sell it, but it showed there was oil down there.&quot; The drill then ran into technical problems and was stopped at a depth of 6.8 kilometers. The hole was closed, but a second hole was opened for drilling closer to the &quot;center of the impact ring where there was even less sedimentary rock&quot;. By October 1991, the drill hit oil at a depth of 3.8 kilometers, but many skeptics remained unconvinced of the site&#x27;s prospects. Geologist John R. Castaño concluded that there was insufficient evidence of the mantle as the hydrocarbon source and that it was unlikely that the Siljan site could be used as a commercial gas field. In 2019, a study of gases and secondary carbonate minerals revealed that long-term microbial methanogenesis has occurred in situ deep within the fracture system of the crater (for at least 80 million years) and with an obvious spatial link to seep oils of surficial sedimentary origin, at odds with Gold&#x27;s theories of deep abiotic gas migration.

Gold&#x27;s later views on the drilling results can be found in chapter 6, &quot;The Siljan Experiment,&quot; of his 1998 book. Another section of the book titled &quot;The Upwelling Theory of Coal Formation&quot; presents another argument in favor of the abiogenic model that he had not presented in an earlier paper. Similarly, he also presents arguments pertaining to the origin of diamonds and that microbial processes are the cause of mineral concentrations at depth.

===Dispute nearly forgotten===

In 1996 a paper published in the journal &quot;Social Studies of Science&quot; was titled, &quot;Which Came First, the Fossil or the Fuel?&quot; The author concluded:

Beginning in the late 1970s, Gold revived the &#x27;abiogenic&#x27; theory, which holds that hydrocarbons are primordial, not remnants of decayed biology. By contesting the central tenet of petroleum geology, Gold precipitated a bitter scientific controversy. Both sides employed novel rhetorical strategies in order to impute interests, to contest expertise, to recruit allies from peripheral disciplines, and to claim the mantle of scientific method; and both managed to construct plausible interpretations of the available data.

The author reported that even the Siljan drilling results had not been sufficient to fully resolve the long-standing dispute about origins, although Gold&#x27;s hypothesis is favored by only a very slim minority. As of 2024, &quot;fossil fuel&quot; is still the prevailing term widely in use in reference to petroleum resources, both within academia and without. Such terminology includes 21st century communications about the causes of anthropogenic climate change and proffered solutions to the crisis, such as the 2023 IPCC report, &quot;Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report: Summary for Policymakers.&quot; Overall, within the academic disciplines of geobiology and petroleum geology, criticism of Gold&#x27;s abiogenic theory has been severe — but not entire. The dispute is more set aside and forgotten than resolved.

As to whether Gold&#x27;s framing of distinct chemosynthetic microbes are active and ubiquitous at depth, the established authorities have moved in his direction. (See next section.)

===&quot;Deep Hot Biosphere&quot; theory===
In a 1992 paper, &quot;The Deep, Hot Biosphere&quot;, Gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the Earth, down to depths of several kilometers, where rising temperatures finally set a limit. The subsurface life obtains its energy not from photosynthesis but from chemical sources in fluids migrating upwards through the crust. The mass of the deep biosphere may be comparable to that of the surface biosphere. Subsurface life may be widespread on other bodies in the solar system and throughout the universe, even on worlds unaccompanied by other stars.

A 1993 article by journalist William Broad, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and titled &quot;Strange New Microbes Hint at a Vast Subterranean World,&quot; carried Gold&#x27;s thesis to public attention. The article began, &quot;New forms of microbial life are being discovered in such abundance deep inside the Earth that some scientists are beginning to suspect that the planet has a hidden biosphere extending miles down whose total mass may rival or exceed that of all surface life. If a deep biosphere does exist, scientists say, its discovery will rewrite textbooks while shedding new light on the mystery of life&#x27;s origins. Even skeptics say the thesis is intriguing enough to warrant new studies of the subterranean realm.&quot;

The 1993 article also features how Gold&#x27;s thesis expands possibilities for astrobiology research: &quot;Dr. Thomas Gold, an astrophysicist at Cornell University known for bold theorizing, has speculated that subterranean life may dot the cosmos, secluded beneath the surfaces of planets and moons and energized by geological processes, with no need for the warming radiation of nearby stars. He wrote in &quot;The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; last year that the solar system might harbor at least 10 deep biospheres. &#x27;Such life may be widely disseminated in the universe,&#x27; he said, &#x27;since planetary type bodies with similar subsurface conditions may be common as solitary objects in space, as well as in other solar-type systems.&#x27;&quot;

Gold also published a book of the same title, &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot;, in 1999, which expanded on the arguments in his 1992 paper and included speculations on the origin of life and on horizontal gene transfer. According to Gold, bacteria feeding on the oil accounts for the presence of biological debris in hydrocarbon fuels, obviating the need to resort to a biogenic theory for the origin of the latter. The flows of underground hydrocarbons may also explain oddities in the concentration of other mineral deposits. In short, Gold said about the origin of natural hydrocarbons (petroleum and natural gas): &quot;Hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology (as the traditional view would hold), but rather geology reworked by biology&quot;.

Freeman Dyson wrote the foreword to Gold&#x27;s 1999 book, where he concluded, &quot;Gold&#x27;s theories are always original, always important, usually controversial — and usually right. It is my belief, based on fifty years of observation of Gold as a friend and colleague, that the deep hot biosphere is all of the above: original, important, controversial — and right.&quot; (Dyson also delivered a eulogy at Gold&#x27;s memorial service, a segment of which pertaining to the deep hot biosphere theory is posted on youtube.)

Following Gold&#x27;s death, scientific discoveries amplified and also shifted understanding of the deep hot biosphere into what is now generally called deep biosphere. However, it is only at great depth where naturally occurring geochemical processes induced by intense heat and pressure produce elemental hydrogen and carbon dioxide upon which novel metabolisms of life (especially among the primitive Archaea) could have evolved. A retrospective paper published in the same journal as Gold&#x27;s 1992 paper featured the metabolic and genetic discoveries of life forms at depth that Gold&#x27;s paper inspired. Titled &quot;The Deep, Hot Biosphere: Twenty-five years of retrospection,&quot; the authors conclude:

The pioneering ideas proposed by Thomas Gold inspired a generation of researchers in the field of geobiology to dive deeper into the possibilities of subsurface life, spawning hundreds of relevant publications... Deep hydrocarbon deposits on Mars, Titan, and worlds beyond could play host to life similar to that in Earth’s own crust. The techniques used to better study and understand deep, hot biospheres on Earth could then be applied to robotically probe targets in deep space as we move into the next century of scientific discovery. Technology is advancing at a rate wherein we may find that Gold’s deep, hot biosphere is not only true, but common across the universe. 

A term Gold coined in his 1999 book carries forward, too, and is a reminder of the worldview shift he advocated. The term is &quot;surface chauvinism&quot;. Gold wrote, &quot;In retrospect, it is not hard to understand why the scientific community has typically sought only &quot;surface&quot; life in the heavens. Scientists have been hindered by a sort of &#x27;surface chauvinism.&#x27;&quot; In 2024 NASA launched the first spacecraft, Europa Clipper, to study and sample whether one of the moons of an outer planet that Gold had pointed to as a prospect for deep life (Europa, a moon of Jupiter) might indeed harbor the physical and chemical conditions essential for carbon-based life.

==Academic legacy==

Throughout his academic career, Gold received a number of honors and distinctions. He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (1948), the Royal Society (1964), the American Geophysical Union (1962), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1974), and the American Astronautical Society, a member of the American Philosophical Society (1972), the United States National Academy of Sciences (1974) and the International Academy of Astronautics, and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (1986). In addition, he served as President of the New York Astronomical Society from 1981 to 1986. Gold won the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1972 for his paper &quot;The Nature of the Lunar Surface: Recent Evidence&quot; and the Humboldt Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 1979. In 1985, Gold won the prestigious Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, an award whose recipients include Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi, Martin Ryle, Edwin Hubble, James Van Allen, Fritz Zwicky, Hannes Alfvén and Albert Einstein. Gold did not earn a doctorate, but received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Cambridge University in 1969.

Following his death in 2004, obituaries laying out the breadth of his scientific inquiries appeared in a number of scientific journals. In the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, Hermann Bondi wrote &quot;Tommy Gold will long be remembered as a singular scientist who stepped into any field where he thought an option was being overlooked. He was also unusual in working mainly theoretically, but using little mathematics, relying instead on his profound intuitive understanding of physics.&quot; The obituary in &quot;Physics Today&quot; included a listing of topics he delved into: &quot;the alignment of galactic dust, the instability of Earth’s axis of rotation, the dusty lunar surface, the Sun&#x27;s cosmic rays, and plasmas and magnetic fields in the solar system ... the origin of solar flares, the nature of time, molecules and masers in the interstellar medium, rotating neutron stars and the nature of pulsars, terrestrial sources of hydrocarbons, and the deep Earth biosphere.&quot;

Gold&#x27;s boldness in his approach is another aspect of his legacy. The obituary in the &quot;Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society&quot; called attention to his being &quot;regarded by some as a scientific maverick who delighted in controversy. In reality, he was an iconoclast whose strength was in penetrating analysis of the assumptions on which some of our most important theories are based... Tommy&#x27;s paradigm-changing ideas in astronomy and planetary science, while original and bold, were also highly controversial. With his radical work on the origin of natural gas and petroleum, the controversy is likely to continue... He will be remembered as one of the most interesting, dynamic and influential scientists of his generation.&quot; The obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Gold would &quot;dive into new territory to open up problems unseen by others — in biophysics, astrophysics, space engineering, or geophysics. Controversy followed him everywhere. Possessing profound scientific intuition and open-minded rigour, he usually ended up challenging the cherished assumptions of others and, to the discomfiture of the scientific establishment, often found them wanting. His stature and influence were international.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gold married his first wife, Merle Eleanor Tuberg, an American astrophysicist who had worked with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, in Cambridge in 1947. He had three daughters with her – Linda, Lucy, and Tanya. After divorcing her, Gold married Carvel Lee Beyer in 1972. With her, he had a daughter Lauren.

Thomas Gold died at the age of 84 from complications due to heart disease, at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, New York. He was buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Ithaca. He was survived by his wife, four daughters, and six grandchildren.

<text>The Amstrad PCW series is a range of personal computers produced by British company Amstrad from 1985 to 1998, and also sold under licence in Europe as the &quot;Joyce&quot; by the German electronics company Schneider in the early years of the series&#x27; life. The PCW, short for &quot;Personal Computer Word-processor&quot;, was targeted at the word processing and home office markets. When it was launched the cost of a PCW system was under 25% of the cost of almost all IBM-compatible PC systems in the UK, and as a result the machine was very popular both in the UK and in Europe, persuading many technophobes to venture into using computers. The series is reported to have sold 8 million units. However the last two models, introduced in the mid-1990s, were commercial failures, being squeezed out of the market by the falling prices, greater capabilities and wider range of software for IBM-compatible PCs.

The series consists of PCW 8256 and PCW 8512 (introduced in 1985), PCW 9512 (introduced in 1987), PCW 9256 (introduced in 1991), PCW 10 and PcW16 (introduced in 1995).

In all models, the monitor&#x27;s casing included the CPU, RAM, floppy disk drives and power supply for all of the systems&#x27; components. All models except the last included a printer in the price. Early models used 3-inch floppy disks, while those sold from 1991 onwards used 3½-inch floppies, which became the industry standard around the time the PCW series was launched. A variety of inexpensive products and services were launched to copy 3-inch floppies to the 3½-inch format so that data could be transferred to other machines.

All models used a Z80 CPU, running at 4 MHz in earlier models and higher speeds in later models. RAM was 256 KB or 512 KB, depending on the model.

All models except the last included the Locoscript word processing program, the CP/M Plus operating system, Mallard BASIC and the Logo programming language at no extra cost. The last model (PcW16) used a custom GUI operating system.

A wide range of other CP/M office software and several games became available, some commercially produced and some free. Although Amstrad supplied all but the last model as text based systems, graphical user interface peripherals and the supporting software also became available. The last model had its own unique GUI operating system and set of office applications, which were included in the price. However, none of the software for previous PCW models could run on this system.

==Development and launch==
In 1984, Tandy Corporation executive Steve Leininger, designer of the TRS-80 Model I, admitted that &quot;as an industry we haven&#x27;t found any compelling reason to buy a computer for the home&quot; other than for word processing. Amstrad&#x27;s founder Alan Sugar realised that most computers in the United Kingdom were used for word processing at home, and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the Far East. This design featured a single &quot;box&quot; containing all the components, including a portrait-oriented display, which would be more convenient for displaying documents than the usual landscape orientation. However the portrait display was quickly eliminated because it would have been too expensive, and the printer also became a separate unit. To reduce the cost of the printer, Amstrad commissioned an ASIC (custom circuit) from MEJ Electronics, which had developed the hardware for Amstrad&#x27;s earlier CPC-464. Two other veterans of the CPC-464&#x27;s creation played important roles, with Roland Perry managing the PCW project and Locomotive Software producing the Locoscript word processing program and other software. The CP/M operating system was added at the last minute. During development the PCW 8256 / 8512 project was code-named &quot;Joyce&quot; after Sugar&#x27;s secretary.

For the launch the product name &quot;Zircon&quot; was jointly suggested by MEJ Electronics and Locomotive Software, as both companies had been spun off from Data Recall, which had produced a word processing system called &quot;Diamond&quot; in the 1970s. Sugar, preferring a more descriptive name, suggested &quot;WPC&quot; standing for &quot;Word Processing Computer&quot;, but Perry pointed out that this invited jokes about Women Police Constables. Sugar reshuffled the initials and the product was launched as the &quot;Personal Computer Word-processor&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;PCW&quot;. The advertising campaign featured trucks unloading typewriters to form huge scrap heaps, with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s more than a word processor for less than most typewriters&quot;. In Britain the system was initially sold exclusively through Dixons, whose chairman shared Sugar&#x27;s dream that computers would cease to be exclusive products for the technologically adept and would become consumer products.

==Impact on the computer market==
In 1986, John Whitehead described the Amstrad PCW as &quot;the bargain of the decade&quot;, and technology writer Gordon Laing said in 2007, &quot;It represented fantastic value at a time when an IBM compatible or a Mac would cost a comparative fortune.&quot; At its United Kingdom launch in September 1985, the basic PCW model was priced at £399 plus value added tax, which included a printer, word processor program, the CP/M operating system and associated utilities, and a BASIC interpreter. Software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available, including accounting, spreadsheet and database programs, so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business.

Shortly afterwards the Tandy 1000 was introduced in the UK with the MS-DOS operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other IBM-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in Britain. At the time the cheapest complete systems from Apricot Computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest IBM PC system cost £2,400. Although competitors&#x27; systems generally had more sophisticated features, including colour monitors, Whitehead thought the Amstrad PCW offered the best value for money.

In the US the PCW was launched at a price of $799, and its competitors were initially the Magnavox VideoWriter and Smith Corona PWP, two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen, keyboard and printer. The magazine &quot;Popular Science&quot; thought that the PCW could not compete as a general-purpose computer, because its use of non-standard 3-inch floppy disk drives and the rather old CP/M operating system would restrict the range of software available from expanding beyond the spreadsheet, typing tutor and cheque book balancing programs already on sale. However, the magazine predicted that the PCW&#x27;s large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets. The system was sold in the US via major stores, business equipment shops and electronics retailers.

The PCW redefined the idea of &quot;best value&quot; in computers by concentrating on reducing the price, which totally disrupted the personal computer market. The low price encouraged home users to trade up from simpler systems like the ZX Spectrum, whose sales had passed their peak. According to &quot;Personal Computer World&quot;, the PCW &quot;got the technophobes using computers&quot;. In the first two years over 700,000 PCWs were sold, gaining Amstrad 60% of the UK home computer market, and 20% of the European personal computer market, second only to IBM&#x27;s 33.3% share. Having gained credibility as computer supplier, Amstrad launched IBM-compatible PCs, once again focussing on low prices, with its PC1512 surpassing the IBM PC on performance and beating even the Taiwanese clones on price. Amstrad became the dominant British personal computer company, buying all the designs, marketing rights and product stocks of Sinclair Research Ltd&#x27;s computer division in April 1986, while Apricot later sold its manufacturing assets to Mitsubishi and became a software company.

In the PCW&#x27;s heyday the magazines &quot;8000 Plus&quot; (later called &quot;PCW Plus&quot;) and &quot;PCW Today&quot; were published specifically for PCW users. In addition to the usual product reviews and technical advice, they featured other content such as articles by science fiction writer and software developer Dave Langford on his experiences of using the PCW.

By 1989, units had been sold. When the PCW line was retired in 1998, 8 million machines had been sold. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the UK, and said that the reliability of the PCW&#x27;s hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity. Laing says the PCW line&#x27;s downfall was that &quot;proper PCs became affordable&quot;. IBM, Compaq and other vendors of more expensive computers had reduced prices drastically in an attempt to increase demand during the recession of the early 1990s. In 1993 the PCW still cost under £390 while a PC system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000. However, after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia IBM-compatible PC in 1997 was about 11% more than that of a PCW 8256 in 1985, and many home PCs were cast-offs, sometimes costing as little as £50, from large organisations that had upgraded their systems.

==Models and features==

===PCW 8256 and 8512===
The PCW 8256 was launched in September 1985, and had 256 KB of RAM and one floppy disk drive. Launched a few months later, the PCW 8512 had 512 KB of RAM and two floppy disk drives. Both systems consisted of three units: a printer; a keyboard; and a monochrome CRT monitor whose casing included the processor, memory, motherboard, one or two floppy disk drives, the power supply for all the units and the connectors for the printer and keyboard. The monitor displayed green characters on a black background. It measured diagonally, and showed 32 lines of 90 characters each. The designers preferred this to the usual personal computer display of 25 80-character lines, as the larger size would be more convenient for displaying a whole letter. The monitor could also display graphics well enough for the bundled graphics program and for some games.
The floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch &quot;compact floppy&quot; format, which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives. In the range&#x27;s early days supplies of 3-inch floppies occasionally ran out, but by 1988 the PCW&#x27;s popularity encouraged suppliers to compete for this market. There are several techniques for transferring data from a PCW to an IBM-compatible PC, some of which also can transfer in the opposite direction, and service companies that will do the job for a fee.
While all the 3-inch disks were double-sided, the PCW 8256&#x27;s 3-inch drive and the PCW 8512&#x27;s upper one were single-sided, while the 8512&#x27;s lower one was double-sided and double-density. Hence there were two types of disk: single-density, which could store 180 KB of data per side, equivalent to about 70 pages of text each; and double density, which could store twice as much per side. The double-density drive could read single-density disks, but it was inadvisable to write to them using this drive. Users of single-sided drives had to flip the disks over to use the full capacity.

The dot matrix printer had a sheet feed for short documents and a tractor attachment for long reports on continuous stationery. This unit could print 90 characters per second at draft quality and 20 characters per second at higher quality, and could also produce graphics. However it had only 9 printing pins and even its higher quality did not match that of 24-pin printers. The dot matrix printer was not very robust as its chassis was made entirely of plastic. Users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a daisy-wheel printer or graph plotter from Amstrad. The daisy-wheel printer could not produce graphics.

The keyboard had 82 keys, some of which were designed for word processing, especially with the bundled Locoscript software – for example to cut, copy, and paste. Non-English characters such as Greek could be typed by holding down the or key, along with the key if capitals were required. Other special key combinations activated caps lock, num lock and reboot.
A wide range of upgrades became available. The PCW 8256&#x27;s RAM could be expanded to 512 KB for a hardware cost of about £50. An additional internal floppy disk drive for the 8256 would cost about £100, and installation was fairly easy. Alternatively one could add external drives, for example if a 3½-inch drive was needed. Graphical user interface devices such as light pens, mice and graphic tablets could be attached to the expansion socket at the back of the monitor. Adding a serial interface connector, which cost about £50, made it possible to attach a modem or non-Amstrad printer.

The designs were licensed to the German consumer electronics company Schneider, which slightly modified their appearance and consequently sold them as &quot;Joyce&quot; and &quot;Joyce Plus&quot;. The partnership between Amstrad and Schneider had been formed to market the Amstrad CPC range of computers, and broke up when Amstrad launched the PCW9512.

===PCW 9512 and 9256===

The PCW 9512, introduced in 1987 at a price of £499 plus VAT, had a white-on-black screen instead of green-on-black, and the bundled printer was a daisy-wheel model instead of a dot-matrix printer. These models also had a parallel port, allowing non-Amstrad printers to be attached. The 9512 was also supplied with version 2 of the Locoscript word processor program which included spellchecker and mail merge facilities. In all other respects the 9512&#x27;s facilities were the same as the 8512&#x27;s.

In 1991 the 9512 was replaced by the PCW 9256 and 9512+, both equipped with a single 3½-inch disk drive that could access 720 KB. The 9512+ had 512 KB of RAM, and two printer options, the Amstrad daisy-wheel unit and a series of considerably more expensive Canon inkjet printers: initially the BJ10e, later the BJ10ex and finally the BJ10sx. The 9256 had 256 KB of RAM and the same dot matrix printer as the 8256 and 8512, as well as the older Locoscript version 1.

===PCW 10===
This was a PCW 9256 with 512 KB of RAM, a parallel printer port, and Locoscript 1.5 instead of Locoscript 1. The PCW 10 was not a success, and few were produced. By this time other systems offered much better print quality, and the PCW was a poor choice as a general-purpose computer, because of its slow CPU and incompatibility with MS-DOS systems.

===PcW16===
This model, whose display labelled it &quot;PcW16&quot;, was introduced in 1995 at a price of £299. Despite its name it was totally incompatible with all previous PCW systems. Instead of having two operating environments, Locoscript for word processing and CP/M for other uses, it had its own GUI operating system, known as &quot;Rosanne&quot;. This could only run one application at a time, and starting another application made the previous one save all the files it had changed and then close. The bundled word processor was produced by Creative Technology, and could read Locoscript files but saved them in its own format. The package also included a spreadsheet, address book, diary, calculator and file manager. Amstrad never provided other applications, and very little third-party software was written for the machine.

The display unit, which also contained the processor, motherboard and RAM, was the standard 640×480 pixels in size and worked in VGA mode. The PcW16 included a standard 1.4 MB floppy drive. While competitors included hard disk drives with capacities of a few hundred MB to a few GB, the PcW16 used a 1 MB flash memory to store the programs and user files. Like previous PCW models, the PcW16 used the 8-bit Zilog Z80 CPU, which first appeared in 1976, while other personal computers used 16-bit CPUs or the more recent 32-bit CPUs. The price included a mouse for use with the GUI, but did not include a printer.

In a May 1996 &quot;PCW Plus&quot; magazine article Dave Langford expressed a series of concerns about the PcW16: the operating system could not run the many CP/M programs available for previous PCW models; the flash RAM was too small for a large collection of programs, but programs could not be run from the floppy disk, which was designed for backing up files; and a second-hand IBM PC with Locoscript Pro looked like a more sensible upgrade path for users of earlier PCWs. Few PcW16s were sold.

==Software==
This section covers the PCW 8xxx, 9xxx and 10 series; software for the PcW16 is described above.

===Bundled===

====Locoscript word processor====
The word processing software Locoscript was included in the price of the hardware. The manual provided both a reference and a tutorial that could enable users to start work within 20 minutes, and some users found the tutorial provided as much information as they ever needed.

The program enabled users to divide documents into groups, display the groups on a disk and then the documents in the selected group, and set up a template for each group. The &quot;limbo file&quot; facility enabled users to recover accidentally deleted documents until the disk ran out of space, when the software would permanently delete files to make room for new ones.

Layout facilities included setting and using tab stops, production of page headers and footers, with automated page numbering; typographical effects including proportional spacing, a range of font sizes, and bold, italic and underline effects. The cut, copy and paste facility provided 10 paste buffers, each designated by a number, and these could be saved to a disk. The menu system had two layouts, one for beginners and the other for experienced users.

Locoscript supported 150 characters and, if used with the dot matrix printer, could print European letters including Greek and Cyrillic, as well as mathematical and technical symbols. The program allowed the user to work on one document while printing another, so that the relative slowness of the basic printer seldom caused difficulties. Locoscript did not run under the control of a standard operating system but booted directly from a floppy disk. Users had to reboot if they wanted to switch between Locoscript and a CP/M application, unless they used a utility called &quot;Flipper&quot;, which could allocate separate areas of RAM to Locoscript and CP/M.

Locoscript version 1, which was bundled with the PCW 8256 and 8512, had no spell checker or mail merge facilities. Version 2, which was bundled with the PCW 9512, included a spellchecker and could provide mail merge by interfacing to other products from Locomotive Software, such as LocoMail and LocoFile. Locoscript 2 also expanded the character set to 400.

====CP/M operating system and applications====
The PCW included a version of CP/M known as &quot;CP/M Plus&quot;. This provided a range of facilities comparable to those of MS-DOS, but imposed a significant limitation: it could not address more than 64 KB of RAM. Since CP/M took 3 KB of this, the most that CP/M applications could use was 61 KB. The rest of the RAM was used as a RAM disk (exposed under the drive letter &quot;M:&quot; for &quot;memory&quot;), which was much faster than a floppy disk but lost all its data when the machine was powered off. On the other hand, the standalone Locoscript word processor program was able to use 154 KB as normal memory, and the rest as a RAM disk.

Mallard BASIC, like LocoScript, was a Locomotive Software product, but ran under CP/M. This version of BASIC lacked built-in graphics facilities, but included JetSAM, an implementation of ISAM that supported multiple indexes per file, so that programs could access records directly by specifying values of key fields. The CP/M software bundle also included the Digital Research implementation of Seymour Papert&#x27;s LOGO programming language and a graphics program that could produce pie charts and bar charts.

===Sold separately===
Many software vendors supplied versions of their products to run with CP/M Plus, making a wide range of software available for the PCW, often very cheaply:
*Alternative word processors included Superwriter and WordStar.
*Several spreadsheet programs became available, including SuperCalc II and Microsoft&#x27;s Multiplan.
*Database programs adapted for the PCW included Sage Database, Cardbox and dBase II.
*The &quot;MicroDesign&quot;, &quot;Desk Top Publisher&quot;, &quot;Newsdesk&quot; and &quot;Stop Press&quot; desktop publishing packages were used by groups of authors for newsletters.
*The Sage Group&#x27;s Popular Accounts and Payroll, and the Camsoft payroll and accounting software.
*Other programming languages, including C.
*Many games for the PCW. Most were text adventures but there were also graphical games like &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Bounder&quot; and &quot;Head over Heels&quot;.

===Free software===
Many free packages could run under CP/M but required careful setting of options to run on the PCW series, although a significant number had installer programs that made this task easier. Programs that were already configured for the PCW covered a broad range of requirements including word processors, databases, graphics, personal accounts, programming languages, games, utilities and a full-featured bulletin board system. Many of these were at least as good as similar commercial offerings, but most had poor documentation.

==Technical design==
The PCW 8256, 8512, 9512, 9256 and 9512+ share a common architecture. Other than the Z80 CPU, the PcW16 does not share any hardware with the original PCW series and should be considered to be a completely different machine.

=== CPU ===
All PCW models, including the PcW16, used the Zilog Z80 range of CPUs. A 4 MHz Z80A was used in the 8256, 8512, 9512, 9256, 9512+ and PCW10; and a 16 MHz Z80 in the PCW16.

=== Memory ===
The Z80 could only access 64 KB of RAM at a time. Software could work around this by bank switching, accessing different banks of memory at different times but this made programming more complex and slowed the system down. The PCW divided the Z80 memory map into four 16 KB banks. In CP/M, the memory used for the display was switched out while programs were running, giving more than 60 KB of usable RAM. While the Joyce architecture was designed with configurations of 128 KB and 256 KB of RAM in mind, no PCW was ever sold with 128 KB of RAM.

Each PCW&#x27;s CP/M application could not use more than 64 KB so the system used the rest of the RAM for a RAM drive. On the other hand, the standalone Locoscript word processor program was reported as using up to 154 KB as normal memory and the rest as a RAM disk.

Unusually, the Z80 CPU in the PCW 8256, 8512, 9512, 9256 and 9512+ had no directly connected ROM, which most computers used to start the boot process. Instead, at startup, the ASIC (customised circuit) at the heart of the PCW provided access to part of the 1k ROM within the Intel 8041 microcontroller used to drive the printer. The Z80 would copy 256 bytes via the ASIC into RAM, providing sufficient instructions to load the first sector from a floppy. The ROM-based code cannot display text, being too small to support character generation; instead, it displays a bright screen which is progressively filled by black stripes as the code is loaded from the floppy.

=== Printer ===
To make the printer cheap enough to be included with every PCW, Amstrad placed the majority of its drive electronics inside the PCW cabinet. The printer case contained only electromechanical components and high-current driver electronics; its power was supplied via a coaxial power connector socket on the monitor casing, and rather than using a traditional parallel interface, pin and motor signals were connected directly by a 34-wire ribbon cable to an 8041 microcontroller on the PCW&#x27;s mainboard.

Most models of PCW were bundled with a 9-pin dot matrix printer mechanism, with the later 9512 and 9512+ models using a daisywheel (with a different cable; the printers were not interchangeable with the dot matrix models). These PCW printers could not, of course, be used on other computers, and the original PCW lacked a then-standard Centronics printer port. Instead, the Z80 bus and video signals were brought to an edge connector socket at the back of the cabinet. Many accessories including parallel and serial ports were produced for this interface. Some of the later models included a built-in parallel port; these could be bundled with either the dedicated Amstrad printer or a Canon Bubblejet model.

=== Video system ===
The PCWs were not designed to play video games, although some software authors considered this a minor detail, releasing games like &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, and &quot;Bounder&quot;. The PCW video system was not at all suited to games. In order that it be able to display a full 80-column page plus margins, the display&#x27;s addressable area was 90 columns and the display had 32 lines. The display was monochrome and bitmapped with a resolution of 720 by 256 pixels. At 1 bit per pixel, this occupied 23 KB of RAM which was far too large for the Z80 CPU to scroll in software without ripple and tearing of the display. Instead, the PCW implemented a Roller RAM consisting of a 512-byte area of RAM that held the address of each line of display data. The screen could now be scrolled either by changing the Roller RAM contents or by writing to an I/O port that set the starting point in Roller RAM for the screen data. This allowed for very rapid scrolling. The video system also fetched data in a special order designed so that plotting a character eight scan lines high would touch eight addresses. This meant that the Z80&#x27;s concise block copy instructions, such as LDIR, could be used. Unfortunately, it also meant that drawing lines and other shapes could be very complicated.

<doc id="156339" wikidata="Q5172458" url="?curid=156339" title="Corporate farming">
<text>Corporate farming is the practice of large-scale agriculture on farms owned or greatly influenced by large companies. This includes corporate ownership of farms and the sale of agricultural products, as well as the roles of these companies in influencing agricultural education, research, and public policy through funding initiatives and lobbying efforts.

The definition and effects of corporate farming on agriculture are widely debated, though sources that describe large businesses in agriculture as &quot;corporate farms&quot; may portray them negatively.

== Definitions and usage ==
The varied and fluid meanings of &quot;corporate farming&quot; have resulted in conflicting definitions of the term, with implications in particular for legal definitions.

=== Legal definitions ===
Most legal definitions of corporate farming in the United States pertain to tax laws, anti-corporate farming laws, and census data collection. These definitions mostly reference farm income, indicating farms over a certain threshold as corporate farms, as well as ownership of the farm, specifically targeting farms that do not pass ownership through family lines.

=== Common definitions ===
In public discourse, the term &quot;corporate farming&quot; lacks a firmly established definition and is variously applied. However, several features of the term&#x27;s usage frequently arise:

# It is largely used as a pejorative with strong negative connotations.
# It most commonly refers to corporations that are large-scale farms, market agricultural technologies (in particular pesticides, fertilizers, and GMO&#x27;s), have significant economic and political influence, or some combination of the three.
# It is usually used in opposition to family farms and new agricultural movements, such as sustainable agriculture and the local food movement.

==== Family farms ====

&quot;Family farm&quot; and &quot;corporate farm&quot; are often defined as mutually exclusive terms, with the two having different interests. This mostly stems from the widespread assumption that family farms are small farms while corporate farms are large-scale operations. While it is true that the majority of small farms are family owned, many large farms are also family businesses, including some of the largest farms in the US.

According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), a family farm &quot;is a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fisheries, pastoral and aquaculture production which is managed and operated by a family and predominantly reliant on family labour, both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s. The family and the farm are linked, coevolve and combine economic, environmental, reproductive, social and cultural functions.&quot;

Additionally, there are large economic and legal incentives for family farmers to incorporate their businesses.

==== Contract farming ====
Farming contracts are agreements between a farmer and a buyer that stipulates what the farmer will grow and how much they will grow usually in return for guaranteed purchase of the product or financial support in purchase of inputs (e.g. feed for livestock growers). In most instances of contract farming, the farm is family owned while the buyer is a larger corporation. This makes it difficult to distinguish the contract farmers from &quot;corporate farms,&quot; because they are family farms but with significant corporate influence. This subtle distinction left a loop-hole in many state laws that prohibited corporate farming, effectively allowing corporations to farm in these states as long as they contracted with local farm owners.

==== Non-farm entities ====

Many people also choose to include non-farming entities in their definitions of corporate farming. Beyond just the farm contractors mentioned above, these types of companies commonly considered part of the term include Cargill, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer among others. These corporations do not have production farms, meaning they do not produce a significant amount of farm products. However, their role in producing and selling agricultural supplies and their purchase and processing of farm products often leads to them being grouped with corporate farms. While this is technically incorrect, it is widely considered substantively accurate because including these companies in the term &quot;corporate farming&quot; is necessary to describe their real influence over agriculture.

===Arguments against corporate farming===
Family farms maintain traditions including environmental stewardship and taking longer views than companies seeking profits. Family farmers may have greater knowledge about soil and crop types, terrains, weather and other features specific to particular local areas of land can be passed from parent to child over generations, which would be harder for corporate managers to grasp.

== North America ==

In Canada, 17.4 percent of farms are owned by family corporations and 2.4 percent by non-family corporations. In Canada (as in some other jurisdictions) conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation can have tax planning benefits, and in some cases, the difference in combined provincial and federal taxation rates is substantial. Also, for farm families with significant off-farm income, incorporating the farm can provide some shelter from high personal income tax rates. Another important consideration can be some protection of the corporate shareholders from liability. Incorporating a family farm can also be useful as a succession tool, among other reasons because it can maintain a family farm as a viable operation where subdivision of the farm into smaller operations among heirs might result in farm sizes too small to be viable.

The 2012 US Census of Agriculture indicates that 5.06 percent of US farms are corporate farms. These include family corporations (4.51 percent) and non-family corporations (0.55 percent). Of the family farm corporations, 98 percent are small corporations, with 10 or fewer stockholders. Of the non-family farm corporations, 90 percent are small corporations, with 10 or fewer stockholders. Non-family corporate farms account for 1.36 percent of US farmland area. Family farms (including family corporate farms) account for 96.7 percent of US farms and 89 percent of US farmland area; a USDA study estimated that family farms accounted for 85 percent of US gross farm income in 2011. Other farmland in the US is accounted for by several other categories, including single proprietorships where the owner is not the farm operator, non-family partnerships, estates, trusts, cooperatives, collectives, institutional, research, experimental and American Indian Reservation farms.

In the US, the average size of a non-family corporate farm is 1078 acres, i.e. smaller than the average family corporate farm (1249 acres) and smaller than the average partnership farm (1131 acres).

=== US farm laws ===
To date, nine US states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit corporate farming. The first of these laws were enacted in the 1930s by Kansas and North Dakota respectively. In the 1970s, similar laws were passed in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin. In 1982, after failure to pass an anti–corporate farming law, the citizens of Nebraska enacted by initiative a similar amendment into their state constitution. The citizens of South Dakota similarly amended their state constitution in 1998.

All nine laws have similar content. They all restrict corporate ability to own and operate on farmland. They all outline exceptions for specific types of corporations. Generally, family farm corporations are exempted, although certain conditions may have to be fulfilled for such exemption (e.g. one or more of: shareholders within a specified degree of kinship owning a majority of voting stock, no shareholders other than natural persons, limited number of shareholders, at least one family member residing on the farm). However, the laws vary significantly in how they define a corporate farm, and in the specific restrictions. Definitions of a farm can include any and all farm operations, or be dependent on the source of income, as in Iowa, where 60 percent of income must come from farm products. Additionally, these laws can target a corporation&#x27;s use of the land, meaning that companies can own but not farm the land, or they may outright prohibit corporations from buying and owning farmland. The precise wording of these laws has significant impact on how corporations can participate in agriculture in these states with the ultimate goal of protecting and empowering the family farm.

==Europe==
Family farms across Europe are heavily protected by EU regulations, which have been driven in particular by French farmers and the French custom splitting land inheritance between children to produce many very small family farms. In regions such as East Anglia, UK, some agribusiness is practiced through company ownership, but most large UK land estates are still owned by wealthy families such as traditional aristocrats, as encouraged by favourable inheritance tax rules.

Most farming in the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc satellite states was collectivized. After the dissolution of those states via the revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, decades of decollectivization and land reform have occurred, with the details varying substantially by country.

==Asia==

=== Pakistan ===
As Pakistan&#x27;s population surged, it gradually turned from a net food exporter to a net food importer, straining Pakistan&#x27;s economy and food security. In response, the Pakistani military has led an initiative to set up corporate farming, a project called the Green Pakistan Initiative, and therefore drastically grow more essential food supplies for both sustenance and exports.

==Africa==
Corporate farming has begun to take hold in some African countries, where listed companies such as Zambeef, Zambia are operated by MBAs as large businesses. In some cases, this has caused debates about land ownership where shares have been bought by international investors, especially from China.

==Middle East==
Some oil-rich middle east countries operate corporate farming including large-scale irrigation of desert lands for cropping, sometimes through partially or fully state-owned companies, especially with regards to water resource management.

<text>Sonia Ann Johnson, (&quot;née&quot; Harris; born February 27, 1936) is an American feminist activist and writer. She was an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and in the late 1970s was publicly critical of the position of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), of which she was a member, against the proposed amendment. She was eventually excommunicated from the church for her activities. She went on to publish several radical feminist books, ran for president in 1984, and become a popular feminist speaker.

==Early life, education, and family==
Sonia Ann Harris, born in Malad, Idaho, was a fifth-generation Mormon. She attended Utah State University and married Rick Johnson following graduation. She earned a master&#x27;s degree and a Doctor of Education from Rutgers College. She was employed as a part-time teacher of English in universities both in the United States and abroad, following her husband to new places of employment. She had four children during these years. They returned to the United States in 1976.

In 1991, Johnson&#x27;s mother, Ida Harris, became worried about her daughter&#x27;s safety after hearing rumors of Sonia&#x27;s death and receiving telephone threats against her daughter. Taking the threats to heart, Ida moved to Sonia&#x27;s Wildfire Community in November 1991. Six months later, Ida passed away at the age of 86 with Sonia by her side. Ida was buried in Logan, Utah, but Sonia did not attend the funeral because she had promised her mother not to return to Utah.

==LDS Church and ERA==
Johnson began speaking out in support of the ERA in 1977 and with three other women, co-founded an organization called &quot;Mormons for ERA&quot;. National exposure occurred with her 1978 testimony in front of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, and she continued speaking and promoting the ERA and denouncing the LDS Church&#x27;s opposition to the amendment. Faith-based feminist Joan M. Martin also testified during this committee hearing.

The LDS Church began disciplinary proceedings against Johnson after she delivered a scathing speech entitled &quot;Patriarchal Panic: Sexual Politics in the Mormon Church&quot; at a meeting of the American Psychological Association (APA) in New York City in September 1979. Johnson denounced as immoral and illegal the LDS Church&#x27;s nationwide lobbying efforts to prevent passage of the ERA.

Because the speech drew national media attention, leaders in Johnson&#x27;s local Virginia congregation, including stake president Earl J. Roueche, immediately began excommunication proceedings. A December 1979 excommunication letter stated that Johnson was charged with a variety of misdeeds, including hindering the worldwide missionary program, damaging internal church social programs, and teaching false doctrine. Her husband divorced her in October 1979, two months before the proceeding. She attributed his decision to &quot;some kind of mid-life crisis.&quot;

After her break with the church, Johnson continued promoting the ERA, speaking on television and at numerous functions throughout the country, including the 1980 Democratic National Convention. She also protested venues such as the Republican Party headquarters in Washington, D.C. She and twenty ERA supporters were briefly jailed for chaining themselves to the gate of the Seattle Washington Temple in Bellevue, Washington.

In the summer of 1982, Johnson led seven other women from around the country in a dramatic public hunger strike in Springfield, Illinois. The group targeted Illinois because it was the only Northern industrial state that hadn&#x27;t ratified the ERA. During the Women Hunger for Justice fast, the feminist activists kept daily vigils in the rotunda of the capitol, but the amendment eventually failed in the Illinois House on June 22. The group broke its 37-day, water-only fast with a round of grape juice. In the 1980s, she was also affiliated with the feminist group known as A Group of Women.

==Citizens Party presidential candidate==
Johnson ran in the 1984 presidential election, as the candidate of the U.S. Citizens Party, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Consumer Party, and California&#x27;s Peace and Freedom Party. Johnson received 72,161 votes (0.08%) finishing fifth. Her running mate for the Citizens Party was Richard Walton and for the Peace and Freedom Party Emma Wong Mar. Mark Dunlea, assistant campaign manager for her campaign, later wrote a book about a fictional female American president, &quot;Madame President: The Unauthorized Biography of the First Green Party President&quot;.

Johnson also founded Wildfire, a short-lived separatist commune for women that disbanded in 1993. She published several of her later books under the imprint &quot;Wildfire Books.&quot;

==Publications and personal views==
Johnson became increasingly radicalized, especially against state power, as reflected in the books she published after 1987. They include:
*&quot;From Housewife to Heretic&quot; (Doubleday, 1981)
*&quot;Telling the Truth&quot; (pamphlet, Crossing Press, 1987)
*&quot;Going Out of Our Minds: The Metaphysics of Liberation&quot; (Crossing Press, 1987)
*&quot;Wildfire: Igniting the She/Volution&quot; (Wildfire Books, 1990)
*&quot;The Ship that Sailed Into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Reconsidered&quot; (Wildfire Books, 1991)
*&quot;Out of This World: A Fictionalized True-Life Adventure&quot; (Wildfire Books, 1993)
*&quot;The SisterWitch Conspiracy&quot; (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2010)

In &quot;Going Out of Our Minds&quot; Johnson details the personal and political experiences that turned her against the state, including her run for the Presidency. In the book she rejects the Equal Rights Amendment, the Supreme Court&#x27;s Roe v. Wade decision, equal opportunity laws, and other government benefits because she considers them cooptation by patriarchy.

In &quot;Wildfire&quot; Johnson elaborates on her beliefs and answers her many critics in and out of the feminist movement. Her bottom line argument is that state violence is male violence and that women relate to the male-dominated state much as women relate to battering husbands who alternately abuse and reward their wives to keep them under control. She compares both relationships to the Stockholm syndrome in which hostages develop an emotional attachment to their captors.

In chapter three of &quot;Wildfire&quot;, entitled &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; Johnson writes: &quot;I have heard women involved in male politics say about our political system almost the same words I have heard battered women use about their abusers: &#x27;Of course our government isn&#x27;t perfect, but where is there a better one? With all its faults, it is still the best system (husband) in the world.&#x27; Like a battered wife, they never think to ask the really relevant questions: who said we needed a husband, or a husband-state, at all?&quot;

During this time Johnson also declared herself a lesbian and began a relationship with a woman. After ending that relationship, she wrote in &quot;The Ship that Sailed Into the Living Room&quot; that even relationships between female couples are a dangerous patriarchal trap, because &quot;two is the ideal number for inequality, for sadism, for the reproduction of patriarchy&quot;, and that relationships are &quot;slave Ships&quot; (a concept from which she derived the title of the book).

&quot;Nearly four years after I began my rebellion against relation/sex/slave Ships,&quot; she wrote, &quot;experience and my Wise Old Woman are telling me that sex as we know it is a patriarchal construct and &quot;has&quot; no rightful, natural place in our lives, no authentic function or ways. Synonymous with hierarchy/control, sex is engineered as part of the siege against our wholeness and power.&quot;

In the self-published &quot;The SisterWitch Conspiracy&quot;, Johnson imagines a world in which men do not exist at all, inspired by her belief that &quot;as long as men were on the planet, neither peace nor justice would ever be possible.&quot;

==Personal life==
As of 2007, Johnson lived in New Mexico with partner Jade DeForest, where they ran &quot;Casa Feminista&quot;, a hotel catering to feminist women. She was also a featured speaker at the 2007 &quot;Feminist Hullabaloo&quot; activist gathering.

The couple now resides in Tucson, Arizona.

By 1992, Johnson had stopped identifying as a lesbian. In January 2019, Johnson clarified that she was &quot;disillusioned&quot; about men, but &quot;had never had sexual feelings for women.&quot; Nonetheless, she has made the choice to dedicate her attention to women because she finds men to be &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;not as wonderful as women.&quot;

<doc id="156348" wikidata="Q1503325" url="?curid=156348" title="Basic Laws of Sweden">
<text>The Basic Laws of Sweden () are the four constitutional laws of the Kingdom of Sweden that regulate the Swedish political system, acting in a similar manner to the constitutions of most countries.

These four laws are: the Instrument of Government (), the Freedom of the Press Act (), the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression () and the Act of Succession (). Together, they constitute a basic framework that stands above other laws and regulation, and also define which agreements are themselves above normal Swedish law.

The Parliament Act () is usually considered to be halfway between a fundamental law and a normal law, with certain main chapters afforded similar protections as the fundamental laws while other additional chapters require only a simple parliamentary majority in order to be amended.

To amend or to revise a fundamental law, the Riksdag needs to approve the changes twice in two successive terms with simple majorities, with a general election having been held in between. The first vote can be supplemented with a referendum.

==Instrument of Government==
The most important of the fundamental laws is the Instrument of Government (). It sets out the basic principles for political life in Sweden defining rights and freedoms.

The 1974 Instrument of Government grants the power to commission a prime minister to the Riksdag, at the nomination of the Speaker of the Riksdag, who following a vote in the Riksdag signs the letter of commission on behalf of the Riksdag. The prime minister is appointed when the majority of the Riksdag does not vote against the nominee, thus making it possible to form minority governments. The prime minister appoints members of the government, including heads of ministries. The government collectively decides on issues after hearing the report of the head of the ministry concerned. At least five members of the government need to be present for a decisional quorum to be made. In practice, reports are written and discussions very rare during formal cabinet meetings.

Constitutional functions for the head of state, i.e., the monarch, include heading the cabinet councils (the king plus the members of the government), heading the Council on Foreign Affairs, recognizing new cabinets (in the Council of State), and opening the annual session of the Riksdag. The monarch is to be continually briefed on governmental issues—in the Council of State or directly by the prime minister.

The first constitutional Instrument of Government was enacted in 1719, marking the transition from autocracy to parliamentarism. Sweden&#x27;s bloodless coup d&#x27;état of 1772 was legitimized by the Riksdag of the Estates in new versions of the Instrument of Government, Swedish Constitution of 1772 and the Union and Security Act from 1789, making the king a &quot;constitutional autocrat&quot;. When the ancient Swedish land in 1809 was split into two parts, and the Grand Duchy of Finland was created as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, this constitutional autocracy was not formally abolished or replaced. Finland gained independence as a republic in 1917, and its parliament used the Swedish Constitution of 1772 as legal basis to operate until the country adopted its new constitution in 1919.

In Sweden, the loss of virtually half the realm led to another bloodless revolution, a new royal dynasty, and the Instrument of Government of 6 June 1809 (as well as a new Freedom of Press Act and Act of Succession). The new Instrument of Government established a separation of powers between the executive branch (the king) and the legislative branch (the Riksdag of the Estates) and gave the king and the Riksdag of the Estates joint power over legislation, with the king still playing a central role in government but no longer independently of the Privy Council. The king was free to choose councillors, but was bound to decide on governmental matters only in presence of the Privy Council, or a subset thereof, and after report of the councillor responsible for the matter in question. The councillor had to countersign a royal decision, unless it was unconstitutional, whereby it gained legal force. The councillor was legally responsible for his advice and was obliged to note his dissension in case he did not agree with the king&#x27;s decision. This constitution placed considerable &quot;de jure&quot; power in the king, but it was increasingly exercised in accordance with his councillors&#x27; advice. From 1917, the king adhered to principles of parliamentarism by choosing councillors possessing direct or indirect support from a majority of the Riksdag.

After over fifty years of &quot;de facto&quot; parliamentarism, it was written into the Instrument of Government of 1974, which, although technically adherent to constitutional monarchy, created the Government of Sweden in its present constitutional form.

===Amendment of 2009===
In 2009, the Riksdag approved Proposition 2009/10:80, &quot;A Reformed Constitution&quot; (), making substantial amendments to the Instrument of Government, and related acts.

The amendment modernized and simplified the text in general, and strengthened several fundamental rights and freedoms. Protection against unfair discrimination was extended to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The amendment affirmed the responsibility of public authorities to protect children&#x27;s rights, and to promote the preservation and development of ethnic minorities&#x27; culture and language, making special mention of the Sami people. It also strengthens judicial powers to make it easier to determine whether new laws contravene the constitution or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

These amendments took effect on 1 January 2011.

==Freedom of the press and freedom of expression==

The other two acts define the freedom of the press and other forms of expression. They are separated into two separate laws mainly to maintain the tradition of the Freedom of the Press Act from 1766, largely the work of proto-Liberal Cap Party politician Anders Chydenius, which abolished censorship and restricted limitations to retroactive legal measures for criticism of the Lutheran state church and the royal house exclusively.

The Freedom of the Press Act () was changed several times since its first incarnation; following Gustav III&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in 1772, the Act was amended in order to curtail freedom of the press, but restored in 1810 following the overthrow of his son, and later amended to ensure this fact in 1812, 1949 and 1982. The option to revoke publishing licenses was retained until the late rule of Charles XIV John and used widely against Liberal papers such as &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, which saw its license revoked ten times in 1838 alone. Publisher Lars Johan Hierta solved this by adding a different numeral to the name &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, thus publishing a formally different newspaper. The right to revoke was finally abolished in 1844. The 1766 Act held for example that freedom of expression was to be uninhibited, except for &quot;violations&quot;, which included blasphemy and criticism of the state.

The () of 1991 is a lengthier document defining freedom of expression in all media except for written books and magazines (such as radio, television, the Internet, etc.)

===Principle of Public Access===
In the 18th century, after over 40 years of mixed experiences with parliamentarism, public access to public documents was one of the main issues with the Freedom of the Press Act of 1766. Although the novelty was put out of order 1772–1809, it has since remained central in the Swedish mindset, seen as a forceful means against corruption and government agencies&#x27; unequal treatment of the citizens, increasing the perceived legitimacy of (local and central) government and politicians. The Principle of Public Access (), as the collection of rules is commonly referred to, provides that all information and documents created or received by a &quot;public authority&quot; (local or central government, and all publicly operated establishments) must be available to all members of the public. It also states that all public authorities must provide information promptly (&quot;skyndsamt&quot;) upon request.

Exemptions from the right to access to public documents are defined in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (&quot;Offentlighets- och sekretesslagen&quot;) which succeeded the Secrecy Act (&quot;Sekretesslagen&quot;) in 2009. The act details which information government agencies can keep secret, under what circumstances, and towards whom. According to the Chapter 2, Article 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act: &quot;The right of access to official documents may be restricted only if restriction is necessary having regard to
* the security of the Realm or its relations with a foreign state or an international organization;
* the central finance policy, monetary policy, or foreign exchange policy of the Realm;
* the inspection, control or other supervisory activities of a public authority;
* the interest of preventing or prosecuting crime;
* the public economic interest;
* the protection of the personal integrity or economic conditions of private subjects;
* the preservation of animal or plant species.&quot;
This list is exhaustive and the Parliament may not legislate about restrictions outside the scope of this list, and any restrictions have to be legislated into the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act previously mentioned.

Secrecy is limited to a maximum time of 70 years (when relating to individuals that is 70 years after the person&#x27;s death).

==Act of Succession==
Sweden&#x27;s switch from elective to hereditary monarchy in 1544 gave reason to Sweden&#x27;s first law of constitutional character, in form of a treaty between the royal dynasty and the realm represented by the four Estates to be valid for all times.

Accordingly, the current 1810 Act of Succession () is a treaty between the old Riksdag of the Estates and the House of Bernadotte regulating the right to accede to the Swedish throne. In 1980, the old principle of agnatic primogeniture, which meant that the throne was inherited by the eldest male child of the preceding monarch, was replaced by the principle of absolute primogeniture. This meant that the throne will be inherited by the eldest child without regard to sex. Thereby Princess Victoria, the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, was created heiress apparent to the Swedish throne over her younger brother, until then Crown Prince Carl Philip.

==Former Lutheran state church==

In 1593, after 70 years of Reformation and Counter-Reformation in Sweden, adherence to the Augsburg confession was decided and given constitutional status at the Synod of Uppsala (). References to Uppsala Synod have since then been worked into the fundamental laws, notably the Act of Succession.

In 2000, the Church was separated from the state and became an independent organization, but the ruling body of the church is still decided by public voting (among members of the church), and mostly consists of the political parties. The Church of Sweden is often classified as a semi-state church. This is because of its formal separation from the state but its lasting ties with official Sweden, most notably the Riksdag and the monarch. The Church of Sweden is also the only religious organization regulated by its own law, the Church of Sweden Act, which stipulates that the Church of Sweden has to be a democratic, Lutheran, Folk church. As a result of the separation, people born in Sweden where the parents are members of the Church of Sweden since 2000 no longer become members of the church automatically at birth.

==Amendments==
Amendments of the fundamental laws must be adopted twice by the Riksdag with a simple majority of the votes cast, with intervening elections. Within 15 days of an amendment&#x27;s first enactment, at least one-tenth of all MPs may bring a motion for a referendum which must be supported by at least one-third of all MPs. The referendum is held simultaneously with Riksdag elections and the amendment is deemed rejected if a simple majority of voters reject it, provided the majority is a majority of all valid votes. If the people do not dismiss a change, it still has to be ratified by the newly elected Riksdag. Such a referendum has never been used.

<text>The Hatch Act of 1887 (ch. 314, , enacted 1887-03-02, et seq.) gave federal funds, initially $15,000 each, to state land-grant colleges in order to create a series of agricultural experiment stations, as well as pass along new information, especially in the areas of soil minerals and plant growth. The bill was named for Congressman William Hatch, who chaired the House Committee of Agriculture at the time the bill was introduced. State agricultural stations created under this act were usually connected with those land-grant state colleges and universities founded under the Morrill Act of 1862, with few exceptions.

Many stations founded under the Hatch Act later became the foundations for state cooperative extension services under the Smith–Lever Act of 1914.

Congress amended the act in 1955 to add a formula that uses rural and farm population factors to allocate the annual appropriation for agricultural experiment stations among the states. Under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107–171, Sec. 7212), states will continue to be required to provide at least 100% matching funds (traditionally, most states have provided more). On average, Hatch Act formula funds constitute 10% of total funding for each experiment station. (7 U.S.C. 361a et seq.).

<doc id="156353" wikidata="Q7545704" url="?curid=156353" title="Smith–Lever Act of 1914">
<text>The Smith–Lever Act of 1914 is a United States federal law that established a system of cooperative extension services, connected to land-grant universities, intended to inform citizens about current developments in agriculture, home economics, public policy/government, leadership, 4-H, economic development, coastal issues (National Sea Grant College Program), and related subjects. The Act helped farmers learn new agricultural techniques by the introduction of home instruction.

The budgeting appropriation for cooperative extension is shared between the states based on an established formula. Once the historic amount that has been allocated for &quot;special needs&quot; programs is set aside and an additional 4% is reserved for USDA administrative costs, the remaining funds are allocated:
* 20% shared by all States in equal proportions;
* 40% shared in the proportion that the rural population of each bears to the total rural population of the several States as determined by the census;
* 40% shared in the proportion that the farm population of each bears to the total farm population of the several States as determined by the census.

Except for the &quot;1994 Land-grant colleges&quot; for Native Americans, each state must match its Federal cooperative extension funds.

In addition, an amount no less than 6% of the total Smith-Lever Act appropriation is allocated for the extension programs of the &quot;1890 Land-grant colleges&quot; (historically black colleges). These funds are also shared between the 1890 colleges by the 20/40/40% formula, with Alabama A&amp;M and Tuskegee University treated as though they were in different states.

In 1964, a US stamp was issued honoring homemakers for the 50th anniversary of the Smith–Lever Act.

<text>The 1932 Winter Olympics, officially known as the III Olympic Winter Games and commonly known as Lake Placid 1932, were a winter multi-sport event in the United States, held in Lake Placid, New York, United States. The games opened on February 4 and closed on February 13. It was the first time the Winter Games were held outside of Europe and the first of four Winter Olympics held in the United States; Lake Placid hosted again in 1980.

The games were awarded to Lake Placid in part by the efforts of Godfrey Dewey, head of the Lake Placid Club and son of Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal System. California also had a bid for the 1932 Winter Games. William May Garland, president of the California X Olympiad Association, wanted the games to take place in Wrightwood and Big Pines, California. The world&#x27;s largest ski jump at the time was constructed in Big Pines for the event, but the games were ultimately awarded to Lake Placid.

The practice of awarding Olympic medals at podium ceremonies was established at the 1932 Winter Olympics, based on pedestals used at the 1930 British Empire Games, as proposed by Melville Marks Robinson.

==Highlights==
* American company Coca-Cola became the official provider of that games&#x27; soft drinks and would remain so for all subsequent winter Olympics (as of 2024).
* The Games were opened by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Governor of New York. He would be elected President of the United States nine months later.
* The victory podium was used for the first time at the winter games. Speed skater Jack Shea became the first Olympic champion to receive a gold medal on the podium. 
* Billy Fiske (who would win his second gold medal at Lake Placid, having won his first at 16 in the 1928 Winter Olympics), carried the flag for the United States in the opening ceremonies. A planner of a winter resort in Aspen, Colorado, he was killed in 1940 flying in the Battle of Britain.
* Sonja Henie won the second of three consecutive Olympic gold medals in figure skating. She also won gold in 1928 and 1936.
* Irving Jaffee won the and the speed skating gold medals, beating previous champion and world record holder Ivar Ballangrud in the 10,000 m by .
* Eddie Eagan became the only Olympian to win gold medals at both the summer and winter games in different sports. He won gold in boxing in the 1920 Antwerp summer games and gold in bobsleigh at Lake Placid. The bobsleigh race was held two days after the games&#x27; closing ceremonies due to unseasonably warm weather in the region the week prior. 
*Georg Gyssling, a member of the Nazi Party, joined a newly created four man bobsledding team after half the German team was injured in several violent crashes on Mount Van Hoevenberg. René Fonjallaz, a future Nazi propagandist on the Swiss team, was also injured and left unconscious for five minutes after a crash during a practice run.
* The United States topped the medal count with a total of 12 medals (6 gold, 4 silver, and 2 bronze). This was the only time the U.S. led the overall medal standings at the Winter Olympics until the 2010 Games in Vancouver, and the only time the United States won the most gold medals.
* Seventeen countries participated.

==Events==
Medals were awarded in 14 events contested in 4 sports (7 disciplines).

<text>The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) was established in 1972 to represent the interests of the newly developed tribal colleges, which are controlled and operated by American Indian nations. The four founders were Gerald One Feather of the Oglala Sioux Community College (now Oglala Lakota College), David Reisling of D–Q University, Pat Locke of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), and Helen Schierbeck of the United States Office of Education (USOE). They organized the initial meeting and brought together all who wanted to form such a national organization. One of the most significant achievements of AIHEC was to work with the United States Congress to authorize in 1994 land-grant status to 29 tribal colleges, achieved in October 1994 under the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act.

As a result, AIHEC is eligible to have a representative participate in the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges&#x27; Council of Presidents. With administrative headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. AIHEC&#x27;s membership consists of 36 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) in the United States and one in Canada, whose first tribal college achieved independent status in 1995. The presidents jointly govern AIHEC from the member institutions. The organization offers technical assistance to its member colleges and develops institutions, and leads efforts to promote the Tribal College Movement.

In 1989, AIHEC established the American Indian College Fund (AICF) to raise scholarship funds for American Indian students at qualified tribal colleges and universities.

==Mission statement==
The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), since 1972, has been the collective spirit and voice of our nation’s Tribal Colleges and Universities, advocating on behalf of individual institutions of higher education that are defined and controlled by their respective tribal nations. AIHEC’s mission is to nurture, advocate, and protect American Indian history, culture, art, and language, and the legal and human rights of American Indian people to their sense of identity and heritage through:

# Assisting Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in maintaining standards of high-quality education, developing an accrediting body for American Indian-serving post-secondary institutions, and reaching out to other national education organizations;
# Promoting and advocating for the development of new TCUs;
# Promoting policy, legislation, and regulations at the national level to strengthen American Indian higher education and advocating for TCUs in Congress and with the federal government;
# Providing technical assistance to member institutions;
# Promoting public and private opportunities for TCUs in areas critical to success in the 21st century, including science and information technology, agriculture and natural resources use, pre-kindergarten through grade-12 linkages, international outreach, and leadership development.

==Strategic goals==
* Sustainability: sustain Tribal Colleges and Universities and the Tribal College Movement.
* Performance accountability: provide technical assistance, standards, and processes necessary for TCUs to be accountable to premier higher education centers within their communities. 
* Student engagement: improve the capacity of TCUs to provide high-quality, culturally relevant, and integrated higher education. 
* Strengthening communities: assist TCUs in improving their capacity to serve their students, individuals, families, and extended families.

<doc id="156363" wikidata="Q1771622" url="?curid=156363" title="Modern Orthodox Judaism">
<text>Modern Orthodox Judaism (also Modern Orthodox or Modern Orthodoxy) is a movement within Orthodox Judaism that attempts to synthesize Jewish values and the observance of Jewish law with the modern world.
Modern Orthodoxy draws on several teachings and philosophies, and thus assumes various forms. In the United States, and generally in the Western world, &quot;Centrist Orthodoxy&quot; underpinned by the philosophy of &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; (&quot;Torah and secular knowledge&quot;) is prevalent. In Israel, Modern Orthodoxy is dominated by Religious Zionism; however, although not identical, these movements share many of the same values and many of the same adherents.

==Modern Orthodoxy==
Modern Orthodoxy comprises a fairly broad spectrum of movements; each movement draws upon several distinct, though related, philosophies, which (in some combination) provide the basis for all variations of the movement today.

===Characteristics===

In general, Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s &quot;overall approach ... is the belief that one can and should be a full member of modern society, accepting the risks to remaining observant, because the benefits outweigh those risks&quot;. Jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to foster goodness and justice within both themselves and the larger community, such as by avoiding sin in their personal lives while also caring for the unfortunate.

Thus, Modern Orthodoxy holds that Jewish law is normative and binding, while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with the modern world. In this view, as expressed by Rabbi Saul Berman, Orthodox Judaism can &quot;be enriched&quot; by its intersection with modernity; further, &quot;modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the Divine work of transforming the world to benefit humanity&quot;. At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of halakha, any area of &quot;powerful inconsistency and conflict&quot; between Torah and modern culture must be filtered out.

Modern Orthodoxy also assigns a central role to the &quot;People of Israel&quot;. Here two characteristics are manifest: in general, Modern Orthodoxy places a high national, as well as religious, significance on the State of Israel, and institutions and individuals are, typically, Zionist in orientation; relatedly, involvement with non-orthodox Jews will extend beyond &quot;outreach&quot; to include institutional relations and cooperation; see further under &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;.

Other &quot;core beliefs&quot; are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies, a commitment to equality of education for both men and women, and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one&#x27;s family.

===Ideological spectrum===

The specific expression of Modern Orthodoxy, however, takes many forms, and particularly over the past 30–40 years, describes a political spectrum. Among the issues have been the extent to which Modern Orthodoxy should cooperate with the more liberal denominations, support secular academic pursuits combined with religious learning, and embrace efforts to give women a larger role in Jewish learning and worship; the acceptability of modern textual criticism as a tool for Torah study is also debated.

To the ideological right, the line between Haredi and Modern Orthodox has blurred in recent years; some have referred to this trend as &quot;haredization&quot;. In addition to increasing stringency in adherence to Halakha, many Modern Orthodox Jews express a growing sense of distance from the larger, secular culture. (&quot;Western civilisation has moved from what was once called the Judeo-Christian ethic to a consumer-driven, choice-fixated culture... Such a world is not &quot;chol&quot;, but &quot;chiloni&quot;, not secular, but secularist. It is impermeable to the values of &quot;kedushah&quot;.&quot;) Here, &quot;the balance has tipped heavily in favor of Torah over madda (secular studies) ... [and many] have redefined &#x27;madda&#x27; as support for making one&#x27;s livelihood in the secular world, not culturally or intellectually engaging with it.&quot; Although defining themselves as &quot;centrist&quot;, institutions here include the Orthodox Union (Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America), the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary.

Adherents on the ideological left have begun to develop new institutions that aim to be outward looking while maintaining a discourse between modernity and halakhah. The resultant &quot;Open Orthodoxy&quot; seeks to re-engage with secular studies, Jews of all denominations and global issues. Some within this movement have experimented with orthodox egalitarianism where gender equality solutions are found through halakhah. This has led to women taking on more leadership roles. Others in this movement are increasingly re-engaging with social justice issues from a halakhic point of view. &quot;Tikun Olam&quot; (&quot;repairing the world&quot;) is re-mapped onto the values of social justice and basic Judaism is increasingly abandoned. See Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Shalom Hartman Institute, Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, Partnership minyan, Shira Hadasha, Maharat.

===The behaviorally modern===
It is also noted that many Modern Orthodox are &quot;behaviorally modern&quot; as opposed to &quot;ideologically modern&quot;, and, in truth, fall outside of &quot;Modern&quot; Orthodoxy, at least in the philosophical sense; see below. This phenomenon is sometimes termed &quot;Social Orthodoxy&quot;.

The distinction is as follows: The ideologically modern are &quot;meticulously observant of Halakha&quot;, and their interaction with the secular comprises a tangible expression of their ideology, wherever it may lie on the spectrum described. The &quot;behaviorally modern&quot;, on the other hand, define themselves as &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; only in the sense that they are neither Haredi (&quot;Ultra-Orthodox&quot;) nor Conservative: these, in other words, are &quot;not deeply concerned with philosophical ideas&quot;, and, often, are not as careful in their observance.

This &quot;Orthodoxy of convenience&quot; has maintained a certain stability over time: as long as these don&#x27;t seek to legitimize their behaviour in halakhic terms, the leadership of the (Modern) Orthodox world have no particular difficulty with them.

===Positioning===

Various highly differing views (or non views) – ranging from traditionalist to revisionist – are thus offered under the banner of &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot;. In fact, even among its leadership, there is limited agreement &quot;on the philosophical parameters of modern Orthodoxy&quot;. The boundaries here, with respect to Haredi and Conservative Judaism, have therefore become increasingly indistinct. At the same time, some elements of Haredi Judaism appear to be more receptive to messages that have traditionally been part of the Modern-Orthodox agenda. Similarly, at Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s left, many appear to align with more traditional elements of Conservative Judaism. In discussing &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot;, it is thus also important to clarify its position with reference to other movements in Judaism: see§ Comparison with other movements below. Further, given this wide range of views, some see the possibility that, in fact, &quot;[t]here is no longer a cohesive, singular Modern Orthodoxy&quot;; see further below.

==Philosophy==
Modern Orthodoxy traces its roots to the works of Rabbis Azriel Hildesheimer (1820–1899) and Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808–1888). While Hildesheimer&#x27;s role is not disputed—comprising distinct philosophic and pragmatic contributions—Hirsch&#x27;s role is less clear, with some Hirsch scholars arguing that his &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; philosophy is in fact at odds with that of Modern Orthodoxy; see further below and in the Hildesheimer article. Today, the movement is additionally, and particularly, influenced by the philosophy of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and the closely related Torah Umadda, as well as by the writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. (Religious Zionism, strictly speaking a distinct philosophy, has an indirect influence.)

===&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;===
Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; ( – &quot;Torah with the &#x27;Way of the World&#x27;/Society&quot;) is a philosophy of Orthodox Judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant Judaism and the modern world. Hirsch held that Judaism requires the application of Torah philosophy to all human endeavor and knowledge compatible with it. Thus, secular education becomes a positive religious duty. &quot;Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: It comprises all of life ... in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the pen and the chisel.&quot; Hirsch&#x27;s vision, although not unqualified, extended to the sciences as well as to (German) literature, philosophy and culture. Torah im Derech Eretz remains influential to this day in all branches of Orthodox Judaism.

Neo Orthodoxy, the movement descended from Hirsch&#x27;s Frankfurt community, regards itself as positioned, ideologically, outside of contemporary Modern Orthodoxy; see further below.

===Pragmatism===
Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer, along with Rabbi Hirsch, was insistent that Orthodox Jews living in the west should not segregate themselves behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects. His approach, &quot;Cultured Orthodoxy&quot;, was defined as representing &quot;unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day; harmony between Judaism and science; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of Judaism&quot;.

He was, however, &quot;the pragmatist rather than the philosopher&quot;, and it is his actions, rather than his philosophy, which have become institutionalized in Modern Orthodoxy, and through which his influence is still felt.
* He established Jewish education for males and females, which included both religious and secular studies.
* He established Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, one of the first Orthodox yeshivot incorporating modern Jewish studies, secular studies, and academic scholarship in its curriculum.
* He was non-sectarian, and worked with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community.
* He maintained traditional attachments to the Land of Israel, and worked with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.

===&quot;Torah Umadda&quot;===
&quot;Torah Umadda&quot; ( – &quot;Torah and secular knowledge&quot;) is a philosophy concerning the secular world and Judaism, and in particular secular knowledge and Jewish knowledge. It envisions a personal—&quot;as opposed to&quot; philosophic—&quot;synthesis&quot; between Torah scholarship and Western, secular scholarship, entailing, also, positive involvement with the broader community. Here, the &quot;individual has absorbed the attitudes characteristic of science, democracy, and Jewish life, and responds appropriately in diverse relations and contexts&quot;. The resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism is referred to as &quot;Centrist Orthodoxy&quot;.

This philosophy, as formulated today, is to a large extent a product of the teachings and philosophy of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (1903–1993), Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University. In Rav Soloveitchik&#x27;s thought, Judaism, which believes that the world is &quot;very good&quot;, enjoins man to engage in &quot;tikkun olam&quot;. &quot;Halakhic Man&quot; must therefore attempt to bring the sanctity and purity of the transcendent realm into the material world. Centrist Orthodoxy is the dominant mode of Modern Orthodoxy in the United States, while &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; remains closely associated with Yeshiva University.

===Religious Zionism===
Modern Orthodoxy draws on the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935), as well as the writings and interpretations of his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook (1891–1982), both as regards their views on Jewish peoplehood and as they regard the (related) interaction with the secular world.
* &quot;Rav Kook&quot; saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme finally to result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland, bringing redemption (&quot;Geula&quot;) to the Jewish people, and the entire world.
* In Rav Kook&#x27;s thought &quot;Kodesh&quot; and &quot;Chol&quot; (sacred and profane) play an important role: &quot;Kodesh&quot; is the inner &quot;taam&quot; (lit: &quot;flavor&quot;) of reality, while &quot;Chol&quot; is that which is detached from &quot;Kodesh&quot; and is without any meaning; Judaism, then, is the vehicle &quot;whereby we sanctify our lives, and attach all the practical, secular elements of life to spiritual goals which reflect the absolute meaning of existence – G-d Himself&quot;.

In Israel, the Religious Zionism of the &quot;Dati Leumi&quot; (, &quot;National Religious&quot;) dominates Modern Orthodoxy. Here too, the ideological basis is largely drawn from the teachings of Rav Kook, and there is therefore much overlap; philosophical differences, as well as other &quot;non-modern&quot; forms of Religious Zionism, are discussed below.

See also &quot;Mizrachi&quot;; &quot;Bnei Akiva&quot;; &quot;National Religious Party&quot;; &quot;Hesder&quot;; &quot;Mechina&quot;; &quot;Gush Emunim&quot;; &quot;Torat Eretz Yisrael&quot;.

==Comparison with other movements==
As above, Modern Orthodoxy comprises various approaches, ranging from traditionalist to revisionist, and the movement apparently overlaps with Conservative Judaism and with Haredi Judaism at its respective boundaries. At its centre too, the movement appears to share practices and values with Neo Orthodoxy and with Religious Zionism. Therefore, in clarifying what Modern Orthodoxy in fact entails, its positioning must be discussed with reference to these movements.

===Haredi Judaism===

Although there is some question as how precisely to define the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Haredi Judaism, there is basic agreement that they may be distinguished on the basis of three major characteristics:
# Modern Orthodoxy adopts a relatively inclusive stance toward society in general, and the larger Jewish community in particular.
# Modern Orthodoxy is, in comparison, accommodating, &quot;if not welcoming&quot;, to modernity, general scholarship, and science.
# Modern Orthodoxy is almost uniformly receptive toward Israel and Zionism, viewing the State of Israel (in addition to the Land of Israel) as having inherent religious significance.

A fourth difference suggested, relates to the acceptability of moderation within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard &quot;Halakha&quot; as divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulchan Aruch and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, in their approach to strictures (&quot;chumras&quot;) and leniencies (&quot;kulas&quot;).
Modern Orthodoxy holds that strictures are not normative, rather, these are a matter of personal choice; &quot;severity and leniency are relevant only in circumstances of factual doubt, not in situations of debate or varied practice. In the latter situations, the conclusion should be based solely on the legal analysis.&quot; 
See .
Note though, that in recent years, many Modern Orthodox Jews are described as &quot;increasingly stringent in their adherence to Jewish law&quot;. 
As to the contention that Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s standards of observance of halakha are &quot;relaxed&quot;, as opposed to moderate, see below under &quot;Criticism&quot;.
In the Haredi view, on the other hand, &quot;the most severe position ... is the most likely basis for unity and commonality of practice within Orthodox community, and is therefore to be preferred&quot;. Further, &quot;such severity ... results in the greatest certainty that God&#x27;s will is being performed&quot;. &quot;Haredi&quot; Judaism thus tends to adopt &quot;chumras&quot; as a norm.

Related to this is the acceptance of the concept of Da&#x27;as Torah - the extent to which Orthodox Jews should seek the input of rabbinic scholars not just on matters of Jewish law, but on all important life matters.
Most rabbinic leaders from Haredi communities view the concept as inextricably linked to the centuries of Jewish tradition. Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, many rabbis and scholars view the matter as a modern development that can be traced to changes in Jewish communal life in the nineteenth century. 
Thus, while the notion of da&#x27;as Torah is viewed by Haredi rabbis as a long-established tradition within Judaism, Modern Orthodox scholars argue that the Haredi claim is a revisionist one. According to Modern Orthodox scholars, although the term &quot;da&#x27;as Torah&quot; has been used in the past, the connotations of absolute rabbinic authority under this banner occurs only in the decades that follow the establishment of the Agudas Yisrael party in Eastern Europe.
See for further elaboration of these differences.

Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s efforts to encourage religious observance among non-Orthodox Jews has been likened to similar efforts by the Chabad movement. The similarity between the two groups in their relationships towards the non-Orthodox, and its adoption by some Haredi groups, has blurred the lines between the modern and Haredi segments of Orthodoxy.

===Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz===
Both Modern Orthodoxy and Neo Orthodoxy, the movement directly descended from Hirsch&#x27;s Frankfurt community, have combined Torah and secular knowledge with participation in contemporary Western life, and thus some maintain that there is a degree of practical and philosophical overlap between the two. The movements are nevertheless distinct, and in general, Neo-Orthodoxy has taken a more qualified approach than Modern orthodoxy, emphasizing that followers must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.

Differences between the movements may be more than a question of degree: some Hirsch scholars argue that Hirschian philosophy is at odds with that of Modern Orthodoxy, while some Modern Orthodox scholars maintain that Modern Orthodoxy accords with Hirsch&#x27;s worldview. These philosophical distinctions (though subtle), manifest in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives. For example, Shimon Schwab, second rabbi of the Torah Im Derech Eretz community in the United States, has been described as being &quot;spiritually very distant&quot; from Yeshiva University and Modern Orthodoxy.

From the viewpoint of Neo-Orthodoxy, that movement differs from Modern Orthodoxy (and particularly Centrist Orthodoxy) on three main counts.
* The role of secular life and culture: In the Hirschian view, interaction with the secular and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge is encouraged, only insofar as it facilitates the application of Torah to worldly matters. For Modern Orthodoxy, on the other hand, secular culture and knowledge are seen as a complement to Torah, and, to some extent, encouraged for their own sake. Some would suggest that in Modern Orthodoxy, Judaism is enriched by interaction with modernity, whereas in Neo-Orthodoxy human experience (and modernity) are enriched by the application of Torah outlook and practice.
* Priority of Torah versus Secular knowledge: In the Hirschian view, Torah is the &quot;sole barometer of truth&quot; by which to judge secular disciplines, as &quot;there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally.&quot; (Hirsch, commentary to Leviticus 18:4–5; see also Rashi &quot;ad loc.&quot;). By contrast, in the view of Modern Orthodoxy, although Torah is the &quot;preeminent center&quot;, secular knowledge is considered to offer &quot;a different perspective that may not agree at all with [Torah] ... [but] both together present the possibility of a larger truth&quot;. (&quot;Torah Umadda&quot;, p. 236).
* Broader communal involvement: Neo-Orthodoxy, influenced by Hirsch&#x27;s philosophy on &quot;Austritt&quot; (secession), &quot;could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people&quot;, and is therefore opposed to the &quot;Mizrachi&quot; movement, which is affiliated with the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency. Modern Orthodoxy, on the other hand, is characterised by its involvement with the broader Jewish Community and by its Religious Zionism.

===Religious Zionism===
Broadly defined, Religious Zionism is a movement that embraces the idea of Jewish national sovereignty, often in connection with the belief in the ability of the Jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel. The spiritual thinkers who started this stream of thought include Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (1795–1874) and Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines (1839–1915). Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy.

Note, however, that Modern Orthodoxy, in fact, overlaps to a large extent with &quot;Religious Zionism&quot; in its narrower form (&quot;Throughout the world, a &#x27;religious Zionist day school&#x27; is a synonym for a &#x27;modern Orthodox day school&#x27;&quot;). At the least, the two are not in any direct conflict, and generally coexist, sharing both values and adherents. Further, in practice, except at their extremes, the differences between Religious Zionism and Modern Orthodoxy in Israel are not pronounced, and they are often identical, especially in recent years and for the younger generation.

Nevertheless, the two movements are philosophically distinct on two broad counts.

* Firstly, (the more conservative) Religious Zionists differ with Modern Orthodoxy in its approach to secular knowledge. Here, engagement with the secular is permissible, and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel; secular knowledge (or, at the least, an extensive secular education) is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. See further under &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;.
* Secondly, under Religious Zionism, a &quot;nationalistic coloration&quot; is given to traditional religious concepts, whereas, by contrast, Modern Orthodoxy includes &quot;a greater balance which includes openness to the non-Jewish world&quot;; thus, under Religious Zionism, the Jewish nation is conceived of as an &quot;organic unity&quot;, whereas Modern Orthodoxy emphasises the individual.

Applying the above distinction, in Israel today, Modern Orthodoxy—as distinct from (right-wing) Religious Zionism—is represented by only a select group of institutions: the Religious Kibbutz Movement, Ne&#x27;emanei Torah Va&#x27;Avodah, the Meimad political party, and the Shalom Hartman Institute, Yeshivat Har Etzion / Migdal Oz and Yeshivat Hamivtar/Ohr Torah Stone Institutions/Midreshet Lindenbaum (some would include Yeshivat Hesder Petach Tikva, Yeshivat Ma&#x27;ale Gilboa, and the Tzohar Foundation).

===Conservative Judaism===

In some areas, Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s left wing appears to align with more traditional elements of Conservative Judaism, and in fact some on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have allied with the formerly Conservative Union for Traditional Judaism. Nonetheless, the two movements are generally described as distinct. Rabbi Avi Weiss, from the left of Modern Orthodoxy, stresses that Orthodox and Conservative Judaism are &quot;so very different in ... three fundamental areas: &quot;Torah mi-Sinai&quot;, rabbinic interpretation, and rabbinic legislation&quot;. Weiss argues as follows:
* &quot;Torah mi-Sinai&quot; (&quot;Torah From Sinai&quot;): Modern Orthodoxy, in line with the rest of Orthodoxy, holds that Jewish law is Divine in origin, and as such, no underlying &quot;principle&quot; may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions, whereas Conservative Judaism holds that Poskim should make use of literary and historical analysis in deciding Jewish law, and may reverse decisions of the Acharonim that are held to be inapplicable today.
* Rabbinic interpretation: (Modern) Orthodoxy contends that legal authority is cumulative, and that a contemporary &quot;posek&quot; (decisor) can only issue judgments based on a full history of Jewish legal precedent, whereas the implicit argument of the Conservative movement is that precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior history appeals to it.
* Rabbinic legislation: Since the (Modern) Orthodox community is ritually observant, rabbinic law legislated by (today&#x27;s) Orthodox rabbis can meaningfully become binding if accepted by the community (see minhag). Conservative Judaism, on the other hand, has a largely non-observant laity. Thus, although Conservatism similarly holds that &quot;no law has authority unless it becomes part of the concern and practice of the community&quot; communal acceptance of a &quot;permissive custom&quot; is not &quot;meaningful&quot;, and, as a result, related rabbinic legislation cannot assume the status of law.

In general, Modern Orthodoxy does not, therefore, view the process by which the Conservative movement decides &quot;halakha&quot; as legitimate—or with the non-normative weighting assigned to halakha by the Conservative movement. In particular, Modern Orthodoxy disagrees with many of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s &quot;halakhic&quot; rulings, particularly as regards issues of egalitarianism. See further on the Orthodox view and the Conservative view.

Modern Orthodoxy clearly differs from the approach of Reform Judaism and Humanistic Judaism, which do not consider &quot;halakha&quot; to be normative.

==Criticism==
This section deals with criticism relating to standards of observance and to social issues. See &quot;Criticism&quot; under Torah Umadda for discussions of philosophy.

===Standards of observance===

There is an often repeated contention that Modern Orthodoxy—beyond its approach to &quot;chumrahs&quot; (&quot;strictures&quot;) described above—has lower standards of observance of traditional Jewish laws and customs than other branches of Orthodox Judaism. This view is largely anecdotal, and is based on individual behaviour, as opposed to any formal, institutional position; see above re &quot;the behaviorally modern&quot;:

Additionally, whereas the Modern Orthodox position is (generally) presented as &quot;unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of Torah, and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of Torah&quot;, &quot;Haredi&quot; groups have sometimes compared Modern Orthodoxy with early Reform Judaism in Germany: Modern Orthodox rabbis have been criticised for attempting to modify Jewish law, in adapting Judaism to the needs of the modern world.

Note that claims of this nature have been commonplace within Orthodox Judaism since the first &quot;reforms&quot; of Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer. Thus, in Europe of the early 19th century, all of Judaism that differed from the strictest forms present at the time was called &quot;Reform&quot;. Then, as now, Modern Orthodoxy took pains to distance its &quot;reforms&quot;, which were consistent with the Shulkhan Arukh and poskim, from those of the Reform movement (and the Conservative movement), which were not.

===Sociological and philosophical dilemmas===
Some observe that the ability of Modern Orthodoxy to attract a large following and maintain its strength as a movement is inhibited by the fact that it embraces modernity—its &quot;&quot;—and that it is highly rational and intellectual.
* Modern Orthodoxy is, almost by definition, inhibited from becoming a strong movement, because this would entail organization and authority to a degree &quot;which goes against the very grain of modernity&quot;. A related difficulty is that Modern Orthodox rabbis who do adopt stringencies may, in the process, lose the support of precisely the &quot;Modern&quot; group they sought to lead. The logic: since one of the characteristics of religious orthodoxy is the submission to the authority of its tradition, the individual is expected to conform to all of its dictates, whereas modernity, by contrast, emphasizes a measure of personal autonomy as well as rationalist truth. The very term &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot; is thus, in some sense, an oxymoron.
* Modern Orthodoxy&#x27;s &quot;highly intellectual and rational stance&quot; presents its own difficulties. Firstly, the ideology entails built-in tensions and frequently requires conscious living with inconsistency (even in the term itself: modernity vs. orthodoxy). Secondly, there are also those who question whether &quot;the literature ... with its intellectually elitist bias fails to directly address the majority of its practitioners&quot;. The suggestion here is that Modern Orthodoxy may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary Modern Orthodox family; see further discussion under &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;.
* As observed above, the (precise) &quot;philosophical parameters of modern Orthodoxy&quot; are not readily defined. It is posited then that &quot;modern orthodoxy&quot;, as such, may be disappearing, &quot;being sucked into pluralistic Judaism on the left and yeshivish on the right&quot;. &quot;Modern orthodoxy&quot;, then, as opposed to constituting an ideological spectrum centred on a common core of values, is, in fact, (tending towards) several entirely separate movements. In fact, &quot;[m]any are making the argument that the time has come to state the inevitable or to admit that which already has occurred: There is no longer a cohesive, singular Modern Orthodoxy. Separate rabbinical schools and separate rabbinic organizations, the argument goes, reflect the reality of a community divided.&quot; See .

==Important figures==
Many Orthodox Jews find the intellectual engagement with the modern world as a virtue. Examples of Orthodox rabbis who promote or have promoted this worldview include:

* Yehuda Amital – A Hungarian survivor of the Holocaust, he emigrated to Israel in 1944, and resumed his yeshiva studies in Jerusalem. During the 1947–1949 Palestine war, he served in the Haganah armored corps, taking part in the battle of Latrun. Following the Six-Day War, Amital founded and led Yeshivat Har Etzion. He eventually founded the Meimad political party in Israel.
* Raymond Apple – former senior rabbi of the Great Synagogue, Sydney, Australia.
* Samuel Belkin, former President of Yeshiva University.
* Eliezer Berkovits – philosopher whose works include &quot;Not In Heaven: The Nature and Function of Halakha&quot; and &quot;Faith after the Holocaust&quot;.
* Saul Berman – director of the now defunct Edah, a Modern Orthodox advocacy organization.
* J. David Bleich, professor at Yeshiva University.
* Shalom Carmy – professor of Jewish Studies and Philosophy at Yeshiva University; theologian
* Chuck Davidson, an activist against the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, specifically in the areas of conversion and marriage, where he is creating alternatives to the official paths.

* Joseph B. Soloveitchik – known as &quot;The Rav&quot;, he was an important figure in Modern Orthodoxy in mid-20th century America. He wrote &quot;The Lonely Man of Faith&quot; and &quot;Halakhic Man&quot;, and was an outspoken Zionist, an opponent of extending rabbinic authority into areas of secular expertise, and a proponent of some interdenominational cooperation, such as the Rabbinical Council of America&#x27;s participation in the now-defunct Synagogue Council of America.

==Modern Orthodox advocacy groups==
There are a few organizations dedicated to furthering Modern Orthodoxy as a religious trend:
* The largest and oldest are the Orthodox Union (Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America), which sponsors youth groups, kashrut supervision, and many other activities, and its rabbinic counterpart, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA). Both have Israel and diaspora (outside the land of Israel) programs.

Others include:
* The Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA): a forum for enhancing the roles of Orthodox Jewish women within the Orthodox community, and reducing Orthodox religious disabilities against women.
* Ne&#x27;emanei Torah Va&#x27;Avodah is a non-profit organization operating in Israel whose proposed goal is &quot;To forge a more open and tolerant discourse in Religious Zionism, one that integrates a halachic lifestyle with active engagement in Israeli society, in order to strengthen tolerance, equality, and social responsibility&quot;.

<text>The House of Bernadotte is the royal family of Sweden, founded there in 1818 by King Charles XIV John of Sweden. It was also the royal family of Norway between 1818 and 1905. Its founder was born in Pau in southern France as Jean Bernadotte. Bernadotte, who had been made a General of Division and Minister of War for his service in the French Army during the French Revolution, and Marshal of the French Empire and Prince of Pontecorvo under Napoleon, was adopted by the elderly King Charles XIII of Sweden, who had no other heir and whose Holstein-Gottorp branch of the House of Oldenburg thus was soon to be extinct on the Swedish throne. The current king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, is a direct descendant of Charles XIV John.

== History of the house ==

Following the conclusion of the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden lost possession of Finland, which had constituted roughly the eastern half of the Swedish realm for centuries. Resentment towards King Gustav IV Adolf precipitated an abrupt &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Gustav Adolf (and his son Gustav) was deposed and his uncle Charles XIII was elected King in his place. However, Charles XIII was 61 years old and prematurely senile. He was also childless; one child had been stillborn and another died after less than a week. It was apparent almost as soon as Charles XIII ascended the throne that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with him. In 1810 the Riksdag of the Estates, the Swedish parliament, elected a Danish prince, Prince Christian August of Augustenborg, as heir-presumptive to the throne. He took the name Charles August, but died later that same year.

At this time, Emperor Napoleon I of France controlled much of continental Europe, and some of his client states were headed by his siblings. The Riksdag decided to choose a king of whom Napoleon would approve. On 21 August 1810, the Riksdag elected Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, a Marshal of France, as heir presumptive to the Swedish throne.
The coat of arms of the House of Bernadotte impales the coat of arms of the House of Vasa (&quot;heraldic right&quot;) and the coat of arms of Bernadotte as Prince of Pontecorvo (&quot;heraldic left&quot;). It is visible as an inescutcheon in the Greater Coat of Arms of the Realm.

When elected to be Swedish royalty the new heir had been called &quot;Prince Bernadotte&quot; according to the promotions he received from Emperor Napoleon I, culminating in sovereignty over the Principality of Pontecorvo. Some Swedish experts have asserted that all of his male heirs have had the right to use that Italian title, since the Swedish government never made payments promised Charles John to get him to give up his position in Pontecorvo.

Some members of the house who lost their royal status and Swedish titles due to unapproved marriages have also been given the titles Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg in the nobility of other countries.

=== Bernadotte ===

Bernadotte, born in the town of Pau, in the province of Béarn, France, had risen to the rank of general during the French Revolution. In 1798, he married Désirée Clary, whose sister was married to Joseph, Napoleon&#x27;s elder brother. In 1804, Napoleon promoted Bernadotte to a Marshal of France. Napoleon also granted him the title &quot;Prince of Pontecorvo&quot;.

As the Crown Prince of Sweden, he assumed the name Charles John () and acted as regent for the remainder of Charles XIII&#x27;s reign. In 1813, he broke with Napoleon and led Sweden into the anti-Napoleon alliance. When Norway was awarded to Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel, Norway resisted and declared independence, triggering a brief war between Sweden and Norway. The war ended when Bernadotte persuaded Norway to enter into a personal union with Sweden. Instead of being merely a Swedish province, Norway remained an independent kingdom, though sharing a common monarch and foreign policy. Bernadotte reigned as Charles XIV John of Sweden and Charles III John of Norway from 5 February 1818 until his death on 8 March 1844.

The House of Bernadotte reigned in both countries until the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Prince Carl of Denmark was then elected as King Haakon VII of Norway. Carl was a grandson of King Charles XV of Sweden and a great-great-grandson of Charles XIV.

=== French origins ===

King Charles John&#x27;s first known paternal ancestor was Joandou du Poey, who was a shepherd. He married Germaine de Bernadotte in 1615 in the southern French city of Pau and began using her surname. Through her the couple owned a building there called &quot;de Bernadotte&quot;, the surname theoretically meaning &quot;Young woman of Béarn&quot; in local dialect.

A grandson of theirs, Jean Bernadotte (1649–1698), was a weaver.

Another Jean Bernadotte (1683–1760), his son, was a tailor.

His son Henri Bernadotte (1711–1780) married Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728–1809) and with her was the father of the future Swedish–Norwegian king. Henri was a local prosecutor, from a family of artisans, who had once been imprisoned for debt. This was a modest family which occupied only one floor of the house in a cross street in a popular and peripheral district of Pau.

Two branches of the French Bernadotte family survive. The elder descends from Andrew (&quot;André&quot;) Bernadotte, an older granduncle of Carl John&#x27;s, with descendants today in the general population of France. The younger branch divided in two, one branch descending from the king&#x27;s older brother John (&quot;Jean Évangéliste&quot;) Bernadotte (1754–1813), the heads of which were French barons as of 1810 with Louvie Palace in the south of Pau as their seat (branch extinct with the death of Baron Henri Bernadotte in 1966), and the other branch being the Swedish Royal House.

<text>Philip Francis “Phil” Berrigan (October 5, 1923 – December 6, 2002) was an American peace activist and Catholic priest with the Josephites. He engaged in nonviolent, civil disobedience in the cause of peace and nuclear disarmament and was often arrested.

In 1973, he married a former nun, Elizabeth McAlister. Both were subsequently excommunicated by the Catholic Church before being reinstated. For 11 years of their 29-year marriage they were separated by one or both serving time in prison.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Berrigan was born in Two Harbors, Minnesota, a Midwestern, working-class town. He had five brothers, including the Jesuit fellow-activist and poet, Daniel Berrigan. His mother, Frieda (née Fromhart), was of German descent and deeply religious. His father, Tom Berrigan, was a second-generation Irish-Catholic, trade union member, socialist, and railway engineer.

Philip Berrigan graduated from high school in Syracuse, New York, and was then employed cleaning trains for the New York Central Railroad. He played with a semi-professional baseball team. In 1943, after a semester of schooling at St. Michael&#x27;s College, Toronto, Berrigan was drafted into combat duty in . He served in the artillery during the Battle of the Bulge (1945) and later became a Second Lieutenant in the infantry. He was deeply affected by racial segregation and racism during boot camp in the American South. Berrigan graduated with an English degree from the College of the Holy Cross, a Jesuit college in Worcester, Massachusetts.

=== Josephites and early priesthood ===
In 1950, he joined the Society of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart, better known as the Josephites, a religious society of priests and lay brothers dedicated to serving African-Americans (who were still dealing with the repercussions of slavery and daily segregation in the United States). After studying at the theological school of the Society, St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Washington, D.C., he was ordained a priest in 1955.

He went on to gain a degree in Secondary Education at Loyola University of the South (1957) and then a Master of Arts degree at Xavier University of Louisiana in 1960, during which time he began to teach at High.

In addition to his academic responsibilities, Berrigan became active in the Civil Rights Movement. He marched for desegregation and participated in sit-ins and bus boycotts. His brother Daniel wrote of him:

Berrigan was first imprisoned in 1962/1963. During his many prison sentences, he would often hold Bible study class and offer legal educational support to other inmates. As a priest, his activism and arrests met with deep disapproval from the leadership of the Catholic Church and Berrigan was moved to Epiphany Apostolic College, the Josephite minor seminary in Newburgh, New York, but he continued his protests. Working with Jim Forest, in 1964 he founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship in New York City. He was moved again to St. Peter Claver Parish in West Baltimore, Maryland, from where he started the Baltimore Interfaith Peace Mission, leading lobbies and demonstrations.

===Protests===

====Baltimore Four====
Berrigan and others took increasingly radical steps to bring attention to the anti-war movement. The group, later known as &quot;the Baltimore Four&quot; occupied the Selective Service Board in the Customs House, Baltimore, on October 27, 1967. &#x27;The Four&#x27; were Berrigan, artist Tom Lewis, writer David Eberhardt, and the Rev. James L. Mengel III. Mengel was a United States Air Force veteran and a United Church of Christ pastor. Performing a sacrificial, blood-pouring protest, they used their own blood and that from poultry and poured it over selective service (draft) records. During their trial Mengel stated that U.S. military forces had killed and maimed not only humans, but also animals and vegetation. Mengel agreed to the action and donated blood, but decided not to actually pour blood. Instead he distributed the paperback book version of the New Testament to draft board workers, newsmen, and police. Berrigan, in a written statement, noted that his sacrificial and constructive act was meant to protest &quot;the pitiful waste of American and Vietnamese blood in Indochina&quot;.

The trial of the four defendants was postponed due to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the subsequent riots in Baltimore and other U.S. cities. Eberhardt and Lewis served jail time and Berrigan was sentenced to six years in federal prisons.

====Catonsville Nine====
In 1968, six months after the Baltimore draft records protest, while out on bail, Berrigan decided to repeat the protest in a modified form. A high school physics teacher, Dean Pappas, helped to concoct homemade napalm. Nine activists, including Berrigan&#x27;s Jesuit brother Daniel, later became known as the Catonsville Nine when they walked into the offices of the local draft board in Catonsville, Maryland, removed 600 draft records, doused them in napalm and burnt them in a lot outside of the building. The Catonsville Nine, who were all Catholics, issued a statement:
Berrigan was convicted of conspiracy and destruction of government property on November 8, 1968, but was bailed for 16 months while the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court rejected the appeal and Berrigan and three others went into hiding. For a time, Liz McAlister, the nun who would later become his wife, helped hide Berrigan in New Jersey. Twelve days later Berrigan was arrested by the FBI and jailed in Lewisburg. All nine were sentenced to three years in prison.
====The Harrisburg Seven====

Berrigan attracted the notice of federal authorities again when he and six other anti-war activists were caught trading letters alluding to kidnapping Henry Kissinger and bombing steam tunnels. They were charged with 23 counts of conspiracy including plans for kidnap and blowing up heating tunnels in Washington. The government spent $2 million on the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial but did not win a conviction. This was one of the reversals suffered by the U.S. government in such cases, another being The Camden 28 in 1973.

====Other actions====

Berrigan organized or inspired many additional operations. The D.C. Nine, in March 1969, consisted of mostly priests and nuns disrupting the Washington Dow Chemical offices by scattering their files. The group protested Dow&#x27;s production of napalm for use in the Vietnam War. The D.C. Nine were later tried in Washington, D.C., but an appeal was won in their favor. Some jail time was served. Later in May 1969, the Chicago 15 Catholics protested napalm and burned 40,000 draft cards.

He helped the Milwaukee 14 in a protest against the Milwaukee Draft Boards on September 24, 1968. The Fourteen men burned 10,000 1-A draft files. After being arrested, they spent a month in prison, unable to raise bail set at $415,000. Father James Groppi came to their aid, co-chairing the Milwaukee 14 Defense Committee. Members were later placed on trial and many did considerable jail time.

He supported the Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI, the burglary of an FBI field office in Media, Penn., to expose the methods of J. Edgar Hoover against war protesters.

He was also involved with the Camden 28, who took action against the Camden, New Jersey, draft board. The group was arrested and the trial resulted in acquittal on all charges. A book has been written about this action by Ed McGowan and a documentary made by Giacchino, which appeared on PBS TV.

Berrigan likewise supported the Harrisburg Seven, whose plan was to put people in the government like Henry Kissinger under citizens arrest for the waging of an illegal war. Philip Berrigan and others were arrested for conspiracy. They had only gathered together to discuss the idea.

In 1968, Berrigan signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

===Marriage===
Berrigan, while still a priest, married former nun Elizabeth McAlister in 1969 by mutual consent. In 1973, they legalized their marriage, and were subsequently excommunicated by the Catholic Church, though their excommunication was later lifted. Together they founded Jonah House in Baltimore, a community to support resistance to war.

===Plowshares Movement===

On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Daniel, with Sister Anne Montgomery RSCJ, Elmer H. Maas, Rev. Carl Kabat, O.M.I., John Schuchardt, Dean Hammer and Molly Rush known as the &quot;Plowshares Eight&quot; entered the General Electric Re-entry Division in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where Mark 12A reentry vehicles for the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were made. They hammered on two reentry vehicles, poured blood on documents, and offered prayers for peace. This is considered the beginning of the Plowshares Movement. They were arrested and charged with ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10, 1990, after nearly ten years of trials and appeals, the Plowshares Eight were re-sentenced and paroled for up to 23 months in consideration of time already served in prison. Berrigan helped set up Jonah House as the community headquarters of the organisation, a terraced house in Reservoir Hill, Baltimore. The headquarters later was moved to St. Peter the Apostle Cemetery in West Baltimore. The story is partly told in the book &quot;ARISE AND WITNESS: Poems by Anne Montgomery, RSCJ, About Faith, Prison, War Zones and Nonviolent Resistance,&quot; published in 2024.

Berrigan&#x27;s last Plowshares action occurred in December 1999, when a group of protesters hammered on A-10 Warthog warplanes held at the Warfield Air National Guard Base. He was indicted for malicious destruction of property and sentenced to 30 months in prison. He was released on December 14, 2001. In his lifetime he had spent about 11 years in jails and prisons for civil disobedience.

In one of his last public statements, Berrigan said,
===Death===
On December 6, 2002, Philip Berrigan died of liver and kidney cancer at the age of 79 at Jonah House in Baltimore. In a last statement, he said
Howard Zinn, professor emeritus at Boston University, paid this tribute to Berrigan saying: &quot;Mr. Berrigan was one of the great Americans of our time. He believed war didn&#x27;t solve anything. He went to prison again and again and again for his beliefs. I admired him for the sacrifices he made. He was an inspiration to a large number of people.&quot;

The funeral was held at St. Peter Claver Church in West Baltimore and he was buried in West Baltimore cemetery. Berrigan&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth McAlister, and others still maintain Jonah House in Baltimore and a website that details all Plowshares activities. His four brothers, Daniel, John, Jim, and Jerome; his wife, Elizabeth McAlister; and their three children, Frida, Jerry, and Kate, are or were all also activists in the peace movement.

==Personal life==
With his wife Liz he had three children: Frida (b. 1974), Jerry (b. 1975), and Kate (b. 1981).
