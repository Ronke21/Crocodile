<doc id="156959" wikidata="Q7834587" url="?curid=156959" title="Transmembrane domain">
<text>A transmembrane domain (TMD, TM domain) is a membrane-spanning protein domain. TMDs may consist of one or several alpha-helices or a transmembrane beta barrel. Because the interior of the lipid bilayer is hydrophobic, the amino acid residues in TMDs are often hydrophobic, although proteins such as membrane pumps and ion channels can contain polar residues. TMDs vary greatly in size and hydrophobicity; they may adopt organelle-specific properties.

== Functions of transmembrane domains ==
Transmembrane domains are known to perform a variety of functions. These include:

* Anchoring transmembrane proteins to the membrane. 
*Facilitating molecular transport of molecules such as ions and proteins across biological membranes; usually hydrophilic residues and binding sites in the TMDs help in this process.
*Signal transduction across the membrane; many transmembrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors, receive extracellular signals. TMDs then propagate those signals across the membrane to induce an intracellular effect.
* Assisting in vesicle fusion; the function of TMDs is not well understood, but they have been shown to be critical for the fusion reaction, possibly as a result of TMDs affecting the tension of the lipid bilayer.
* Mediating transport and sorting of transmembrane proteins; TMDs have been shown to work in tandem with cytosolic sorting signals, with length and hydrophobicity being the main determinants in TDM sorting. Longer and more hydrophobic TMDs aid in sorting proteins to the cell membrane, whereas shorter and less hydrophobic TMDs are used to retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The exact mechanism of this process is still unknown.

==Identification of transmembrane helices==
Transmembrane helices are visible in structures of membrane proteins determined by X-ray diffraction. They may also be predicted on the basis of hydrophobicity scales. Because the interior of the bilayer and the interiors of most proteins of known structure are hydrophobic, it is presumed to be a requirement of the amino acids that span a membrane that they be hydrophobic as well. However, membrane pumps and ion channels also contain numerous charged and polar residues within the generally non-polar transmembrane segments.

Using &quot;hydrophobicity analysis&quot; to predict transmembrane helices enables a prediction in turn of the &quot;transmembrane topology&quot; of a protein; i.e. prediction of what parts of it protrude into the cell, what parts protrude out, and how many times the protein chain crosses the membrane.

Transmembrane helices can also be identified &quot;in silico&quot; using the bioinformatic tool, TMHMM.

== The role of membrane protein biogenesis and quality control factors ==
Since protein translation occurs in the cytosol (an aqueous environment), factors that recognize the TMD and protect them in this hostile environment are required. Additional factors that allow the TMD to be incorporated into the target membrane (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum or other organelles) are also required. Factors also detect TMD misfolding within the membrane and perform quality control functions. These factors must be able to recognize a highly variable set of TMDs and can be segregated into those active in the cytosol or active in the membrane.

=== Cytosolic recognition factors ===
Cytosolic recognition factors are thought to use two distinct strategies. In the co-translational strategy the recognition and shielding are coupled to protein synthesis. Genome wide association studies indicate the majority of membrane proteins targeting the endoplasmic reticulum are handled by the signal recognition particle which is bound to the ribosomal exit tunnel and initiates recognition and shielding as protein is translated. The second strategy involves tail-anchored proteins, defined by a single TMD located close to the carboxyl terminus of the membrane protein. Once translation is completed, the tail-anchored TMD remains in the ribosomal exit tunnel, and an ATPase mediates targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. Examples of shuttling factors include TRC40 in higher eukaryotes and Get3 in yeast. Furthermore, general TMD-binding factors protect against aggregation and other disrupting interactions. SGTA and calmodulin are two well-known general TMD-binding factors. Quality control of membrane proteins involve TMD-binding factors that are linked to ubiquitination proteasome system.

=== Membrane recognition factors ===
Once transported, factors assist with insertion of the TMD across the hydrophilic layer phosphate &quot;head&quot; group of the phospholipid membrane. Quality control factors must be able to discern function and topology, as well as facilitate extraction to the cytosol. The signal recognition particle transports membrane proteins to the Sec translocation channel, positioning the ribosome exit tunnel proximal to the translocon central pore and minimizing exposure of the TMD to cytosol. Insertases can also mediate TMD insertion into the lipid bilayer. Insertases include the bacterial YidC, mitochondrial Oxa1, and chloroplast Alb3, all of which are evolutionarily related. The conserved Hrd1 and Derlin enzyme families are examples of membrane bound quality control factors.

== Examples ==
* Tetraspanins have 4 conserved transmembrane domains.
*Mildew locus o (&quot;mlo&quot;) proteins have 7 conserved transmembrane domains that encode alpha helices.

<text>Mount Washington is an ultra-prominent mountain in the state of New Hampshire. It is the highest peak in the Northeastern United States at and the most topographically prominent mountain east of the Mississippi River.

The mountain is notorious for its erratic weather. On the afternoon of April 12, 1934, the Mount Washington Observatory recorded a windspeed of at the summit, the world record from 1934 until 1996. Mount Washington still holds the record for highest measured wind speed not associated with a tornado or tropical cyclone.

The mountain is located in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, in Coös County, New Hampshire. The mountain is in several unincorporated townships, with the summit in the township of Sargent&#x27;s Purchase. While nearly the whole mountain is in the White Mountain National Forest, an area of surrounding and including the summit is designated as Mount Washington State Park.

The Mount Washington Cog Railway ascends the western slope of the mountain, and the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east. The mountain is visited by hikers from various approaches, including the Appalachian Trail, which traverses the summit. Other common activities include glider flying, backcountry skiing, and annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.

==History==

Before European settlers arrived in the region, the mountain was known by various indigenous peoples as &quot;Kodaak Wadjo&quot; (&quot;the top is so hidden&quot; or &quot;summit of the highest mountain&quot;) or &quot;Agiochook&quot; or &quot;Agiocochook&quot; (&quot;the place of the Great Spirit&quot; or &quot;the place of the Concealed One&quot;). The Algonquians called the summit &quot;Waumbik&quot;, &quot;white rocks&quot;. The Abenaki people inhabiting the region at the time of European contact believed that the tops of mountains were the dwelling place of the gods and did not climb them out of religious deference to their sanctity.

In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano became the first European to mention the mountain. Viewing it from the Atlantic Ocean, he described what he saw as &quot;high interior mountains&quot;.

In 1642, Darby Field claimed to have made the first ascent of Mount Washington. Field climbed the mountain in June of that year to demonstrate to the Abenaki chief Passaconaway that the Europeans bargaining for tribal land were not subject to the gods believed to inhabit the summit, a primarily political move that facilitated colonists&#x27; northern expansion. Field again summited Agiocochook in October 1642 on an early surveying expedition that created maps of land as far as Maine, which allowed people from the Massachusetts colony to identify arable coastal areas.

The earliest known map to display the name, Mount Washington, was published in 1796. A 1784 geology party, headed by Manasseh Cutler, may have first named the mountain. 

In 1819, the Crawford Path was established from Crawford Notch to the summit. It is the oldest continuously maintained hiking path in the United States. Abel Crawford led a group that included several Harvard students on the first recorded ascent of the path on September 10, 1819. Among them were Samuel Joseph May, George B. Emerson, Samuel E. Sewall, Caleb Cushing, Joseph Coolidge, William Ware and Joseph G. Moody.

On August 31, 1821, Eliza, Harriet, and Abigail Austin, three sisters from Jefferson, New Hampshire, became the first White women to set foot atop Mount Washington. This was likely the first significant mountain to be climbed by any Euro-American females in the United States.

In 1821, Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit. The house lasted until a storm in 1826.
Little occurred on the summit itself until the mid-19th century, when it was developed into one of the first tourist destinations in the nation, with construction of more bridle paths and two hotels. The Summit House opened in 1852, a stone hotel anchored by four heavy chains over its roof. In 1853, the Tip-Top House was erected to compete. Rebuilt of wood with 91 rooms in 1872–1873, the Summit House burned in 1908, then was replaced in granite in 1915. The Tip-Top House alone survived the fire; today it is a state historic site, recently renovated for exhibits. Other Victorian era tourist attractions include a coach road (1861)—now the Mount Washington Auto Road—and the Mount Washington Cog Railway (1869), both of which are still in operation.

For forty years, until 1917, an intermittent daily newspaper, called &quot;Among the Clouds&quot;, was published by Henry M. Burt at the summit each summer.

In 2011 and 2012, Orlando, Florida–based CNL Financial Group, which at the time operated the Mount Washington Hotel at the foot of the mountain, trademarked the &quot;Mount Washington&quot; name when used with a resort or hotel. CNL officials said they were directing their efforts only against hotels and not the numerous businesses in the area that use the name. CNL&#x27;s application at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeks registration of the trademark &quot;Mount Washington&quot; for any retail service, any restaurant service, and any entertainment service.

== Climate ==
The summit station of Mount Washington has an alpine climate or tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;), although it receives an extremely high amount of precipitation, atypical for most regions with such cold weather. However, elevations just beneath treeline have a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) which eventually transitions to a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) near the mountain&#x27;s base and the surrounding lower elevations.

The weather of Mount Washington is notoriously erratic. This is partly due to the convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north–south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from the summit of the mountain on average of 110 days per year. These extreme winds also contribute to the mountain&#x27;s very short treeline, with elevations as low as being too hostile to support any plant life more than a few inches (centimeters) in height.

Mount Washington once held the world record, and still holds the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere record, for directly measured surface wind speed, at , recorded on the afternoon of April 12, 1934. A new wind speed record was discovered in 2009: on April 10, 1996, Tropical Cyclone Olivia had created a wind gust of at Barrow Island off the western coast of Australia.

The first regular meteorological observations on Mount Washington were conducted by the U.S. Signal Service, a precursor of the National Weather Service, from 1870 to 1892. The Mount Washington station was the first of its kind in the world, setting an example followed in many other countries. For many years, the record low temperature was thought to be occurring on January 29, 1934, but upon the first in-depth examination of the data from the 19th century at NOAA&#x27;s National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, a new record low was discovered. Mount Washington&#x27;s official record low of was recorded on January 22, 1885. The official record low daily maximum is on February 6, 1995. Highs of or below occur on 13 days annually, while lows at or below can be expected from November 17 through April 1; from December to March, temperatures rise above freezing () on only 15 days.

On January 16, 2004, the summit weather observation registered a temperature of and sustained winds of , resulting in a wind chill value of at the mountain. During a 71-hour period from approximately 3 p.m. on January 13 to 2 p.m. on January 16, 2004, the wind chill on the summit never went above . The official record high temperature at the summit is on June 26, 2003, and August 2, 1975, while the official record high daily minimum is , recorded on the latter date. Readings of or higher at the summit are seen an average of 13.5 days annually.

On February 3–4, 2023, overnight wind gusts of over and a temperature of combined to produce a new US record low windchill temperature of , breaking the previous figure of . Temperatures remained at or below -45 °F for 13 straight hours on February 3–4, 2023, and a -47 °F reading from the morning of February 4, 2023 was the coldest reading in 89 years, tying a previous record low observed in January 1934.

The primary summit building was designed to withstand winds; other structures are chained to the mountain. In addition to a number of broadcast towers, the mountain is the site of a non-profit scientific observatory reporting the weather as well as other aspects of the subarctic climate of the mountain. The extreme environment creates strong winds and ice at the top of Mount Washington making the use of unmanned equipment problematic. The observatory also conducts research, primarily the testing of new weather measurement devices. The Sherman Adams summit building, which houses the observatory, is closed to the public during the winter and hikers are not allowed inside the building except for pre-arranged guided tours.

In 1932, the Mount Washington Observatory was built on the summit through a group interested in and noting the worth of a research facility at that demanding location. The observatory&#x27;s weather data have accumulated a climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using a sling psychrometer, a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of the sling psychrometer has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.

The observatory makes prominent use of the slogan &quot;Home of the World&#x27;s Worst Weather&quot;, a claim that originated with a 1940 article in &quot;Appalachia&quot; magazine by Charles Brooks, the man generally given the majority of credit for creating the Mount Washington Observatory. The article was titled &quot;The Worst Weather in the World&quot; even though it concluded that Mount Washington most likely did not have the world&#x27;s worst weather.

=== Precipitation ===

Due in part to its high prominence, to its situation at the confluence of two major storm tracks, and to the north–south orientation of the Presidential Range ridgeline, which it crowns, Mount Washington receives high levels of precipitation, averaging an equivalent of of rain per year, with a record high for a calendar year of in 1969 and a low of in 1979. Monthly precipitation has ranged from in October 1947 to in October 2005. Large amounts of precipitation often fall in a short period of time: in October 1996, a record of precipitation fell during a single 24-hour period. A substantial amount of this falls as snow, with a seasonal average of around of snow; seasonal accumulation has ranged from in 1947–48 to in 1968–69. The record amount of snowfall in a 24-hour period, , occurred in February 1969, which is also the snowiest month on record with .

==Geographical features==
Although the western slope that the Cog Railway ascends is straightforward from base to summit, the mountain&#x27;s other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain&#x27;s largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater surrounded by the Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater&#x27;s southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.
East of the summit, a plateau known as the Alpine Gardens extends south from Chandler Ridge at about elevation. It is notable for plant species either endemic to alpine meadows in the White Mountains or outliers of larger populations in arctic regions far to the north. Alpine Gardens drops off precipitously into two prominent glacial cirques. Craggy Huntington Ravine offers rock and ice climbing in an alpine setting. More rounded Tuckerman Ravine is New England&#x27;s best-known site for spring back-country skiing as late as June and then a scenic hiking route.

South of the summit lies a second and larger alpine plateau, Bigelow Lawn, at to elevation. Satellite summit Boott Spur and then the Montalban Ridge including Mount Isolation and Mount Davis extend south from it, while the higher Southern Presidentials—Mounts Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower, Pierce, Jackson and Webster—extend southwest to Crawford Notch. Oakes Gulf separates the two high ridges.

==Uses==

The mountain is part of a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail traversing below the summit past one of the Appalachian Mountain Club&#x27;s eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain&#x27;s shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 50-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions that can occur above tree line.

The weather at Mount Washington has made it a site for glider flying. In 2005, it was recognized as the 14th National Landmark of Soaring.

===Hiking===

The most common hiking trail approach to the summit is via the Tuckerman Ravine Trail. It starts at the Pinkham Notch camp area and gains , leading straight up the bowl of Tuckerman Ravine via a series of steep rock steps that afford views of the ravine and across the notch to Wildcat Mountain. Fatalities have occurred on the trail, both from ski accidents and hypothermia. Water bottles may be refilled at the base of the bowl up the trail at a well pump near the Hermit Lake Shelters, which offers snacks, toilets and shelter. At the summit is a center with a museum, gift shop, observation area, cafeteria, and the Mount Washington Observatory. Other routes up the eastern slopes of the mountain include the Lion Head, Boott Spur, Huntington Ravine and Nelson Crag trails, as well as the Great Gulf Trail ascending from the northeast. Routes from the western slopes include the Ammonoosuc Ravine and Jewell trails and the Crawford Path and Gulfside Trail (coincident with the Appalachian Trail from the southwest and from the north, respectively).

There are many differences between climbing Mount Washington in summer and climbing it in winter. There are no public facilities on the summit in winter. In the winter months, the most common route is the Lion Head Winter Route, which begins on the Tuckerman Ravine Trail but then turns north to ascend up to Lion Head at elevation . The winter route variation is recommended to help climbers avoid avalanche danger. Exactly where the route turns from the Tuckerman Ravine Trail depends on the snow conditions. If the amount of snowfall has not been significant, the Lion Head Summer Route may be open. After hiking from the visitor center in Pinkham Notch, the trail will take a right turn onto the Lion Head Summer Route. If there has been enough snow accumulation on the summer Lion Head Trail, the Forest Service will open the Lion Head Winter Route, which turns off after approximately .

===Cog railway===

Since 1869, the Mount Washington Cog Railway has provided tourists with a train journey to the summit of Mount Washington. It uses a Marsh rack system and was the first successful rack railway in the US. The railway travels up the west side of the mountain.

===Auto Road===

The Mount Washington Auto Road—originally the Mount Washington Carriage Road—is a private toll road on the east side of the mountain, rising from an altitude of at the bottom to at the top, an average gradient of 11.6%. The road was completed and opened to the public in 1861, eight years before the Cog Railway. There are several annual races on the Auto Road.

===Races===
Every June, the mountain is the site of the Mount Washington Road Race, an event that attracts hundreds of runners. In August the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb, a bicycle race, takes place along the same route as the road race. The hillclimb&#x27;s notable contestants include former Tour de France contender Tyler Hamilton.

On August 7, 1932, Raymond E. Welch became the first one-legged man to climb Mount Washington. An official race was held and open only to one-legged people. Mr. Welch climbed the &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; route and descended via the carriage road. At the time of his climb, he was the station agent for the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad in Northumberland, New Hampshire.

The mountain is also the host to one of the oldest car races in the country, the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race, which has been held on and off since 1904. Travis Pastrana set record ascents in 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2021, driving a Subaru WRX STi to a record of five minutes and 28.67 seconds. In 2014 EVSR created by Entropy Racing was the first electric car to compete at Mt. Washington with an official time for driver Tim O&#x27;Neil of seven minutes and 28.92 seconds.

=== Backcountry skiing ===

Tuckerman Ravine, a glacial cirque on the mountain&#x27;s southeast side, is a popular backcountry skiing destination, attracting tens of thousands of skiers to the mountain each year. Skiers have skied down the headwall since 1931, first by two Dartmouth students, John Carleton and Charles Proctor, who were quickly followed by a group from Harvard who skied the headwall from the summit of Mount Washington for the first time. The ravine soon became an important site for extreme skiing in New England.

The mountain hosted the first giant slalom race in the United States in 1937, the Franklin Edson Memorial Race.

==Transmission facilities==
Due to its status as the highest elevation in the northeast United States, the top of the mountain is a popular site for stations that require transmission ranges over a broad territory, but which operate on frequencies that are generally limited to line-of-sight coverage. In 2003, it was reported that the summit was the site used &quot;for three commercial radio stations and dozens of state, federal and private agencies, including the state police&quot;.

Use of the mountain summit as a transmitter site dates to the 1930s. At this time investigations were begun into establishing radio stations broadcasting on &quot;Very High Frequency&quot; (VHF) assignments above 30 MHz. Reception of stations operating on these frequencies tended to be limited to line-of-sight distances, so operating from the top of Mount Washington was ideal for providing maximum coverage. As of 1938 it was reported that at least five experimental stations were located on the mountain.

The most prominent of the early experimental stations was W1XER, originally an &quot;Apex&quot; radio station licensed to the Yankee Network, that was moved from Boston to the mountain in 1937, and initially used to relay meteorological information from the weather observatory. With the aid of Edwin H. Armstrong, the station was converted from an AM transmitter into an FM broadcasting station, although the conversion process turned out to be an arduous undertaking, and W1XER did not start broadcast programming on a regular schedule until December 19, 1940. This station&#x27;s facilities included construction of the original broadcast tower, the Yankee Building housing the crew and transmitter equipment, and the first power house building. Commercial broadcasting commenced on April 5, 1941, initially with the call sign W39B. Effective November 1, 1943 the station call sign was changed to WMTW, and in late 1946 the call letters were changed again, to WMNE. WMNE ceased operations in late 1948, due to excessive maintenance costs, and concern that a mandatory frequency change to the new FM &quot;high band&quot; would cause an unacceptable decrease in transmission range.

In 1954 WMTW, channel 8, licensed to Poland Spring, Maine, constructed a TV tower and transmitter and began operations from the mountain, including local forecasts by (now retired) WMTW transmitter engineer Marty Engstrom. In its first decades, WMTW served as the ABC Network affiliate for the Portland, Burlington, Montreal and Sherbrooke television markets, thanks to its wide coverage area. This station relocated its transmitter away from the mountain in 2002, due to concerns that a mandated switch from analog to digital transmissions would result in insufficient coverage if the transmitter remained at the mountaintop.

There are currently two FM stations located at the mountain. 1958 saw the construction of WMTW-FM 94.9 MHz (now WHOM). A second station, WMOU (now WPKQ), moved to the summit in 1987, installing transmitters in the Yankee building and constructing a new broadcast tower behind the building, which is the tallest structure on the summit.

WHOM and WMTW-TV shared a transmitter building, which also housed the generators used to supply electrical power to the various facilities atop the mountain. However, on February 9, 2003, a major fire broke out in the generator room of the transmitter building, which had become the property of the state only a year earlier when WMTW left the summit. The fire destroyed the building, including WHOM&#x27;s transmitters as well as the summit&#x27;s main generators, and also spread to the adjacent Old Yankee Power House building, which housed the emergency generator, destroying that building also and disrupting all power to the summit. Temporary generators had to be transported up the mountain to restore power to the observatory and to the Yankee building, which houses important public safety communications equipment. A makeshift generator room was constructed underneath the canopy of the Sherman Adams building across from the public entrance to replace the destroyed buildings. The makeshift generator room was later made permanent when power cables were installed in 2009, delivering grid power to the summit for the first time.

The original Armstrong tower still stands today. The Yankee Building also remains and continues to serve as a communications facility, housing equipment for numerous tenants including cellular telephone providers and public safety agencies. The old sign from the destroyed Old Yankee Power House building was placed above the doorway to the new generator room. WHOM subsequently built a new transmitter building on the site of the old power building, and also installed a new standby antenna on the Armstrong tower. (For the first time since 1948, the Armstrong tower was used for broadcasts.)

The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Gray, Maine, operates NOAA Weather Radio station KZZ41 on 162.5 MHz from the summit of Mount Washington. The NWS coverage map indicates that it can be heard throughout most of New Hampshire, western Maine, northeast Vermont, and portions of southern Canada. During very clear conditions, KZZ41 has the potential to reach the majority of northern Massachusetts (including some northern areas of Greater Boston and much of the North Shore) as well as the majority of Vermont and Maine.

In June 2008, the possibility of television returning to Mount Washington arose, with the filing by New Hampshire Public Television to move WLED-TV from its current location near Littleton to the old WMTW mast on top.

==Deaths==

As of 2019, more than 161 people had died in the Presidential range, since record-keeping began in 1849. Author Nicholas Howe has detailed many of the fatalities on this mountain in his book &quot;Not Without Peril&quot; published in 2000 and updated in 2009. The foreword to the 2009 edition states that many of the deaths over the past 150 years can be attributed to poor planning and lack of understanding of &quot;the difference in weather between Boston and the mountains. The latter are farther north, farther inland and much higher than the city.&quot;

William Buckingham Curtis, often posthumously called &quot;the father of American amateur athletics&quot;, died from exhaustion on June 30, 1900, near Lakes of the Clouds Hut during a summer snowstorm.

==Artistic tributes==
Mount Washington has been the subject of several famous paintings, part of a New England school of art known as White Mountain art. Inspired by the Hudson River School of landscape painting, a number of artists during the Victorian era ventured into the White Mountains in search of natural subjects. Train service in the area spurred increased tourism and the construction of the Glen House where Albert Bierstadt and his photographer brother (Bierstadt Brothers) stayed. John P. Soule, John B. Heywood and the Kilburn Brothers also produced stereographic images of scenery in the area.

<doc id="156962" wikidata="Q12073245" url="?curid=156962" title="X-ray scattering techniques">
<text>X-ray scattering techniques are a family of non-destructive analytical techniques which reveal information about the crystal structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of materials and thin films. These techniques are based on observing the scattered intensity of an X-ray beam hitting a sample as a function of incident and scattered angle, polarization, and wavelength or energy.

Note that X-ray diffraction is sometimes considered a sub-set of X-ray scattering, where the scattering is elastic and the scattering object is crystalline, so that the resulting pattern contains sharp spots analyzed by X-ray crystallography (as in the Figure). However, both scattering and diffraction are related general phenomena and the distinction has not always existed. Thus Guinier&#x27;s classic text from 1963 is titled &quot;X-ray diffraction in Crystals, Imperfect Crystals and Amorphous Bodies&quot; so &#x27;diffraction&#x27; was clearly not restricted to crystals at that time.

==Scattering techniques==

===Elastic scattering===
* X-ray diffraction, sometimes called Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
* Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) probes structure in the nanometer to micrometer range by measuring scattering intensity at scattering angles 2θ close to 0°.
* X-ray reflectivity is an analytical technique for determining thickness, roughness, and density of single layer and multilayer thin films.
* Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), a technique concentrating on scattering angles 2θ larger than 5°.
===Inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS)===
In IXS the energy and angle of inelastically scattered X-rays are monitored, giving the dynamic structure factor formula_1. From this many properties of materials can be obtained, the specific property depending on the scale of the energy transfer. The table below, listing techniques, is adapted from. Inelastically scattered X-rays have intermediate phases and so in principle are not useful for X-ray crystallography. In practice X-rays with small energy transfers are included with the diffraction spots due to elastic scattering, and X-rays with large energy transfers contribute to the background noise in the diffraction pattern.

<doc id="156964" wikidata="Q310899" url="?curid=156964" title="MicroRNA">
<text>Micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA, miRNA, μRNA) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules containing 21–23 nucleotides. Found in plants, animals, and even some viruses, miRNAs are involved in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs base-pair to complementary sequences in messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, then silence said mRNA molecules by one or more of the following processes:

* Cleaving the mRNA strand into two pieces.
* Destabilizing the mRNA by shortening its poly(A) tail.
* Reducing translation of the mRNA into proteins.

In cells of humans and other animals, miRNAs primarily act by destabilizing the mRNA.

miRNAs resemble the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short stem-loops (hairpins), whereas siRNAs derive from longer regions of double-stranded RNA. The human genome may encode over 1900 miRNAs, However, only about 500 human miRNAs represent &quot;bona fide&quot; miRNAs in the manually curated miRNA gene database MirGeneDB.

miRNAs are abundant in many mammalian cell types. They appear to target about 60% of the genes of humans and other mammals. Many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, which implies that they have important biological functions. For example, 90 families of miRNAs have been conserved since at least the common ancestor of mammals and fish, and most of these conserved miRNAs have important functions, as shown by studies in which genes for one or more members of a family have been knocked out in mice.

In 2024, American scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the discovery of miRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

==History==
The first miRNA was discovered in the early 1990s. However, they were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s. Research revealed different sets of miRNAs expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for miRNAs in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes. Aberrant miRNA expression are implicated in disease states. MiRNA-based therapies are under investigation.

The first miRNA was discovered in 1993 by a group led by Victor Ambros and including Lee and Feinbaum. However, additional insight into its mode of action required simultaneously published work by Gary Ruvkun&#x27;s team, including Wightman and Ha. These groups published back-to-back papers on the &quot;lin-4&quot; gene, which was known to control the timing of &quot;C. elegans&quot; larval development by repressing the &quot;lin-14&quot; gene. When Lee et al. isolated the &quot;lin-4&quot; miRNA, they found that instead of producing an mRNA encoding a protein, it produced short non-coding RNAs, one of which was a ~22-nucleotide RNA that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3&#x27; UTR of the &quot;lin-14&quot; mRNA. This complementarity was proposed to inhibit the translation of the &quot;lin-14&quot; mRNA into the LIN-14 protein. At the time, the &quot;lin-4&quot; small RNA was thought to be a nematode idiosyncrasy.

In 2000, a second small RNA was characterized: &quot;let-7&quot; RNA, which represses &quot;lin-41&quot; to promote a later developmental transition in &quot;C. elegans&quot;. The &quot;let-7&quot; RNA was found to be conserved in many species, leading to the suggestion that &quot;let-7&quot; RNA and additional &quot;small temporal RNAs&quot; might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals, including humans.

A year later, the &quot;lin-4&quot; and &quot;let-7&quot; RNAs were found to be part of a large class of small RNAs present in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot; and human cells. The many RNAs of this class resembled the &quot;lin-4&quot; and &quot;let-7&quot; RNAs, except their expression patterns were usually inconsistent with a role in regulating the timing of development. This suggested that most might function in other types of regulatory pathways. At this point, researchers started using the term &quot;microRNA&quot; to refer to this class of small regulatory RNAs.

The first human disease associated with deregulation of miRNAs was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this disorder, the miRNAs have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes.

==Nomenclature==
Under a standard nomenclature system, names are assigned to experimentally confirmed miRNAs before publication. The prefix &quot;miR&quot; is followed by a dash and a number, the latter often indicating order of naming. For example, miR-124 was named and likely discovered prior to miR-456. A capitalized &quot;miR-&quot; refers to the mature form of the miRNA, while the uncapitalized &quot;mir-&quot; refers to the pre-miRNA and the -miRNA. The genes encoding miRNAs are also named using the same three-letter prefix according to the conventions of the organism gene nomenclature. For examples, the official miRNAs gene names in some organisms are &quot;&quot;mir-1&quot; in &quot;C. elegans&quot; and &quot;Drosophila,&quot; &quot;Mir1&quot; in &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; and &quot;MIR25&quot; in human.

miRNAs with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter. For example, miR-124a is closely related to miR-124b. For example:
: : 

Pre-miRNAs, -miRNAs and genes that lead to 100% identical mature miRNAs but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix. For example, the pre-miRNAs -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature miRNA (-miR-194) but are from genes located in different genome regions.

Species of origin is designated with a three-letter prefix, e.g., -miR-124 is a human (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) miRNA and oar-miR-124 is a sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) miRNA. Other common prefixes include &quot;v&quot; for viral (miRNA encoded by a viral genome) and &quot;d&quot; for &quot;Drosophila&quot; miRNA (a fruit fly commonly studied in genetic research).

When two mature microRNAs originate from opposite arms of the same pre-miRNA and are found in roughly similar amounts, they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix. (In the past, this distinction was also made with &quot;s&quot; (sense) and &quot;as&quot; (antisense)). However, the mature microRNA found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm, in which case, an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite arm of a hairpin. For example, miR-124 and miR-124* share a pre-miRNA hairpin, but much more miR-124 is found in the cell.

==Targets==
Plant miRNAs usually have near-perfect pairing with their mRNA targets, which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts. In contrast, animal miRNAs are able to recognize their target mRNAs by using as few as 6–8 nucleotides (the seed region) at the 5&#x27; end of the miRNA, which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mRNAs. Combinatorial regulation is a feature of miRNA regulation in animals. A given miRNA may have hundreds of different mRNA targets, and a given target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs.

Estimates of the average number of unique messenger RNAs that are targets for repression by a typical miRNA vary, depending on the estimation method, but multiple approaches show that mammalian miRNAs can have many unique targets. For example, an analysis of the miRNAs highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has, on average, roughly 400 conserved targets. Likewise, experiments show that a single miRNA species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger RNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (much less than 2-fold).

==Biogenesis==
As many as 40% of miRNA genes may lie in the introns or even exons of other genes. These are usually, though not exclusively, found in a sense orientation, and thus usually are regulated together with their host genes.

The DNA template is not the final word on mature miRNA production: 6% of human miRNAs show RNA editing (IsomiRs), the site-specific modification of RNA sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their DNA. This increases the diversity and scope of miRNA action beyond that implicated from the genome alone.

===Transcription===
miRNA genes are usually transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The polymerase often binds to a promoter found near the DNA sequence, encoding what will become the hairpin loop of the pre-miRNA. The resulting transcript is capped with a specially modified nucleotide at the 5&#x27; end, polyadenylated with multiple adenosines (a poly(A) tail), and spliced. Animal miRNAs are initially transcribed as part of one arm of an ~80 nucleotide RNA hairpin that in turn forms part of a several hundred nucleotide-long miRNA precursor termed a pri-miRNA. When a hairpin precursor is found in the 3&#x27; UTR, a transcript may serve as a pri-miRNA and a mRNA. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes some miRNAs, especially those with upstream Alu sequences, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and mammalian wide interspersed repeat (MWIR) promoter units.

===Nuclear processing===
A single pri-miRNA may contain from one to six miRNA precursors. These hairpin loop structures are composed of about 70 nucleotides each. Each hairpin is flanked by sequences necessary for efficient processing.

The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure of the hairpins in a pri-miRNA is recognized by a nuclear protein known as DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8 or &quot;Pasha&quot; in invertebrates), named for its association with DiGeorge Syndrome. DGCR8 associates with the enzyme Drosha, a protein that cuts RNA, to form the Microprocessor complex. In this complex, DGCR8 orients the catalytic RNase III domain of Drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-miRNAs by cleaving RNA about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base (one helical dsRNA turn into the stem). The product resulting has a two-nucleotide overhang at its 3&#x27; end; it has 3&#x27; hydroxyl and 5&#x27; phosphate groups. It is often termed as a pre-miRNA (precursor-miRNA). Sequence motifs downstream of the pre-miRNA that are important for efficient processing have been identified.

Pre-miRNAs that are spliced directly out of introns, bypassing the Microprocessor complex, are known as &quot;mirtrons.&quot; Mirtrons have been found in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, and mammals.

As many as 16% of pre-miRNAs may be altered through nuclear RNA editing. Most commonly, enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze adenosine to inosine (A to I) transitions. RNA editing can halt nuclear processing (for example, of pri-miR-142, leading to degradation by the ribonuclease Tudor-SN) and alter downstream processes including cytoplasmic miRNA processing and target specificity (e.g., by changing the seed region of miR-376 in the central nervous system).

===Nuclear export===
Pre-miRNA hairpins are exported from the nucleus in a process involving the nucleocytoplasmic shuttler Exportin-5. This protein, a member of the karyopherin family, recognizes a two-nucleotide overhang left by the RNase III enzyme Drosha at the 3&#x27; end of the pre-miRNA hairpin. Exportin-5-mediated transport to the cytoplasm is energy-dependent, using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound to the Ran protein.

===Cytoplasmic processing===
In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer. This endoribonuclease interacts with 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends of the hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; arms, yielding an imperfect miRNA:miRNA* duplex about 22 nucleotides in length. Overall hairpin length and loop size influence the efficiency of Dicer processing. The imperfect nature of the miRNA:miRNA* pairing also affects cleavage. Some of the G-rich pre-miRNAs can potentially adopt the G-quadruplex structure as an alternative to the canonical hairpin structure. For example, human pre-miRNA 92b adopts a G-quadruplex structure which is resistant to the Dicer mediated cleavage in the cytoplasm. Although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional miRNA, only one strand is usually incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where the miRNA and its mRNA target interact.

While the majority of miRNAs are located within the cell, some miRNAs, commonly known as circulating miRNAs or extracellular miRNAs, have also been found in extracellular environment, including various biological fluids and cell culture media.

===Biogenesis in plants===
miRNA biogenesis in plants differs from animal biogenesis mainly in the steps of nuclear processing and export. Instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes, once inside and once outside the nucleus, both cleavages of the plant miRNA are performed by a Dicer homolog, called Dicer-like1 (DL1). DL1 is expressed only in the nucleus of plant cells, which indicates that both reactions take place inside the nucleus. Before plant miRNA:miRNA* duplexes are transported out of the nucleus, its 3&#x27; overhangs are methylated by a RNA methyltransferaseprotein called Hua-Enhancer1 (HEN1). The duplex is then transported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm by a protein called Hasty (HST), an Exportin 5 homolog, where they disassemble and the mature miRNA is incorporated into the RISC.

==RNA-induced silencing complex==
The mature miRNA is part of an active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing Dicer and many associated proteins. RISC is also known as a microRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (miRNP); A RISC with incorporated miRNA is sometimes referred to as a &quot;miRISC.&quot;

Dicer processing of the pre-miRNA is thought to be coupled with unwinding of the duplex. Generally, only one strand is incorporated into the miRISC, selected on the basis of its thermodynamic instability and weaker base-pairing on the 5&#x27; end relative to the other strand. The position of the hairpin may also influence strand choice. The other strand, called the passenger strand due to its lower levels in the steady state, is denoted with an asterisk (*) and is normally degraded. In some cases, both strands of the duplex are viable and become functional miRNA that target different mRNA populations.

Members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family are central to RISC function. Argonautes are needed for miRNA-induced silencing and contain two conserved RNA binding domains: a PAZ domain that can bind the single stranded 3&#x27; end of the mature miRNA and a PIWI domain that structurally resembles ribonuclease-H and functions to interact with the 5&#x27; end of the guide strand. They bind the mature miRNA and orient it for interaction with a target mRNA. Some argonautes, for example human Ago2, cleave target transcripts directly; argonautes may also recruit additional proteins to achieve translational repression. The human genome encodes eight argonaute proteins divided by sequence similarities into two families: AGO (with four members present in all mammalian cells and called E1F2C/hAgo in humans), and PIWI (found in the germline and hematopoietic stem cells).

Additional RISC components include TRBP [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivating response RNA (TAR) binding protein], PACT (protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase), the SMN complex, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), Tudor staphylococcal nuclease-domain-containing protein (Tudor-SN), the putative DNA helicase MOV10, and the RNA recognition motif containing protein TNRC6B.

===Mode of silencing and regulatory loops===
Gene silencing may occur either via mRNA degradation or preventing mRNA from being translated. For example, miR16 contains a sequence complementary to the AU-rich element found in the 3&#x27;UTR of many unstable mRNAs, such as TNF alpha or GM-CSF. It has been demonstrated that given complete complementarity between the miRNA and target mRNA sequence, Ago2 can cleave the mRNA and lead to direct mRNA degradation. In the absence of complementarity, silencing is achieved by preventing translation. The relation of miRNA and its target mRNA can be based on the simple negative regulation of a target mRNA, but it seems that a common scenario is the use of a &quot;coherent feed-forward loop&quot;, &quot;mutual negative feedback loop&quot; (also termed double negative loop) and &quot;positive feedback/feed-forward loop&quot;. Some miRNAs work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription, translation and protein stability. Such regulation is typically achieved by the virtue of negative feedback loops or incoherent feed-forward loop uncoupling protein output from mRNA transcription.

==Turnover==
Turnover of mature miRNA is needed for rapid changes in miRNA expression profiles. During miRNA maturation in the cytoplasm, uptake by the Argonaute protein is thought to stabilize the guide strand, while the opposite (* or &quot;passenger&quot;) strand is preferentially destroyed. In what has been called a &quot;Use it or lose it&quot; strategy, Argonaute may preferentially retain miRNAs with many targets over miRNAs with few or no targets, leading to degradation of the non-targeting molecules.

Decay of mature miRNAs in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; is mediated by the 5&#x27;-to-3&#x27; exoribonuclease XRN2, also known as Rat1p. In plants, SDN (small RNA degrading nuclease) family members degrade miRNAs in the opposite (3&#x27;-to-5&#x27;) direction. Similar enzymes are encoded in animal genomes, but their roles have not been described.

Several miRNA modifications affect miRNA stability. As indicated by work in the model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (thale cress), mature plant miRNAs appear to be stabilized by the addition of methyl moieties at the 3&#x27; end. The 2&#x27;-O-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil (U) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes, a modification that may be associated with miRNA degradation. However, uridylation may also protect some miRNAs; the consequences of this modification are incompletely understood. Uridylation of some animal miRNAs has been reported. Both plant and animal miRNAs may be altered by addition of adenine (A) residues to the 3&#x27; end of the miRNA. An extra A added to the end of mammalian miR-122, a liver-enriched miRNA important in hepatitis C, stabilizes the molecule and plant miRNAs ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates.

==Cellular functions==
The function of miRNAs appears to be in gene regulation. For that purpose, a miRNA is complementary to a part of one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Animal miRNAs are usually complementary to a site in the 3&#x27; UTR whereas plant miRNAs are usually complementary to coding regions of mRNAs. Perfect or near perfect base pairing with the target RNA promotes cleavage of the RNA. This is the primary mode of plant miRNAs. In animals the match-ups are imperfect.

For partially complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its &#x27;seed region&#x27;) must be perfectly complementary. Animal miRNAs inhibit protein translation of the target mRNA (this is present but less common in plants). Partially complementary microRNAs can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. While degradation of miRNA-targeted mRNA is well documented, whether or not translational repression is accomplished through mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, or a combination of the two is hotly debated. Recent work on miR-430 in zebrafish, as well as on bantam-miRNA and miR-9 in &quot;Drosophila&quot; cultured cells, shows that translational repression is caused by the disruption of translation initiation, independent of mRNA deadenylation.

miRNAs occasionally also cause histone modification and DNA methylation of promoter sites, which affects the expression of target genes.

Nine mechanisms of miRNA action are described and assembled in a unified mathematical model:
* Cap-40S initiation inhibition;
* 60S Ribosomal unit joining inhibition;
* Elongation inhibition;
* Ribosome drop-off (premature termination);
* Co-translational nascent protein degradation;
* Sequestration in P-bodies;
* mRNA decay (destabilisation);
* mRNA cleavage;
* Transcriptional inhibition through microRNA-mediated chromatin reorganization followed by gene silencing.
It is often impossible to discern these mechanisms using experimental data about stationary reaction rates. Nevertheless, they are differentiated in dynamics and have different &quot;kinetic signatures&quot;.

Unlike plant microRNAs, the animal microRNAs target diverse genes. However, genes involved in functions common to all cells, such as gene expression, have relatively fewer microRNA target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by microRNAs. There is a strong correlation between &quot;ITPR&quot; gene regulations and mir-92 and mir-19.

dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed &quot;small RNA-induced gene activation&quot; or RNAa. dsRNAs targeting gene promoters can induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. This was demonstrated in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs termed small activating RNAs (saRNAs), but has also been demonstrated for endogenous microRNA.

Interactions between microRNAs and complementary sequences on genes and even pseudogenes that share sequence homology are thought to be a back channel of communication regulating expression levels between paralogous genes (genes having a similar structure indicating divergence from a common ancestral gene). Given the name &quot;competing endogenous RNAs&quot; (ceRNAs), these microRNAs bind to &quot;microRNA response elements&quot; on genes and pseudogenes and may provide another explanation for the persistence of non-coding DNA.

miRNAs are also found as extracellular circulating miRNAs. Circulating miRNAs are released into body fluids including blood and cerebrospinal fluid and have the potential to be available as biomarkers in a number of diseases. Some researches show that mRNA cargo of exosomes may have a role in implantation, they can savage an adhesion between trophoblast and endometrium or support the adhesion by down regulating or up regulating expression of genes involved in adhesion/invasion.

Moreover, miRNA as miR-183/96/182 seems to play a key role in circadian rhythm.

==Evolution==
miRNAs are well conserved in both plants and animals, and are thought to be a vital and evolutionarily ancient component of gene regulation. While core components of the microRNA pathway are conserved between plants and animals, miRNA repertoires in the two kingdoms appear to have emerged independently with different primary modes of action.

microRNAs are useful phylogenetic markers because of their apparently low rate of evolution. microRNAs&#x27; origin as a regulatory mechanism developed from previous RNAi machinery that was initially used as a defense against exogenous genetic material such as viruses. Their origin may have permitted the development of morphological innovation, and by making gene expression more specific and &#x27;fine-tunable&#x27;, permitted the genesis of complex organs and perhaps, ultimately, complex life. Rapid bursts of morphological innovation are generally associated with a high rate of microRNA accumulation.

New microRNAs are created in multiple ways. Novel microRNAs can originate from the random formation of hairpins in &quot;non-coding&quot; sections of DNA (i.e. introns or intergene regions), but also by the duplication and modification of existing microRNAs. microRNAs can also form from inverted duplications of protein-coding sequences, which allows for the creation of a foldback hairpin structure. The rate of evolution (i.e. nucleotide substitution) in recently originated microRNAs is comparable to that elsewhere in the non-coding DNA, implying evolution by neutral drift; however, older microRNAs have a much lower rate of change (often less than one substitution per hundred million years), suggesting that once a microRNA gains a function, it undergoes purifying selection. Individual regions within an miRNA gene face different evolutionary pressures, where regions that are vital for processing and function have higher levels of conservation. At this point, a microRNA is rarely lost from an animal&#x27;s genome, although newer microRNAs (thus presumably non-functional) are frequently lost. In &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, the net flux of miRNA genes has been predicted to be between 1.2 and 3.3 genes per million years. This makes them a valuable phylogenetic marker, and they are being looked upon as a possible solution to outstanding phylogenetic problems such as the relationships of arthropods. On the other hand, in multiple cases microRNAs correlate poorly with phylogeny, and it is possible that their phylogenetic concordance largely reflects a limited sampling of microRNAs.

microRNAs feature in the genomes of most eukaryotic organisms, from the brown algae to the animals. However, the difference in how these microRNAs function and the way they are processed suggests that microRNAs arose independently in plants and animals.

Focusing on the animals, the genome of &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot; appears to lack recognizable microRNAs, as well as the nuclear proteins Drosha and Pasha, which are critical to canonical microRNA biogenesis. It is the only animal thus far reported to be missing Drosha. MicroRNAs play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression in all non-ctenophore animals investigated thus far except for &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;, the first known member of the phylum Placozoa.

Across all species, in excess of 5000 different miRNAs had been identified by March 2010. Whilst short RNA sequences (50 – hundreds of base pairs) of a broadly comparable function occur in bacteria, bacteria lack true microRNAs.

==Experimental detection and manipulation==
While researchers focused on miRNA expression in physiological and pathological processes, various technical variables related to microRNA isolation emerged. The stability of stored miRNA samples has been questioned. microRNAs degrade much more easily than mRNAs, partly due to their length, but also because of ubiquitously present RNases. This makes it necessary to cool samples on ice and use RNase-free equipment.

microRNA expression can be quantified in a two-step polymerase chain reaction process of modified RT-PCR followed by quantitative PCR. Variations of this method achieve absolute or relative quantification. miRNAs can also be hybridized to microarrays, slides or chips with probes to hundreds or thousands of miRNA targets, so that relative levels of miRNAs can be determined in different samples. microRNAs can be both discovered and profiled by high-throughput sequencing methods (microRNA sequencing). The activity of an miRNA can be experimentally inhibited using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligo, a Morpholino oligo or a 2&#x27;-O-methyl RNA oligo. A specific miRNA can be silenced by a complementary antagomir. microRNA maturation can be inhibited at several points by steric-blocking oligos. The miRNA target site of an mRNA transcript can also be blocked by a steric-blocking oligo. For the &quot;in situ&quot; detection of miRNA, LNA or Morpholino probes can be used. The locked conformation of LNA results in enhanced hybridization properties and increases sensitivity and selectivity, making it ideal for detection of short miRNA.

High-throughput quantification of miRNAs is error prone, for the larger variance (compared to mRNAs) that comes with methodological problems. mRNA-expression is therefore often analyzed to check for miRNA-effects in their levels (e.g. in). Databases can be used to pair mRNA- and miRNA-data that predict miRNA-targets based on their base sequence. While this is usually done after miRNAs of interest have been detected (e. g. because of high expression levels), ideas for analysis tools that integrate mRNA- and miRNA-expression information have been proposed.

==Human and animal diseases==
Just as miRNA is involved in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells, so has dysregulation of miRNA been associated with disease. A manually curated, publicly available database, miR2Disease, documents known relationships between miRNA dysregulation and human disease.

===Inherited diseases===
A mutation in the seed region of miR-96 causes hereditary progressive hearing loss.

A mutation in the seed region of miR-184 causes hereditary keratoconus with anterior polar cataract.

Deletion of the miR-17~92 cluster causes skeletal and growth defects.

===Cancer===
The first human disease known to be associated with miRNA deregulation was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Many other miRNAs also have links with cancer and accordingly are sometimes referred to as &quot;oncomirs&quot;. In malignant B cells miRNAs participate in pathways fundamental to B cell development like B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling, B-cell migration/adhesion, cell-cell interactions in immune niches and the production and class-switching of immunoglobulins. MiRNAs influence B cell maturation, generation of pre-, marginal zone, follicular, B1, plasma and memory B cells.

Another role for miRNA in cancers is to use their expression level for prognosis. In NSCLC samples, low miR-324a levels may serve as an indicator of poor survival. Either high miR-185 or low miR-133b levels may correlate with metastasis and poor survival in colorectal cancer.

Furthermore, specific miRNAs may be associated with certain histological subtypes of colorectal cancer. For instance, expression levels of miR-205 and miR-373 have been shown to be increased in mucinous colorectal cancers and mucin-producing Ulcerative Colitis-associated colon cancers, but not in sporadic colonic adenocarcinoma that lack mucinous components. In-vitro studies suggested that miR-205 and miR-373 may functionally induce different features of mucinous-associated neoplastic progression in intestinal epithelial cells.

Hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation may arise from miR-21 interaction with MAP2K3, a tumor repressor gene. Optimal treatment for cancer involves accurately identifying patients for risk-stratified therapy. Those with a rapid response to initial treatment may benefit from truncated treatment regimens, showing the value of accurate disease response measures. Cell-free circulating miRNAs (cimiRNAs) are highly stable in blood, are overexpressed in cancer and are quantifiable within the diagnostic laboratory. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, plasma miR-21, miR-494, and miR-1973 are promising disease response biomarkers. Circulating miRNAs have the potential to assist clinical decision making and aid interpretation of positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography. They can be performed at each consultation to assess disease response and detect relapse.

MicroRNAs have the potential to be used as tools or targets for treatment of different cancers. The specific microRNA, miR-506 has been found to work as a tumor antagonist in several studies. A significant number of cervical cancer samples were found to have downregulated expression of miR-506. Additionally, miR-506 works to promote apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, through its direct target hedgehog pathway transcription factor, Gli3.

===DNA repair and cancer===
Many miRNAs can directly target and inhibit cell cycle genes to control cell proliferation. A new strategy for tumor treatment is to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by repairing the defective miRNA pathway in tumors.
Cancer is caused by the accumulation of mutations from either DNA damage or uncorrected errors in DNA replication. Defects in DNA repair cause the accumulation of mutations, which can lead to cancer. Several genes involved in DNA repair are regulated by microRNAs.

Germline mutations in DNA repair genes cause only 2–5% of colon cancer cases. However, altered expression of microRNAs, causing DNA repair deficiencies, are frequently associated with cancers and may be an important causal factor. Among 68 sporadic colon cancers with reduced expression of the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1, most were found to be deficient due to epigenetic methylation of the CpG island of the MLH1 gene. However, up to 15% of MLH1-deficiencies in sporadic colon cancers appeared to be due to over-expression of the microRNA miR-155, which represses MLH1 expression.

In 29–66% of glioblastomas, DNA repair is deficient due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, which reduces protein expression of MGMT. However, for 28% of glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient, but the MGMT promoter is not methylated. In glioblastomas without methylated MGMT promoters, the level of microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3&#x27;UTR (the three prime untranslated region of MGMT mRNA). Thus, in 28% of glioblastomas, increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA repair enzyme MGMT may be a causal factor.

HMGA proteins (HMGA1a, HMGA1b and HMGA2) are implicated in cancer, and expression of these proteins is regulated by microRNAs. HMGA expression is almost undetectable in differentiated adult tissues, but is elevated in many cancers. HMGA proteins are polypeptides of ~100 amino acid residues characterized by a modular sequence organization. These proteins have three highly positively charged regions, termed AT hooks, that bind the minor groove of AT-rich DNA stretches in specific regions of DNA. Human neoplasias, including thyroid, prostatic, cervical, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas, show a strong increase of HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins. Transgenic mice with HMGA1 targeted to lymphoid cells develop aggressive lymphoma, showing that high HMGA1 expression is associated with cancers and that HMGA1 can act as an oncogene. HMGA2 protein specifically targets the promoter of ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though the extent to which HGMA2 was involved is not known).

Single Nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter the binding of miRNAs on 3&#x27;UTRs for example the case of hsa-mir181a and hsa-mir181b on the CDON tumor suppressor gene.

===Heart disease===
The global role of miRNA function in the heart has been addressed by conditionally inhibiting miRNA maturation in the murine heart. This revealed that miRNAs play an essential role during its development. miRNA expression profiling studies demonstrate that expression levels of specific miRNAs change in diseased human hearts, pointing to their involvement in cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, animal studies on specific miRNAs identified distinct roles for miRNAs both during heart development and under pathological conditions, including the regulation of key factors important for cardiogenesis, the hypertrophic growth response and cardiac conductance. Another role for miRNA in cardiovascular diseases is to use their expression levels for diagnosis, prognosis or risk stratification. miRNA&#x27;s in animal models have also been linked to cholesterol metabolism and regulation.

====miRNA-712====
Murine microRNA-712 is a potential biomarker (i.e. predictor) for atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular disease of the arterial wall associated with lipid retention and inflammation. Non-laminar blood flow also correlates with development of atherosclerosis as mechanosenors of endothelial cells respond to the shear force of disturbed flow (d-flow). A number of pro-atherogenic genes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are upregulated by d-flow, mediating pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals. These findings were observed in ligated carotid arteries of mice to mimic the effects of d-flow. Within 24 hours, pre-existing immature miR-712 formed mature miR-712 suggesting that miR-712 is flow-sensitive. Coinciding with these results, miR-712 is also upregulated in endothelial cells exposed to naturally occurring d-flow in the greater curvature of the aortic arch.

====Origin====
Pre-mRNA sequence of miR-712 is generated from the murine ribosomal RN45s gene at the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2). XRN1 is an exonuclease that degrades the ITS2 region during processing of RN45s. Reduction of XRN1 under d-flow&quot; &quot;conditions therefore leads to the accumulation of miR-712.

====Mechanism====
MiR-712 targets tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). TIMPs normally regulate activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM). Arterial ECM is mainly composed of collagen and elastin fibers, providing the structural support and recoil properties of arteries. These fibers play a critical role in regulation of vascular inflammation and permeability, which are important in the development of atherosclerosis. Expressed by endothelial cells, TIMP3 is the only ECM-bound TIMP. A decrease in TIMP3 expression results in an increase of ECM degradation in the presence of d-flow. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of pre-miR712 increases expression of TIMP3 in cells, even when exposed to turbulent flow.

TIMP3 also decreases the expression of TNFα (a pro-inflammatory regulator) during turbulent flow. Activity of TNFα in turbulent flow was measured by the expression of TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) in blood. TNFα decreased if miR-712 was inhibited or TIMP3 overexpressed, suggesting that miR-712 and TIMP3 regulate TACE activity in turbulent flow conditions.

Anti-miR-712 effectively suppresses d-flow-induced miR-712 expression and increases TIMP3 expression. Anti-miR-712 also inhibits vascular hyperpermeability, thereby significantly reducing atherosclerosis lesion development and immune cell infiltration.

====Human homolog microRNA-205====

The human homolog of miR-712 was found on the RN45s homolog gene, which maintains similar miRNAs to mice. MiR-205 of humans share similar sequences with miR-712 of mice and is conserved across most vertebrates. MiR-205 and miR-712 also share more than 50% of the cell signaling targets, including TIMP3.

When tested, d-flow decreased the expression of XRN1 in humans as it did in mice endothelial cells, indicating a potentially common role of XRN1 in humans.

===Kidney disease===
Targeted deletion of Dicer in the FoxD1-derived renal progenitor cells in a murine model resulted in a complex renal phenotype including expansion of nephron progenitors, fewer renin cells, smooth muscle arterioles, progressive mesangial loss and glomerular aneurysms. High throughput whole transcriptome profiling of the FoxD1-Dicer knockout mouse model revealed ectopic upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2L11 (Bim) and dysregulation of the p53 pathway with increase in p53 effector genes including Bax, Trp53inp1, Jun, Cdkn1a, Mmp2, and Arid3a. p53 protein levels remained unchanged, suggesting that FoxD1 stromal miRNAs directly repress p53-effector genes. Using a lineage tracing approach followed by Fluorescent-activated cell sorting, miRNA profiling of the FoxD1-derived cells not only comprehensively defined the transcriptional landscape of miRNAs that are critical for vascular development, but also identified key miRNAs that are likely to modulate the renal phenotype in its absence. These miRNAs include miRs-10a, 18a, 19b, 24, 30c, 92a, 106a, 130a, 152, 181a, 214, 222, 302a, 370, and 381 that regulate Bcl2L11 (Bim) and miRs-15b, 18a, 21, 30c, 92a, 106a, 125b-5p, 145, 214, 222, 296-5p and 302a that regulate p53-effector genes. Consistent with the profiling results, ectopic apoptosis was observed in the cellular derivatives of the FoxD1 derived progenitor lineage and reiterates the importance of renal stromal miRNAs in cellular homeostasis.

===Nervous system===
MiRNAs are crucial for the healthy development and function of the nervous system. Previous studies demonstrate that miRNAs can regulate neuronal differentiation and maturation at various stages. MiRNAs also play important roles in synaptic development (such as dendritogenesis or spine morphogenesis) and synaptic plasticity (contributing to learning and memory). Elimination of miRNA formation in mice by experimental silencing of Dicer has led to pathological outcomes, such as reduced neuronal size, motor abnormalities (when silenced in striatal neurons), and neurodegeneration (when silenced in forebrain neurons). Altered miRNA expression has been found in neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Huntington&#x27;s disease) as well as many psychiatric disorders (including epilepsy, schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders).

====Stroke====
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability in America. 87% of the cases are ischemic strokes, which results from blockage in the artery of the brain that carries oxygen-rich blood. The obstruction of the blood flow means the brain cannot receive necessary nutrients, such as oxygen and glucose, and remove wastes, such as carbon dioxide. miRNAs plays a role in posttranslational gene silencing by targeting genes in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, such as the inflammatory, angiogenesis, and apoptotic pathway. 

====Alcoholism====
The vital role of miRNAs in gene expression is significant to addiction, specifically alcoholism. Chronic alcohol abuse results in persistent changes in brain function mediated in part by alterations in gene expression. miRNA global regulation of many downstream genes deems significant regarding the reorganization or synaptic connections or long term neural adaptations involving the behavioral change from alcohol consumption to withdrawal and/or dependence. Up to 35 different miRNAs have been found to be altered in the alcoholic post-mortem brain, all of which target genes that include the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adhesion, nervous system development and cell signaling. Altered miRNA levels were found in the medial prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent mice, suggesting the role of miRNA in orchestrating translational imbalances and the creation of differentially expressed proteins within an area of the brain where complex cognitive behavior and decision making likely originate.

miRNAs can be either upregulated or downregulated in response to chronic alcohol use. miR-206 expression increased in the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent rats, targeting the transcription factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ultimately reducing its expression. BDNF plays a critical role in the formation and maturation of new neurons and synapses, suggesting a possible implication in synapse growth/synaptic plasticity in alcohol abusers. miR-155, important in regulating alcohol-induced neuroinflammation responses, was found to be upregulated, suggesting the role of microglia and inflammatory cytokines in alcohol pathophysiology. Downregulation of miR-382 was found in the nucleus accumbens, a structure in the basal forebrain significant in regulating feelings of reward that power motivational habits. miR-382 is the target for the dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and its overexpression results in the upregulation of DRD1 and delta fosB, a transcription factor that activates a series of transcription events in the nucleus accumbens that ultimately result in addictive behaviors. Alternatively, overexpressing miR-382 resulted in attenuated drinking and the inhibition of DRD1 and delta fosB upregulation in rat models of alcoholism, demonstrating the possibility of using miRNA-targeted pharmaceuticals in treatments.

===Obesity===
miRNAs play crucial roles in the regulation of stem cell progenitors differentiating into adipocytes. Studies to determine what role pluripotent stem cells play in adipogenesis, were examined in the immortalized human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line hMSC-Tert20. Decreased expression of miR-155, miR-221, and miR-222, have been found during the adipogenic programming of both immortalized and primary hMSCs, suggesting that they act as negative regulators of differentiation. Conversely, ectopic expression of the miRNAs 155, 221, and 222 significantly inhibited adipogenesis and repressed induction of the master regulators PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). This paves the way for possible genetic obesity treatments.

Another class of miRNAs that regulate insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, is the let-7 family. Let-7 accumulates in human tissues during the course of aging. When let-7 was ectopically overexpressed to mimic accelerated aging, mice became insulin-resistant, and thus more prone to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. In contrast when let-7 was inhibited by injections of let-7-specific antagomirs, mice become more insulin-sensitive and remarkably resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Not only could let-7 inhibition prevent obesity and diabetes, it could also reverse and cure the condition. These experimental findings suggest that let-7 inhibition could represent a new therapy for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

===Hemostasis===
miRNAs also play crucial roles in the regulation of complex enzymatic cascades including the hemostatic blood coagulation system. Large scale studies of functional miRNA targeting have recently uncovered rationale therapeutic targets in the hemostatic system. They have been directly linked to Calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is critical in cell differentiation in early development.

==Plants==
miRNAs are considered to be key regulators of many developmental, homeostatic, and immune processes in plants. Their roles in plant development include shoot apical meristem development, leaf growth, flower formation, seed production, or root expansion. In addition, they play a complex role in responses to various abiotic stresses comprising heat stress, low-temperature stress, drought stress, light stress, or gamma radiation exposure.

==Viruses==
Viral microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression of viral and/or host genes to benefit the virus. Hence, miRNAs play a key role in host–virus interactions and pathogenesis of viral diseases. The expression of transcription activators by &quot;human herpesvirus-6&quot; DNA is believed to be regulated by viral miRNA.

==Target prediction==
miRNAs can bind to target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mRNA degradation. It is of key importance to identify the miRNA targets accurately. A comparison of the predictive performance of eighteen in silico algorithms is available. Large scale studies of functional miRNA targeting suggest that many functional miRNAs can be missed by target prediction algorithms.

<text>Henry Barnard (January 24, 1811 – July 5, 1900) was an American educator and reformer.

==Biography==
He was born in Hartford, Connecticut on January 24, 1811 and attended Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy. He graduated from Yale University in 1830 and was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1835. In 1837–1839, he was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, effecting in 1838 the passage of a bill, drafted and introduced by himself, which provided for &quot;the better supervision of the common schools&quot;, and established a board of &quot;commissioners of common schools&quot; in the state. He was the secretary of the board from 1838 until its abolition in 1842, and during this time worked indefatigably to reorganize and reform the common school system of the state, thus earning a national reputation as an educational reformer.

In 1843, he was appointed by the governor of Rhode Island agent to examine the public schools of the state, and recommended improvements; and his work resulted in the reorganization of the school system two years later. From 1845 to 1849, he was the first commissioner of public schools in the state, and his administration was marked by a decided step in educational progress. In 1845, Barnard established the first &quot;Rhode Island Teachers Institute&quot; at Smithville Seminary.

Returning to Connecticut, from 1851 to 1855, he was &quot;superintendent of common schools&quot;, and principal of the Connecticut State Normal School at New Britain, Connecticut.

In 1852, Barnard was offered the newly created position of President of the University of Michigan, but he declined. From 1859 to 1860, he was chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and agent of the board of regents of the normal school fund; in 1866 he was president of St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland; and from 1867 to 1870 he was the first United States Commissioner of Education, and in this position he laid the foundation for the subsequent work of the Bureau of Education.

He was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership in 1893.

==&quot;American Journal of Education&quot;==

Barnard&#x27;s chief service to the cause of education, however, was rendered as the editor, from 1855 to 1881, of the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot;, the thirty-one volumes of which are a veritable encyclopedia of education, one of the most valuable compendiums of information on the subject ever brought together through the agency of any one man. He also edited from 1838 to 1842, and again from 1851 to 1854, the &quot;Connecticut Common School Journal&quot;, and from 1846 to 1849 the &quot;Journal of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
He died at Hartford on July 5, 1900, aged 89.

He is buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. The Henry Barnard School at Rhode Island College and the Henry Barnard School in New Rochelle, New York are named in his honor. There is also an elementary school named in his honor in Enfield, CT-Henry Barnard Elementary School.

<doc id="156968" wikidata="Q1757382" url="?curid=156968" title="Integral membrane protein">
<text>An integral, or intrinsic, membrane protein (IMP) is a type of membrane protein that is permanently attached to the biological membrane. All transmembrane proteins can be classified as IMPs, but not all IMPs are transmembrane proteins. IMPs comprise a significant fraction of the proteins encoded in an organism&#x27;s genome. Proteins that cross the membrane are surrounded by annular lipids, which are defined as lipids that are in direct contact with a membrane protein. Such proteins can only be separated from the membranes by using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents.

Proteins that adhere only temporarily to cellular membranes are known as peripheral membrane proteins. These proteins can either associate with integral membrane proteins, or independently insert in the lipid bilayer in several ways.

==Structure==

Three-dimensional structures of ~160 different integral membrane proteins have been determined at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. They are challenging subjects for study owing to the difficulties associated with extraction and crystallization. In addition, structures of many water-soluble protein domains of IMPs are available in the Protein Data Bank. Their membrane-anchoring α-helices have been removed to facilitate the extraction and crystallization. Search integral membrane proteins in the PDB (based on gene ontology classification)

IMPs can be divided into two groups:

# Integral polytopic proteins (Transmembrane proteins)
# Integral monotopic proteins

===Integral polytopic protein===

The most common type of IMP is the transmembrane protein, which spans the entire biological membrane. Single-pass membrane proteins cross the membrane only once, while multi-pass membrane proteins weave in and out, crossing the membrane several times. Single pass membrane proteins can be categorized as Type I, which are positioned such that their carboxyl-terminus is towards the cytosol, or Type II, which have their amino-terminus towards the cytosol. Type III proteins have multiple transmembrane domains in a single polypeptide, while type IV consists of several different polypeptides assembled together in a channel through the membrane. Type V proteins are anchored to the lipid bilayer through covalently linked lipids. Finally Type VI proteins have both transmembrane domains and lipid anchors.

===Integral monotopic proteins===
Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the cell membrane from one side.

Three-dimensional structures of the following integral monotopic proteins have been determined:
* prostaglandin H2 syntheses 1 and 2 (cyclooxygenases)
* lanosterol synthase and squalene-hopene cyclase
* microsomal prostaglandin E synthase
* carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2
* Phosphoglycosyl transferase C

There are also structures of integral monotopic &quot;domains&quot; of transmembrane proteins:
* monoamine oxidases A and B
* fatty acid amide hydrolase
* mammalian cytochrome P450 oxidases
* corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenases

===Extraction===
Many challenges facing the study of integral membrane proteins are attributed to the extraction of those proteins from the phospholipid bilayer. Since integral proteins span the width of the phospholipid bilayer, their extraction involves disrupting the phospholipids surrounding them, without causing any damage that would interrupt the function or structure of the proteins. Several successful methods are available for performing the extraction including the uses of &quot;detergents, low ionic salt (salting out), shearing force, and rapid pressure change&quot;.

=== Determination of protein structure ===
The Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), funded by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has among its aim to determine three-dimensional protein structures and to develop techniques for use in structural biology, including for membrane proteins. Homology modeling can be used to construct an atomic-resolution model of the &quot;target&quot; integral protein from its amino acid sequence and an experimental three-dimensional structure of a related homologous protein. This procedure has been extensively used for ligand-G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) and their complexes.

==Function==
IMPs include transporters, linkers, channels, receptors, enzymes, structural membrane-anchoring domains, proteins involved in accumulation and transduction of energy, and proteins responsible for cell adhesion. Classification of transporters can be found in Transporter Classification Database.

As an example of the relationship between the IMP (in this case the bacterial phototrapping pigment, bacteriorhodopsin) and the membrane formed by the phospholipid bilayer is illustrated below. In this case the integral membrane protein spans the phospholipid bilayer seven times. The part of the protein that is embedded in the hydrophobic regions of the bilayer are alpha helical and composed of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. The C terminal end of the protein is in the cytosol while the N terminal region is in the outside of the cell. A membrane that contains this particular protein is able to function in photosynthesis.

==Examples==
Examples of integral membrane proteins:
* Insulin receptor
* Some types of cell adhesion proteins or cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as integrins, cadherins, NCAMs, or selectins
* Some types of receptor proteins
* Glycophorin
* Rhodopsin
* Band 3
* CD36
* Glucose Permease
* Ion channels and Gates
* Gap junction Proteins
* G protein coupled receptors (e.g., Beta-adrenergic receptor)
* Seipin
* Photosystem I

<text>The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including those of bacteria and archaea. In eukaryotes, it extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane and is composed of similar proteins in the various organisms. It is composed of three main components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, and these are all capable of rapid growth and or disassembly depending on the cell&#x27;s requirements.

A multitude of functions can be performed by the cytoskeleton. Its primary function is to give the cell its shape and mechanical resistance to deformation, and through association with extracellular connective tissue and other cells it stabilizes entire tissues. The cytoskeleton can also contract, thereby deforming the cell and the cell&#x27;s environment and allowing cells to migrate. Moreover, it is involved in many cell signaling pathways and in the uptake of extracellular material (endocytosis), the segregation of chromosomes during cellular division, the cytokinesis stage of cell division, as scaffolding to organize the contents of the cell in space and in intracellular transport (for example, the movement of vesicles and organelles within the cell) and can be a template for the construction of a cell wall. Furthermore, it can form specialized structures, such as flagella, cilia, lamellipodia and podosomes. The structure, function and dynamic behavior of the cytoskeleton can be very different, depending on organism and cell type. Even within one cell, the cytoskeleton can change through association with other proteins and the previous history of the network.

A large-scale example of an action performed by the cytoskeleton is muscle contraction. This is carried out by groups of highly specialized cells working together. A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is the microfilament. Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin. During contraction of a muscle, within each muscle cell, myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments. Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins, tropomyosin and troponin. Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin, while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition. This action contracts the muscle cell, and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells, the entire muscle.

==History==
In 1903, Nikolai K. Koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton. The concept of a protein mosaic that dynamically coordinated cytoplasmic biochemistry was proposed by Rudolph Peters in 1929 while the term (&quot;cytosquelette&quot;, in French) was first introduced by French embryologist Paul Wintrebert in 1931.

When the cytoskeleton was first introduced, it was thought to be an uninteresting gel-like substance that helped organelles stay in place. Much research took place to try to understand the purpose of the cytoskeleton and its components.

Initially, it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well. This discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.

==Eukaryotic cytoskeleton==

Eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments: microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. In neurons the intermediate filaments are known as neurofilaments. Each type is formed by the polymerization of a distinct type of protein subunit and has its own characteristic shape and intracellular distribution. Microfilaments are polymers of the protein actin and are 7 nm in diameter. Microtubules are composed of tubulin and are 25 nm in diameter. Intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins, depending on the type of cell in which they are found; they are normally 8-12 nm in diameter. The cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape, and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol, it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment. Cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with cellular membranes.

Research into neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) indicate that the cytoskeleton is affected in these diseases. Parkinson&#x27;s disease is marked by the degradation of neurons, resulting in tremors, rigidity, and other non-motor symptoms. Research has shown that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time. In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, tau proteins which stabilize microtubules malfunction in the progression of the illness causing pathology of the cytoskeleton. Excess glutamine in the Huntington protein involved with linking vesicles onto the cytoskeleton is also proposed to be a factor in the development of Huntington&#x27;s Disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis results in a loss of movement caused by the degradation of motor neurons, and also involves defects of the cytoskeleton.

Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose suggest a role of microtubule vibrations in neurons in the origin of consciousness.

Accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations.

A number of small-molecule cytoskeletal drugs have been discovered that interact with actin and microtubules. These compounds have proven useful in studying the cytoskeleton, and several have clinical applications.

===Microfilaments===

Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are composed of linear polymers of G-actin proteins, and generate force when the growing (plus) end of the filament pushes against a barrier, such as the cell membrane. They also act as tracks for the movement of myosin molecules that affix to the microfilament and &quot;walk&quot; along them. In general, the major component or protein of microfilaments are actin. The G-actin monomer combines to form a polymer which continues to form the microfilament (actin filament). These subunits then assemble into two chains that intertwine into what are called F-actin chains. Myosin motoring along F-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers, both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types. Actin structures are controlled by the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho itself for contractile acto-myosin filaments (&quot;stress fibers&quot;), Rac for lamellipodia and Cdc42 for filopodia.

Functions include:
* Muscle contraction
* Cell movement
* Intracellular transport/trafficking
* Maintenance of eukaryotic cell shape
* Cytokinesis
* Cytoplasmic streaming

===Intermediate filaments===

Intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryotic cells. These filaments, averaging 10 nanometers in diameter, are more stable (strongly bound) than microfilaments, and heterogeneous constituents of the cytoskeleton. Like actin filaments, they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing tension (microtubules, by contrast, resist compression but can also bear tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome). Intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell, anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina. They also participate in some cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions. Nuclear lamina exist in all animals and all tissues. Some animals like the fruit fly do not have any cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. In those animals that express cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, these are tissue specific. Keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells provide protection for different mechanical stresses the skin may endure. They also provide protection for organs against metabolic, oxidative, and chemical stresses. Strengthening of epithelial cells with these intermediate filaments may prevent onset of apoptosis, or cell death, by reducing the probability of stress.

Intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or &quot;scaffolding&quot; for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions. In combination with proteins and desmosomes, the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell. These connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment. Mutations in the IF proteins have been shown to cause serious medical issues such as premature aging, desmin mutations compromising organs, Alexander Disease, and muscular dystrophy.

Different intermediate filaments are:
* made of vimentins. Vimentin intermediate filaments are in general present in mesenchymal cells.
* made of keratin. Keratin is present in general in epithelial cells.
* neurofilaments of neural cells.
* made of lamin, giving structural support to the nuclear envelope.
* made of desmin, play an important role in structural and mechanical support of muscle cells.

===Microtubules===

Microtubules are hollow cylinders about 23 nm in diameter (lumen diameter of approximately 15 nm), most commonly comprising 13 protofilaments that, in turn, are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin. They have a very dynamic behavior, binding GTP for polymerization. They are commonly organized by the centrosome.

In nine triplet sets (star-shaped), they form the centrioles, and in nine doublets oriented about two additional microtubules (wheel-shaped), they form cilia and flagella. The latter formation is commonly referred to as a &quot;9+2&quot; arrangement, wherein each doublet is connected to another by the protein dynein. As both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell, and are maintained by microtubules, they can be considered part of the cytoskeleton. There are two types of cilia: motile and non-motile cilia. Cilia are short and more numerous than flagella. The motile cilia have a rhythmic waving or beating motion compared to the non-motile cilia which receive sensory information for the cell; processing signals from the other cells or the fluids surrounding it. Additionally, the microtubules control the beating (movement) of the cilia and flagella. Also, the dynein arms attached to the microtubules function as the molecular motors. The motion of the cilia and flagella is created by the microtubules sliding past one another, which requires ATP.
They play key roles in:
* intracellular transport (associated with dyneins and kinesins, they transport organelles like mitochondria or vesicles).
* the axoneme of cilia and flagella.
* the mitotic spindle.
* synthesis of the cell wall in plants.

In addition to the roles described above, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose have proposed that microtubules function in consciousness.

===Comparison===
===Septins===
Septins are a group of the highly conserved GTP binding proteins found in eukaryotes. Different septins form protein complexes with each other. These can assemble to filaments and rings. Therefore, septins can be considered part of the cytoskeleton. The function of septins in cells include serving as a localized attachment site for other proteins, and preventing the diffusion of certain molecules from one cell compartment to another. In yeast cells, they build scaffolding to provide structural support during cell division and compartmentalize parts of the cell. Recent research in human cells suggests that septins build cages around bacterial pathogens, immobilizing the harmful microbes and preventing them from invading other cells.

===Spectrin===
Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that lines the intracellular side of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. Spectrin forms pentagonal or hexagonal arrangements, forming a scaffolding and playing an important role in maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and cytoskeletal structure.

===Yeast cytoskeleton===
In budding yeast (an important model organism), actin forms cortical patches, actin cables, and a cytokinetic ring and the cap. Cortical patches are discrete actin bodies on the membrane and are vital for endocytosis, especially the recycling of glucan synthase which is important for cell wall synthesis. Actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap (which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth) and in the positioning of mitochondria. The cytokinetic ring forms and constricts around the site of cell division.

==Prokaryotic cytoskeleton==

Prior to the work of Jones et al., 2001, the cell wall was believed to be the deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes, including rods and spirals. When studied, many misshapen bacteria were found to have mutations linked to development of a cell envelope. The cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryotic cells, but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes. Harold Erickson notes that before 1992, only eukaryotes were believed to have cytoskeleton components. However, research in the early &#x27;90s suggested that bacteria and archaea had homologues of actin and tubulin, and that these were the basis of eukaryotic microtubules and microfilaments. Although the evolutionary relationships are so distant that they are not obvious from protein sequence comparisons alone, the similarity of their three-dimensional structures and similar functions in maintaining cell shape and polarity provides strong evidence that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletons are truly homologous. Three laboratories independently discovered that FtsZ, a protein already known as a key player in bacterial cytokinesis, had the &quot;tubulin signature sequence&quot; present in all α-, β-, and γ-tubulins. However, some structures in the bacterial cytoskeleton may not have been identified as of yet.

===FtsZ===
FtsZ was the first protein of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton to be identified. Like tubulin, FtsZ forms filaments in the presence of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), but these filaments do not group into tubules. During cell division, FtsZ is the first protein to move to the division site, and is essential for recruiting other proteins that synthesize the new cell wall between the dividing cells.

===MreB and ParM===
Prokaryotic actin-like proteins, such as MreB, are involved in the maintenance of cell shape. All non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins, and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

Some plasmids encode a separate system that involves an actin-like protein ParM. Filaments of ParM exhibit dynamic instability, and may partition plasmid DNA into the dividing daughter cells by a mechanism analogous to that used by microtubules during eukaryotic mitosis.

===Crescentin===
The bacterium &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; contains a third protein, crescentin, that is related to the intermediate filaments of eukaryotic cells. Crescentin is also involved in maintaining cell shape, such as helical and vibrioid forms of bacteria, but the mechanism by which it does this is currently unclear. Additionally, curvature could be described by the displacement of crescentic filaments, after the disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis.

== The cytoskeleton and cell mechanics ==
The cytoskeleton is a highly anisotropic and dynamic network, constantly remodeling itself in response to the changing cellular microenvironment. The network influences cell mechanics and dynamics by differentially polymerizing and depolymerizing its constituent filaments (primarily actin and myosin, but microtubules and intermediate filaments also play a role). This generates forces, which play an important role in informing the cell of its microenvironment. Specifically, forces such as tension, stiffness, and shear forces have all been shown to influence cell fate, differentiation, migration, and motility. Through a process called “mechanotransduction,” the cell remodels its cytoskeleton to sense and respond to these forces.

Mechanotransduction relies heavily on focal adhesions, which essentially connect the intracellular cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through focal adhesions, the cell is able to integrate extracellular forces into intracellular ones as the proteins present at focal adhesions undergo conformational changes to initiate signaling cascades. Proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src have been shown to transduce force signals in response to cellular activities such as proliferation and differentiation, and are hypothesized to be key sensors in the mechanotransduction pathway. As a result of mechanotransduction, the cytoskeleton changes its composition and/or orientation to accommodate the force stimulus and ensure the cell responds accordingly.

The cytoskeleton changes the mechanics of the cell in response to detected forces. For example, increasing tension within the plasma membrane makes it more likely that ion channels will open, which increases ion conductance and makes cellular change ion influx or efflux much more likely. Moreover, the mechanical properties of cells determine how far and where, directionally, a force will propagate throughout the cell and how it will change cell dynamics. A membrane protein that is not closely coupled to the cytoskeleton, for instance, will not produce a significant effect on the cortical actin network if it is subjected to a specifically directed force. However, membrane proteins that are more closely associated with the cytoskeleton will induce a more significant response. In this way, the anisotropy of the cytoskeleton serves to more keenly direct cell responses to intra or extracellular signals.

== Long-range order ==
The specific pathways and mechanisms by which the cytoskeleton senses and responds to forces are still under investigation. However, the long-range order generated by the cytoskeleton is known to contribute to mechanotransduction. Cells, which are around 10–50 μm in diameter, are several thousand times larger than the molecules found within the cytoplasm that are essential to coordinate cellular activities. Because cells are so large in comparison to essential biomolecules, it is difficult, in the absence of an organizing network, for different parts of the cytoplasm to communicate. Moreover, biomolecules must polymerize to lengths comparable to the length of the cell, but resulting polymers can be highly disorganized and unable to effectively transmit signals from one part of the cytoplasm to another. Thus, it is necessary to have the cytoskeleton to organize the polymers and ensure that they can effectively communicate across the entirety of the cell.

==Common features and differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes==
By definition, the cytoskeleton is composed of proteins that can form longitudinal arrays (fibres) in all organisms. These filament forming proteins have been classified into 4 classes. Tubulin-like, actin-like, Walker A cytoskeletal ATPases (WACA-proteins), and intermediate filaments.

Tubulin-like proteins are tubulin in eukaryotes and FtsZ, TubZ, RepX in prokaryotes. Actin-like proteins are actin in eukaryotes and MreB, FtsA in prokaryotes. An example of a WACA-proteins, which are mostly found in prokaryotes, is MinD. Examples for intermediate filaments, which have almost exclusively been found in animals (i.e. eukaryotes) are the lamins, keratins, vimentin, neurofilaments, and desmin.

Although tubulin-like proteins share some amino acid sequence similarity, their equivalence in protein-fold and the similarity in the GTP binding site is more striking. The same holds true for the actin-like proteins and their structure and ATP binding domain.

Cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape, DNA segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Which proteins fulfill which task is very different. For example, DNA segregation in all eukaryotes happens through use of tubulin, but in prokaryotes either WACA proteins, actin-like or tubulin-like proteins can be used. Cell division is mediated in eukaryotes by actin, but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like (often FtsZ-ring) proteins and sometimes (Thermoproteota) ESCRT-III, which in eukaryotes still has a role in the last step of division.

== Cytoplasmic streaming ==

Cytoplasmic streaming, also known as cyclosis, is the active movement of a cell&#x27;s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton. While mainly seen in plants, all cell types use this process for transportation of waste, nutrients, and organelles to other parts of the cell.  Plant and algae cells are generally larger than many other cells; so cytoplasmic streaming is important in these types of cells. This is because the cell&#x27;s extra volume requires cytoplasmic streaming in order to move organelles throughout the entire cell. Organelles move along microfilaments in the cytoskeleton driven by myosin motors binding and pushing along actin filament bundles.

<text>A grammar school is one of several different types of school in the history of education in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries, originally a school teaching Latin, but more recently an academically oriented selective secondary school.

The original purpose of medieval grammar schools was the teaching of Latin. Over time the curriculum was broadened, first to include Ancient Greek, and later English and other European languages, natural sciences, mathematics, history, geography, art and other subjects. In the late Victorian era grammar schools were reorganised to provide secondary education throughout England and Wales; Scotland had developed a different system. Grammar schools of these types were also established in British territories overseas, where they have evolved in different ways.

Grammar schools became one of the three tiers of the Tripartite System of state-funded secondary education operating in England and Wales from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s, and continue as such in Northern Ireland. After most local education authorities moved to non-selective comprehensive schools in the 1960s and 1970s, some grammar schools became fully independent schools and charged fees, while most others were abolished or became comprehensive (or sometimes merged with a secondary modern to form a new comprehensive school). In both cases, some of these schools kept &quot;grammar school&quot; in their names. More recently, a number of state grammar schools, still retaining their selective intake, gained academy status are thus independent of the local education authority (LEA). Some LEAs retain forms of the Tripartite System and a few grammar schools survive in otherwise comprehensive areas. Some of the remaining grammar schools can trace their histories to before the 15th century.

==History==
=== Medieval grammar schools ===
Although the term was not widely used until the 14th century, the earliest such schools appeared from the sixth century, e.g. the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury (founded 597), the King&#x27;s School, Rochester (604) and St Peter&#x27;s School, York (627)
The schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries, teaching Latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks. Other subjects required for religious work were occasionally added, including music and verse (for liturgy), astronomy and mathematics (for the church calendar) and law (for administration).

With the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century, grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education, with Latin seen as the foundation of the trivium. Pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14, after which they would look to universities and the church for further study. Of the three first schools independent of the church – Winchester College (1382), Oswestry School (1407) and Eton College (1440) – Winchester and Eton were feeder schools to Oxford and Cambridge universities respectively. There is a mention of a grammar school at Shrewsbury in a court case of 1439. They were boarding schools, so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation.

===Early modern grammar schools===

An example of an early grammar school, founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church, or university, is Bridgnorth Grammar School, founded in 1503 by Bridgnorth Borough Corporation.
During the English Reformation in the 16th century, most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the dissolution of the monasteries. For example, the oldest extant schools in Wales – Christ College, Brecon (founded 1541) and the Friars School, Bangor (1557) – were established on the sites of former Dominican monasteries. King Edward VI made an important contribution to grammar schools, founding a series of schools during his reign (see King Edward&#x27;s School). A few grammar schools were also established in the name of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I. King James I founded a series of &quot;Royal Schools&quot; in Ulster, beginning with The Royal School, Armagh. In theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees; however, few poor children attended school, because their labour was economically valuable to their families.

In the Scottish Reformation schools such as the Choir School of Glasgow Cathedral (founded 1124) and the Grammar School of the Church of Edinburgh (1128) passed from church control to burgh councils, and the burghs also founded new schools. With the increased emphasis on studying the scriptures after the Reformation, many schools added Greek and, in a few cases, Hebrew. The teaching of these languages was hampered by a shortage of non-Latin type and of teachers fluent in the languages.
During the 16th and 17th centuries the establishment of grammar schools became a common act of charity by nobles, wealthy merchants and guilds; for example The Crypt School, Gloucester, founded by John and Joan Cook in 1539, Sir Roger Manwood&#x27;s School, founded in 1563 by Sandwich jurist Roger Manwood, and Spalding Grammar School, founded by John Gamlyn and John Blanche in 1588. Many of these are still commemorated in annual &quot;Founder&#x27;s Day&quot; services and ceremonies at surviving schools. The usual pattern was to create an endowment to pay the wages of a master to instruct local boys in Latin and sometimes Greek without charge.

The school day typically ran from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a two-hour break for lunch; in winter, school started at 7 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m. Most of the day was spent in the rote learning of Latin. To encourage fluency, some schoolmasters recommended punishing any pupil who spoke in English. The younger boys learned the parts of speech and Latin words in the first year, learned to construct Latin sentences in the second year, and began translating English–Latin and Latin–English passages in the third year. By the end of their studies at age 14, they would be quite familiar with the great Latin authors, and with Latin drama and rhetoric. Other skills, such as arithmetic and handwriting, were taught in odd moments or by travelling specialist teachers such as scriveners.

===Grammar schools in the 18th and 19th centuries===

In 1755 Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; defined a grammar school as &quot;a school in which the learned languages are grammatically taught&quot;;
However, by this time demand for these languages had fallen greatly. A new commercial class required modern languages and commercial subjects. Most grammar schools founded in the 18th century also taught arithmetic and English. In Scotland, the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that Scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here, though some, such as Aberdeen Grammar School, retain the name.

In England, urban middle-class pressure for a commercial curriculum was often supported by the school&#x27;s trustees (who would charge the new students fees), but resisted by the schoolmaster, supported by the terms of the original endowment. Very few schools were able to obtain special acts of Parliament to change their statutes; examples are the Macclesfield Grammar School Act 1774 and the Bolton Grammar School Act 1788. Such a dispute between the trustees and master of Leeds Grammar School led to a celebrated case in the Court of Chancery. After 10 years, Lord Eldon, then Lord Chancellor, ruled in 1805, &quot;There is no authority for thus changing the nature of the Charity, and filling a School intended for the purpose of teaching Greek and Latin with Scholars learning the German and French languages, mathematics, and anything except Greek and Latin.&quot; Although he offered a compromise by which some subjects might be added to a classical core, the ruling set a restrictive precedent for grammar schools across England; they seemed to be in terminal decline. However it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in England and Wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of St Bees Clerical College, in 1817, and St David&#x27;s College Lampeter, in 1828, specialist grammar schools in the north-west of England and South Wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties, which enabled them to be ordained as Anglican clergymen without going to university.

===Victorian-era grammar schools===

The 19th century saw a series of reforms to grammar schools, culminating in the Endowed Schools Act 1869. Grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula, while often retaining classical subjects.

The Grammar Schools Act 1840 made it lawful to apply the income of grammar schools to purposes other than those defined in the original endowment eg. teaching of classical languages. Such change however to the intentions of the original endowment required application to and consent of a court of law. In mid C19 therefore, some schools started reorganising themselves along the lines of Thomas Arnold&#x27;s reforms at Rugby School, and also the spread of the railways supported the success of new boarding schools, teaching a broader curriculum, such as Marlborough College (1843).

The first girls&#x27; schools targeted at university entrance were North London Collegiate School (1850) and Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College (from the appointment of Dorothea Beale in 1858).

Following the Clarendon Commission, which led to the Public Schools Act 1868 which restructured the trusts of nine leading schools (including Eton College, Harrow School and Shrewsbury School), the Taunton Commission was appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools. The commission reported that the distribution of schools did not match the current population, and that provision varied greatly in quality, with provision for girls being particularly limited. The Taunton Commission&#x27;s report of 1868 proposed the creation of a national system of secondary education by restructuring the endowments of these schools for modern purposes. The result was the Endowed Schools Act 1869, which created the Endowed Schools Commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools. It was said that the commission &quot;could turn a boys&#x27; school in Northumberland into a girls&#x27; school in Cornwall&quot;. Across England and Wales schools endowed to offer free classical instruction to boys were remodelled as fee-paying schools (with a few competitive scholarships) teaching broad curricula to boys or girls.
In the late Victorian era there was a great emphasis on the importance of self-improvement, and many schools established at that time emulated the great public schools, copying their curriculum, ethos and ambitions, and some took or maintained the title &quot;grammar school&quot; for historical reasons. A girls&#x27; grammar school established in a town with an older boys&#x27; grammar school would often be named a &quot;high school&quot;.

Under the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act 1907 all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools. Grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of England and Wales before 1944.

===Tripartite System===
The Education Act 1944 created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in England and Wales, echoed by the Education (Northern Ireland) Act 1947. One of the three types of school forming the Tripartite System was called the grammar school, which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools. Grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the 11-plus examination.

Two types of grammar schools existed under the system:
* State-maintained grammar schools, which reached a peak in 1964 with 1,298 in England and Wales. Though some were quite old, most were either newly created or built since the Victorian period, seeking to replicate the studious, aspirational atmosphere found in the older grammar schools.
* Direct-grant grammar schools of which there were 179. They took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system, and the rest from fee-paying parents. They also exercised far greater freedom from local authorities, and some were members of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference. These schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the Tripartite System. The most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was Manchester Grammar School, whose headmaster, Lord James of Rusholme, was one of the most outspoken advocates of the Tripartite System.

Grammar school pupils were given the best opportunities of any schoolchildren in the state system. Initially, they studied for the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate, replaced in 1951 by General Certificate of Education examinations at O-level (Ordinary level) and A-level (Advanced level). In contrast, very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious Certificate of Secondary Education (known as the CSE) in 1965. Until the implementation of the Robbins Report in the 1960&#x27;s expanding higher education, pupils from public and grammar schools effectively monopolised access to universities. These schools were also the only ones that offered an extra term of school to prepare pupils for the competitive entrance exams for Oxford and Cambridge.

According to Anthony Sampson, in his book &quot;Anatomy of Britain&quot; (1965), there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working-class parents, while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle-class parents. The Tripartite System was largely abolished in England and Wales between 1965, with the issue of Circular 10/65, and the Education Act 1976. Most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools, to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools, though a few were closed. This process proceeded quickly in Wales, with the closure of such schools as Cowbridge Grammar School. In England, implementation was less even, with some counties and individual schools successfully resisting conversion or closure.

The Direct Grant Grammar Schools (Cessation of Grant) Regulations 1975 required direct grant schools to decide whether to convert into comprehensives under local authority control or become private schools funded entirely by fees. Of the direct grant schools remaining at that time, 51 became comprehensive, 119 opted for independence, and five were &quot;not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close&quot;. Some of these schools retained the name &quot;grammar&quot; in their title but are no longer free of charge for all but a few pupils. These schools normally select their pupils by an entrance examination and sometimes by interview.

By the end of the 1980s, all of the grammar schools in Wales and most of those in England had closed or converted to comprehensive schools. Selection also disappeared from state-funded schools in Scotland in the same period. Although almost all former grammar schools ceased to be selective, there are comprehensive schools that chose to maintain the descriptor &quot;grammar&quot; in their nomenclature. Most of these schools do however operate some form of selection in their admission process, due to oversubscription. There is also a small group of formally partially selective schools which select a cohort of pupils based on academic ability. The tripartite system (reduced to grammar and secondary modern schools) does survive in certain areas, such as Kent, where the eleven-plus examination which divides pupils into placement in grammar or secondary modern school is known as the Kent Test.

==Current British grammar schools==
Today, &quot;grammar school&quot; commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in England and the 69 remaining in Northern Ireland. The National Grammar Schools Association campaigns in favour of such schools, while Comprehensive Future and the Campaign for State Education campaign against them. A University College London study has shown that UK grammar school pupils gain no significant social or emotional advantages by the age of 14 over similarly gifted pupils in non-selective schools.

===England===
England has a long history of grammar schools. Curricula differ from school to school but generally includes English language, English literature, mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art and design, music, drama, design and technology, history, philosophy, civics/citizenship, classical education, religious education, physical education, and several other foreign languages. Most English grammar schools follow the National Curriculum and follow the same broad national exams as other state schools.
Under the Labour government&#x27;s School Standards and Framework Act 1998, grammar schools were for the first time to be designated by statutory instrument. The Act also defined a procedure by which local communities could petition for a ballot for an end to selection at schools. Petitions were launched in several areas, but only one received the signatures of 20% of eligible parents, the level needed to trigger a ballot. Thus the only ballot held to date was for Ripon Grammar School in 2000, when parents rejected change by a ratio of 2 to 1. These arrangements were condemned in 2004 by the Select Committee for Education and Skills as being ineffective and a waste of time and resources.

There remain 163 grammar schools in England (out of some 3,000 state secondaries in total). Only a few areas have kept a formal grammar school system along the lines of the Tripartite System. In these areas, the eleven plus exam is used solely to identify a subset of children (around 25%) considered suitable for grammar education. When a grammar school has too many qualified applicants, other criteria are used to allocate places, such as siblings, distance or faith. Such systems still exist in Buckinghamshire, Rugby and Stratford districts of Warwickshire, the Salisbury district of Wiltshire and most of Lincolnshire, Kent, Reading and Medway. Of metropolitan areas, Trafford and most of Wirral are selective.

In other areas, grammar schools survive mainly as very highly selective schools in an otherwise comprehensive county, for example in several of the outer boroughs of London. These schools are often heavily oversubscribed, and award places in rank order of performance in their entry tests. In some LEAs, as many as 10–15% of 11-year-olds may attend grammar schools (for example in Gloucestershire), but in other LEAs it is as low as 2%. These very highly selective schools also tend to dominate the top positions in performance tables.

Further radical change was opposed by both Conservative and Labour governments until September 2016. Although many on the left argue that the existence of selective schools undermines the comprehensive structure, Labour governments have delegated decisions on grammar schools to local processes, which have not yet resulted in any changes. Moreover, government education policy appears to accept the existence of some kind of hierarchy in secondary education, with specialist schools, academies and similar initiatives proposed as ways of raising standards. Many grammar schools have featured in these programmes, and a lower level of selection is permitted at specialist schools.

In September 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May reversed the previous Conservative Party policy against expansion of grammar schools (except to cope with population expansion in wholly selective areas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 9/9/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The government opened a consultation on proposals to allow existing grammar schools to expand and new ones to be set up. The Labour and Liberal Democrat parties remain opposed to any expansion.

===Northern Ireland===

Attempts to move to a comprehensive system (as in the rest of the United Kingdom) have been delayed by shifts in the administration of Northern Ireland.
As a result, Northern Ireland still maintains the grammar school system, with many pupils being entered for academic selection exams similar to the 11-plus. Since the &quot;open enrolment&quot; reform of 1989, these schools (unlike those in England) have been required to accept pupils up to their capacity, which has also increased. By 2006, the 69 grammar schools took 42% of transferring children, and only 7 of them took all of their intake from the top 30% of the cohort.

The 11-plus has long been controversial, and Northern Ireland&#x27;s political parties have taken opposing positions. Unionists tend to lean towards preserving the grammar schools as they are, with academic selection at the age of 11, whereas nationalist politicians lean towards scrapping the 11-plus, despite vehement protestations from the majority of Catholic Grammar Schools, most notably by the board of governors at Rathmore Grammar School in Finaghy, (a South Belfast suburb) and Lumen Christi (although co-educational) in Derry. 

The Democratic Unionist Party claimed to have ensured the continuation of the grammar school system in the province as part of the St Andrews Agreement in October 2006. By contrast, Sinn Féin claims to have secured the abolition of the 11-plus and a veto over any system which might follow it.

The last government-run 11-plus exam was held in 2008 (for 2009 entry), but the Northern Ireland Assembly has not been able to agree on a replacement system for secondary transfer. The grammar schools have organised groupings to run their own tests, the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium (mostly Catholic schools) and the Association for Quality Education.
The Northern Ireland Commission for Catholic Education did accept continued selection at Catholic grammar schools as a temporary measure, anticipating them to end the practice by 2012. As of September 2019, the practice continues.

==In other countries or regions==
Grammar schools were established in various British territories, and have developed in different ways since those territories became independent.

===Australia===

In the mid-19th century, independent schools were established in the Australian colonies to spare the wealthy classes from sending their sons to schools in Britain.
These schools took their inspiration from English public schools, and often called themselves &quot;grammar schools&quot;.
Early examples include Launceston Grammar School (1846), Pulteney Grammar School (1847), Geelong Grammar School (1855), Melbourne Grammar School (1858) and Hale School (1858).

With the exception of the non-denominational Sydney Grammar School (1857) and Queensland grammar schools, all the grammar schools established in the 19th century were attached to the Church of England (now the Anglican Church of Australia).
In Queensland, the Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided for the state-assisted foundation of non-denominational grammar schools.
Beginning with Ipswich Grammar School (1863), ten schools were founded, of which the following eight still exist:
* Brisbane Grammar School
* Brisbane Girls&#x27; Grammar School (1875), the first of several grammar schools for girls in Australia 
* Ipswich Girls&#x27; Grammar School
* Ipswich Grammar School
* Rockhampton Girls&#x27; Grammar School (1892)
* Rockhampton Grammar School
* Toowoomba Grammar School
* Townsville Grammar School

In the 1920s grammar schools of other denominations were established, including members of the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria, and the trend has continued to the present day.
Today, the term is defined only in Queensland legislation.
Throughout the country, &quot;grammar schools&quot; are generally high-cost private schools.

The nearest equivalents of contemporary English grammar schools are selective schools.
The New South Wales public education system operates 19 selective public schools which resemble the English grammar-school system insofar as they engage in academic selection by way of centralised examination, they do not charge tuition fees and they are recipients of a greater degree of public funding per pupil than is afforded to non-selective government schools.

===Canada===

Grammar schools provided secondary education in Ontario until 1871.
The first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, advocated grammar schools for the colony to save the wealthy from sending their sons to the United States to be educated, but he was unable to convince his superiors in London.
He, however, made a grant enabling John Stuart to set up Kingston Grammar School in 1795.
After several abortive attempts to raise funding, the District Schools Act of 1807 provided support for one grammar school teacher in each district, of which there were then eight, but they were then left to their own devices.

Finding the grammar schools unsuitable as preparation for university, Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Colborne founded Upper Canada College as a superior grammar school.
Legislation in 1839 allowed for more than one grammar school in a district, triggering a rapid but unstructured growth in numbers over the following two decades to 86 in 1861. The schools became more independent of the Church of England and began to admit girls However, the schools were unsupervised, often underfunded and of varying standards. Some, like Tassie&#x27;s School, in Galt, provided a traditional classical education, but many provided a basic education of poor quality.

Chief Superintendent of Education Egerton Ryerson attempted to reform the schools in the 1850s and the 1860s by moving control of the schools from counties (the former districts) to city authorities, securing their funding and introducing inspectors. However, his efforts to convert the schools into classical schools for only boys were unsuccessful.
In recognition of the broad curricula offered, grammar schools were redesignated as secondary school by the Act to Improve the Common and Grammar Schools of the Province of Ontario of 1871. Schools that offered classical studies were given additional funding and operated as collegiate institutes. The secondary–school collegiate–institute system was also emulated in several other provinces in Western Canada.

===Hong Kong===

Mainstream schools in Hong Kong reflect the post-war British grammar system, focusing on a traditional curriculum rather than vocational subjects.

===Ireland===

Education in the Republic of Ireland has traditionally been organised on denominational lines. Grammar schools along the lines of those in Great Britain were set up for members of the Church of Ireland prior to its disestablishment in 1871. Some schools remain, as private schools catering largely for Protestant students. These are often fee-paying and accommodate boarders, given the scattered nature of the Protestant population in much of Ireland. Such schools include Bandon Grammar School, Drogheda Grammar School, Dundalk Grammar School and Sligo Grammar School. Others are among the many former fee-paying schools absorbed into larger state-funded community schools founded since the introduction of universal secondary education in the Republic by minister Donogh O&#x27;Malley in September 1967. Examples include Cork Grammar School, replaced by Ashton School, a co-educational comprehensive, in 1972.

===Malaysia===

Malaysia has a number of grammar schools, a majority of which were established when the country was under British rule. They are generally not known as &quot;grammar schools&quot; but are similarly selective in their intake. Among the best known being the Penang Free School, the Victoria Institution (Kuala Lumpur), Malay College Kuala Kangsar, the English College (Johor Bahru), King George V School (Seremban) and St George&#x27;s Institution (Taiping). Mission schools set up by various Christian denominations paralleled the selective state school albeit not with the same degree of selectivity. Notable mission schools include the La Sallian family of schools and those set up by the Marist Brothers and Methodist missionaries. Before the 1970s when Malay was made the medium of instruction, many such selective schools became known for providing excellent English-medium education and have produced many notable alumni, including former Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Tun Razak (St. John&#x27;s Institution) and all five of his predecessors.
===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, a small number of schools are named &quot;grammar schools&quot; and follow the academic and cultural traditions established in the United Kingdom. Grammar schools were established only in Auckland and originally came under the authority of the Auckland Grammar Schools&#x27; Board. Auckland&#x27;s grammar schools share a common line of descent from the British grammar school system, with a strong focus on academics and traditional British sports. Originally, the schools used entry assessments and selected academic students from across New Zealand. The schools mentioned below all share the school motto: &quot;Per Angusta Ad Augusta&quot; (Through difficulties to honours). They also share the same icon/logo, the &quot;Auckland Grammar Lion&quot;. Today, all grammar schools in New Zealand are non-selective state schools, but they use school donations to supplement their government funding. Within the Ministry of Education, they are regarded as any other secondary institutions.

New Zealand did not establish a state education system until 1877. The absence of a national education system meant that the first sizable secondary-education providers were grammar schools and other private institutions. The first grammar school in New Zealand, Auckland Grammar School, was established in 1850 and formally recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 by the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act. In 1888, Auckland Girls&#x27; Grammar School was established. In 1917 Auckland Grammar School&#x27;s sister school was established, Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar School. In 1922, Mount Albert Grammar School was established as part of Auckland Grammar School. Both schools have since become separate institutions. Takapuna Grammar School was established in 1927 and was the first co-educational grammar school to be established in New Zealand.

===Singapore===

Singapore was established as a Crown Colony, and the term &quot;grammar school&quot; was used since 1819 among the English community. The English, and later, the Scottish, set up cathedrals, churches, and elite grammar schools for the upper class. Initially, this was a racially segregated colonial system.

The British then opened up their schools to children from English mixed marriages, or to those with English descent. During the late colonial period, these schools expanded and also schooled descendants of the very few mixed English and Straits-Chinese families, and descendants of some rich Straits-born Chinese merchant class families, who were educated in Oxbridge or had London trade ties. Initially these schools were run exactly like their counterparts in England, and taught by the English.

The oldest of these, Raffles Institution, was founded in 1823 by Sir Stamford Raffles to educate sons born and living in the Crown Colony, often to fathers in Crown colonial service. Single-sex classes were set up for daughters of the British ruling class in 1844, and later became Raffles Girls&#x27; School, officially founded in 1879. After independence it became the Raffles Girls&#x27; School (Primary School), distinct from the branch school established by the local government after independence, the Raffles Girls&#x27; School (Secondary School).

The French Roman Catholic Orders later opened up their ministries and boarding schools to children of mixed marriages, and racial segregation was also relaxed to some extent in the English schools. The French Catholic missions and schools, but not the English schools, also accepted orphans, foundlings, and illegitimate children abandoned by mothers ostracized for breaching racial purity laws.

The CHIJMES building has commemorative plaques for these abandoned babies. The children were termed &quot;children of God&quot; and raised as Catholics. When laws banning polygamy became strictly enforced in Singapore after 1965, these schools extended their English-speaking classes to girls from families of any socio-economic background. The British grammar schools in Singapore imitated much of this education system, with Catholicism replaced by Anglicanism. Later the Anglican High School of Singapore was set up. Australian Methodist missionaries started UK-style grammar schools with American and British Methodist church funds. They founded the Anglo-Chinese School (1886) and Methodist Girls&#x27; School (1887).

When Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom, the Singapore government established publicly funded bilingual schools based on the existing grammar school system. Since the 1960s their mission was to provide a high-quality elite education to the top 10% in national annual IQ tests, regardless of socio-economic background. These bilingual schools were influenced by the US educational system, and termed &quot;high schools&quot; rather than &quot;grammar schools&quot;. Other, less elitist, state schools were called simply &quot;secondary schools&quot;, similar to the UK equivalent of &quot;comprehensive schools&quot;. High schools include Dunman High School (co-educational), Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School, Maris Stella High School (for boys only) and Catholic High School (all-boys). Within these schools there are academically top classes, the very competitive Scholars&#x27; class or &quot;A&quot; class. Graduates tend to become part of the upper class. These schools recruit pupils worldwide, particularly from large emerging Asian economies. Recruitment is carried out under the auspices of the Special Assistant Plan Scholars programme, the ASEAN Scholars programme, and the India and China Scholars programmes. Gifted pupils, such as winners of Mathematical Olympiads, international violin and piano competitions, Physics Olympiads and child inventors are particularly sought after.

In addition to religious missions and the new high schools, the less selective Singapore Chinese Girls&#x27; School was set up by several Peranakan business and community leaders. The Ministry of Education published annual rankings, but discontinued them after criticism of excessive academic stress placed on schoolchildren, some of whom committed suicide in response to perceived failure. After the 1990s all schools were integrated into a unified national school system, but the elite schools distinguished themselves by descriptions such as &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;autonomous&quot;.

===United States===

Grammar schools on the English and later British models were founded during the colonial period, the first being the Boston Latin School, founded as the Latin Grammar School in 1635.
In 1647 the Massachusetts Bay Colony enacted the Old Deluder Satan Law, requiring any township of at least 100 households to establish a grammar school, and similar laws followed in the other New England colonies. These schools initially taught young men the classical languages as a preparation for university, but by the mid-18th century many had broadened their curricula to include practical subjects. Nevertheless, they declined in popularity owing to competition from the more practical academies.

The name &quot;grammar school&quot; was adopted by public schools for children from 10 to 14 years of age, following a primary stage from 5 to 9 years of age. These types were gradually combined around 1900 to form elementary schools, which were also known as &quot;grammar schools&quot;.

An analogous concept to the contemporary English grammar school is the magnet school, a state-funded secondary institution that may select students from a given school district according to academic criteria.

<text>Otranto (, , ; ; ; ; ) is a coastal town, port and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Lecce (Apulia, Italy), in a fertile region once famous for its breed of horses. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

It is located on the east coast of the Salento peninsula. The Strait of Otranto, to which the city gives its name, connects the Adriatic Sea with the Ionian Sea and separates Italy from Albania. The harbour is small and has little trade.

The lighthouse &quot;Faro della Palascìa&quot;, at approximately southeast of Otranto, marks the most easterly point of the Italian mainland.

About south lies the promontory of Santa Maria di Leuca (so called since ancient times from its white cliffs, &quot;leukos&quot; being Greek for white), the southeastern extremity of Italy, the ancient &quot;Promontorium Iapygium&quot; or &quot;Sallentinum&quot;. The district between this promontory and Otranto is thickly populated and very fertile.

The area that lies between Otranto and Santa Maria di Leuca is part of the Regional Natural Coastal Park of &quot;Costa Otranto - Santa Maria di Leuca e Bosco di Tricase&quot; wanted by the Apulia Region in 2008. This territory has numerous natural and historical attractions such as Ciolo, which is a rocky cove.

==History==
Otranto occupies the site of the ancient Greek city of Magna Graecia Hydrus (in Greek: Ὑδροῦς) or Hydruntum (in Latin), also known as Hydrunton, Hydronton, or Hydruntu. Otranto was a town of Messapian (Illyrian) origin, which, in the wars of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal sided against Rome.

In Roman times it was a city. As it is the nearest port to the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, it was perhaps more important than Brundisium (present Brindisi), under the Roman emperors as a point of embarkation for the East, as the distance to Apollonia, (in present Albania) was less than from Brundisium.

In the 8th century, it was for some time in the possession of duke Arechis II of Benevento.

On 17 August 928, the city was sacked by a Fatimid fleet under Sabir al-Fata. Its inhabitants were carried to North Africa as slaves. It remained in the hands of the Byzantine emperors until it was among the last cities of Apulia to surrender to the Norman Robert Guiscard in 1068. It then became part of the Principality of Taranto. In the Middle Ages, the Jews had a school there.

===Ottoman invasion===
In 1480, Sultan Mehmed II sent an Ottoman fleet to invade Rome under the command of Gedik Ahmed Pasha. The force reached the shores of Apulia on 28 July 1480, and the city was captured in two weeks on 11 August 1480. All of the male inhabitants were slaughtered by the victorious Ottomans. Of the 22,000 inhabitants, only 10,000 were left alive. Some 800 citizens, known as the &quot;Martyrs of Otranto&quot;, were beheaded after they had refused to convert to Islam. They were canonised by Pope Francis on 12 May 2013. Archbishop Stefano Pendinelli was also martyred.

Between August and September 1480, the Italian and European kingdoms failed to help King Ferdinand of Naples except for his cousin Ferdinand the Catholic of Spain, the Kingdom of Sicily and later the Republic of Genoa. In 1481, the Pope, in panic, called for a crusade to be led by King Ferdinand of Naples and was joined by troops of Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. The Ottomans controlled the city for 13 months. Mehmed II died on his way to capture the rest of Italy. His successor, Sultan Bayezid II, ordered Gedik Ahmed Pasha to be hanged. On 11 September 1481, the Ottomans abandoned the city.

In 1537, the famous Ottoman corsair and admiral Barbarossa recaptured Otranto and the Fortress of Castro, but the Ottomans were again repulsed from the city and from the rest of Apulia.

===Napoleonic Wars===

In 1804, the city was obliged to harbour a French garrison that was established there to watch the movements of the English fleet. Under the French name of Otrante it was created a duché grand-fief de l&#x27;Empire in the Napoleonic kingdom of Naples for Joseph Fouché, Napoleon&#x27;s minister of Police (1809). The family used the title of duc d&#x27;Otrante after Joseph Fouché&#x27;s death.

===World War I===

During WWI the allied Italian-French-British Fleet organized the Otranto Barrage to control the Austro-Hungarian Fleet in the Adriatic Sea. The Austro-Hungarian Fleet led by captain Miklós Horthy attacked the Barrage (13 -15 May 1917) breaking it and sinking some British drifters (Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)).

===World War II===

During WWII the British fleet raided the Otranto Channel (11-12 November 1940) as a diversionary manoeuvre (Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1940) from the contemporary main attack on Taranto (Battle of Taranto).

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Otranto experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with long, hot summers and short, cool winters.

==Main sights==


Otranto main sights include:
* The &quot;Castello Aragonese&quot; (Castle), reinforced by Emperor Frederick II and rebuilt by Alphonso II of Naples in 1485–98. It has an irregular plan with five sides, with a moat running along the entire perimeter. In origin it had a single entrance, reachable through a draw-bridge. Towers include three cylindrical ones and a bastion called &quot;Punta di Diamante&quot; (&quot;Diamond&#x27;s Head&quot;). The entrance sports the coat of arms of Emperor Charles V.
* The &quot;Cathedral&quot;, consecrated in 1088, a work of Count Roger I adorned later (about 1163), by Bishop Jonathas, with a mosaic floor; it has a rose window and side portal of 1481. The interior, a basilica with nave and two aisles, contains columns said to come from a temple of Minerva and a fine mosaic pavement of 1166, with interesting representations of the months, Old Testament subjects and others. Bones and relics of the Martyrs of Otranto, who perished in the 15th-century siege surround the high altar. The church has a crypt supported by 42 marble columns. The same Count Roger also founded a Basilian monastery here, which, under Abbot Nicetas, became a place of study; its library was nearly all bought by Bessarion.
* The church of &quot;San Pietro&quot;, with Byzantine frescoes.
* The catacombs of &quot;Torre Pinta&quot;.
* &quot;Idro&quot;, a small river which the toponym Otranto stems from.

==Culture==
Otranto is the setting of Horace Walpole&#x27;s book &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, which is generally held to be the first Gothic novel. Walpole had chosen the town from a map of the Kingdom of Naples because the name was &quot;well-sounding&quot;; he was not aware that Otranto had a castle until 1786, some twenty-two years after the novel was first published under a pseudonym. The principal model for the castle was his villa in Strawberry Hill, London.

Otranto is also mentioned in Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lady of the Shroud&quot;.

<doc id="156979" wikidata="Q1344342" url="?curid=156979" title="Mid Sussex District">
<text>Mid Sussex is a local government district in West Sussex, England. The largest town is Haywards Heath, where the council is based. The district also contains the towns of Burgess Hill and East Grinstead plus surrounding rural areas, including many villages. The district includes part of the South Downs National Park and part of the designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty of High Weald, including sections of Ashdown Forest. The district contains most headwaters of the River Ouse. Its largest body of water is Ardingly reservoir which is used by watersports clubs. At the 2021 census the district had a population of 152,949.

The neighbouring districts are Crawley, Horsham, Brighton and Hove, Lewes, Wealden and Tandridge.

==History==
The name &quot;Mid Sussex&quot; was occasionally used for various parts of central Sussex prior to 1974, including as an alternative name for the Lewes constituency created under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and as a joint water district established in 1907.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of seven districts within West Sussex. The new district covered the whole area of three former districts and most of a fourth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Burgess Hill Urban District
*Cuckfield Urban District (included Haywards Heath and Lindfield)
*Cuckfield Rural District (except the parts of the parishes of Slaugham and Worth within the designated area for the new town of Crawley)
*East Grinstead Urban District
The new district was named Mid Sussex, reflecting its position within the historic county. All of the areas which made up Mid Sussex were in East Sussex prior to 1974; as part of the reforms that year they were transferred to West Sussex. The change of county was not without controversy; the government&#x27;s rationale for the change was that it brought the projected major economic area centred on Crawley and Gatwick Airport under the supervision of one county council.

==Governance==

Mid Sussex District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by West Sussex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a minority administration of the Liberal Democrats and some of the independent councillors, led by Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Eggleston.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2006 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
Four of the five independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 27 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district straddles three parliamentary constituencies; most of the district is in the Mid Sussex constituency, but north-western parts of the district are in the Horsham constituency and southern parts of the district are in the Arundel and South Downs constituency.

===Premises===
The council is based at Oaklands, in Haywards Heath, which was originally a large Victorian house and had served as the headquarters of the old Cuckfield Urban District Council (which had included Haywards Heath) since 1934. The building has been substantially extended.

==Towns and parishes==


The district is divided into 24 civil parishes. The parish councils for Burgess Hill, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The small parish of Newtimber has a parish meeting rather than a parish council. Hassocks is a post town but has a parish council rather than a town council.

==Home ownership==
Homes owned by their occupants, with or without a loan, make up more than 85% of Mid Sussex housing. Mid Sussex&#x27;s residents had the lowest burden of social housing, at 0.5% of housing stock, at the time of the census, a district which is approximately 30 minutes by its fast railway services from the area with the highest such proportion covering London Bridge station, the London Borough of Southwark (having 31.2% social housing) and from a creative and self-declared, progressive authority with 9.8% social housing and 28% of its housing privately rented, Brighton and Hove.

In terms of rented housing Mid Sussex at the 2011 census ranked 216th out of in terms of 327 local authorities in England. The proportion of homes which were rented as investments by non-occupants was higher than several other semi-rural districts of Sussex, with 11.7% of housing stock speculatively acquired in this way or to provide for those unable to obtain mortgage finance and 1.0% was let out to residents on either public or private shared ownership schemes, close to the national average. These figures are those of the 2011 census.

==Media==
In terms of television, Mid Sussex is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian with television signals received from the Heathfield TV transmitter. Northern parts of the district around East Grinstead can also receive BBC London and ITV London from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Sussex
*BBC Radio Surrey can also be heard.
*Heart South
*107 Meridian FM (serving East Grinstead and surrounding areas)
*More Radio Mid-Sussex (serving Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath)

Local newspapers are the &quot;Mid Sussex Times&quot; and &quot;The Sussex Newspaper&quot;.

<text>George of Trebizond (; 1395–1486) was a Byzantine Greek philosopher, scholar, and humanist.

==Life==

He was born on the Greek island of Crete (then a Venetian colony known as the Kingdom of Candia), and derived his surname Trapezuntius from the fact that his ancestors were from the Byzantine Greek Trapezuntine Empire.

When he went to Italy is not certain; according to some accounts he was summoned to Venice about 1430 to act as amanuensis to Francesco Barbaro, who appears to have already made his acquaintance; according to others he did not visit Italy until the time of the Council of Florence (1438–1439).

He learned Latin from Vittorino da Feltre, and made such rapid progress that in three years he was able to teach Latin literature and rhetoric. His reputation as a teacher and a translator of Aristotle was very great, and he was selected as secretary by Pope Nicholas V, an ardent Aristotelian. The bitterness of his attacks upon Plato (in the &quot;Comparatio Aristotelis et Platonis&quot; of 1458, described by historian James Hankins as &quot;one of the most remarkable mixtures of learning and lunacy ever penned&quot;), which drew forth a powerful response from Bessarion (&quot;In calumniatorem Platonis&quot;, printed in 1469) and the manifestly hurried and inaccurate character of his translations of Plato, Aristotle and other classical authors, combined to ruin his fame as a scholar, and to endanger his position as a teacher of philosophy. (Pope Pius II was among the critics of George&#x27;s translations.) The indignation against George on account of his first-named work was so great that he would probably have been compelled to leave Italy had not Alfonso V of Aragon given him protection at the court of Naples.

He subsequently returned to Rome, where in 1471 he published a very successful Latin grammar based on the work of another Greek grammarian of Latin, Priscian. Additionally, an earlier work on Greek rhetorical principles garnered him wide recognition, even from his former critics who admitted his brilliance and scholarship. He died in great poverty in 1486 in Rome.

His son, Andrea of Trebizond (&quot;da Trebisonda&quot;) was also a classic scholar and translator in Rome.

<text>TIGR (an acronym of the place-names &quot;Trst&quot;, &quot;Istra&quot;, &quot;Gorica&quot;, and &quot;Reka&quot;), fully the Revolutionary Organization of the Julian March T.I.G.R. (), was a militant anti-fascist and insurgent organization established as a response to the Fascist Italianization of the Slovene and Croat people on part of the former Austro-Hungarian territories that became part of Italy after the First World War, and were known at the time as the Julian March. It is considered one of the first anti-fascist resistance movements in Europe. It was active between 1927 and 1941.
== Background ==
 While the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was a multi-national empire, which allowed a relatively large degree of cultural autonomy to the different peoples and ethnic groups, Italy was a nation state, and its governments had little intention of allowing the existence of separate national movements and identities on its territories. Issues regarding the use of the Slovene and Croatian languages in public administration and in the educational system, therefore, became the main point of contention between the Italian authorities and the Slovene and Croatian minorities.

After the Fascist movement came to power in 1922, anti-Slavic policies were enforced as part of Italianization. In 1923, the use of Slovene and Croatian in all public offices, including post offices and means of public transport, was prohibited. In the same year, the Gentile reform declared Italian as the only language of public education; by 1928, all Slovene and Croatian schools, including private ones, were closed down. In 1925, the use of Slovene and Croatian was prohibited in the courts of law. All Slovene and Croatian names of towns and settlements were Italianized. By 1927, all public use of Slovene and Croatian was prohibited. It was prohibited to give children Slavic names, and all Slavic-sounding surnames were administratively given an Italian-sounding form. The Fascist Italianization prohibited Slavic inscriptions on gravestones.

By 1927, all Slovene and Croatian associations—not only political ones, but also cultural, educational and sport associations—were dissolved, as were all financial and economic institutions in the hands of the Slovene and Croatian minority. Starting in 1928, the state law also started limiting the use of Slovene and Croatian in the churches, and in 1934, all use of Slovene and Croatian in Roman Catholic liturgy (including singing and sermons) was prohibited.

Under the effect of this policy, tens of thousands emigrated abroad, mostly to Yugoslavia and South America.

==Composition and activity==
Its membership consisted of radical (mostly national liberal) Slovene youth from former Austrian Littoral, and a few Croats of Istria, where its support was much weaker. Many members of this organization were connected with Yugoslav and British intelligence services and many of them were militarily trained. The aim of the organization was to fight violent Fascist Italianization and to achieve the annexation of Istria, the Slovenian Littoral and Rijeka to Yugoslavia.

The TIGR carried out several bomb attacks on Italian and German soil, as well as assassinations of Italian military personnel, police forces, civil servants and prominent members of the National Fascist Party. It also planned a popular uprising against the Fascist regime, which was however never carried out. Because of these actions, it was treated as a terrorist organization by the Italian state.

The organization was dismantled by the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism in 1940 and 1941. Many of its members joined the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People during World War II. After the war, many former TIGR activists were persecuted by Yugoslav Communist authorities.

== Early activity ==
The first organized anti-Fascist resistance activities in the Julian March began in the mid 1920s in the easternmost districts of the region (around Postojna and Ilirska Bistrica), on the border with Yugoslavia. Local Slovene activists established contacts with the Yugoslav nationalist organization Orjuna, launching first attacks at Italian military and police personnel. These were however still mostly individual actions, without an organizational background. The connections between the Slovene anti-Fascist activists and the Orjuna were soon broken due to a different ideological agenda.

In September 1927, a group of Slovene liberal nationalist activists met on the Nanos Plateau above the Vipava Valley, and decided to form an insurgence organization called TIGR, an abbreviation of the names for Trieste, Istria, Gorizia, and Rijeka. A few months later, another meeting took place in Trieste, where a group connected to the former established the organization &quot;Borba&quot; (Fight), which also included some Croat activists from Istria. From the very beginning, the two groups worked in close alliance.

The two organization were formed mostly by Slovene progressive nationalist youngsters from Trieste, the Karst Plateau, Inner Carniola, and the Tolmin district. Between 1927 and 1930, the organization launched numerous attacks on individual members or supporters of the National Fascist Party (both Italian and Slovene), and also killed several members of repressive forces: carabinieri, border guards, military personnel.

In the Gorizia region, the TIGR organization restrained from openly violent actions, and focused mostly on propaganda and on illegal educational, cultural and political activity among larger strata of the population. The Gorizia section of the TIGR established close connections with the underground Catholic network organized by Christian Socialist activists, centered around the lawyer Janko Kralj and priest Virgil Šček.

In Istria, the TIGR cell was led by Vladimir Gortan, a Croat activist from Beram (near Pazin). Differently from most Slovene cells, Gortan opted for open demonstrative actions, such as attacks on police convoys. In March 1929, during the Fascist plebiscite, when he raided a polling station near the town of Pazin, killing one peasant. Soon afterwards, he was caught by the Italian police and executed.

On 10 February 1930, in the headquarters of the newspaper &quot;Il Popolo di Trieste&quot;, the TIGR places a bomb killing the editor Guido Neri. Three other journalists and typographers remained injured.

In 1930 the Italian fascist police discovered some TIGR cells. Numerous members of the organization were sentenced at the First Trieste trial; four of them (Ferdo Bidovec, Fran Marušič, Zvonimir Miloš and Alojzij Valenčič), charged with murder, were sentenced to death and executed at Basovizza () near Trieste.

== Re-organization in the 1930s ==
After the trial of 1930, the organization quickly re-organized itself under the leadership of Albert Rejec and Danilo Zelen. It expanded its membership and shifted its tactics. Instead of demonstrative attacks on symbolic figures and institutions of Fascist repression, they opted for targeted attacks on infrastructure and high-ranking military, militia and police personnel. They also built a wide intelligence network, and established contacts with British and Yugoslav intelligence services. Ideological propaganda was intensified.

While in the late 1920s, the organization had close connection with radical Yugoslav nationalist movements, such as ORJUNA, after the reorganization in the 1930s it adopted a more left wing ideology. Several connections with Italian anti-Fascist organizations were established (including with the organisation Giustizia e Libertà). In 1935, TIGR signed an agreement of co-operation with the Communist Party of Italy. The TIGR nevertheless tried to remain above all ideological divisions, maintaining a close relationship with the local Slovene and Croat Roman Catholic lower clergy and grassroots organizations in Istria and the Slovenian Littoral.

Among the actions planned by the organization, the most daring and far-reaching was probably the attempt on Benito Mussolini&#x27;s life in 1938. The plan was supposed to be carried out in 1938, when the dictator visited Kobarid (then officially known as Caporetto). The plan was put off at the last minute, most probably because of the pressure by the British intelligence, which opposed such an action in times when Mussolini was conducting an active role in the negotiations that led to the Munich agreement.

After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in 1938, the TIGR expanded its activity to neighboring Nazi Germany, focusing primarily on bomb actions against crucial infrastructure: railways, and high-voltage power lines. The actions led to a thorough investigation by the Fascist regime, which disclosed most of the TIGR cells in 1940/1941.

== Second World War ==

In 1941 several members of TIGR were condemned for espionage and terrorism at the Second Trieste trial; four of them (Viktor Bobek, Ivan Ivančič, Simon Kos and Ivan Vadnal) were executed in Villa Opicina near Trieste the same year, jointly with the Communist activist Pinko Tomažič. By the time of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, most of the organization was already dismantled by both Italian and Nazi German secret police and most of its prominent members either sent to concentration camps, killed or exiled. On May 13, 1941, in the hills above Podtabor, three TIGR members carried out the first armed resistance against Axis forces in Slovenian territory during the Second World War, in which Danilo Zelen (1907–1941) was the first Slovenian to die in combat resisting the Axis forces.

During World War II, many of its members joined the partisan resistance, although the organization itself was not invited to join the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People.

== Aftermath and legacy ==

After the establishment of the Communist regime in Yugoslavia in 1945, most former TIGR members were removed from public life. The Yugoslav secret police continued to closely monitor some of TIGR&#x27;s members up to the 1970s. Their activity was removed from the official historical accounts.

In the late 1970s, the first historical accounts on the activity of the TIGR started to appear. Only in the 1980s, however, did their resistance activity started to be appreciated again, with several historical books written on the matter. The historian Milica Kacin Wohinz was one of the first to produce a thorough study of the movement in a monograph entitled &quot;The First Anti-Fascism in Europe&quot;, and published in 1990.

Throughout the 1990s, the history of TIGR received increased publicity and started to be mentioned in public speeches. In 1994, the &quot;Association for the Nourishment of Patriotic Traditions of the Slovenian Littoral Organization TIGR&quot; (colloquially known as the &quot;Association TIGR&quot; or &quot;Patriotic Association TIGR&quot;) was formed in Postojna, and eventually became the main promoter of the positive evaluation of the TIGR legacy.

In 1997 on the 50th anniversary of annexation of the Slovenian Littoral to the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, the then president of Slovenia Milan Kučan symbolically insignated the organization TIGR with the Golden Honour Insignia of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia (&quot;Zlati častni znak svobode Republike Slovenije&quot;), the highest state decoration in Slovenia.

Since the 1990s, many monuments and memorial plaques have been erected to commemorate TIGR activists and their activities.

<text>A Bachelor of Arts (abbreviated B.A., BA, A.B. or AB; from the Latin &#x27;,&#x27;, or &quot;&quot;) is the holder of a bachelor&#x27;s degree awarded for an undergraduate program in the liberal arts, or, in some cases, other disciplines. A Bachelor of Arts degree course is generally completed in three or four years, depending on the country and institution.

* Degree attainment typically takes five or more years in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
* Degree attainment typically takes four years in Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada (except Quebec), China, Egypt, Finland, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States, and Zambia.
* Degree attainment typically takes three years in Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Caribbean, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Montenegro, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Canadian province of Quebec, South Africa (certain degrees), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (except Scotland), and most of the European Union. In Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Russia, three-year BA (associates) courses are also available. A three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree usually does not qualify the holder for admission to graduate programs in other countries where four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees are the standard prerequisite.

==Definition==
The Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree is an undergraduate postsecondary degree that puts a focus on liberal arts and studies. In comparison, a Bachelor of Science (BS) has a greater focus on science, math, and engineering. The Bachelor of Arts degree is a type of baccalaureate degree. A Bachelor of Arts degree is usually completed in four years: that is, it requires four years of full-time coursework during term time. However, just as with other degrees, some may require a longer time period. This is due to factors such as the student&#x27;s ability, motivation, and access to financial assistance to earn the degree. Just like other baccalaureate degrees, a Bachelor of Arts is historically offered only at public and private universities and colleges. A Bachelor of Arts, just like other bachelor&#x27;s degrees, is an admission requirement for graduate and professional school. Beginning in the 1990s, junior colleges started to confer their own baccalaureate degrees. In addition to the standard BA degrees, there are career-specific Bachelor of Arts degrees, including Bachelor of Arts in Functional English, Bachelor of Arts in Administration, Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies, and Regents Bachelor of Arts.

==History==
The Bachelor of Arts degree has been prominent in academics for centuries. It influenced universities to begin focusing on broad topics such as algebra, psychology, biology, art, history, and philosophy.

This aspect of the BA degree has been consistent in its history. The Bachelor of Arts degree was formed out of the study of liberal arts. &quot;Liberal art&quot; is a term that was applied to the study of many branches of learning such as grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The study of liberal arts started during the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, the term &quot;liberal&quot; &quot;art&quot; was meant to describe general studies more broadly. This definition of liberal studies remains to this day.

In Japan and the United States, Bachelor of Arts degrees were historically given only by public or private institutions and colleges.

==Degrees in Europe==
===Germany===
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a &quot;Universität&quot; (plural: &quot;Universitäten&quot;) or a (plural: ); both can be referred to as a &quot;Hochschule&quot;, which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. is often translated as &quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot;. &quot;Universitäten&quot; place greater emphasis on fundamental science and background in theory, while are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at &quot;Universitäten&quot; and are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the BA course normally lasts between three and three and a half years—six or seven semesters—and the degree is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 ECTS.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the BA and Master of Arts (MA) degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then, a single program led to the &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree (abbreviated drs.), which comprised the same course load as the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs combined. The title &quot;doctorandus&quot; was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (, Dutch for master, abbreviated &quot;Mr.&quot;) and engineering (&quot;ingenieur&quot;, abbreviated Ir. for academic masters level or ING. for higher vocational bachelor&#x27;s level). Those who had already started the &quot;doctorandus&quot; program could, on completing it, opt for the &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree (entitling them to use &quot;drs.&quot; in front of their name) or could use the master&#x27;s degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard. When attaining a master level/graduate degree, it is still customary to use either drs. pre-nominally or MA/MSc post-nominally at the discretion of the holder.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland) and Ireland, the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a BA or BSc degree. However, some older or ancient universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Trinity College Dublin traditionally award BAs to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g., Part II Tripos (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderator-ship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new plate glass universities established in the 1960s, such as York and Lancaster, originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding BAs in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding BSc degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin the degree of MA can be claimed, usually twenty-one terms after matriculation, without any further study. For many centuries, the bachelor&#x27;s degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and of the International Baccalaureate) come from this: and , respectively.

The ancient universities of Scotland award a Master of Arts degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a BSc to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinary. In Scotland, one can opt to take an ordinary degree, which ranks below a third class honours degree (for example, BA with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the post-nominal letters BA for an ordinary or pass degree and BA (Hons) for an honours degree. (However, graduates entitled to use the &quot;Hons&quot; post-nominal very rarely do so in practice.) The academic dress worn by honours and non-honours graduates is identical. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes, depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those who pass with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary, pass or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add &#x27;(Hons)&#x27;) may be awarded if a student has completed (i) followed a non-honours program, or (b) attempted an honours course but marginally failed to achieve third-class standard.

==Degrees in North America==
===Canada===
Education in Canada is controlled by the provinces and can be very different depending on the province. While all Canadian universities offer four-year degrees, it is not uncommon, depending on the province and the university for a three-year general degree to also be offered as an option. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as BA or as honours BA degrees. Honours programs require more education than non-honours programs, typically a specialization beyond the requirements of a BA, and can often be used as a gateway to a PhD program, bypassing a master&#x27;s degree.

===United States===
Along with the Bachelor of Science (B.S.), the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) is the most commonly granted degree in the US. A B.A. degree is earned after the completion of four years of undergraduate college level study. The Bachelor of Science is abbreviated with periods i.e., B.S., and the Bachelor of Arts is abbreviated as B.A. Most US colleges and universities offer undergraduate programs.

== Degrees in other countries ==

In colleges and universities in Australia, Nepal, New Zealand, India and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study. Students must pursue at least one major area of study and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities, students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects.
In Pakistan the Bachelor of Arts (BA) program is a regular 2-year degree program in which students are offered with a combination of any two of areas from the available electives: Business, Journalism, Psychology, Computer Science and Education.

<doc id="156996" wikidata="Q381039" url="?curid=156996" title="John Wilkins">
<text>John Wilkins (14 February 1614 – 19 November 1672) was an Anglican clergyman, natural philosopher, and author, and was one of the founders of the Royal Society. He was Bishop of Chester from 1668 until his death.

Wilkins is one of the few persons to have headed a college at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. He was a polymath, although not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period. His personal qualities were brought out, and obvious to his contemporaries, in reducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford, in founding the Royal Society on non-partisan lines, and in efforts to reach out to Protestant Nonconformists. He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time. He is particularly known for &quot;An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language&quot; (1668) in which, amongst other things, he proposed a universal language and an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system.

Wilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy, yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes; he was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible, &quot;and toleration for the rest&quot;. Gilbert Burnet called him &quot;the wisest clergyman I ever knew. He was a lover of mankind, and had a delight in doing good.&quot; His stepdaughter married John Tillotson, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1691.

== Early life ==
He was probably born at Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, though some sources say Fawsley; his father Walter Wilkins (died 1623) was a goldsmith and his mother Jane Dod was daughter of John Dod, a well-known conforming Puritan. His mother then remarried to Francis Pope, and their son, Walter Pope was a half-brother.

Wilkins was educated at a school in Oxford run by Edward Sylvester, and matriculated at New Inn Hall. He then moved to Magdalen Hall, Oxford where his tutor was John Tombes, and graduated with a BA degree in 1631, an MA degree in 1634. He studied astronomy with John Bainbridge.

Wilkins went to Fawsley in 1637, a sheep-farming place with little population, dominated by the Knightley family, to whom he and then Dod may have ministered; Richard Knightley had been Dod&#x27;s patron there. He was ordained a priest of the Church of England in Christ Church Cathedral in February 1638. He then became chaplain successively to Lord Saye and Sele, and by 1641 to Lord Berkeley. In 1644 he became chaplain to Prince Charles Louis, nephew of King Charles I, who was then in England.

==In London, Oxford and Cambridge==

Wilkins was one of the group of savants, interested in experimental philosophy, who gathered round Charles Scarburgh, the royalist physician who arrived in London in summer 1646 after the fall of Oxford to the parliamentarian forces. The group included George Ent, Samuel Foster, Francis Glisson, Jonathan Goddard, Christopher Merrett, and John Wallis.

Others of Scarburgh&#x27;s circle were William Harvey and Seth Ward. This London group, the Gresham College group of 1645, was described much later by Wallis, who mentions also Theodore Haak, anchoring it also to the Palatine exiles; there are clear connections to the Wilkins Oxford Philosophical Club, another and less remote precursor to the Royal Society.

From 1648 Charles Louis was able to take up his position as Elector of the Palatinate on the Rhine, as a consequence of the Peace of Westphalia. Wilkins travelled to continental Europe, and according to Anthony Wood visited Heidelberg.

In 1648 Wilkins became Warden of Wadham College in Oxford, and under him the college prospered. He fostered political and religious tolerance and drew talented minds to the college, including Christopher Wren. Although he was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, Royalists placed their sons in his charge. From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted with a set of rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, and Wren who was a young protégé of Scarburgh), it included (in the account of Thomas Sprat) Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician, and by 1658 was working with Boyle.

In 1656, Wilkins married Robina French (née Cromwell), youngest sister of Oliver Cromwell, who had been widowed in 1655 when her husband Peter French, a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, had died. Wilkins thereby joined a high stratum of Parliamentary society, and the couple used rooms in Whitehall Palace. Shortly before his death, Oliver Cromwell arranged for Wilkins a new appointment as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, an appointment that was confirmed by Richard Cromwell who succeeded his father as Lord Protector. Wilkins was there long enough to befriend and become a patron of Isaac Barrow.

==After the Restoration==

Upon the Restoration in 1660, the new authorities deprived Wilkins of the position given him by Cromwell; he gained appointment as prebendary of York and rector of Cranford, Middlesex. In 1661, he was reduced to preacher at Gray&#x27;s Inn, lodging with his friend Seth Ward. In 1662, he became vicar of St Lawrence Jewry, London. He suffered in the Great Fire of London, losing his vicarage, library and scientific instruments.

Possessing strong scientific tastes, Wilkins was a founding member of the Royal Society and was soon elected fellow and one of the Society&#x27;s two secretaries: he shared the work with Henry Oldenburg, whom he had met in Oxford in 1656.

==Bishop==
Wilkins became vicar of Polebrook, Northamptonshire, in 1666; prebendary of Exeter in 1667; and in the following year, prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s and bishop of Chester. He owed his position as bishop to the influence of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham&#x27;s approach to the religious problem of the day was comprehension, something less than religious tolerance but aimed at least at bringing in the Presbyterians among the nonconformists to the Church of England by some peaceful form of negotiation and arrangement. Wilkins too thought along these lines. He had been a sympathetic reader of John Humfrey&#x27;s 1661 justification of his acceptance of re-ordination by William Piers, having already once been ordained in the Presbyterian style by a classis.

As Wilkins was ordained, he spoke out against the use of penal laws, and immediately tried to gather support from other moderate bishops to see what concessions to the nonconformists could be made.

A serious effort was made in 1668 to secure a scheme of comprehension, with William Bates, Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton for the dissenters meeting Wilkins and Hezekiah Burton. Wilkins felt the Presbyterians could be brought within the Church of England, while the Independent separatists were left outside. It fell through by late summer, with Manton blaming John Owen for independent scheming for general toleration with Buckingham, and Baxter pointing the finger at the House of Lords.

==Death==
Wilkins died in London, most likely from the medicines used to treat his kidney stones and urinary retention.

==Works==

His numerous written works include:

The early scientific works were in a popular vein, and have links to the publications of Francis Godwin. &quot;The Discovery of a World in the Moone&quot; (1638) was followed up by &quot;A Discourse Concerning a New Planet&quot; (1640). The author highlights the similarities between the Earth and the Moon. Based on these similarities, he proposes the idea that the Moon would house living beings, the Selenites. Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; was also published in 1638. In 1641 Wilkins published an anonymous treatise entitled &quot;Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger&quot;. This was a small work on cryptography; it may well have been influenced by Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Nuncius inanimatus&quot; (1629). His &quot;Mathematical Magic&quot; (1648) was divided into two sections, one on traditional mechanical devices such as the lever, and the other, more speculative, on machines. It drew on many authors, both classical writers and moderns such as Guidobaldo del Monte and Marin Mersenne. It alludes to Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;, for bird-powered flight. These were light if learned works and admitted both blue-sky thinking, such as the possibility of the Moon being inhabitable, and references to figures on the &quot;occult&quot; side: Trithemius, John Dee, the Rosicrucians, Robert Fludd.

&quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; (1646) is a plea for a plain style in preaching, avoiding rhetoric and scholasticism, for a more direct and emotional appeal. It analysed the whole field of available Biblical commentary, for the use of those preparing sermons, and was reprinted many times. It is noted as a transitional work, both in the move away from Ciceronian style in preaching, and in the changing meaning of elocution to the modern sense of vocal production.

&quot;A Discourse Concerning the Beauty of Providence&quot; (1649) took an unfashionable line, namely that divine providence was more inscrutable than current interpreters were saying. It added to the reputation of Wilkins, when the Stuarts returned to the throne, to have warned that the short term reading of events as managed by God was risky.

In 1654, Wilkins joined with Seth Ward in writing &quot;Vindiciae academiarum&quot;, a reply to John Webster&#x27;s &quot;Academiarum Examen&quot;, one of many attacks at the time on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and their teaching methods. This attack had more clout than most: it was dedicated to John Lambert, a top military figure, and was launched during Barebone&#x27;s Parliament, when radical change seemed on the cards. Wilkins (as NS) provided an open letter to Ward; and Ward (as HD, also taking the final letters of his name therefore) replied at greater length. Wilkins makes two main points: first, Webster is not addressing the actual state of the universities, which were not as wedded to old scholastic ways, Aristotle, and Galen, as he said; and secondly Webster&#x27;s mixture of commended authors, without fuller understanding of the topics, really was foolish. In this approach Wilkins had to back away somewhat from his writings of the late 1630s and early 1640s. He made light of this in the way of pointing to Alexander Ross, a very conservative Aristotelian who had attacked his own astronomical works, as a more suitable target for Webster. This exchange was part of the process of the new experimental philosophers throwing off their associations with occultists and radicals.

In 1668 he published his &quot;Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language&quot;. In it he attempted to create a universal language to replace Latin as a completely unambiguous tongue with which scholars and philosophers could communicate. One aspect of this work was the suggestion of an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system but which was never promoted.

In his lexicographical work he collaborated with William Lloyd. The &quot;&quot; (1663), a gently satirical ode to the Society, refers to this project:

<text>An action potential (also known as a nerve impulse or &quot;spike&quot; when in a neuron) is a series of quick changes in voltage across a cell membrane. An action potential occurs when the membrane potential of a specific cell rapidly rises and falls. This depolarization then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarize. Action potentials occur in several types of excitable cells, which include animal cells like neurons and muscle cells, as well as some plant cells. Certain endocrine cells such as pancreatic beta cells, and certain cells of the anterior pituitary gland are also excitable cells.

In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell–cell communication by providing for—or with regard to saltatory conduction, assisting—the propagation of signals along the neuron&#x27;s axon toward synaptic boutons situated at the ends of an axon; these signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. The temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its &quot;spike train&quot;. A neuron that emits an action potential, or nerve impulse, is often said to &quot;fire&quot;.

Action potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell&#x27;s plasma membrane. These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the (negative) resting potential of the cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage, depolarising the transmembrane potential. When the channels open, they allow an inward flow of sodium ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential towards zero. This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on. The process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron, and they are then actively transported back out of the plasma membrane. Potassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the afterhyperpolarization.

In animal cells, there are two primary types of action potentials. One type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated calcium channels. Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond, but calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer. In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a &quot;primer&quot; to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.

==Overview==

Nearly all cell membranes in animals, plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell, called the membrane potential. A typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is −70 mV. This means that the interior of the cell has a negative voltage relative to the exterior. In most types of cells, the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant. Some types of cells, however, are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time. In some types of electrically active cells, including neurons and muscle cells, the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward (positive) spike followed by a rapid fall. These up-and-down cycles are known as &quot;action potentials&quot;. In some types of neurons, the entire up-and-down cycle takes place in a few thousandths of a second. In muscle cells, a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second. In plant cells, an action potential may last three seconds or more.

The electrical properties of a cell are determined by the structure of its membrane. A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer of molecules in which larger protein molecules are embedded. The lipid bilayer is highly resistant to movement of electrically charged ions, so it functions as an insulator. The large membrane-embedded proteins, in contrast, provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane. Action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell. These voltage-sensitive proteins are known as voltage-gated ion channels.

===Process in a typical neuron===

All cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane, known as the membrane potential. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels. In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the dendrites, axon, and cell body different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not. Recent studies have shown that the most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the axon hillock (the point where the axon leaves the cell body), which is called the axonal initial segment, but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases.

Each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential: the resting potential, which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the threshold potential. At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second. However, some types are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.

==Biophysical basis==
Action potentials result from the presence in a cell&#x27;s membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels. A voltage-gated ion channel is a transmembrane protein that has three key properties:
# It is capable of assuming more than one conformation.
# At least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions.
# The transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential.

Thus, a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential, and closed for others. In most cases, however, the relationship between membrane potential and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay. Ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times: The membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition.
Voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops: The membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels, but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential. Thus, in some situations, a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open, thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential. An action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle (Hodgkin cycle) proceeds explosively. The time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it. Several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist. Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction. Slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels. Each of these types comes in multiple variants, with different voltage sensitivity and different temporal dynamics.

The most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction. These are sometimes known as Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels because they were first characterized by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential, but can more conveniently be referred to as &quot;Na&quot;V channels. (The &quot;V&quot; stands for &quot;voltage&quot;.) An &quot;Na&quot;V channel has three possible states, known as &quot;deactivated&quot;, &quot;activated&quot;, and &quot;inactivated&quot;. The channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the &quot;activated&quot; state. When the membrane potential is low, the channel spends most of its time in the &quot;deactivated&quot; (closed) state. If the membrane potential is raised above a certain level, the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the &quot;activated&quot; (open) state. The higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation. Once a channel has activated, it will eventually transition to the &quot;inactivated&quot; (closed) state. It tends then to stay inactivated for some time, but, if the membrane potential becomes low again, the channel will eventually transition back to the &quot;deactivated&quot; state. During an action potential, most channels of this type go through a cycle &quot;deactivated&quot;→&quot;activated&quot;→&quot;inactivated&quot;→&quot;deactivated&quot;. This is only the population average behavior, however – an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time. However, the likelihood of a channel&#x27;s transitioning from the &quot;inactivated&quot; state directly to the &quot;activated&quot; state is very low: A channel in the &quot;inactivated&quot; state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the &quot;deactivated&quot; state.

The outcome of all this is that the kinetics of the &quot;Na&quot;V channels are governed by a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way. Since these channels themselves play a major role in determining the voltage, the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out. Hodgkin and Huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states, known as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. These equations have been extensively modified by later research, but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics.

As the membrane potential is increased, sodium ion channels open, allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell. This is followed by the opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell&#x27;s resting potential. The sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70 mV. However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15 mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell &quot;fires&quot;, producing an action potential. The frequency at which a neuron elicits action potentials is often referred to as a firing rate or neural firing rate.

Currents produced by the opening of voltage-gated channels in the course of an action potential are typically significantly larger than the initial stimulating current. Thus, the amplitude, duration, and shape of the action potential are determined largely by the properties of the excitable membrane and not the amplitude or duration of the stimulus. This all-or-nothing property of the action potential sets it apart from graded potentials such as receptor potentials, electrotonic potentials, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, and synaptic potentials, which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus. A variety of action potential types exist in many cell types and cell compartments as determined by the types of voltage-gated channels, leak channels, channel distributions, ionic concentrations, membrane capacitance, temperature, and other factors.

The principal ions involved in an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell, and potassium ions leave, restoring equilibrium. Relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically. The ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations. The few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continuous action of the sodium–potassium pump, which, with other ion transporters, maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane. Calcium cations and chloride anions are involved in a few types of action potentials, such as the cardiac action potential and the action potential in the single-cell alga &quot;Acetabularia&quot;, respectively.

Although action potentials are generated locally on patches of excitable membrane, the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane, precipitating a domino-like propagation. In contrast to passive spread of electric potentials (electrotonic potential), action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and propagate without decay. Myelinated sections of axons are not excitable and do not produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as electrotonic potential. Regularly spaced unmyelinated patches, called the nodes of Ranvier, generate action potentials to boost the signal. Known as saltatory conduction, this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter. Depolarization of axon terminals, in general, triggers the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. In addition, backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which are ubiquitous in the neocortex. These are thought to have a role in spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

In the Hodgkin–Huxley membrane capacitance model, the speed of transmission of an action potential was undefined and it was assumed that adjacent areas became depolarized due to released ion interference with neighbouring channels. Measurements of ion diffusion and radii have since shown this not to be possible. Moreover, contradictory measurements of entropy changes and timing disputed the capacitance model as acting alone. Alternatively, Gilbert Ling&#x27;s adsorption hypothesis, posits that the membrane potential and action potential of a living cell is due to the adsorption of mobile ions onto adsorption sites of cells.

=== Maturation of the electrical properties of the action potential ===
A neuron&#x27;s ability to generate and propagate an action potential changes during development. How much the membrane potential of a neuron changes as the result of a current impulse is a function of the membrane input resistance. As a cell grows, more channels are added to the membrane, causing a decrease in input resistance. A mature neuron also undergoes shorter changes in membrane potential in response to synaptic currents. Neurons from a ferret lateral geniculate nucleus have a longer time constant and larger voltage deflection at P0 than they do at P30. One consequence of the decreasing action potential duration is that the fidelity of the signal can be preserved in response to high frequency stimulation. Immature neurons are more prone to synaptic depression than potentiation after high frequency stimulation.

In the early development of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The opening and closing kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower than those of the voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. Xenopus neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a potassium channel current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.

In order for the transition from a calcium-dependent action potential to a sodium-dependent action potential to proceed new channels must be added to the membrane. If Xenopus neurons are grown in an environment with RNA synthesis or protein synthesis inhibitors that transition is prevented. Even the electrical activity of the cell itself may play a role in channel expression. If action potentials in Xenopus myocytes are blocked, the typical increase in sodium and potassium current density is prevented or delayed.

This maturation of electrical properties is seen across species. Xenopus sodium and potassium currents increase drastically after a neuron goes through its final phase of mitosis. The sodium current density of rat cortical neurons increases by 600% within the first two postnatal weeks.

==Neurotransmission==
===Anatomy of a neuron===

Several types of cells support an action potential, such as plant cells, muscle cells, and the specialized cells of the heart (in which occurs the cardiac action potential). However, the main excitable cell is the neuron, which also has the simplest mechanism for the action potential.

Neurons are electrically excitable cells composed, in general, of one or more dendrites, a single soma, a single axon and one or more axon terminals. Dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals. Their protrusions, known as dendritic spines, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of ligand-gated ion channels. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines. The dendritic spine can, with rare exception (see LTP), act as an independent unit. The dendrites extend from the soma, which houses the nucleus, and many of the &quot;normal&quot; eukaryotic organelles. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the axon hillock. This region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials, i.e. the trigger zone. Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the axon hillock is the axon. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a myelin sheath. Myelin is composed of either Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system), both of which are types of glial cells. Although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals, they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons. To be specific, myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment, forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present on the surface of the axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These nodes of Ranvier can be considered to be &quot;mini axon hillocks&quot;, as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals. These presynaptic terminals, or synaptic boutons, are a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles.

===Initiation===
Before considering the propagation of action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs, it is helpful to consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the axon hillock. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing. There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.

===Dynamics===
Action potentials are most commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from a presynaptic neuron. Typically, neurotransmitter molecules are released by the presynaptic neuron. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. This binding opens various types of ion channels. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the cell membrane and, thus, the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory. Whether the voltage is increased or decreased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the cable equation and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with the distance from the synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter. Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the axon hillock and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential. More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must work together at nearly the same time to provoke a new action potential. Their joint efforts can be thwarted, however, by the counteracting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.

Neurotransmission can also occur through electrical synapses. Due to the direct connection between excitable cells in the form of gap junctions, an action potential can be transmitted directly from one cell to the next in either direction. The free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical-mediated transmission. Rectifying channels ensure that action potentials move only in one direction through an electrical synapse. Electrical synapses are found in all nervous systems, including the human brain, although they are a distinct minority.

===&quot;All-or-none&quot; principle===

The amplitude of an action potential is often thought to be independent of the amount of current that produced it. In other words, larger currents do not create larger action potentials. Therefore, action potentials are said to be all-or-none signals, since either they occur fully or they do not occur at all. This is in contrast to receptor potentials, whose amplitudes are dependent on the intensity of a stimulus. In both cases, the frequency of action potentials is correlated with the intensity of a stimulus.

Despite the classical view of the action potential as a stereotyped, uniform signal having dominated the field of neuroscience for many decades, newer evidence does suggest that action potentials are more complex events indeed capable of transmitting information through not just their amplitude, but their duration and phase as well, sometimes even up to distances originally not thought to be possible.

===Sensory neurons===
In sensory neurons, an external signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is coupled with the opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. Some examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner&#x27;s corpuscle, which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon. Instead, they may convert the signal into the release of a neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.

===Pacemaker potentials===


In sensory neurons, action potentials result from an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock. The voltage traces of such cells are known as pacemaker potentials. The cardiac pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example. Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The external stimuli do not cause the cell&#x27;s repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing. In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as bursting.

==Phases==
The course of the action potential can be divided into five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and the refractory period. During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative, returning towards resting potential. The undershoot, or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized). Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the refractory period, which may overlap with the other phases.

The course of the action potential is determined by two coupled effects. First, voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response to changes in the membrane voltage &quot;Vm&quot;. This changes the membrane&#x27;s permeability to those ions. Second, according to the Goldman equation, this change in permeability changes the equilibrium potential &quot;Em&quot;, and, thus, the membrane voltage &quot;Vm&quot;. Thus, the membrane potential affects the permeability, which then further affects the membrane potential. This sets up the possibility for positive feedback, which is a key part of the rising phase of the action potential. A complicating factor is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal &quot;gates&quot; that respond to changes in &quot;Vm&quot; in opposite ways, or at different rates. For example, although raising &quot;Vm&quot; &quot;opens&quot; most gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, it also &quot;closes&quot; the channel&#x27;s &quot;inactivation gate&quot;, albeit more slowly. Hence, when &quot;Vm&quot; is raised suddenly, the sodium channels open initially, but then close due to the slower inactivation.

The voltages and currents of the action potential in all of its phases were modeled accurately by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. However, their model considers only two types of voltage-sensitive ion channels, and makes several assumptions about them, e.g., that their internal gates open and close independently of one another. In reality, there are many types of ion channels, and they do not always open and close independently.

===Stimulation and rising phase===
A typical action potential begins at the axon hillock with a sufficiently strong depolarization, e.g., a stimulus that increases &quot;Vm&quot;. This depolarization is often caused by the injection of extra sodium cations into the cell; these cations can come from a wide variety of sources, such as chemical synapses, sensory neurons or pacemaker potentials.

For a neuron at rest, there is a high concentration of sodium and chloride ions in the extracellular fluid compared to the intracellular fluid, while there is a high concentration of potassium ions in the intracellular fluid compared to the extracellular fluid. The difference in concentrations, which causes ions to move from a high to a low concentration, and electrostatic effects (attraction of opposite charges) are responsible for the movement of ions in and out of the neuron. The inside of a neuron has a negative charge, relative to the cell exterior, from the movement of K+ out of the cell. The neuron membrane is more permeable to K+ than to other ions, allowing this ion to selectively move out of the cell, down its concentration gradient. This concentration gradient along with potassium leak channels present on the membrane of the neuron causes an of potassium ions making the resting potential close to &quot;E&quot;K ≈ –75 mV. Since Na+ ions are in higher concentrations outside of the cell, the concentration and voltage differences both drive them into the cell when Na+ channels open. Depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow into and out of the axon, respectively. If the depolarization is small (say, increasing &quot;Vm&quot; from −70 mV to −60 mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around −70 mV. However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition (positive feedback) results: the more inward current there is, the more &quot;Vm&quot; increases, which in turn further increases the inward current. A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in &quot;Vm&quot;) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives &quot;Vm&quot; closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage &quot;E&quot;Na≈ +55 mV. The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes &quot;Vm&quot; still further towards &quot;E&quot;Na. This positive feedback continues until the sodium channels are fully open and &quot;Vm&quot; is close to &quot;E&quot;Na. The sharp rise in &quot;Vm&quot; and sodium permeability correspond to the &quot;rising phase&quot; of the action potential.

The critical threshold voltage for this runaway condition is usually around −45 mV, but it depends on the recent activity of the axon. A cell that has just fired an action potential cannot fire another one immediately, since the Na+ channels have not recovered from the inactivated state. The period during which no new action potential can be fired is called the &quot;absolute refractory period&quot;. At longer times, after some but not all of the ion channels have recovered, the axon can be stimulated to produce another action potential, but with a higher threshold, requiring a much stronger depolarization, e.g., to −30 mV. The period during which action potentials are unusually difficult to evoke is called the &quot;relative refractory period&quot;.

===Peak phase===
The positive feedback of the rising phase slows and comes to a halt as the sodium ion channels become maximally open. At the peak of the action potential, the sodium permeability is maximized and the membrane voltage &quot;Vm&quot; is nearly equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage &quot;E&quot;Na. However, the same raised voltage that opened the sodium channels initially also slowly shuts them off, by closing their pores; the sodium channels become &quot;inactivated&quot;. This lowers the membrane&#x27;s permeability to sodium relative to potassium, driving the membrane voltage back towards the resting value. At the same time, the raised voltage opens voltage-sensitive potassium channels; the increase in the membrane&#x27;s potassium permeability drives &quot;Vm&quot; towards &quot;E&quot;K. Combined, these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause &quot;Vm&quot; to drop quickly, repolarizing the membrane and producing the &quot;falling phase&quot; of the action potential.

===Afterhyperpolarization===
The depolarized voltage opens additional voltage-dependent potassium channels, and some of these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, further potassium channels open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The intracellular concentration of potassium ions is transiently unusually low, making the membrane voltage &quot;Vm&quot; even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage &quot;E&quot;K. The membrane potential goes below the resting membrane potential. Hence, there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization, termed an afterhyperpolarization, that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value, restoring the membrane potential to the resting state.

===Refractory period===
Each action potential is followed by a refractory period, which can be divided into an &quot;absolute refractory period&quot;, during which it is impossible to evoke another action potential, and then a &quot;relative refractory period&quot;, during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required. These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules. When closing after an action potential, sodium channels enter an &quot;inactivated&quot; state, in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potential—this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state, it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open, making it difficult for the membrane potential to depolarize, and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period. Because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons, the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable.

The absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons. At any given moment, the patch of axon behind the actively spiking part is refractory, but the patch in front, not having been activated recently, is capable of being stimulated by the depolarization from the action potential.

==Propagation==

The action potential generated at the axon hillock propagates as a wave along the axon. The currents flowing inwards at a point on the axon during an action potential spread out along the axon, and depolarize the adjacent sections of its membrane. If sufficiently strong, this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches. This basic mechanism was demonstrated by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin in 1937. After crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, he showed that an action potential arriving on one side of the block could provoke another action potential on the other, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short.

Once an action potential has occurred at a patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again. At the molecular level, this &quot;absolute refractory period&quot; corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., to return to their closed state. There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons. Some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several milliseconds during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state. Although it limits the frequency of firing, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon. The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon. However, only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. In the usual orthodromic conduction, the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as antidromic conduction—is very rare. However, if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle, both halves of the axon are &quot;fresh&quot;, i.e., unfired; then two action potentials will be generated, one traveling towards the axon hillock and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs.

===Myelin and saltatory conduction===
In order to enable fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system, certain neuronal axons are covered with myelin sheaths. Myelin is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as nodes of Ranvier. It is produced by specialized cells: Schwann cells exclusively in the peripheral nervous system, and oligodendrocytes exclusively in the central nervous system. Myelin sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node. Myelination is found mainly in vertebrates, but an analogous system has been discovered in a few invertebrates, such as some species of shrimp. Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; for example, axons of the neurons comprising the autonomous nervous system are not, in general, myelinated.

Myelin prevents ions from entering or leaving the axon along myelinated segments. As a general rule, myelination increases the conduction velocity of action potentials and makes them more energy-efficient. Whether saltatory or not, the mean conduction velocity of an action potential ranges from 1 meter per second (m/s) to over 100 m/s, and, in general, increases with axonal diameter.

Action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane in myelinated segments of the axon. However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient to depolarize the first or second subsequent node of Ranvier. Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one node of Ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent &quot;hopping&quot; of the action potential from node to node is known as saltatory conduction. Although the mechanism of saltatory conduction was suggested in 1925 by Ralph Lillie, the first experimental evidence for saltatory conduction came from Ichiji Tasaki and Taiji Takeuchi and from Andrew Huxley and Robert Stämpfli. By contrast, in unmyelinated axons, the action potential provokes another in the membrane immediately adjacent, and moves continuously down the axon like a wave.

Myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency. For axons larger than a minimum diameter (roughly 1 micrometre), myelination increases the conduction velocity of an action potential, typically tenfold. Conversely, for a given conduction velocity, myelinated fibers are smaller than their unmyelinated counterparts. For example, action potentials move at roughly the same speed (25 m/s) in a myelinated frog axon and an unmyelinated squid giant axon, but the frog axon has a roughly 30-fold smaller diameter and 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area. Also, since the ionic currents are confined to the nodes of Ranvier, far fewer ions &quot;leak&quot; across the membrane, saving metabolic energy. This saving is a significant selective advantage, since the human nervous system uses approximately 20% of the body&#x27;s metabolic energy.

The length of axons&#x27; myelinated segments is important to the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. In nature, myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node. Thus, the safety factor of saltatory conduction is high, allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury. However, action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the safety factor is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the branch point of an axon, where it divides into two axons.

Some diseases degrade myelin and impair saltatory conduction, reducing the conduction velocity of action potentials. The most well-known of these is multiple sclerosis, in which the breakdown of myelin impairs coordinated movement.

===Cable theory===
The flow of currents within an axon can be described quantitatively by cable theory and its elaborations, such as the compartmental model. Cable theory was developed in 1855 by Lord Kelvin to model the transatlantic telegraph cable and was shown to be relevant to neurons by Hodgkin and Rushton in 1946. In simple cable theory, the neuron is treated as an electrically passive, perfectly cylindrical transmission cable, which can be described by a partial differential equation

:formula_1

where &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is the voltage across the membrane at a time &quot;t&quot; and a position &quot;x&quot; along the length of the neuron, and where λ and τ are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus. Referring to the circuit diagram on the right, these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length.

:formula_2

:formula_3

These time and length-scales can be used to understand the dependence of the conduction velocity on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers. For example, the time-scale τ increases with both the membrane resistance &quot;rm&quot; and capacitance &quot;cm&quot;. As the capacitance increases, more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by the equation &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;CV&quot;); as the resistance increases, less charge is transferred per unit time, making the equilibration slower. In a similar manner, if the internal resistance per unit length &quot;ri&quot; is lower in one axon than in another (e.g., because the radius of the former is larger), the spatial decay length λ becomes longer and the conduction velocity of an action potential should increase. If the transmembrane resistance &quot;rm&quot; is increased, that lowers the average &quot;leakage&quot; current across the membrane, likewise causing &quot;λ&quot; to become longer, increasing the conduction velocity.

==Termination==

===Chemical synapses===
In general, action potentials that reach the synaptic knobs cause a neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters are small molecules that may open ion channels in the postsynaptic cell; most axons have the same neurotransmitter at all of their termini. The arrival of the action potential opens voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane; the influx of calcium causes vesicles filled with neurotransmitter to migrate to the cell&#x27;s surface and release their contents into the synaptic cleft. This complex process is inhibited by the neurotoxins tetanospasmin and botulinum toxin, which are responsible for tetanus and botulism, respectively.

===Electrical synapses===
Some synapses dispense with the &quot;middleman&quot; of the neurotransmitter, and connect the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells together. When an action potential reaches such a synapse, the ionic currents flowing into the presynaptic cell can cross the barrier of the two cell membranes and enter the postsynaptic cell through pores known as connexons. Thus, the ionic currents of the presynaptic action potential can directly stimulate the postsynaptic cell. Electrical synapses allow for faster transmission because they do not require the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft. Hence, electrical synapses are used whenever fast response and coordination of timing are crucial, as in escape reflexes, the retina of vertebrates, and the heart.

===Neuromuscular junctions===
A special case of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction, in which the axon of a motor neuron terminates on a muscle fiber. In such cases, the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which binds to the acetylcholine receptor, an integral membrane protein in the membrane (the &quot;sarcolemma&quot;) of the muscle fiber. However, the acetylcholine does not remain bound; rather, it dissociates and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, located in the synapse. This enzyme quickly reduces the stimulus to the muscle, which allows the degree and timing of muscular contraction to be regulated delicately. Some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase to prevent this control, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides diazinon and malathion.

==Other cell types==

===Cardiac action potentials===


The cardiac action potential differs from the neuronal action potential by having an extended plateau, in which the membrane is held at a high voltage for a few hundred milliseconds prior to being repolarized by the potassium current as usual. This plateau is due to the action of slower calcium channels opening and holding the membrane voltage near their equilibrium potential even after the sodium channels have inactivated.

The cardiac action potential plays an important role in coordinating the contraction of the heart. The cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart. The action potentials of those cells propagate to and through the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Action potentials from the AV node travel through the bundle of His and thence to the Purkinje fibers. Conversely, anomalies in the cardiac action potential—whether due to a congenital mutation or injury—can lead to human pathologies, especially arrhythmias. Several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential, such as quinidine, lidocaine, beta blockers, and verapamil.

===Muscular action potentials===
The action potential in a normal skeletal muscle cell is similar to the action potential in neurons. Action potentials result from the depolarization of the cell membrane (the sarcolemma), which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; these become inactivated and the membrane is repolarized through the outward current of potassium ions. The resting potential prior to the action potential is typically −90mV, somewhat more negative than typical neurons. The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2–4 ms, the absolute refractory period is roughly 1–3 ms, and the conduction velocity along the muscle is roughly 5 m/s. The action potential releases calcium ions that free up the tropomyosin and allow the muscle to contract. Muscle action potentials are provoked by the arrival of a pre-synaptic neuronal action potential at the neuromuscular junction, which is a common target for neurotoxins.

===Plant action potentials===
Plant and fungal cells are also electrically excitable. The fundamental difference from animal action potentials is that the depolarization in plant cells is not accomplished by an uptake of positive sodium ions, but by release of negative &quot;chloride&quot; ions. In 1906, J. C. Bose published the first measurements of action potentials in plants, which had previously been discovered by Burdon-Sanderson and Darwin. An increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions may be the cause of anion release into the cell. This makes calcium a precursor to ion movements, such as the influx of negative chloride ions and efflux of positive potassium ions, as seen in barley leaves.

The initial influx of calcium ions also poses a small cellular depolarization, causing the voltage-gated ion channels to open and allowing full depolarization to be propagated by chloride ions.

Some plants (e.g. &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;) use sodium-gated channels to operate plant movements and &quot;count&quot; stimulation events to determine if a threshold for movement is met. &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;, also known as the Venus flytrap, is found in subtropical wetlands in North and South Carolina. When there are poor soil nutrients, the flytrap relies on a diet of insects and animals. Despite research on the plant, there lacks an understanding behind the molecular basis to the Venus flytraps, and carnivore plants in general.

However, plenty of research has been done on action potentials and how they affect movement and clockwork within the Venus flytrap. To start, the resting membrane potential of the Venus flytrap (−120 mV) is lower than animal cells (usually −90 mV to −40 mV). The lower resting potential makes it easier to activate an action potential. Thus, when an insect lands on the trap of the plant, it triggers a hair-like mechanoreceptor. This receptor then activates an action potential that lasts around 1.5 ms. This causes an increase of positive calcium ions into the cell, slightly depolarizing it. However, the flytrap does not close after one trigger. Instead, it requires the activation of two or more hairs. If only one hair is triggered, it disregards the activation as a false positive. Further, the second hair must be activated within a certain time interval (0.75–40 s) for it to register with the first activation. Thus, a buildup of calcium begins and then slowly falls after the first trigger. When the second action potential is fired within the time interval, it reaches the calcium threshold to depolarize the cell, closing the trap on the prey within a fraction of a second.

Together with the subsequent release of positive potassium ions the action potential in plants involves an osmotic loss of salt (KCl). Whereas, the animal action potential is osmotically neutral because equal amounts of entering sodium and leaving potassium cancel each other osmotically. The interaction of electrical and osmotic relations in plant cells appears to have arisen from an osmotic function of electrical excitability in a common unicellular ancestors of plants and animals under changing salinity conditions. Further, the present function of rapid signal transmission is seen as a newer accomplishment of metazoan cells in a more stable osmotic environment. It is likely that the familiar signaling function of action potentials in some vascular plants (e.g. &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot;) arose independently from that in metazoan excitable cells.

Unlike the rising phase and peak, the falling phase and after-hyperpolarization seem to depend primarily on cations that are not calcium. To initiate repolarization, the cell requires movement of potassium out of the cell through passive transportation on the membrane. This differs from neurons because the movement of potassium does not dominate the decrease in membrane potential. To fully repolarize, a plant cell requires energy in the form of ATP to assist in the release of hydrogen from the cell – utilizing a transporter called proton ATPase.

==Taxonomic distribution and evolutionary advantages==
Action potentials are found throughout multicellular organisms, including plants, invertebrates such as insects, and vertebrates such as reptiles and mammals. Sponges seem to be the main phylum of multicellular eukaryotes that does not transmit action potentials, although some studies have suggested that these organisms have a form of electrical signaling, too. The resting potential, as well as the size and duration of the action potential, have not varied much with evolution, although the conduction velocity does vary dramatically with axonal diameter and myelination.

Given its conservation throughout evolution, the action potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 m/s, which is one-third the speed of sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8 m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, one that has been exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.

The common prokaryotic/eukaryotic ancestor, which lived perhaps four billion years ago, is believed to have had voltage-gated channels. This functionality was likely, at some later point, cross-purposed to provide a communication mechanism. Even modern single-celled bacteria can utilize action potentials to communicate with other bacteria in the same biofilm.

==Experimental methods==


The study of action potentials has required the development of new experimental methods. The initial work, prior to 1955, was carried out primarily by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, who were, along John Carew Eccles, awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contribution to the description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction. It focused on three goals: isolating signals from single neurons or axons, developing fast, sensitive electronics, and shrinking electrodes enough that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded.

The first problem was solved by studying the giant axons found in the neurons of the squid (&quot;Loligo forbesii&quot; and &quot;Doryteuthis pealeii&quot;, at the time classified as &quot;Loligo pealeii&quot;). These axons are so large in diameter (roughly 1 mm, or 100-fold larger than a typical neuron) that they can be seen with the naked eye, making them easy to extract and manipulate. However, they are not representative of all excitable cells, and numerous other systems with action potentials have been studied.

The second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the voltage clamp, which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation, and eliminated a key source of electronic noise, the current &quot;IC&quot; associated with the capacitance &quot;C&quot; of the membrane. Since the current equals &quot;C&quot; times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage &quot;Vm&quot;, the solution was to design a circuit that kept &quot;Vm&quot; fixed (zero rate of change) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane. Thus, the current required to keep &quot;Vm&quot; at a fixed value is a direct reflection of the current flowing through the membrane. Other electronic advances included the use of Faraday cages and electronics with high input impedance, so that the measurement itself did not affect the voltage being measured.

The third problem, that of obtaining electrodes small enough to record voltages within a single axon without perturbing it, was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropipette electrode, which was quickly adopted by other researchers. Refinements of this method are able to produce electrode tips that are as fine as 100 Å (10 nm), which also confers high input impedance. Action potentials may also be recorded with small metal electrodes placed just next to a neuron, with neurochips containing EOSFETs, or optically with dyes that are sensitive to Ca2+ or to voltage.

While glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels, studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the patch clamp by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann. For this discovery, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991. Patch-clamping verified that ionic channels have discrete states of conductance, such as open, closed and inactivated.

Optical imaging technologies have been developed in recent years to measure action potentials, either via simultaneous multisite recordings or with ultra-spatial resolution. Using voltage-sensitive dyes, action potentials have been optically recorded from a tiny patch of cardiomyocyte membrane.

==Neurotoxins==
Several neurotoxins, both natural and synthetic, function by blocking the action potential. Tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the &quot;Gonyaulax&quot; (the dinoflagellate genus responsible for &quot;red tides&quot;) block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel; similarly, dendrotoxin from the black mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel. Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to &quot;turn off&quot; specific channels at will, thus isolating the other channels&#x27; contributions; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as chemical weapons. Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides; one example is the synthetic permethrin, which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials. The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.

==History==
The role of electricity in the nervous systems of animals was first observed in dissected frogs by Luigi Galvani, who studied it from 1791 to 1797. Galvani&#x27;s results inspired Alessandro Volta to develop the Voltaic pile—the earliest-known electric battery—with which he studied animal electricity (such as electric eels) and the physiological responses to applied direct-current voltages.

In the 19th century scientists studied the propagation of electrical signals in whole nerves (i.e., bundles of neurons) and demonstrated that nervous tissue was made up of cells, instead of an interconnected network of tubes (a &quot;reticulum&quot;). Carlo Matteucci followed up Galvani&#x27;s studies and demonstrated that injured nerves and muscles in frogs could produce direct current. Matteucci&#x27;s work inspired the German physiologist, Emil du Bois-Reymond, who discovered in 1843 that stimulating these muscle and nerve preparations produced a notable diminution in their resting currents, making him the first researcher to identify the electrical nature of the action potential. The conduction velocity of action potentials was then measured in 1850 by du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s friend, Hermann von Helmholtz. Progress in electrophysiology stagnated thereafter due to the limitations of chemical theory and experimental practice. To establish that nervous tissue is made up of discrete cells, the Spanish physician Santiago Ramón y Cajal and his students used a stain developed by Camillo Golgi to reveal the myriad shapes of neurons, which they rendered painstakingly. For their discoveries, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal were awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology. Their work resolved a long-standing controversy in the neuroanatomy of the 19th century; Golgi himself had argued for the network model of the nervous system.

The 20th century saw significant breakthroughs in electrophysiology. In 1902 and again in 1912, Julius Bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeability of the axonal membrane to ions. Bernstein&#x27;s hypothesis was confirmed by Ken Cole and Howard Curtis, who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential. In 1907, Louis Lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed, what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances. In 1949, Alan Hodgkin and Bernard Katz refined Bernstein&#x27;s hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions; in particular, they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential. They made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential. This line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of Hodgkin, Katz and Andrew Huxley, in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane&#x27;s permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time, from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively. Hodgkin and Huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states, including &quot;open&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, and &quot;inactivated&quot;. Their hypotheses were confirmed in the mid-1970s and 1980s by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, who developed the technique of patch clamping to examine the conductance states of individual ion channels. In the 21st century, researchers are beginning to understand the structural basis for these conductance states and for the selectivity of channels for their species of ion, through the atomic-resolution crystal structures, fluorescence distance measurements and cryo-electron microscopy studies.

Julius Bernstein was also the first to introduce the Nernst equation for resting potential across the membrane; this was generalized by David E. Goldman to the eponymous Goldman equation in 1943. The sodium–potassium pump was identified in 1957 and its properties gradually elucidated, culminating in the determination of its atomic-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved, giving a broader view of how these molecular machines work.

==Quantitative models==


Mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential, and offer predictions that may be tested against experimental data, providing a stringent test of a theory. The most important and accurate of the early neural models is the Hodgkin–Huxley model, which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although the Hodgkin–Huxley model may be a simplification with few limitations compared to the realistic nervous membrane as it exists in nature, its complexity has inspired several even-more-simplified models, such as the Morris–Lecar model and the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, both of which have only two coupled ODEs. The properties of the Hodgkin–Huxley and FitzHugh–Nagumo models and their relatives, such as the Bonhoeffer–Van der Pol model, have been well-studied within mathematics, computation and electronics. However the simple models of generator potential and action potential fail to accurately reproduce the near threshold neural spike rate and spike shape, specifically for the mechanoreceptors like the Pacinian corpuscle. More modern research has focused on larger and more integrated systems; by joining action-potential models with models of other parts of the nervous system (such as dendrites and synapses), researchers can study neural computation and simple reflexes, such as escape reflexes and others controlled by central pattern generators.

<doc id="156999" wikidata="Q47928" url="?curid=156999" title="Circus">
<text>A circus is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, dancers, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, magicians, ventriloquists, and unicyclists as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term &quot;circus&quot; also describes the field of performance, training, and community which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Although not the inventor of the medium, Newcastle-under-Lyme born Philip Astley is credited as the father of the modern circus. 

In 1768, Astley, a skilled equestrian, began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha&#x27;penny Hatch on the south side of the Thames River, England. In 1770, he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers, and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a &quot;circus.&quot; Performances developed significantly over the next 50 years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The format in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music, often termed &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;classical&quot; circus, developed in the latter part of the nineteenth century and remained the dominant format until the 1970s.

As styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venue where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open-air structures with limited covered seating. From the late eighteenth to late nineteenth century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a center ring, and sometimes a stage. The traditional large tents commonly known as &quot;big tops&quot; were introduced in the mid-nineteenth century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue. Contemporary circus is performed in a variety of venues including tents, theatres, casinos, cruise ships, and open-air spaces. Many circus performances are still held in a ring, usually in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late eighteenth century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.

A shift in form has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry. Circus companies and artistes within this movement, often termed &quot;new circus&quot; or &quot;cirque nouveau,&quot; have tended to favor a theatrical approach, combining character-driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories. Since the 1990s, a more avant-garde approach to presenting traditional circus techniques or &quot;disciplines&quot; in ways that align more closely to performance art, dance or visual arts has been given the name &quot;contemporary circus.&quot; This labelling can cause confusion based upon the other use of the phrase contemporary circus to mean &quot;circus of today.&quot; For this reason, some commentators have begun using the term &quot;21st Century Circus&quot; to encompass all the various styles available in the present day. 21st Century Circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills, techniques, and stylistic influences from other art forms and technological developments. For aesthetic or economic reasons, 21st Century Circus productions may often be staged in theaters rather than in large outdoor tents.

==Etymology==
First attested in English fourteenth century, the word &quot;circus&quot; derives from Latin , which is the romanization of the Greek (), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek (), meaning &quot;circle&quot; or &quot;ring.&quot; In the book , early Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honor of her father Helios, the Sun God.

==History==
The modern and commonly held idea of a circus is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein; however, the history of circuses is more complex, with historians disagreeing on its origin, as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research, and the ongoing circus phenomenon. For many, circus history begins with Englishman Philip Astley, while for others its origins go back much further—to Roman Empire times.

===Origin===
In Ancient Rome, the &quot;circus&quot; was a roofless arena for the exhibition of horse and chariot races, equestrian shows, staged battles, gladiatorial combat, and displays of (and fights with) trained animals. The circuses of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek hippodromes, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction, and for events that involved re-enactments of naval battles, the circus was flooded with water; however, the Roman circus buildings were not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank; there were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends. The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated. Some circus historians such as George Speaight have stated &quot;these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called &#x27;circuses&#x27; by the Romans, but it is a mistake to equate these places, or the entertainments presented there, with the modern circus&quot;. Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman circuses and a chronology of circus-related entertainment can be traced to Roman times, continued by the Hippodrome of Constantinople that operated until the 13th century, through medieval and renaissance jesters, minstrels and troubadours to the late 18th century and the time of Astley.

The first circus in the city of Rome was the Circus Maximus, in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was constructed during the monarchy and, at first, built completely from wood. After being rebuilt several times, the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people; it was built of stone and measured 400m in length and 90m in width. Next in importance were the Circus Flaminius and the Circus Neronis, from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero. A fourth circus was constructed by Maxentius; its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus.

For some time after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment. Instead, itinerant performers, animal trainers, and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe, performing at local fairs, such as the Bartholomew Fair in London during the Middle Ages.

===Modern format===
====Astley and early British circus====
The origin of the modern circus has been attributed to Philip Astley, who was born 1742 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England. He became a cavalry officer who set up the first modern amphitheatre for the display of horse riding tricks in Lambeth, London, on 4 April 1768. Astley did not originate trick horse riding, nor was he first to introduce acts such as acrobats and clowns to the English public, but he was the first to create a space where all these acts were brought together to perform a show. Astley rode in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did, and thus chanced on the format of performing in a circle. Astley performed stunts in a 42 ft diameter ring, which is the standard size used by circuses ever since. Astley referred to the performance arena as a circle and the building as an amphitheatre; these would later be known as a circus. In 1770, Astley hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers, and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts.

Astley was followed by Andrew Ducrow, whose feats of horsemanship had much to do with establishing the traditions of the circus, which were perpetuated by Hengler&#x27;s and Sanger&#x27;s celebrated shows in a later generation. In England circuses were often held in purpose-built buildings in large cities, such as the London Hippodrome, which was built as a combination of the circus, the menagerie, and the variety theatre, where wild animals such as lions and elephants from time to time appeared in the ring, and where convulsions of nature such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions were produced with an extraordinary wealth of realistic display. Joseph Grimaldi, the first mainstream clown, had his first major role as Little Clown in the pantomime &quot;The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Wedding&quot; in 1781. The Royal Circus was opened in London on 4 November 1782 by Charles Dibdin (who coined the term &quot;circus&quot;), aided by his partner Charles Hughes, an equestrian performer. In 1782, Astley established the Amphithéâtre Anglais in Paris, the first purpose-built circus in France, followed by 18 other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe. Astley leased his Parisian circus to the Italian Antonio Franconi in 1793. In 1826, the first circus took place under a canvas big top.

====Ricketts and the first American circus====
The Englishman John Bill Ricketts brought the first modern circus to the United States. He began his theatrical career with Hughes Royal Circus in London in the 1780s, and travelled from England in 1792 to establish his first circus in Philadelphia. The first circus building in the US opened on 3 April 1793 in Philadelphia, where Ricketts gave America&#x27;s first complete circus performance. George Washington attended a performance there later that season.
====Expansion of the American format====

In the Americas during the first two decades of the 19th century, the Circus of Pepin and Breschard toured from Montreal to Havana, building circus theatres in many of the cities it visited. Victor Pépin, a native New Yorker, was the first American to operate a major circus in the United States. Later the establishments of Purdy, Welch &amp; Co., and of van Amburgh gave a wider popularity to the circus in the United States. In 1825, Joshuah Purdy Brown was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance. Circus pioneer Dan Rice was the most famous pre-Civil War circus clown, popularising such expressions as &quot;The One-Horse Show&quot; and &quot;Hey, Rube!&quot;. The American circus was revolutionised by P. T. Barnum and William Cameron Coup, who launched the travelling P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Museum, Menagerie &amp; Circus, the first freak show, in the 1870s. Coup also introduced the first multiple-ring circuses, and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use circus trains to transport the circus between towns. By the 1830s, sideshows were also being established alongside travelling circuses.
====Touring ====
In 1838, the equestrian Thomas Taplin Cooke returned to England from the United States, bringing with him a circus tent. At this time, itinerant circuses that could be fitted-up quickly were becoming popular in Britain. William Batty&#x27;s circus, for example, between 1838 and 1840, travelled from Newcastle to Edinburgh and then to Portsmouth and Southampton. Pablo Fanque, who is noteworthy as Britain&#x27;s only black circus proprietor and who operated one of the most celebrated travelling circuses in Victorian England, erected temporary structures for his limited engagements or retrofitted existing structures. One such structure in Leeds, which Fanque assumed from a departing circus, collapsed, resulting in minor injuries to many but the death of Fanque&#x27;s wife. Traveling circus companies also rented the land they set up their structures on sometimes causing damage to the local ecosystems. Three important circus innovators were the Italian Giuseppe Chiarini, and Frenchmen Louis Soullier and Jacques Tourniaire, whose early travelling circuses introduced the circus to Latin America, Australia, Southeast Asia, China, South Africa, and Russia. Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in 1866, and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga, where it became extremely popular.

After an 1881 merger with James Anthony Bailey and James L. Hutchinson&#x27;s circus and Barnum&#x27;s death in 1891, his circus travelled to Europe as the Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including the tent and circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition, and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the 20th century.

The influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialogue of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly, while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and by exhibitions of skill, strength, and daring, requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers, and often of complicated and expensive machinery.

From the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city. After World War II, the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment (such as television) arrived and the public&#x27;s tastes changed. From the 1960s onward, circuses attracted growing criticism from animal rights activists. Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies. Nonetheless, a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world, ranging from small family enterprises to three-ring extravaganzas. Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself.

====Russia====
In 1919, Lenin, head of Soviet Russia, expressed a wish for the circus to become &quot;the people&#x27;s art-form&quot;, with facilities and status on par with theatre, opera and ballet. The USSR nationalised Russian circuses. In 1927, the State University of Circus and Variety Arts, better known as the Moscow Circus School, was established; performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics programme. When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the 1950s, its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded.

====China====
Circuses from China, drawing on Chinese traditions of acrobatics, like the Chinese State Circus are also popular touring acts.

===New Circus===

New Circus (originally known as &quot;cirque nouveau&quot;) is a performing arts movement that originated in the 1970s in Australia, Canada, France, the West Coast of the United States, and the United Kingdom. New Circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme. Compared with the traditional circus, this genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact, on character and story development, and on the use of lighting design, original music, and costume design to convey thematic or narrative content. Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production, and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history. Animal acts rarely appear in new circus, in contrast to traditional circus, where animal acts have often been a significant part of the entertainment.

Early pioneers of the new circus genre included: Circus Oz, forged in Australia in 1977 from SoapBox Circus (1976) and New Circus (1973); the Pickle Family Circus, founded in San Francisco in 1975; Ra-Ra Zoo in 1984 in London; Nofit State Circus in 1984 from Wales; Cirque du Soleil, founded in Quebec in 1984; Cirque Plume and Archaos from France in 1984 and 1986 respectively. More recent examples include: Cirque Éloize (founded in Quebec in 1993); Sweden&#x27;s Cirkus Cirkör (1995); Teatro ZinZanni (founded in Seattle in 1998); the West African Circus Baobab (late 1990s); and Montreal&#x27;s Les 7 doigts de la main (founded in 2002). The genre includes other circus troupes such as the Vermont-based Circus Smirkus (founded in 1987 by Rob Mermin) and Le Cirque Imaginaire (later renamed Le Cirque Invisible, both founded and directed by Victoria Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin).

The most conspicuous success story in the new circus genre has been that of Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian circus company whose estimated annual revenue exceeds US$810 million in 2009, and whose &quot;cirque nouveau&quot; shows have been seen by nearly 90 million spectators in over 200 cities on five continents.

===Contemporary Circus===

The genre of contemporary circus is largely considered to have begun in 1995 with &#x27;Le Cri du Caméléon&#x27;, an ensemble performance from the graduating class of the French circus school Le Centre National des Arts du Cirque (CNAC), directed by Joseph Nadj. In contrast to New Circus, Contemporary Circus (as a genre) tends to avoid linear narrative in favour of more suggestive, interdisciplinary approaches to abstract concepts. This includes a strong trend for developing new apparatus and movement languages based on the capacities, experience and interests of individual performers, rather than finding new ways to present traditional repertoire.

===Social Circus===

Beyond the performance aspect of circus, is the Social Circus field, catalysed by Reg Bolton. Social Circus engages communities through circus practice and activity to provide health and well-being benefits.

==Performance==
A traditional circus performance is often led by a ringmaster who has a role similar to a Master of Ceremonies. The ringmaster presents performers, speaks to the audience, and generally keeps the show moving. The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring; large circuses may have multiple rings, like the six-ringed Moscow State Circus. A circus often travels with its own band, whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included brass instruments, drums, glockenspiel, and sometimes the distinctive sound of the calliope. Performers have been traditionally referred to as artistes, although in recent years the term artists has also come into regular use. To some performers from multi-generational circus families, the term artiste is still preferred as it is considered to confer higher status than artist. Conversely, some performers from the circus school training route taken by many of the newer generations prefer the term artist as it is considered to be less pretentious than artiste. The physical and creative skills that circus artist/es perform are known as disciplines, and are often grouped for training purposes into the broad categories of juggling, equilibristics, acrobatics, aerial and clowning. These disciplines can be honed into individual acts, which can be performed independently and marketed to many different prospective circus employers, and also used for devising solo or collaborative work created specifically for a single project. 

===Acts===

Common acts include a variety of acrobatics, gymnastics (including tumbling and trampoline), aerial acts (such as trapeze, aerial silk, corde lisse, Aerial Hoop and aerial straps) contortion, stilt-walking, and a variety of other routines. Juggling is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics that includes acts like plate spinning and the rolling globe come under the category equilibristics, along with more classical balance disciplines such as tightwire, slackline and unicycle. Acts like these are some of the most common and the most traditional. Clowns are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; &quot;clowns getting into the act&quot; is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included Austin Miles, the Fratellini Family, Rusty Russell, Emmett Kelly, Grock, and Bill Irwin. The title clown refers to the role functions and performance skills, not simply to the image of red nose and exaggerated facepaint that was popularised through 20th Century mass media. While many clowns still perform in this styling, there are also many clowns who adopt a more natural look.

Daredevil stunt acts, freak shows, and sideshow acts are also parts of some circus acts, these activities may include human cannonball, chapeaugraphy, fire eating, breathing, and dancing, knife throwing, magic shows, sword swallowing, or strongman. Famous sideshow performers include Zip the Pinhead and The Doll Family. A popular sideshow attraction from the early 19th century was the flea circus, where fleas were attached to props and viewed through a Fresnel lens.

===Animal acts===


A variety of animals have historically been used in acts. While the types of animals used vary from circus to circus, big cats (namely lions, tigers, and leopards), foxes, wolves, polecats, minks, weasels, camels, llamas, elephants, zebras, horses, donkeys, birds (like parrots and doves), sea lions, bears, monkeys, and domestic animals such as cats and dogs are the most common.

The earliest involvement of animals in circus was just the display of exotic creatures in a menagerie. Going as far back as the early eighteenth century, exotic animals were transported to North America for display, and menageries were a popular form of entertainment. The first true animals acts in the circus were equestrian acts. Soon elephants and big cats were displayed as well. Isaac A. Van Amburgh entered a cage with several big cats in 1833, and is generally considered to be the first wild animal trainer in American circus history. Mabel Stark was a famous female tiger-tamer.

====Controversy and laws====

Animal rights groups have documented many cases of animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse has always been the method for training circus animals. It is also alleged that the animals are kept in cages that are too small and are given very little opportunity to walk around outside of their enclosure, thereby violating their right to freedom.

====United States====
According to PETA, although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit any sort of punishment that puts the animals in discomfort, trainers will still go against this law and use such things as electric rods and bullhooks. According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson &amp; Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to &quot;beat the elephants with a bullhook as hard as they can and sink the sharp metal hook into the elephant&#x27;s flesh and twist it until they scream in pain&quot;.

On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands, Wageningen University conducted an investigation into the welfare of circus animals in 2008. The following issues, among others, were found:

* 71% of the observed animals had medical problems.
* 33% of tigers and lions did not have access to an outdoor enclosure.
* Lions spend on average 98% of their time indoors.
* An average enclosure for tigers is only 5 m2.
* Elephants are shackled in chains for 17 hours a day on average.
* Elephants spend on average 10 hours a day showing stereotypic behaviour.
* Tigers are terrified of fire but are still forced to jump through fire rings.
* Since 1990 there have been over 123 cases of lion attacks at circuses.
* Animals are trained through discipline.

Based on these findings, the researchers called for more stringent regulation regarding the welfare of circus animals. In 2012, the Dutch government announced a ban on the use of wild circus animals.

In testimony in U.S. District Court in 2009, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind the ears, under the chin and on their legs with metal tipped prods, called bullhooks. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers. Feld also acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant, which Feld also stated was appropriate practice. Feld denied that any of these practices harm elephants. In its January 2010 verdict on the case, brought against Feld Entertainment International by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals et al., the Court ruled that evidence against the circus company was &quot;not credible with regard to the allegations&quot;. In lieu of a USDA hearing, Feld Entertainment Inc. (parent of Ringling Bros.) agreed to pay an unprecedented $270,000 fine for violations of the Animal Welfare Act that allegedly occurred between June 2007 and August 2011.

A 14-year litigation against the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus came to an end in 2014 when The Humane Society of the United States and a number of other animal rights groups paid a $16 million settlement to Feld Entertainment; however, the circus closed in May 2017 after a 146-year run when it experienced a steep decline in ticket sales a year after it discontinued its elephant act and sent its pachyderms to a reserve.

On 1 February 1992 at the Great American Circus in Palm Bay, Florida, an elephant named Janet (1965 – 1 February 1992) went out of control while giving a ride to a mother, her two children, and three other children. The elephant then stampeded through the circus grounds outside before being shot to death by police. Also, during a Circus International performance in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 20 August 1994, an elephant called Tyke (1974 – 20 August 1994) killed her trainer, Allen Campbell, and severely mauled her groomer, Dallas Beckwith, in front of hundreds of spectators. Tyke then bolted from the arena and ran through the streets of Kakaako for more than thirty minutes. Police fired 86 shots at Tyke, who eventually collapsed from the wounds and died.

In December 2018, New Jersey became the first state in the U.S. to ban circuses, carnivals and fairs from featuring elephants, tigers, and other exotic animals.

====England====
In 1998 in the United Kingdom, a parliamentary working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions and treatment of animals in UK circuses. All members of this group agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, &quot;It&#x27;s undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate—the cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe the time has come for that practice to end.&quot; The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University &quot;found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation.&quot;; however, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of &quot;scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom.&quot; According to that group&#x27;s report, published in October 2007, &quot;there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments.&quot;

A ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in England was due to be passed in 2015, but Conservative MP Christopher Chope repeatedly blocked the bill under the reasoning that &quot;The EU Membership Costs and Benefits bill should have been called by the clerk before the circuses bill, so I raised a point of order&quot;. He explained that the circus bill was &quot;at the bottom of the list&quot; for discussion. The Animal Defenders International non-profit group dubbed this &quot;a huge embarrassment for Britain that 30 other nations have taken action before us on this simple and popular measure&quot;. On 1 May 2019 Environmental Secretary Michael Gove announced a new Bill to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses. The Wild Animals in Circuses Act 2019 came into effect on 20 January 2020.

====Wales====

A bill to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Wales was introduced in June 2019, and subsequently passed by the Welsh Parliament on 15 July 2020. Over 6,500 responses were made by the people of Wales, to the public consultation on the draft Bill, 97% of which supported the ban.

====Scotland====
The use of wild animals in travelling circuses has been banned in Scotland. The Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses (Scotland) Act 2018 came into force on 28 May 2018.

====Worldwide====

There are nationwide bans on using some if not all animals in circuses in Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have locally restricted or banned the use of animals in entertainment. In response to a growing popular concern about the use of animals in entertainment, animal-free circuses are becoming more common around the world. In 2009, Bolivia passed legislation banning the use of any animals, wild or domestic, in circuses. The law states that circuses &quot;constitute an act of cruelty.&quot; Circus operators had one year from the bill&#x27;s passage on 1 July 2009 to comply. In 2018 in Germany, an accident with an elephant during a circus performance prompted calls to ban animal performances in circuses. PETA called the German politicians to outlaw the keeping of animals for circuses.

A survey confirmed that on average, wild animals spend around 99 to 91 percent of their time in cages, wagons, or enclosure due to transportation. This causes a huge amount of distress to animals and leads to excessive amounts of drooling.

City ordinances banning performances by wild animals have been enacted in San Francisco (2015), Los Angeles (2017), and New York City (2017).

Greece became the first European country to ban any animal from performing in any circus in its territory in February 2012, following a campaign by Animal Defenders International and the Greek Animal Welfare Fund (GAWF).

On 6 June 2015, the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe adopted a position paper in which it recommends the prohibition of the use of wild animals in travelling circuses.

Despite the contemporary circus&#x27; shift toward more theatrical techniques and its emphasis on human rather than animal performance, traditional circus companies still exist alongside the new movement. Numerous circuses continue to maintain animal performers, including UniverSoul Circus and the Big Apple Circus from the United States, Circus Krone from Munich, Circus Royale and Lennon Bros Circus from Australia, Vazquez Hermanos Circus, Circo Atayde Hermanos, and Hermanos Mayaror Circus from Mexico, and Moira Orfei Circus from Italy, to name just a few.

==Buildings==


In some towns, there are circus buildings where regular performances are held. The best known are:
* Blackpool Tower Circus
* Budapest Circus
* Circus Krone Building in Munich
* Cirque d&#x27;hiver, Paris
* Cirque Jules Verne in Amiens
* Hippodrome Circus, Great Yarmouth
* La Tohu in Montreal
* Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard in Moscow
* Ciniselli Circus in Saint Petersburg
* Shanghai Circus World in Shanghai
* Turkmen State Circus in Ashgabat
* Riga Circus in Riga
* Belarus State Circus in Minsk
* &quot;Globus&quot; Circus in Bucharest

In other countries, purpose-built circus buildings still exist which are no longer used as circuses, or are used for circus only occasionally among a wider programme of events; for example, the Cirkusbygningen (The Circus Building) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden, or Carré Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==International awards==
The International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo has been held in Monaco since 1974 and was the first of many international awards for circus performers.

==In art, music, films, plays, books, and video games==


Erich Kästner&#x27;s children&#x27;s books &#x27; 1963 (&quot;The Little Man&quot;) and &#x27; 1967 (&quot;The Little Man and the Little Miss&quot;) are largely set in a circus where the orphaned young protagonist grows up as a ward of the show&#x27;s magician.

The atmosphere of the circus has served as a dramatic setting for many musicians. The most famous circus theme song is called &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot;, and was composed in 1904 by Julius Fučík. Other circus music includes &quot;El Caballero&quot;, &quot;Quality Plus&quot;, &quot;Sunnyland Waltzes&quot;, &quot;The Storming of El Caney&quot;, &quot;Pahjamah&quot;, &quot;Bull Trombone&quot;, &quot;Big Time Boogie&quot;, &quot;Royal Bridesmaid March&quot;, &quot;The Baby Elephant Walk&quot;, &quot;Liberty Bell March&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Radetsky March&quot;, and &quot;Pageant of Progress&quot;. A poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal, one of the most popular circuses of Victorian England, inspired John Lennon to write Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! on The Beatles&#x27; album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The song title refers to William Kite, a well-known circus performer in the 19th century. Producer George Martin and EMI engineers created the song&#x27;s fairground atmosphere by assembling a sound collage of collected recordings of calliopes and fairground organs, which they cut into strips of various lengths, threw into a box, and then mixed up and edited together randomly, creating a long loop which was mixed into the final production. Another traditional circus song is the John Philip Sousa march &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, which is played only to alert circus performers of an emergency.

Plays set in a circus include the 1896 musical &quot;The Circus Girl&quot; by Lionel Monckton, &quot;Polly of the Circus&quot; written in 1907 by Margaret Mayo, &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; written by Russian Leonid Andreyev 1915 and later adapted into one of the first circus films, &quot;Katharina Knie&quot; written in 1928 by Carl Zuckmayer and adapted for the English stage in 1932 as &quot;Caravan&quot; by playwright Cecily Hamilton, the revue &quot;Big Top&quot; written by Herbert Farjeon in 1942, &quot;Top of the Ladder&quot; written by Tyrone Guthrie in 1950, &quot;Stop the World, I Want to Get Off&quot; written by Anthony Newley in 1961, and &quot;Barnum&quot; with music by Cy Coleman and lyrics and book by Mark Bramble, &quot;Roustabout: The Great Circus Train Wreck&quot; written by Jay Torrence in 2006.

Following World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; was the first film released by MGM; in 1925 &quot;Sally of the Sawdust&quot; (remade 1930), &quot;Variety&quot;, and &quot;Vaudeville&quot; were produced, followed by &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Circus&quot; in 1926 and &quot;The Circus&quot; starring Charlie Chaplin, &quot;Circus Rookies&quot;, &quot;4 Devils&quot;; and &quot;Laugh Clown Laugh&quot; in 1928. German film &quot;Salto Mortale&quot; about trapeze artists was released in 1931 and remade in the United States and released as &quot;Trapeze&quot; starring Burt Lancaster in 1956; in 1932 &quot;Freaks&quot; was released; &quot;Charlie Chan at the Circus&quot;, &quot;Circus&quot; (USSR) and &quot;The Three Maxiums&quot; were released in 1936 and &quot;At the Circus&quot; starring the Marx Brothers and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot; in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included &quot;The Great Profile&quot; starring John Barrymore (1940), the animated Disney film &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), &quot;Road Show&quot; (1941), &quot;The Wagons Roll at Night&quot; (1941) and &quot;Captive Wild Woman&quot; (1943).

&quot;Tromba&quot;, a film about a tiger trainer, was released in 1948. In 1952 Cecil B. de Mille&#x27;s Oscar-winning film &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; was first shown. Released in 1953 were &quot;Man on a Tightrope&quot; and Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Gycklarnas afton&quot; (released as &quot;Sawdust and Tinsel&quot; in the United States); these were followed by &quot;Life Is a Circus&quot;; &quot;Ring of Fear&quot;; &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot; (1954), &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; and &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), an Oscar-winning film by Federico Fellini about a girl who is sold to a circus strongman. Fellini made a second film set in the circus called &quot;The Clowns&quot; in 1970. Films about the circus made since 1959 include Disney&#x27;s &quot;Toby Tyler&quot; (1960), the B-movie &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; (also in 1960); the musical film &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; (1962); &quot;A Tiger Walks&quot;, a Disney film about a tiger that escapes from the circus; and &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964), starring John Wayne. In Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s first animated film &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear!&quot; (1964), Cindy Bear is held captive in a circus where she is cruelly forced to perform until Yogi and Boo-Boo rescue her. &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; (1970), a Hindi drama film directed by Raj Kapoor which was about a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows. In the anime film &quot;Jungle Emperor Leo&quot; (1997), Leo&#x27;s son Lune is captured and placed in a circus, which burns down when a tiger knocks down a ring of fire while jumping through it. &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, a DreamWorks Animation film about zoosters escape from the evil animal control Capitan DuBois, was released in 2012. &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;, a musical film loosely based on the life of P. T. Barnum, was released in 2017.

The TV series &quot;Circus Humberto&quot;, based on the novel by Eduard Bass, follows the history of the circus family Humberto between 1826 and 1924. The setting of the HBO television series &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2005, is also largely set in a travelling circus. The circus has also inspired many writers. Numerous books, both non-fiction and fiction, have been published about circus life. Notable examples of circus-based fiction include &quot;Circus Humberto&quot; by Eduard Bass, &quot;Cirque du Freak&quot; by Darren Shan, and &quot;Spangle&quot; by Gary Jennings. The novel &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; by Sara Gruen tells the fictional tale of a circus veterinarian and was made into a movie with the same title, starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. Science fiction writer Barry B. Longyear wrote a trilogy about a circus of the future: City of Baraboo; Elephant Song; and Circus World.

Circus is the central theme in comic books of Super Commando Dhruva, an Indian comic book superhero. According to this series, Dhruva was born and brought up in a fictional Indian circus called Jupiter Circus. When a rival circus burnt down Jupiter Circus, killing everyone in it, including Dhruva&#x27;s parents, Dhruva vowed to become a crime fighter. A circus-based television series called &quot;Circus&quot; was also telecast in India in 1989 on DD National, starring Shahrukh Khan as the lead actor.

In the third case of the video game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice for All, the main character, Phoenix Wright, investigates a murder at a circus, working as the defence attorney of an egotistical magician.

<doc id="157004" wikidata="Q1204997" url="?curid=157004" title="Business logic">
<text>In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

==Details and example==
Business logic:
* Prescribes how business objects interact with one another
* Enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated

Business rules:
* Model real-life business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)

Business logic comprises:
* Workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another.

Business logic should be distinguished from business rules. Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.

For example, an e-commerce website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information. The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:
* The sequence of events that happens during checkout, for example a multi-page form which first asks for the shipping address, then for the billing address, next page will contain the payment method, and last page will show congratulations.

There will also be business rules of the website:
* Adding an item more than once from the item description page increments the quantity for that item.
* Specific formats that the visitor&#x27;s address, email address, and credit card information must follow.
* A specific communication protocol for talking to the credit card network

The web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:
* Peripheral content not related to the core business data, such as the HTML that defines the colors, appearance, background image, and navigational structure of the site
* Generic error-handling code (e.g., which displays the HTTP Error Code 500 page)
* Initialization code that runs when the web server starts up the site, which sets up the system
* Monitoring infrastructure to make sure all the parts of the site are working properly (e.g., the billing system is available)
* Generic code for making network connections, transmitting objects to the database, parsing user input via HTTP POST events, etc.

==Business logic and tiers/layers==

Business logic could be anywhere in a program. For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.

Business logic often changes. For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country. Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or loosely coupled. This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code. Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.

A multitier architecture formalizes this decoupling by creating a business logic layer which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the data access layer or service layer. Each layer &quot;knows&quot; only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers—just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a model–view–controller paradigm, the controller and view layers might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model. In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).

Alternative paradigms are possible. For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the database model).

Some tiered schemes use either a distinct application layer or a service layer, or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.

==Tools and techniques==
Business logic can be extracted from procedural code using a business rule management system (BRMS).

The business rules approach of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code. User interface management systems are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code. The magic pushbutton is considered an &quot;anti-pattern&quot;: a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.

A domain model is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.

<doc id="157009" wikidata="Q285783" url="?curid=157009" title="Intersection (road)">
<text>An intersection or an at-grade junction is a junction where two or more roads converge, diverge, meet or cross at the same height, as opposed to an interchange, which uses bridges or tunnels to separate different roads. Major intersections are often delineated by gores and may be classified by road segments, traffic controls and lane design.

This article primarily reflects practice in jurisdictions where vehicles are driven on the right. If not otherwise specified, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; can be reversed to reflect jurisdictions where vehicles are driven on the left.

== Types ==
=== Road segments ===
One way to classify intersections is by the number of road segments (arms) that are involved.
* A three-way intersection is a junction between three road segments (arms): a T junction when two arms form one road, or a Y junction, the latter also known as a fork if approached from the stem of the Y.

* A four-way intersection, or crossroads, usually involves a crossing over of two streets or roads. In areas where there are blocks and in some other cases, the crossing streets or roads are perpendicular to each other. However, two roads may cross at a different angle. In a few cases, the junction of two road segments may be offset from each when reaching an intersection, even though both ends may be considered the same street.
* Six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction; for example, a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection.
* Five, seven or more approaches to a single intersection, such as at Seven Dials, London, are not common.

=== Traffic controls ===
Another way of classifying intersections is by traffic control technology:

* Uncontrolled intersections, without signs or signals (or sometimes with a warning sign). Priority (right-of-way) rules may vary by country: on a 4-way intersection traffic from the right often has priority; on a 3-way intersection either traffic from the right has priority again, or traffic on the continuing road. For traffic coming from the same or opposite direction, that which goes straight has priority over that which turns off.
* Yield-controlled intersections may or may not have specific &quot;YIELD&quot; signs (known as &quot;GIVE WAY&quot; signs in some countries).
* Stop-controlled intersections have one or more &quot;STOP&quot; signs. Two-way stops are common, while some countries also employ four-way stops.
* Signal-controlled intersections depend on Traffic light, usually electric, which indicate which traffic is allowed to proceed at any particular time.

=== Lane design ===
* A traffic circle is a type of intersection at which traffic streams are directed around a circle. Types of traffic circles include roundabouts, &quot;mini-roundabouts&quot;, &quot;rotaries&quot;, &quot;STOP&quot;-controlled circles, and signal-controlled circles. Some people consider roundabouts to be a distinct type of intersection from traffic circles (with the distinction based on certain differences in size and engineering).
* A box junction can be added to an intersection, generally prohibiting entry to the intersection unless the exit is clear.
* Some (unconventional or alternative) intersections employ indirect left turns to increase capacity and reduce delays. The Michigan left combines a right turn and a U-turn. Jughandle lefts diverge to the right, then curve to the left, converting a left turn to a crossing maneuver, similar to throughabouts. These techniques are generally used in conjunction with signal-controlled intersections, although they may also be used at stop-controlled intersections.
* Other designs include advanced stop lines, parallel-flow and continuous-flow intersections, hook turns, quadrants, seagull intersections, slip lanes, staggered junctions (junctions consisting of two opposing T-junctions where one road intersects two sideroads located diagonally opposite each other; in American English referred to as doglegs), superstreets, Texas Ts, Texas U-turns and turnarounds.
* A roundabout and its variants like turbo roundabouts, bowties and distributing circles like traffic circles and right-in/right-out (RIRO) intersections.

== Turns ==
At intersections, turns are usually allowed, but are often regulated to avoid interference with other traffic. Certain turns may be not allowed or may be limited by regulatory signs or signals, particularly those that cross oncoming traffic. Alternative designs often attempt to reduce or eliminate such potential conflicts.

=== Turn lanes ===
At intersections with large proportions of turning traffic, turn lanes (also known as turn bays) may be provided. For example, in the intersection shown in the diagram, left turn lanes are present in the right-left street.

Turn lanes allow vehicles, to cross oncoming traffic (i.e., a left turn in right-side driving countries, or a right turn in left-side driving countries), or to exit a road without crossing traffic (i.e., a right turn in right-side driving countries, or a left turn in left-side driving countries). Absence of a turn lane does not normally indicate a prohibition of turns in that direction. Instead, traffic control signs are used to prohibit specific turns.

Turn lanes can increase the capacity of an intersection or improve safety. Turn lanes can have a dramatic effect on the safety of a junction. In rural areas, crash frequency can be reduced by up to 48% if left turn lanes are provided on both main-road approaches at stop-controlled intersections. At signalized intersections, crashes can be reduced by 33%. Results are slightly lower in urban areas.

Turn lanes are marked with an arrow bending into the direction of the turn which is to be made from that lane. Multi-headed arrows indicate that vehicle drivers may travel in any one of the directions pointed to by an arrow.

=== Turn signals ===

Traffic signals facing vehicles in turn lanes often have arrow-shaped indications. North America uses various indication patterns. Green arrows indicate protected turn phases, when vehicles may turn unhindered by oncoming traffic. Red arrows may be displayed to prohibit turns in that direction. Red arrows may be displayed along with a circular green indication to show that turns in the direction of the arrow are prohibited, but other movements are allowed. In some jurisdictions, a red arrow prohibits a turn on red. In Europe, if different lanes have differing phases, red, yellow and green traffic lights corresponding to each lane have blacked-out areas in the middle in the shape of arrows indicating the direction(s) drivers in that lane may travel in. This makes it easier for drivers to be aware which traffic light they need to pay attention to. A green arrow may also be provided; when it is on, drivers heading in the direction of the arrow may proceed, but must yield to all other vehicles. This is similar to the right turn on red in the US.

Disadvantages to turn lanes include increased pavement area, with associated increases in construction and maintenance costs, as well as increased amounts of stormwater runoff. They also increase the distance over which pedestrians crossing the street are exposed to vehicle traffic. If a turn lane has a separate signal phase, it often increases the delay experienced by oncoming through traffic. Without a separate phase, left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the turn lane.

=== Lane management ===
Alternative intersection configurations, formerly called unconventional intersections, can manage turning traffic to increase safety and intersection throughput. These include the Michigan left/Superstreet (RCUT/MUT) and continuous flow intersection (CFI/DLT), to improve traffic flow, and also interchange types like Diverging diamond interchange (DDI/DCD) design as part of the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s Every Day Counts initiative which started in 2012.

== Vulnerable road users ==
Vulnerable road users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and individuals using motorized scooters and similar devices. Compared to people who are in motor vehicles (like cars and trucks), they are much more likely to suffer catastrophic or fatal injuries at an intersection.

=== Pedestrians ===

Intersections generally must manage pedestrian as well as vehicle traffic. Pedestrian aids include crosswalks, pedestrian-directed traffic signals (&quot;walk light&quot;) and over/underpasses. Traffic signals can be time consuming to navigate, especially if programmed to prioritise vehicle flow over pedestrians, while over and underpasses which rely on stairs are inaccessible to those who can not climb them. Walk lights may be accompanied by audio signals to aid the visually impaired. Medians can offer pedestrian islands, allowing pedestrians to divide their crossings into a separate segment for each traffic direction, possibly with a separate signal for each.
Some intersections display red lights in all directions for a period of time. Known as a pedestrian scramble, this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction, including diagonally. All green for non motorists is known from the crossing at Shibuya Station, Tokyo.

In 2020, NHTSA reported that more than 50% of pedestrian deaths in the United States (3,262 total) were attributed to failure to yield the right of way-- which typically occurs at intersections. 

=== Cyclists and motorcyclists ===
Poor visibility at junctions can lead to drivers colliding with cyclists and motorcyclists. Some junctions use advanced stop lines which allow cyclists to filter to the front of a traffic queue which makes them more visible to drivers.

== Safety ==
A European study found that in Germany and Denmark, the most important crash scenario involving vulnerable road users was:
* motor vehicle turning right/left while cyclist going straight; 
* motor vehicle turning right/left while pedestrian crossing the intersection approach.

These findings are supported by data elsewhere. According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, roughly half of all U.S. car crashes occurred at intersections or were intersection related in 2019.

== At grade railways ==

In the case of railways or rail tracks the term at grade applies to a rail line that is not on an embankment nor in an open cut. As such, it crosses streets and roads without going under or over them. This requires level crossings. At-grade railways may run along the median of a highway. The opposite is grade-separated. There may be overpasses or underpasses.

<doc id="157020" wikidata="Q1075941" url="?curid=157020" title="La Borinqueña">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the official anthem of Puerto Rico. 

After Puerto Rico became known as &quot;The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot; in 1952, the first elected governor, Luis Muñoz Marín, signed law #2 of July 24, 1952, which made an altered version of the musical composition known as &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; its national anthem. The words that go with the composition were approved by governor Carlos Romero Barceló on July 27, 1977, as per law #123.

==Etymology==
The title refers to the aboriginal Taíno name for the island of Puerto Rico, .

==History==

The music was originally credited to Félix Astol Artés in 1867 as a habanera danza, with romantic lyrics, but there is some evidence that Francisco Ramírez, a native of San Germán, wrote the music in 1860, and named it &quot;La Almojábana&quot;. In 1868, Lola Rodríguez de Tió wrote a poem in support of the Puerto Rican revolution, which was set to the Ramírez/Astol music. In fear of investigation by the Spanish government, Ramírez asked Astol to claim authorship of the music since he was a native of Catalonia and would, therefore, raise no suspicion.

After the cession of the island to the United States, the popular revolutionary lyrics of Lola Rodríguez de Tió were deemed too subversive for official adoption; therefore, a non-confrontational set of lyrics were written in 1903 by Asturias-born Manuel Fernández Juncos. The tune was officially adopted as Puerto Rico&#x27;s national anthem in 1952 by governor Luis Muñoz Marín, and the words were adopted in 1977 by governor Carlos Romero Barceló.

The version of &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; that is most commonly performed today is performed as a slow-tempo march, without the original tune&#x27;s initial &quot;paseo&quot;. Per the request of the new government, Ramón Collado rearranged the music in 1952 into a more military-like tune. Luis Miranda, the musical director of Puerto Rico&#x27;s 65th Infantry Regiment Band, adapted the tune to be played as a march in 1922. The 1977 law that officially adopted the words merely stated that &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; be played as a march, with the tempo vaguely described as being in a &quot;martial manner&quot;, but established no official arrangement for the music. An official revision made in 2003 leaves the tune as a march.

In 2012, Dr. Yajaira Sierra Sastre, an aspiring astronaut, collaborated in a variety of projects with the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network and the Cornell Nanoscale Facility, which included writing the smallest &quot;national&quot; anthem ever written, &quot;La Borinqueña Más Pequeña&quot;.

According to Puerto Rico Law # 2 of July 24, 1952, both &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; are played at official events. During international sports competitions such as the Olympics, only &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; is played.

The anthem, with its revolutionary lyrics, was featured in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2021 film adaptation of the stage musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, sung by the Puerto Rican gang, the Sharks, early in the film. It was never used in the stage version nor its 1961 film adaptation prior to this film.

==Lyrics==
===Current lyrics===
The following are the current lyrics, as written by Manuel Fernández Juncos and adopted in 1903.

===Original 1868 revolutionary lyrics===


==== Abridged version ====
A short version of the revolutionary lyrics is sometimes sung, consisting of the first half of the first verse and the second half of the third verse.

<doc id="157024" wikidata="Q6508866" url="?curid=157024" title="Leaf mold">
<text>Leaf mold (spelled leaf mould outside of the United States) is the compost produced by decomposition of shaded deciduous shrub and tree leaves, primarily by fungal breakdown in a slower, cooler manner as opposed to the bacterial degradation of leaves.

==Description==
Leaves shed in autumn tend to have a very low nitrogen content and are often dry. Their main constituents, cellulose and lignin, are two recalcitrant molecules resistant to degradation. Because of this, autumn leaves break down far more slowly than most other compost ingredients which may take a very long time on their own. Specialised biota, such as molds, produce extracellular enzymes which can easily break down those complex plant polymers(cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose) into biologically accessible forms enriching the soil environment.

The importance of this decomposition of the leaves and other shed plant litter is that their degradation and decomposition forms a critical step in the mineralization of organic nutrients and their recycling.

==Time and process==
Fungal decomposition of a heap of leaves in damp temperate climates can take between one and three years to break down into a dark brown fine powdery humic matter. A succession of different fungal species may be involved. A range of micro detritivores are also involved in converting the leaf material into a fine-grained humus, including many isopods, millipedes, earthworms, etc.

==Uses==
In the natural environment, the decomposition of leaves provides a moist growing medium for young plants and protects the ground from drying out during periods of low rainfall. It is a significant component of soil organic matter, particularly in temperate deciduous woodland. The slow rate of decomposition gradually releases plant nutrients bound up in the leaves back into the environment to be re-used by plants. Autumn leaves are often collected in gardens and farms into pits or containers for the resultant leaf mold to be used later.

Oxygen and moisture are essential for leaf decomposition. Leaf mold is not high in nutrient content but is an excellent humic soil conditioner because its structure and moisture retention provide a good growing medium for seedling roots.

Leaves collected from roads and pavements may be contaminated by pollutants which can become more concentrated as the leaves decompose into a smaller volume

<doc id="157027" wikidata="Q4388272" url="?curid=157027" title="Three-way junction">
<text>A three-way junction (or three-way intersection) is a type of road intersection with three arms. A Y junction (or Y intersection) generally has three arms of equal size coming at an acute or obtuse angle to each other; while a T junction (or T intersection) also has three arms, but one of the arms is generally a smaller road joining a larger road at right angle.

==Right-of-way==
Some three-way junctions are controlled by traffic lights, while others rely upon drivers to obey right-of-way rules, which vary from place to place:&lt;br&gt;
*In some jurisdictions, chiefly in European countries except the U.K. and Ireland, a driver is always obliged to yield right-of-way for every vehicle oncoming from the right at a junction without traffic signals and priority signs (including T junctions).
*In other jurisdictions (mainly in the U.K., USA, Australia and Taiwan), a driver turning in a three-way junction must yield for every vehicle approaching the junction (on the way straight ahead) and, if the driver turns right in left-hand traffic/left in right-hand traffic, for every vehicle turning without crossing the oncoming traffic&#x27;s side of the road (left in left-hand traffic/right in right-hand traffic) &quot;or&quot; (if two vehicles both turn right in left-hand traffic) for the right-turning vehicle approaching from the left/(if two vehicles both turn left in right-hand traffic) the left-turning vehicle approaching from the right (and a road going straight ahead at a three-way junction is normally marked as a priority road).

In the United States and some other countries, it is common to have stop signs facing each direction, although according to game-theoretical analysis, drivers have strong incentives to run the stop sign, while randomly removing one stop sign may lead to significant efficiency gains.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, going straight on red when approaching a T junction on the main road with the intersecting road on the left was permitted until the Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China took effect on 1 May 2004.

==Turns==
When one road at a 3-way junction has a higher traffic volume than the other (and particularly when the roads are perpendicular to each other), turns are characterized as &quot;right-in&quot;, &quot;right-out&quot;, &quot;left-in&quot; and &quot;left-out&quot;. A turn &quot;in&quot; represents a turn from the major road into the minor road. A turn &quot;out&quot; represents a turn out of the minor road onto the major road. A 3-way junction allowing all four of these turns is characterized as &quot;full-movement&quot;. These terms also apply to turns between roads and driveways.

==Variations==
An experiment was done in Illinois, United States to allow going straight on red (like a right turn on red) when approaching a T junction on the main road, with the intersecting road on the left. It was a failure. However, at some T junctions where the main road includes at least two lanes on the side away from the intersecting road, the farthest (rightmost, in areas where traffic drives to the right) lane is given the right of way to proceed straight through the intersection at all times, denoted by a &quot;green arrow&quot; signal if a traffic light is installed at the intersection.

In such cases, often that lane is also specially delimited with pavement markings or other lane separation devices, to keep left-turning traffic on the intersecting road from colliding with traffic proceeding through the intersection on the main road. There are now safer variations of this, called continuous green-T (or seagull) intersections, that have a left turn lane off the main road either channelized or otherwise separated from traffic going straight, which allows for a traffic signal on only one side of the road.

==Superstitious beliefs==
In Thailand, three-way junction was called in an old word &quot;Sam Phraeng&quot; (, ). Sam Phraeng is unsuitable area according to the beliefs of Thai people since ancient times on account of it is a passageway of ghosts or demons, therefore, normally no one will build a house or residence in the Sam Phraeng area. This belief also appears in China, Japan, and Korea.

<text>Wolfgang Iser (22 July 1926 – 24 January 2007) was a German literary scholar.

==Biography==
Wolfgang Iser was born in Marienberg, Germany. His parents were Paul and Else (Steinbach) Iser. He studied literature in the universities of Leipzig and Tübingen before receiving his PhD in English at Heidelberg with a dissertation on the world view of Henry Fielding (&quot;Die Weltanschauung Henry Fieldings&quot;, 1950). A year later, Iser was appointed as an instructor at Heidelberg and in 1952 as an assistant lecturer at the University of Glasgow. There, Iser began to explore contemporary philosophy and literature, which deepened his interest in inter-cultural exchange. He subsequently lectured in many other parts of the world, including Asia and Israel. He died in Constance.

He was married to Lore Iser.

==Hermeneutics==
Iser is known for his reader-response criticism in literary theory. This theory began to evolve in 1967, while he was working in the University of Konstanz, which he helped to found in the 1960s. Together with Hans Robert Jauss, he is considered to be the founder of the Constance School of reception theory. In his approach to reader-response theory, Iser describes the process of first reading, the subsequent development of the text into a &#x27;whole&#x27;, and how the dialogue between the reader and text takes place. In his study of Shakespeare&#x27;s histories, in particular &quot;Richard II&quot;, Iser interprets Richard&#x27;s continually changing legal policy as expression of the desire for self-assertion. Here he follows Hans Blumenberg, and attempts to apply his theory of modernity to Shakespeare. In this theory of modernity, modernity is associated with self-assertion, which responds to the destruction of scholastic rationalism in the nominalist revolution (with William of Ockham).

For Iser, meaning is not an object to be found within a text, but is an event of construction that occurs somewhere between the text and the reader. Specifically, a reader comes to the text, which is a fixed world, but meaning is realized through the act of reading and how a reader connects the structures of the text to their own experience. To illustrate this, Iser uses the example of constellations: &quot;The impressions that arise as a result of this process will vary from individual to individual, but only within the limits imposed by the written as opposed to the unwritten text. In the same way, two people gazing at the night sky may both be looking at the same collection of stars, but one will see the image of a plough, and the other will make out a dipper. The &#x27;stars&#x27; in a literary text are fixed; the lines that join them are variable&quot;. A literary work, which for Iser is created when a reader and a text &quot;converge, consists of two &quot;poles&quot;: the artistic (the object, the text created by the author) and the aesthetic (the realization accomplished by the reader). Both of these poles contribute to the two central points of Iser&#x27;s theory: the concept of &quot;implied reader&quot; and narrative &quot;gaps&quot;.

When an author is composing a text, they have a particular reader in mind, which is in part represented in the text. This reader is not identical to a real, flesh-and-blood reader, but is &quot;a textual structure anticipating the presence of a recipient without necessarily defining him…the concept of the implied reader designates a network of response-inviting structures, which impel the reader to grasp the text&quot;. Iser separates the concept of implied reader into two &quot;interrelated aspects: the reader’s role as a textual structure, and the reader’s role as a structured act&quot;.

The textual structure refers to the reader’s point-of-view as found within the text. This standpoint is multifaceted, because the narrator, the characters, the plot, and the fictitious reader all offer sides of it. Further, the reader’s role as a textual structure is defined by the &quot;vantage point by which he joins [these perspectives], and the meeting place they converge&quot;. All, as component parts, operate together to shape the reader’s role as found within the text.

The reader&#x27;s role as a structured act refers to how a reader fulfills the textual structures by causing them to converge within their imagination. In other words, the textual structures are connected and come to life when a reader takes part in the reading process. This does not mean that the &quot;real&quot; reader simply accepts this role, but rather they exist in tension between their own historical reality and experience, and the acceptance of their role as reader. &quot;The concept of the implied reader as an expression of the role offered by the text is in no way an abstraction derived from a real reader, but is rather the conditioning force behind a particular kind of tension produced by the real reader when he accepts the role&quot;. The differences between the real reader, and the role of the fictitious reader, produce a tension that allows for different connections and readings.

For Iser, a literary work is composed of both written and unwritten portions of a text. As a reader begins the reading process, the sentences that make up a work not only inform the reader of the literary movement, but produce certain
expectations within the mind of the reader. However, these expectations are rarely fulfilled, as a text is &quot;full of unexpected twists and turns, and frustrations of expectations…Thus whenever the flow is interrupted and we are led off in unexpected directions, the opportunity is given to us to bring into play our own faculty for establishing connections—for filling in the gaps left by the text itself&quot;. These gaps are the unwritten portion of the text that calls for the reader&#x27;s participation. Different readers will decide to fill in the various gaps in different ways, allowing for inexhaustible realizations of the text within its provided interpretive limits. As the reader reflects on what they have read previously in the text, or if they reread the text, new light is shed on the happenings within the narrative as &quot;certain aspects of the text will assume a significance we did not attach to them on a first reading, while others will recede into the background&quot;.

Thus, the structure of a text brings about expectations, which are interrupted by surprising unfulfillment, producing gaps, which require filling by the reader to create a coherent flow of the text. These gaps then, in turn, cause the reader to reread prior events in the text in light of those gap fillings. However, these gaps cannot be filled arbitrarily, but through interpretive limits given in the text by an author. Iser finds this experience to be the breakdown of the subject-object division, in that &quot;text and reader no longer confront each other as object and subject, but instead the &#x27;division&#x27; takes place within the reader himself&quot;. In the act of reading, a text becomes a living subject within the reader.

<text>An artistamp (a portmanteau of the words &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;stamp&quot;) or artist&#x27;s stamp is a postage stamp-like art form used to depict or commemorate any subject its creator chooses. Artistamps are a form of Cinderella stamps in that they are not valid for postage, but they differ from forgeries or bogus Illegal stamps in that typically the creator has no intent to defraud postal authorities or stamp collectors.

Artistamp creators often include their work on legitimate mail, alongside valid postage stamps, in order to decorate the envelope with their art. In many countries this practice is legal, provided the artistamp is not passed off as or likely to be mistaken for a genuine postage stamp. When so combined (and sometimes, less strictly speaking, even when not so) the artistamp may be considered part of the mail art genre.

Irony, satire, humor, eroticism and subversion of governmental authority are frequent characteristics of artistamps. Artists may leverage the expectation of official endorsement that necessarily inheres in governmentally-issued postage for the purpose of shocking or subverting viewers&#x27; expectations, with such actions typically representing a specific political and artistic motive. Other practitioners are content to depict more homey subjects like kittens and family members. Some artists use the form to create fantasy stamps for their own postal administrations or countries – in many cases thereby developing or complementing an imaginary governmental system.

==History==

The first artist to produce an &quot;artist’s stamp&quot; is open to interpretation. It did not take many years after the introduction of postage stamps before UK commercial photographers saw a market in personalised stamp photographs incorporating an individual&#x27;s portrait within a stamp-like printed border, printed in perforated sheets with gummed backs. Fine artists were certainly commissioned to create poster stamps (advertising posters in collectible stamp form) from the late 1800s, but none appear to have worked with the format outside the commercial or advertising context.

In 1919, Dadaist Raoul Hausmann affixed a self-portrait postage stamp to a postcard, but given that Dada was determinedly anti-art (at least in theory), calling this an &quot;artist’s stamp&quot; seems almost counterintuitive.

German artist Karl Schwesig, while a political prisoner during World War II, drew a series of pseudo-stamps on the blank, perforated margins of postage stamp sheets, using coloured inks. Jas Felter asserts that this 1941 series, which illustrated life in a concentration camp, is typically accepted as the first true set of artist&#x27;s stamps.

American Robert Watts, a member of the Fluxus group, became the first artist to create a full sheet of [faux] postage stamps within a fine art context when he produced a perforated block of 15 stamps combining popular and erotic imagery in 1961.

Canadian multimedia artist and philatelist T Michael Bidner, who made his life&#x27;s work the cataloguing of all then-known artist&#x27;s stamps, coined the word &quot;artistamp&quot; in 1982. It quickly became the term of choice amongst mail artists.

Artist Clifford Harper published a series of designs for anarchist postage stamps in 1988, featuring portraits of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Emma Goldman, Oscar Wilde, Emiliano Zapata and Herbert Read.

==Recognition of the art form==

Despite the exhibitions, history, number of artists and global sweep of the artistamp movement, the medium had long been ignored by major institutions and derided by the arts establishment: before his death in 1989, Bidner attempted to donate his definitive collection to several major Canadian institutions but was turned down by every one. The collection eventually went to Artpool, an art research centre in Budapest, Hungary who organized World Art Post, the first big scale artistamp exhibition in Central Europe in 1982, and in 1987 the first arstistamp exhibition to be held in a renowned museum. Upon his death, Bidner&#x27;s friend Rosemary Gahlinger-Beaune, undertook Bidner&#x27;s vision and began to catalogue, using philatelic standards, artistamps from over 200 artists from 29 countries, documenting more than 10,000 artistamp images. In 1999, Gahlinger-Beaune and Bianchini released a CD entitled &quot;The World of Artistamps&quot;, the most comprehensive database of artistamps of the time.

Multimedia artist James Warren &quot;Jas&quot; Felter curated an exhibition called &quot;Artists&#x27; Stamps and Stamp Images&quot; at Simon Fraser Gallery, Simon Fraser University, Canada, in 1974: the first exhibition to acknowledge the stamp as an artistic medium. This collection, which toured Europe and America for the next ten years, led to an explosion in the number of artists using stamps as an artistic format.

Photographer and multimedia artist Ginny Lloyd started her Gina Lotta Post series in 1979 and by 1982 had produced some of the first computer-generated imagery used in artists stamps. On a visit to Artpool in 1982, she collaborated with György Galántai on artistamp issues. In 1984, Lloyd co-organized an Art in Space event in San Francisco at which a rocket containing artistamps on a microchip was launched. In 1986, the artist received a Visual Studies Workshop artist-in-residence funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States. Her project for the residency culminated with &quot;Gina Lotta Post,&quot; a series of artistamps bound into a book and includes a set of postcards. A second book &quot;Make Your Own Stamps Sheet,&quot; is a Complete and Return project that originated from the same residency, becoming available in 2011.

In 1989, Felter curated the first of three International Biannual Exhibitions of Artistamps at Davidson Galleries in Seattle.

In 1994, an exhibition sponsored by the Swiss Posts was held in the PTT-Museum in Berne, resulting in the publication of a book and four sheets of artists&#x27; stamps (one of the few printed at the costs of an official postal service!). More than 60 artists participated. The word &quot;Artistamps&quot; does not appear in the book, but on one of the stamps, by E.F. Higgins.

In 1995, Patricia Tavenner curated &quot;The First California Artistamp Exhibit&quot; at University of California, Berkeley - San Francisco Extension. The exhibit presented works of about 170 artists from around the world.

The &quot;First Moscow International Artistamp Exhibition&quot; was held in Moscow in December 1998, as part of International Art Fair XX. The event was curated by Natalie Lamanova, Alexander Kholopv and Jas Felter. This event gave rise to the &quot;Moscow Artistamp Collection&quot; which presently includes more than 700 works of 83 artists from 19 countries.

From November 12, 1999, to January 19, 2000, the Art Institute of Boston hosted the &quot;Stamp Art and Artists Stamps&quot; exhibition. The show included artistamp sheets from Natalia Lamanova, Alexander Kholopov of Russia, Vittore Baroni, Clemente Padin, Jose Carlos Soto, Pere Sousa and Donald Evans. PBS documented this exhibit.

In December 2000, an exhibit featuring artistamps from around the world was displayed at the E. Max von Isser Gallery of Art at Elgin Community College, Elgin, Illinois.

The exhibition &quot;Motherland/Fatherland&quot; was held at The International Museum Exhibition Centre in Moscow from July 11 to 21, 2002.

Fricker, Ryosuke Cohen, Ginny Lloyd, and Al Brandtner. &quot;The new function artistamp has in this exhibition is to convey the explosively changing worldview at the turn of the millennium,&quot; said Galántai in an interview. The show ran from March 23 to June 24, 2007.

In July 2007, the SomArts Cultural Center gallery presented the &quot;Multiplicity/Multiplicidad: Mailart &amp; Artistamp Show&quot;, in collaboration with Vortice Argentina, Buenos Aires.

Artistamps have been recognized in mainstream stamp publications, such as &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot;. In 2004, Linn&#x27;s published an article covering the release of Twine Workshop&#x27;s &quot;The Blighted State of America&quot; artistamp, a piece directly criticizing then U.S. president George W. Bush.

John Held Jr.&#x27;s book, &quot;Small Scale Subversion: Mail Art &amp; Artistamps,&quot; was published on April 11, 2015.

From 2019-2024, mail artist Adam Roussopoulos has compiled contemporary artistampers from all over the world in his publication - The Artistamp Review. The review included some of the prominent works by artists like John Held Jr., The Sticker Dude (Joel Cohen), Vittore Baroni, Ruggero Maggi, the late E.F. Higgins III and H.R. Fricker to name a few. The project expanded to 40 issues.

==Controversy==
In 2005, United States Secret Service agents attended the opening of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; exhibition at Columbia College Chicago&#x27;s Glass Curtain Gallery. According to Carol Ann Brown, director of the gallery, the agents were most interested in the work entitled &quot;Patriot Act&quot; by Chicago-based artist Al Brandtner. The work depicts a revolver pointed at the head of then President George W. Bush. Secret Service spokesman Tom Mazur stated, &quot;We need to ensure ... that this is nothing more than artwork with a political statement.&quot;

When the exhibit opened at a gallery on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus on September 15, 2005, university chancellor Bruce Shepard directed the removal of Brandtner&#x27;s work from the gallery. In a letter to faculty and staff, Shepard said &quot;in a society all too violence prone, using these or other venues to appear to advocate or suggest assassination is not something the UW-Green Bay may do.&quot;

==The artistamp creation process==


Artistamps are created as one-off works of art, in limited editions, or as mass-produced product. Artistamps have been produced as multiples of one design per sheet; a multitude of designs per page; as miniature sheets with a decorative or inclusive border; in booklets; or any combination/size/shape the artist chooses.

Techniques for the creation of artistamps may include perforating the paper to resemble a traditional perforated stamp, as well as applying gum to the reverse side of the paper. Self-adhesive paper is also used. The image represented on the stamp may be hand-drawn or painted, lithographed or offset-printed, photographed, photocopied, etched, engraved, silk-screened, rubber stamped, or produced on a digital inkjet or laser printer. While the method of production is entirely the choice of the artist, creators who exclusively or primarily use rubber stamps are occasionally held in contempt by members of the artistamp community, some of whom refer to such producers as &quot;bunny-stampers.&quot;

The personal computer, personal printer and color photocopier have served to democratize the means of production of artistamps. It is no coincidence that the early 1980s explosion in artistamp creation paralleled the development and widespread use of color photocopiers, and that a similar surge followed the ubiquity of personal computers and inexpensive color printers. Still, the lack of workable, widely available, cheap and accessible perforators have limited the number of artists who can create convincing simulacra of traditional perforated stamps.

Makers of artistamps sometimes apply cancellations to the stamps when affixing them to covers; first day of issue covers for artistamps also exist.

The rise of the Internet has seen the development of the concept of the so-called cyberstamp, a digital-only stamp-like image designed primarily to be viewed online and often sent with e-mail. Cyberstamps also allow the use of animated imagery. Whether a digital image, however, can be considered a &quot;stamp&quot; at all is a matter of dispute.

Artists working in the stamp art medium often employ fixed-line perforators as part of the creation process. Most functional and sought-after of these machines are cast-iron, pedal-operated devices manufactured beginning in the 1880s by bindery equipment makers like F.P Rosback Co. and Latham Machinery Co. Rosback also produced table-top perforators, but surviving models are exceedingly rare. Other methods for perforating paper to resemble stamp sheets have generally proven unsatisfactory. Such alternative methods used include using sewing machines, sewing pounces, leather punches, modified veterinary needles, and speciality scissors. Some owners of pedal-operated or motorized perforators sell pre-perforated paper and offer perforating services for a fee.

In 2018, postage stamp designer and mail art aficionado Niko Courtelis launched The Portland Stamp Company with his partners in Plazm. Artists were enabled to purchase blank, perforated, lick-and-stick stamps or to have their artwork printed on custom stamps at larger scale. Writing in Print magazine, design critic Steven Heller described The Portland Stamp Company&#x27;s work as making stamps &quot;the old-fashioned way - with perfs and glued backs.&quot;

In 2005 and 2006, a machinist operating under the name &quot;Dr. Arcane&quot; (Adrian West) manufactured and sold about 20 &quot;Whizbang&quot; perforators. These table-top devices worked well, but were reportedly fragile. In 2020, ten updated versions of the Whizbang perforator were offered by Dr. Arcane for sale on the International Union of Mail-Artists (IUOMA) forum. The new perforator has a solid metal frame that replaced the wooden frame designs of the 2005 and 2006 versions.
In 2004, the International Brotherhood of Perforator Workers (IBPW), an organization based in Washington, D.C., was established to represent the interests of artists owning and/or operating perforators in the creation of stamp art.

<text>Go proverbs are traditional proverbs relating to the game of Go, generally used to help one find good moves in various situations during a game. They are generalizations and thus a particular proverb will have specific situations where it is not applicable. Knowing when a proverb is inapplicable is part of the process of getting stronger as a Go player. Indeed, several proverbs contradict each other—however they agree in as much as they are advising the player to pay attention to the stated situation.

Go proverbs, life-or-death problems (tsumego), and compilations of go games (kifu) are the three major traditional teaching resources for the game of go.

Several books relating to Go proverbs have been written, for example &quot;Go Proverbs illustrated&quot; by Kensaku Segoe () was published in 1960. Such books do not just quote the proverb but spend their pages explaining the meaning and application of the proverbs.

Some proverbs have a more general applicability. For example, one famous proverb is to move where your opponent wants to move. This may be used as a heuristic in games such as &quot;Scrabble&quot;.

<doc id="157050" wikidata="Q1475448" url="?curid=157050" title="Regicide">
<text>Regicide is the purposeful killing of a monarch or sovereign of a polity and is often associated with the usurpation of power. A regicide can also be the person responsible for the killing. The word comes from the Latin roots of &quot;regis&quot; and &quot;cida&quot; (&quot;cidium&quot;), meaning &quot;of monarch&quot; and &quot;killer&quot; respectively.
In the British tradition, it refers to the judicial execution of a king after a trial, reflecting the historical precedent of the trial and execution of Charles I of England. The concept of regicide has also been explored in media and the arts through pieces like &quot;Macbeth&quot; (Macbeth&#x27;s killing of King Duncan).

==History==
In Western Christianity, regicide was far more common prior to 1200/1300. Sverre Bagge counts 20 cases of regicide between 1200 and 1800, which means that 6% of monarchs were killed by their subjects. He counts 94 cases of regicide between 600 and 1200, which means that 21.8% of monarchs were killed by their subjects. He argues that the most likely reasons for the decline in regicide is that clear rules of succession were established, which made it hard to remove rightful heirs to the throne, and only made it so that the nearest heir (and their backers) had a motive to kill the monarch.

There is evidence that regicide and the ability of states to keep or even expand their territories are negatively correlated: Firstly, elite violence hindered the development of territorial state capacity, and the killing of rulers also directly resulted in a more likely loss of territory. And secondly, state capacity, reflected by territorial state capacity, could be hypothesized to have had a restraining effect on interpersonal violence. This would be consistent with Pinker&#x27;s (2011) view that modern state capacity leads to a reduction in violence, both interpersonal and in terms of military conflict.

=== Britain ===
Before the Tudor period, English kings had been murdered while imprisoned (for example Edward II and Edward V) or killed in battle by their subjects (for example Richard III); Scottish kings had also died in battle against rebels (such as James III) or been assassinated (Duncan II, James I); but none of these deaths is usually referred to as regicide.

====Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots====

The word regicide seems to have come into popular use among continental Catholics when Pope Sixtus V renewed the papal bull of excommunication against the &quot;crowned regicide&quot; Queen Elizabeth I, for—among other things—executing Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587, although she had abdicated the Scottish crown some 20 years earlier. Elizabeth had originally been excommunicated by Pope Pius V, in , for converting England to Protestantism after the reign of Mary I of England.

====Execution of Charles I of England====
After the First English Civil War, King Charles I was a prisoner of the Parliamentarians. The Parliamentarians attempted to negotiate a compromise with him, but he stuck steadfastly to his view that he was King by divine right and attempted in secret to raise an army to fight against them. It became obvious to the leaders of the Parliamentarians that they could not negotiate a settlement with him and they could not trust him to refrain from raising an army against them; they reluctantly came to the conclusion that he would have to be put to death. On 13 December 1648, the House of Commons broke off negotiations with the King. Two days later, the Council of Officers of the New Model Army voted that the King be moved from the Isle of Wight, where he was prisoner, to Windsor &quot;in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice&quot;. In the middle of December, the King was moved from Windsor to St James&#x27;s Palace, Westminster. The House of Commons of the Rump Parliament passed a Bill setting up a High Court of Justice in order to try Charles I for high treason &quot;in the name of the people of England.&quot; From a Royalist and post-restoration perspective, this Bill was not lawful, as the House of Lords refused to pass it and it predictably failed to receive the Royal Assent. However, the Parliamentary leaders and the Army pressed on with the trial regardless.

At his trial in the High Court of Justice on Saturday 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall, Charles asked &quot;I would know by what power I am called hither. I would know by what authority, I mean lawful&quot;. In view of the historic issues involved, both sides based themselves on surprisingly technical legal grounds. Charles did not dispute that Parliament as a whole did have some judicial powers, but he maintained that the House of Commons on its own could not try anybody, and so he refused to plead. At that time under English law, if a prisoner refused to plead, they would be treated identically to one who had pleaded guilty. This has since changed; a refusal to plead is now interpreted as a not-guilty plea.

Charles was found guilty on Saturday 27 January 1649, and his death warrant was signed by fifty-nine commissioners. To show their agreement with the sentence of death, all of the Commissioners who were present rose to their feet.

On the day of his execution, 30 January 1649, Charles dressed in two shirts so that he would not shiver from the cold, lest it be said that he was shivering from fear. His execution was delayed by several hours so that the House of Commons could pass an emergency bill to make it an offence to proclaim a new King, and to declare the representatives of the people, the House of Commons, as the source of all just power. Charles was then escorted through a window of the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall to an outdoor scaffold where he would be beheaded. He forgave those who had passed sentence on him and gave instructions to his enemies that they should learn to &quot;know their duty to God, the King – that is, my successors – and the people&quot;. He then gave a brief speech outlining his unchanged views of the relationship between the monarchy and the monarch&#x27;s subjects, ending with the words &quot;I am the martyr of the people&quot;. His head was severed from his body with one blow.

One week later, the Rump, sitting in the House of Commons, passed a bill abolishing the monarchy. Ardent Royalists refused to accept it on the basis that there could never be a vacancy of the Crown. Others refused because, as the bill had not passed the House of Lords and did not have Royal Assent, it could not become an Act of Parliament.

The Declaration of Breda 11 years later paved the way for the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. At the time of the restoration, thirty-one of the fifty-nine Commissioners who had signed the death warrant were living. Parliament, with the assent of the new king, Charles II, enacted the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, giving a general pardon to those who had committed crimes during the civil war and interregnum, but the regicides were among those excluded from it. A number fled. Some, such as Daniel Blagrave, fled to continental Europe, while others like John Dixwell, Edward Whalley, and William Goffe fled to New Haven, Connecticut. Those regicides who could be found and arrested were put on trial. Six were found guilty and suffered the fate of being hanged, drawn and quartered: Thomas Harrison, John Jones, Adrian Scrope, John Carew, Thomas Scot, and Gregory Clement. The captain of the guard at the trial, Daniel Axtell, who encouraged his men to the King when he tried to speak in his own defence, an influential preacher, Hugh Peters, and the leading prosecutor at the trial, John Cook, were executed in a similar manner. Colonel Francis Hacker, who signed the order to the executioner of the king and commanded the guard around the scaffold and at the trial, was hanged. Concern amongst the royal ministers over the negative impact on popular sentiment of these public tortures and executions led to jail sentences being substituted for the remaining regicides.

Some regicides, such as Richard Ingoldsby and Philip Nye, were conditionally pardoned, while a further 19 served life imprisonment. The bodies of the regicides Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton, which had been buried in Westminster Abbey, were disinterred and hanged, drawn and quartered in posthumous executions. In 1662, three more regicides, John Okey, John Barkstead and Miles Corbet, were also hanged, drawn and quartered. The officers of the court that tried Charles I, those who prosecuted him, and those who signed his death warrant, have been known ever since the restoration as regicides.

The Parliamentary Archives in the Palace of Westminster, London, holds the original death warrant for Charles I.

==== Britain, 1760–1850 ====
Some people throughout in the 1760–1850 period in England and Great Britain who have been suspected, arrested, and perhaps punished for trying to lethally harm the reigning monarch, which has sometimes been understood to be attempted &quot;regicide&quot;, do not appear to have had the intention of actually killing the king or queen. According to Poole (2000), the actions and utterances of English figures such as Nicholson, Firth, Sutherland, Hadfield, Collins, Oxford, Francis and Bean, all of whom tried to get the monarch&#x27;s attention for some matter, &quot;point more often to physical remonstance after experiences of extreme frustration with an ineffectual petitioning process.&quot; Others who did try to kill the ruler did so not in order to replace the monarchy with a republic, but because they hoped that their successor would be a better ruler, and able to address certain issues which, in the would-be assassins&#x27; views, the current sovereign failed to properly act on. According to British radical orator John Thelwall (1764–1834), regicide was simply a means of replacing an unacceptable monarch with a better one.

=== France ===
On 25 June 1836, a Frenchman named Alibaud attempted to assassinate the &quot;July Monarch&quot; Louis Philippe I by shooting him. At trial, Alibaud held the king responsible for the economic ruin of his family, compared himself to Marcus Junius Brutus (most well known amongst the assassins of Julius Caesar), and stated: &quot;Regicide is the right of all men who are debarred from any justice but that which they take into their own hands.&quot; He was executed by guillotine.

=== Mexico ===
The separate 19th century executions of two of Mexico&#x27;s emperors were carried out by Republicans.

After the abolishment of the First Mexican Empire, Agustin I was first exiled and on 11 May 1823, the ex-emperor boarded the British ship Rawlins en route to Livorno, Italy (then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany), accompanied by his wife, children, and some servants. After Conservative political factions in Mexico finally convinced Agustin I to return, and unaware of the consequences of a law aimed solely at him, he was taken prisoner by a general he had himself pardoned as emperor. He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824. The aftermath of his execution was met with indignation by Mexican royalists. The sentiment of those horrified by the execution was compiled by novelist Enrique de Olavarría y Ferrari in &quot;El cadalso de Padilla:&quot; &quot;Done is the dark crime, for which we will doubtlessly be called Parricides.&quot;

Later, after the downfall of the Second Mexican Empire, which saw the reign of Maximilian I of Mexico—a member of the House of Habsburg, which had previously ruled Mexico as New Spain from the 16th to 18th century— the Republican forces of Benito Juarez, with aid from the U.S. and sabotage by Colonel Miguel López, captured and executed him on 19 June 1867. Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s last words were &quot;…May my blood which is about to be spilled end the bloodshed which has been experienced in my new motherland. Long live Mexico! Long live its independence!&quot;.

=== Portugal ===
=== Iraq ===
On 14 July 1958, at least four members of the ruling Hashemite family (including the King and the Crown Prince) of the Kingdom of Iraq were killed by revolutionaries of the Nationalist Officers&#x27; Organization under the command of Abdul Salam Arif.

=== Italy ===
King Umberto I was assassinated by Italian-American anarchist Gaetano Bresci on the evening of 29 July 1900 in Monza. Bresci claimed he wanted to avenge the people killed in Milan in the course of the Bava Beccaris massacre.

==Usurpation==

Regicide has particular resonance within the concept of the divine right of kings, whereby monarchs were presumed by decision of God to have a divinely anointed authority to rule. As such, an attack on a king by one of his own subjects was taken to amount to a direct challenge to the monarch, to his divine right to rule, and thus to God&#x27;s will.

The biblical David refused to harm King Saul, because he was the Lord&#x27;s anointed, even though Saul was seeking his life; and when Saul eventually was killed in battle and a person reported to David that he helped kill Saul, David put the man to death, even though Saul had been his enemy, because he had raised his hands against the Lord&#x27;s anointed. Christian concepts of the inviolability of the person of the monarch have great influence from this story. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, King of Tara (mentioned above), was killed by Áed Dub mac Suibni in 565. According to Adomnan of Iona&#x27;s Life of St Columba, Áed Dub mac Suibni received God&#x27;s punishment for this crime by being impaled by a treacherous spear many years later and then falling from his ship into a lake and drowning.

Even after the disappearance of the divine right of kings and the appearance of constitutional monarchies, the term continued and continues to be used to describe the murder of a king.

In France, the judicial penalty for regicides (i.e. those who had murdered, or attempted to murder, the king) was especially hard, even in regard to the harsh judicial practices of pre-revolutionary France. As with many criminals, the regicide was tortured so as to make him tell the names of his accomplices. However, the method of execution itself was a form of torture. Here is a description of the death of Robert-François Damiens, who attempted to kill Louis XV:
In &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, the French philosopher Michel Foucault cites this case of Damiens the Regicide as an example of disproportionate punishment in the era preceding the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;. The classical school of criminology asserts that the punishment &quot;should fit the crime&quot;, and should thus be proportionate and not extreme. This approach was spoofed by Gilbert and Sullivan, when The Mikado sang, &quot;My object all sublime, I shall achieve in time, to let the punishment fit the crime&quot;.

In common with earlier executions for regicides:
* the hand that attempted the murder is burnt
* the regicide is dismembered alive

In both the François Ravaillac and the Damiens cases, court papers refer to the offenders as a patricide, rather than as regicide, which lets one deduce that, through divine right, the king was also regarded as &quot;Father of the country&quot;.

<doc id="157052" wikidata="Q794457" url="?curid=157052" title="Locked-in syndrome">
<text>Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma, is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in their body except for vertical eye movements and blinking. The individual is conscious and sufficiently intact cognitively to be able to communicate with eye movements. Electroencephalography results are normal in locked-in syndrome.
Total locked-in syndrome, or completely locked-in state (CLIS), is a version of locked-in syndrome wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well. Fred Plum and Jerome B. Posner coined the term for this disorder in 1966.

==Signs and symptoms==
Locked-in syndrome is usually characterized by quadriplegia (loss of limb function) and the inability to speak in otherwise cognitively intact individuals. Those with locked-in syndrome may be able to communicate with others through coded messages by blinking or moving their eyes, which are often not affected by the paralysis. Patients who have locked-in syndrome are conscious and aware, with no loss of cognitive function. They can sometimes retain proprioception and sensation throughout their bodies. Some patients may have the ability to move certain facial muscles, and most often some or all of the extraocular muscles. Individuals with the syndrome lack coordination between breathing and voice. This prevents them from producing voluntary sounds, though the vocal cords themselves may not be paralysed.

==Causes==
Unlike persistent vegetative state, in which the upper portions of the brain are damaged and the lower portions are spared, locked-in syndrome is essentially the opposite, caused by damage to specific portions of the lower brain and brainstem, with no damage to the upper brain. Injuries to the pons are the most common cause of locked-in syndrome.

Possible causes of locked-in syndrome include:
* Poisoning cases – More frequently from a krait bite and other neurotoxic venoms, as they cannot usually cross the blood–brain barrier
* Brainstem stroke
* Diseases of the circulatory system
* Medication overdose
* Damage to nerve cells, particularly destruction of the myelin sheath, caused by disease or &quot;osmotic demyelination syndrome&quot; (formerly designated central pontine myelinolysis) secondary to excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia [&gt;1 mEq/L/h])
* A stroke or brain hemorrhage, usually of the basilar artery
* Traumatic brain injury
* Result from lesion of the brainstem

Curare poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning mimic a total locked-in syndrome by causing paralysis of all voluntarily controlled skeletal muscles. The respiratory muscles are also paralyzed, but the victim can be kept alive by artificial respiration.

==Diagnosis==
Locked-in syndrome can be difficult to diagnose. In a 2002 survey of 44 people with LIS, it took almost three months to recognize and diagnose the condition after it had begun. Locked-in syndrome may mimic loss of consciousness in patients, or, in the case that respiratory control is lost, may even resemble death. People are also unable to actuate standard motor responses such as withdrawal from pain; as a result, testing often requires making requests of the patient such as blinking or vertical eye movement.

Brain imaging may provide additional indicators of locked-in syndrome, as brain imaging provides clues as to whether or not brain function has been lost. Additionally, an EEG can allow the observation of sleep-wake patterns indicating that the patient is not unconscious but simply unable to move.

=== Similar conditions ===
* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
* Bilateral brainstem tumors
* Brain death (of the whole brain or the brainstem or other part)
* Coma (deep or irreversible)
* Guillain–Barré syndrome
* Myasthenia gravis
* Poliomyelitis
* Polyneuritis
* Vegetative state (chronic or otherwise)

==Treatment==
Neither a standard treatment nor a cure is available. Stimulation of muscle reflexes with electrodes (NMES) has been known to help patients regain some muscle function. Other courses of treatment are often symptomatic. Assistive computer interface technologies such as Dasher, combined with eye tracking, may be used to help people with LIS communicate with their environment.

==Prognosis==
It is extremely rare for any significant motor function to return, with the majority of locked-in syndrome patients never regaining motor control. However, some people with the condition continue to live for extended periods of time, while in exceptional cases, like that of Kerry Pink, Gareth Shepherd, Jacob Haendel, Kate Allatt, and Jessica Wegbrans, a near-full recovery may be achieved with intensive physical therapy.

==Research==
New brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) may provide future remedies. One effort in 2002 allowed a fully locked-in patient to answer yes-or-no questions. In 2006, researchers created and successfully tested a neural interface which allowed someone with locked-in syndrome to operate a web browser. Some scientists have reported that they have developed a technique that allows locked-in patients to communicate via sniffing.
For the first time in 2020, a 34-year-old German patient, paralyzed since 2015 (later also the eyeballs) managed to communicate through an implant capable of reading brain activity.

<doc id="157055" wikidata="Q207952" url="?curid=157055" title="Law of large numbers">
<text>In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists. More formally, the LLN states that given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean. 

The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. Importantly, the law applies (as the name indicates) only when a &quot;large number&quot; of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be &quot;balanced&quot; by the others (see the gambler&#x27;s fallacy).

The LLN only applies to the &quot;average&quot; of the results obtained from repeated trials and claims that this average converges to the expected value; it does not claim that the &quot;sum&quot; of &quot;n&quot; results gets close to the expected value times &quot;n&quot; as &quot;n&quot; increases.

Throughout its history, many mathematicians have refined this law. Today, the LLN is used in many fields including statistics, probability theory, economics, and insurance.

For example, a single roll of a six-sided die produces one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, each with equal probability. Therefore, the expected value of the roll is:

formula_1

According to the law of large numbers, if a large number of six-sided dice are rolled, the average of their values (sometimes called the sample mean) will approach 3.5, with the precision increasing as more dice are rolled.

It follows from the law of large numbers that the empirical probability of success in a series of Bernoulli trials will converge to the theoretical probability. For a Bernoulli random variable, the expected value is the theoretical probability of success, and the average of &quot;n&quot; such variables (assuming they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)) is precisely the relative frequency.

For example, a fair coin toss is a Bernoulli trial. When a fair coin is flipped once, the theoretical probability that the outcome will be heads is equal to . Therefore, according to the law of large numbers, the proportion of heads in a &quot;large&quot; number of coin flips &quot;should be&quot; roughly . In particular, the proportion of heads after &quot;n&quot; flips will almost surely converge to as &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity.

Although the proportion of heads (and tails) approaches , almost surely the absolute difference in the number of heads and tails will become large as the number of flips becomes large. That is, the probability that the absolute difference is a small number approaches zero as the number of flips becomes large. Also, almost surely the ratio of the absolute difference to the number of flips will approach zero. Intuitively, the expected difference grows, but at a slower rate than the number of flips.

Another good example of the LLN is the Monte Carlo method. These methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation tends to be. The reason that this method is important is mainly that, sometimes, it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.

== Limitation ==
The average of the results obtained from a large number of trials may fail to converge in some cases. For instance, the average of &quot;n&quot; results taken from the Cauchy distribution or some Pareto distributions (α&lt;1) will not converge as &quot;n&quot; becomes larger; the reason is heavy tails. The Cauchy distribution and the Pareto distribution represent two cases: the Cauchy distribution does not have an expectation, whereas the expectation of the Pareto distribution (&quot;α&quot;&lt;1) is infinite. One way to generate the Cauchy-distributed example is where the random numbers equal the tangent of an angle uniformly distributed between −90° and +90°. The median is zero, but the expected value does not exist, and indeed the average of &quot;n&quot; such variables have the same distribution as one such variable. It does not converge in probability toward zero (or any other value) as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity.

And if the trials embed a selection bias, typical in human economic/rational behaviour, the law of large numbers does not help in solving the bias. Even if the number of trials is increased the selection bias remains.

==History==
The Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) stated without proof that the accuracies of empirical statistics tend to improve with the number of trials. This was then formalized as a law of large numbers. A special form of the LLN (for a binary random variable) was first proved by Jacob Bernoulli. It took him over 20 years to develop a sufficiently rigorous mathematical proof which was published in his (&quot;The Art of Conjecturing&quot;) in 1713. He named this his &quot;Golden Theorem&quot; but it became generally known as &quot;Bernoulli&#x27;s theorem&quot;. This should not be confused with Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, named after Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s nephew Daniel Bernoulli. In 1837, S. D. Poisson further described it under the name (&quot;the law of large numbers&quot;). Thereafter, it was known under both names, but the &quot;law of large numbers&quot; is most frequently used.

After Bernoulli and Poisson published their efforts, other mathematicians also contributed to refinement of the law, including Chebyshev, Markov, Borel, Cantelli, Kolmogorov and Khinchin. Markov showed that the law can apply to a random variable that does not have a finite variance under some other weaker assumption, and Khinchin showed in 1929 that if the series consists of independent identically distributed random variables, it suffices that the expected value exists for the weak law of large numbers to be true. These further studies have given rise to two prominent forms of the LLN. One is called the &quot;weak&quot; law and the other the &quot;strong&quot; law, in reference to two different modes of convergence of the cumulative sample means to the expected value; in particular, as explained below, the strong form implies the weak.

==Forms==
There are two different versions of the law of large numbers that are described below. They are called the&quot; strong law of large numbers&quot; and the &quot;weak law of large numbers&quot;. Stated for the case where &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ... is an infinite sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Lebesgue integrable random variables with expected value E(&quot;X&quot;1) = E(&quot;X&quot;2) = ... = &quot;μ&quot;, both versions of the law state that the sample average

formula_2

converges to the expected value:
(Lebesgue integrability of &quot;Xj&quot; means that the expected value E(&quot;Xj&quot;) exists according to Lebesgue integration and is finite. It does &quot;not&quot; mean that the associated probability measure is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.)

Introductory probability texts often additionally assume identical finite variance formula_3 (for all formula_4) and no correlation between random variables. In that case, the variance of the average of n random variables is

formula_5

which can be used to shorten and simplify the proofs. This assumption of finite variance is &quot;not necessary&quot;. Large or infinite variance will make the convergence slower, but the LLN holds anyway. 

Mutual independence of the random variables can be replaced by pairwise independence or exchangeability in both versions of the law.

The difference between the strong and the weak version is concerned with the mode of convergence being asserted. For interpretation of these modes, see Convergence of random variables.

===Weak law===

The weak law of large numbers (also called Khinchin&#x27;s law) states that given a collection of independent and identically distributed (iid) samples from a random variable with finite mean, the sample mean converges in probability to the expected value
That is, for any positive number &quot;ε&quot;,

formula_6

Interpreting this result, the weak law states that for any nonzero margin specified (&quot;ε&quot;), no matter how small, with a sufficiently large sample there will be a very high probability that the average of the observations will be close to the expected value; that is, within the margin.

As mentioned earlier, the weak law applies in the case of i.i.d. random variables, but it also applies in some other cases. For example, the variance may be different for each random variable in the series, keeping the expected value constant. If the variances are bounded, then the law applies, as shown by Chebyshev as early as 1867. (If the expected values change during the series, then we can simply apply the law to the average deviation from the respective expected values. The law then states that this converges in probability to zero.) In fact, Chebyshev&#x27;s proof works so long as the variance of the average of the first &quot;n&quot; values goes to zero as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity. As an example, assume that each random variable in the series follows a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution) with mean zero, but with variance equal to formula_7, which is not bounded. At each stage, the average will be normally distributed (as the average of a set of normally distributed variables). The variance of the sum is equal to the sum of the variances, which is asymptotic to formula_8. The variance of the average is therefore asymptotic to formula_9 and goes to zero.

There are also examples of the weak law applying even though the expected value does not exist.

===Strong law===
The strong law of large numbers (also called Kolmogorov&#x27;s law) states that the sample average converges almost surely to the expected value
{\longrightarrow}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

That is,

formula_10

What this means is that, as the number of trials &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity, the probability that the average of the observations converges to the expected value, is equal to one. The modern proof of the strong law is more complex than that of the weak law, and relies on passing to an appropriate subsequence. 

The strong law of large numbers can itself be seen as a special case of the pointwise ergodic theorem. This view justifies the intuitive interpretation of the expected value (for Lebesgue integration only) of a random variable when sampled repeatedly as the &quot;long-term average&quot;. 

Law 3 is called the strong law because random variables which converge strongly (almost surely) are guaranteed to converge weakly (in probability). However the weak law is known to hold in certain conditions where the strong law does not hold and then the convergence is only weak (in probability). See differences between the weak law and the strong law.

The strong law applies to independent identically distributed random variables having an expected value (like the weak law). This was proved by Kolmogorov in 1930. It can also apply in other cases. Kolmogorov also showed, in 1933, that if the variables are independent and identically distributed, then for the average to converge almost surely on &quot;something&quot; (this can be considered another statement of the strong law), it is necessary that they have an expected value (and then of course the average will converge almost surely on that).

If the summands are independent but not identically distributed, then
{\longrightarrow}\ 0,
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

provided that each &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; has a finite second moment and

formula_11

This statement is known as &quot;Kolmogorov&#x27;s strong law&quot;, see e.g. .

===Differences between the weak law and the strong law===
The &quot;weak law&quot; states that for a specified large &quot;n&quot;, the average formula_12 is likely to be near &quot;μ&quot;. Thus, it leaves open the possibility that formula_13 happens an infinite number of times, although at infrequent intervals. (Not necessarily formula_14 for all &quot;n&quot;).

The &quot;strong law&quot; shows that this almost surely will not occur. It does not imply that with probability 1, we have that for any the inequality formula_15 holds for all large enough &quot;n&quot;, since the convergence is not necessarily uniform on the set where it holds.

The strong law does not hold in the following cases, but the weak law does.

===Uniform laws of large numbers===
There are extensions of the law of large numbers to collections of estimators, where the convergence is uniform over the collection; thus the name &quot;uniform law of large numbers&quot;.

Suppose &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;θ&quot;) is some function defined for &quot;θ&quot; ∈ Θ, and continuous in &quot;θ&quot;. Then for any fixed &quot;θ&quot;, the sequence {&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1,&quot;θ&quot;), &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2,&quot;θ&quot;), ...} will be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, such that the sample mean of this sequence converges in probability to E[&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;θ&quot;)]. This is the &quot;pointwise&quot; (in &quot;θ&quot;) convergence.

A particular example of a uniform law of large numbers states the conditions under which the convergence happens &quot;uniformly&quot; in &quot;θ&quot;. If

# &quot;Θ&quot; is compact,
# &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;θ&quot;) is continuous at each &quot;θ&quot; ∈ Θ for almost all &quot;x&quot;s, and measurable function of &quot;x&quot; at each &quot;θ&quot;.
# there exists a dominating function &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) such that E[&quot;d&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)] &lt; ∞, and formula_16

Then E[&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;θ&quot;)] is continuous in &quot;θ&quot;, and

formula_17

This result is useful to derive consistency of a large class of estimators (see Extremum estimator).

===Borel&#x27;s law of large numbers===
Borel&#x27;s law of large numbers, named after Émile Borel, states that if an experiment is repeated a large number of times, independently under identical conditions, then the proportion of times that any specified event is expected to occur approximately equals the probability of the event&#x27;s occurrence on any particular trial; the larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation tends to be. More precisely, if &quot;E&quot; denotes the event in question, &quot;p&quot; its probability of occurrence, and &quot;Nn&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) the number of times &quot;E&quot; occurs in the first &quot;n&quot; trials, then with probability one,
formula_18

This theorem makes rigorous the intuitive notion of probability as the expected long-run relative frequency of an event&#x27;s occurrence. It is a special case of any of several more general laws of large numbers in probability theory.

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. Let &quot;X&quot; be a random variable with finite expected value &quot;μ&quot; and finite non-zero variance &quot;σ&quot;2. Then for any real number ,

formula_19

==Proof of the weak law==
Given &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ... an infinite sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite expected value formula_20, we are interested in the convergence of the sample average

formula_21

The weak law of large numbers states:
===Proof using Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality assuming finite variance===
This proof uses the assumption of finite variance formula_22 (for all formula_4). The independence of the random variables implies no correlation between them, and we have that

formula_24

The common mean μ of the sequence is the mean of the sample average:

formula_25

Using Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality on formula_26 results in

formula_27

This may be used to obtain the following:

formula_28

As &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity, the expression approaches 1. And by definition of convergence in probability, we have obtained
===Proof using convergence of characteristic functions===
By Taylor&#x27;s theorem for complex functions, the characteristic function of any random variable, &quot;X&quot;, with finite mean μ, can be written as

formula_29

All &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ... have the same characteristic function, so we will simply denote this &quot;φ&quot;&quot;X&quot;.

Among the basic properties of characteristic functions there are

formula_30 if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent.

These rules can be used to calculate the characteristic function of formula_31 in terms of &quot;φ&quot;&quot;X&quot;:

formula_32

The limit &quot;e&quot;&quot;itμ&quot; is the characteristic function of the constant random variable μ, and hence by the Lévy continuity theorem, formula_33 converges in distribution to μ:

formula_34

μ is a constant, which implies that convergence in distribution to μ and convergence in probability to μ are equivalent (see Convergence of random variables.) Therefore,
This shows that the sample mean converges in probability to the derivative of the characteristic function at the origin, as long as the latter exists.

==Proof of the strong law==
We give a relatively simple proof of the strong law under the assumptions that the formula_35 are iid, formula_36, formula_37, and formula_38.

Let us first note that without loss of generality we can assume that formula_39 by centering. In this case, the strong law says that

formula_40
or
formula_41
It is equivalent to show that
formula_42
Note that
formula_43
and thus to prove the strong law we need to show that for every formula_44, we have
formula_45
Define the events formula_46, and if we can show that 
formula_47
then the Borel-Cantelli Lemma implies the result. So let us estimate formula_48.

We compute 
formula_49
We first claim that every term of the form formula_50 where all subscripts are distinct, must have zero expectation. This is because formula_51 by independence, and the last term is zero—and similarly for the other terms. Therefore the only terms in the sum with nonzero expectation are formula_52 and formula_53. Since the formula_35 are identically distributed, all of these are the same, and moreover formula_55. 

There are formula_56 terms of the form formula_52 and formula_58 terms of the form formula_59, and so
formula_60
Note that the right-hand side is a quadratic polynomial in formula_56, and as such there exists a formula_62 such that formula_63 for formula_56 sufficiently large. By Markov,
formula_65
for formula_56 sufficiently large, and therefore this series is summable. Since this holds for any formula_44, we have established the Strong LLN.

== Consequences ==
The law of large numbers provides an expectation of an unknown distribution from a realization of the sequence, but also any feature of the probability distribution. By applying Borel&#x27;s law of large numbers, one could easily obtain the probability mass function. For each event in the objective probability mass function, one could approximate the probability of the event&#x27;s occurrence with the proportion of times that any specified event occurs. The larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation. As for the continuous case: formula_68, for small positive h. Thus, for large n:

formula_69

With this method, one can cover the whole x-axis with a grid (with grid size 2h) and obtain a bar graph which is called a histogram.

== Applications ==
One application of the LLN is an important method of approximation known as the Monte Carlo method, which uses a random sampling of numbers to approximate numerical results. The algorithm to compute an integral of f(x) on an interval [a,b] is as follows:

# Simulate uniform random variables X1, X2, ..., Xn which can be done using a software, and use a random number table that gives U1, U2, ..., Un independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables on [0,1]. Then let Xi = a+(b - a)Ui for i= 1, 2, ..., n. Then X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent and identically distributed uniform random variables on [a, b].
# Evaluate f(X1), f(X2), ..., f(Xn)
# Take the average of f(X1), f(X2), ..., f(Xn) by computing formula_70 and then by the Strong Law of Large Numbers, this converges to formula_71 = formula_72 =formula_73

We can find the integral of formula_74 on [-1,2]. Using traditional methods to compute this integral is very difficult, so the Monte Carlo method can be used here. Using the above algorithm, we get

formula_75 = 0.905 when n=25

and

formula_75 = 1.028 when n=250

We observe that as n increases, the numerical value also increases. When we get the actual results for the integral we get

formula_75 = 1.000194

When the LLN was used, the approximation of the integral was closer to its true value, and thus more accurate.

Another example is the integration of f(x) = formula_78 on [0,1]. Using the Monte Carlo method and the LLN, we can see that as the number of samples increases, the numerical value gets closer to 0.4180233.

<text>In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Although in the broadest sense, &quot;correlation&quot; may indicate any type of association, in statistics it usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are &quot;linearly&quot; related. 
Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the height of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase, as it is depicted in the demand curve.

Correlations are useful because they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice. For example, an electrical utility may produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather. In this example, there is a causal relationship, because extreme weather causes people to use more electricity for heating or cooling. However, in general, the presence of a correlation is not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship (i.e., correlation does not imply causation).

Formally, random variables are &quot;dependent&quot; if they do not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence. In informal parlance, &quot;correlation&quot; is synonymous with &quot;dependence&quot;. However, when used in a technical sense, correlation refers to any of several specific types of mathematical relationship between the conditional expectation of one variable given the other is not constant as the conditioning variable changes; broadly correlation in this specific sense is used when formula_1 is related to formula_2 in some manner (such as linearly, monotonically, or perhaps according to some particular functional form such as logarithmic). Essentially, correlation is the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another. There are several correlation coefficients, often denoted formula_3 or formula_4, measuring the degree of correlation. The most common of these is the &quot;Pearson correlation coefficient&quot;, which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other). Other correlation coefficients – such as &quot;Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient&quot; – have been developed to be more robust than Pearson&#x27;s and to detect less structured relationships between variables. Mutual information can also be applied to measure dependence between two variables.

==Pearson&#x27;s product-moment coefficient==

The most familiar measure of dependence between two quantities is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), or &quot;Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient&quot;, commonly called simply &quot;the correlation coefficient&quot;. It is obtained by taking the ratio of the covariance of the two variables in question of our numerical dataset, normalized to the square root of their variances. Mathematically, one simply divides the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. Karl Pearson developed the coefficient from a similar but slightly different idea by Francis Galton.

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient attempts to establish a line of best fit through a dataset of two variables by essentially laying out the expected values and the resulting Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient indicates how far away the actual dataset is from the expected values. Depending on the sign of our Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient, we can end up with either a negative or positive correlation if there is any sort of relationship between the variables of our data set.

The population correlation coefficient formula_5 between two random variables formula_6 and formula_7 with expected values formula_8 and formula_9 and standard deviations formula_10 and formula_11 is defined as:

formula_12

where formula_13 is the expected value operator, formula_14 means covariance, and formula_15 is a widely used alternative notation for the correlation coefficient. The Pearson correlation is defined only if both standard deviations are finite and positive. An alternative formula purely in terms of moments is:

formula_16

===Correlation and independence===
It is a corollary of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality that the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient is not bigger than 1. Therefore, the value of a correlation coefficient ranges between −1 and +1. The correlation coefficient is +1 in the case of a perfect direct (increasing) linear relationship (correlation), −1 in the case of a perfect inverse (decreasing) linear relationship (anti-correlation), and some value in the open interval formula_17 in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables. As it approaches zero there is less of a relationship (closer to uncorrelated). The closer the coefficient is to either −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables.

If the variables are independent, Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient is 0. However, because the correlation coefficient detects only linear dependencies between two variables, the converse is not necessarily true. A correlation coefficient of 0 does not imply that the variables are independent.

formula_18

For example, suppose the random variable formula_6 is symmetrically distributed about zero, and formula_20. Then formula_7 is completely determined by formula_6, so that formula_6 and formula_7 are perfectly dependent, but their correlation is zero; they are uncorrelated. However, in the special case when formula_6 and formula_7 are jointly normal, uncorrelatedness is equivalent to independence.

Even though uncorrelated data does not necessarily imply independence, one can check if random variables are independent if their mutual information is 0.
===Sample correlation coefficient===
Given a series of formula_27 measurements of the pair formula_28 indexed by formula_29, the &quot;sample correlation coefficient&quot; can be used to estimate the population Pearson correlation formula_5 between formula_6 and formula_7. The sample correlation coefficient is defined as

:formula_33

where formula_34 and formula_35 are the sample means of formula_6 and formula_7, and formula_38 and formula_39 are the corrected sample standard deviations of formula_6 and formula_7.

Equivalent expressions for formula_42 are
:formula_43
where formula_44 and formula_45 are the &quot;uncorrected&quot; sample standard deviations of formula_6 and formula_7.

If formula_2 and formula_49 are results of measurements that contain measurement error, the realistic limits on the correlation coefficient are not −1 to +1 but a smaller range. For the case of a linear model with a single independent variable, the coefficient of determination (R squared) is the square of formula_42, Pearson&#x27;s product-moment coefficient.

===Example===
Consider the joint probability distribution of and given in the table below.

For this joint distribution, the marginal distributions are:
:formula_51

:formula_52

This yields the following expectations and variances:
:formula_53
:formula_54
:formula_55
:formula_56

Therefore:

: formula_57

==Rank correlation coefficients==
Rank correlation coefficients, such as Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient and Kendall&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient (τ) measure the extent to which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship. If, as the one variable increases, the other &quot;decreases&quot;, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson&#x27;s coefficient, used either to reduce the amount of calculation or to make the coefficient less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as an alternative measure of the population correlation coefficient.

To illustrate the nature of rank correlation, and its difference from linear correlation, consider the following four pairs of numbers formula_58:

:(0, 1), (10, 100), (101, 500), (102, 2000).

As we go from each pair to the next pair formula_2 increases, and so does formula_49. This relationship is perfect, in the sense that an increase in formula_2 is &quot;always&quot; accompanied by an increase in formula_49. This means that we have a perfect rank correlation, and both Spearman&#x27;s and Kendall&#x27;s correlation coefficients are 1, whereas in this example Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is 0.7544, indicating that the points are far from lying on a straight line. In the same way if formula_49 always &quot;decreases&quot; when formula_2 &quot;increases&quot;, the rank correlation coefficients will be −1, while the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient may or may not be close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line. Although in the extreme cases of perfect rank correlation the two coefficients are both equal (being both +1 or both −1), this is not generally the case, and so values of the two coefficients cannot meaningfully be compared. For example, for the three pairs (1, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) Spearman&#x27;s coefficient is 1/2, while Kendall&#x27;s coefficient is 1/3.

==Other measures of dependence among random variables==
The information given by a correlation coefficient is not enough to define the dependence structure between random variables. The correlation coefficient completely defines the dependence structure only in very particular cases, for example when the distribution is a multivariate normal distribution. (See diagram above.) In the case of elliptical distributions it characterizes the (hyper-)ellipses of equal density; however, it does not completely characterize the dependence structure (for example, a multivariate t-distribution&#x27;s degrees of freedom determine the level of tail dependence). 

For continuous variables, multiple alternative measures of dependence were introduced to address the deficiency of Pearson&#x27;s correlation that it can be zero for dependent random variables (see and reference references therein for an overview). They all share the important property that a value of zero implies independence. This led some authors to recommend their routine usage, particularly of Distance correlation. Another alternative measure is the Randomized Dependence Coefficient. The RDC is a computationally efficient, copula-based measure of dependence between multivariate random variables and is invariant with respect to non-linear scalings of random variables.

One important disadvantage of the alternative, more general measures is that, when used to test whether two variables are associated, they tend to have lower power compared to Pearson&#x27;s correlation when the data follow a multivariate normal distribution. This is an implication of the No free lunch theorem. To detect all kinds of relationships, these measures have to sacrifice power on other relationships, particularly for the important special case of a linear relationship with Gaussian marginals, for which Pearson&#x27;s correlation is optimal. Another problem concerns interpretation. While Person&#x27;s correlation can be interpreted for all values, the alternative measures can generally only be interpreted meaningfully at the extremes.

For two binary variables, the odds ratio measures their dependence, and takes range non-negative numbers, possibly infinity: . Related statistics such as Yule&#x27;s &quot;Y&quot; and Yule&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; normalize this to the correlation-like range . The odds ratio is generalized by the logistic model to model cases where the dependent variables are discrete and there may be one or more independent variables.

The correlation ratio, entropy-based mutual information, total correlation, dual total correlation and polychoric correlation are all also capable of detecting more general dependencies, as is consideration of the copula between them, while the coefficient of determination generalizes the correlation coefficient to multiple regression.

==Sensitivity to the data distribution==
The degree of dependence between variables and does not depend on the scale on which the variables are expressed. That is, if we are analyzing the relationship between and , most correlation measures are unaffected by transforming to and to , where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are constants (&quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; being positive). This is true of some correlation statistics as well as their population analogues. Some correlation statistics, such as the rank correlation coefficient, are also invariant to monotone transformations of the marginal distributions of and/or .

Most correlation measures are sensitive to the manner in which and are sampled. Dependencies tend to be stronger if viewed over a wider range of values. Thus, if we consider the correlation coefficient between the heights of fathers and their sons over all adult males, and compare it to the same correlation coefficient calculated when the fathers are selected to be between 165 cm and 170 cm in height, the correlation will be weaker in the latter case. Several techniques have been developed that attempt to correct for range restriction in one or both variables, and are commonly used in meta-analysis; the most common are Thorndike&#x27;s case II and case III equations.

Various correlation measures in use may be undefined for certain joint distributions of and . For example, the Pearson correlation coefficient is defined in terms of moments, and hence will be undefined if the moments are undefined. Measures of dependence based on quantiles are always defined. Sample-based statistics intended to estimate population measures of dependence may or may not have desirable statistical properties such as being unbiased, or asymptotically consistent, based on the spatial structure of the population from which the data were sampled.

Sensitivity to the data distribution can be used to an advantage. For example, scaled correlation is designed to use the sensitivity to the range in order to pick out correlations between fast components of time series. By reducing the range of values in a controlled manner, the correlations on long time scale are filtered out and only the correlations on short time scales are revealed.

==Correlation matrices==

The correlation matrix of formula_27 random variables formula_66 is the formula_67 matrix formula_68 whose formula_69 entry is
:formula_70
Thus the diagonal entries are all identically one. If the measures of correlation used are product-moment coefficients, the correlation matrix is the same as the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables formula_71 for formula_72. This applies both to the matrix of population correlations (in which case formula_73 is the population standard deviation), and to the matrix of sample correlations (in which case formula_73 denotes the sample standard deviation). Consequently, each is necessarily a positive-semidefinite matrix. Moreover, the correlation matrix is strictly positive definite if no variable can have all its values exactly generated as a linear function of the values of the others.

The correlation matrix is symmetric because the correlation between formula_75 and formula_76 is the same as the correlation between formula_76 and formula_75.

A correlation matrix appears, for example, in one formula for the coefficient of multiple determination, a measure of goodness of fit in multiple regression.

In statistical modelling, correlation matrices representing the relationships between variables are categorized into different correlation structures, which are distinguished by factors such as the number of parameters required to estimate them. For example, in an exchangeable correlation matrix, all pairs of variables are modeled as having the same correlation, so all non-diagonal elements of the matrix are equal to each other. On the other hand, an autoregressive matrix is often used when variables represent a time series, since correlations are likely to be greater when measurements are closer in time. Other examples include independent, unstructured, M-dependent, and Toeplitz.

In exploratory data analysis, the iconography of correlations consists in replacing a correlation matrix by a diagram where the &quot;remarkable&quot; correlations are represented by a solid line (positive correlation), or a dotted line (negative correlation).

===Nearest valid correlation matrix===
In some applications (e.g., building data models from only partially observed data) one wants to find the &quot;nearest&quot; correlation matrix to an &quot;approximate&quot; correlation matrix (e.g., a matrix which typically lacks semi-definite positiveness due to the way it has been computed).

In 2002, Higham formalized the notion of nearness using the Frobenius norm and provided a method for computing the nearest correlation matrix using the Dykstra&#x27;s projection algorithm, of which an implementation is available as an online Web API.

This sparked interest in the subject, with new theoretical (e.g., computing the nearest correlation matrix with factor structure) and numerical (e.g. usage the Newton&#x27;s method for computing the nearest correlation matrix) results obtained in the subsequent years.

==Uncorrelatedness and independence of stochastic processes==
Similarly for two stochastic processes formula_79 and formula_80: If they are independent, then they are uncorrelated. The opposite of this statement might not be true. Even if two variables are uncorrelated, they might not be independent to each other.

==Common misconceptions==

===Correlation and causality===
The conventional dictum that &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot; means that correlation cannot be used by itself to infer a causal relationship between the variables. This dictum should not be taken to mean that correlations cannot indicate the potential existence of causal relations. However, the causes underlying the correlation, if any, may be indirect and unknown, and high correlations also overlap with identity relations (tautologies), where no causal process exists. Consequently, a correlation between two variables is not a sufficient condition to establish a causal relationship (in either direction).

A correlation between age and height in children is fairly causally transparent, but a correlation between mood and health in people is less so. Does improved mood lead to improved health, or does good health lead to good mood, or both? Or does some other factor underlie both? In other words, a correlation can be taken as evidence for a possible causal relationship, but cannot indicate what the causal relationship, if any, might be.

=== Simple linear correlations ===
The Pearson correlation coefficient indicates the strength of a &quot;linear&quot; relationship between two variables, but its value generally does not completely characterize their relationship. In particular, if the conditional mean of formula_7 given formula_6, denoted formula_83, is not linear in formula_6, the correlation coefficient will not fully determine the form of formula_83.

The adjacent image shows scatter plots of Anscombe&#x27;s quartet, a set of four different pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four formula_49 variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (formula_87). However, as can be seen on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient, even though the relationship between the two variables is not linear.

These examples indicate that the correlation coefficient, as a summary statistic, cannot replace visual examination of the data. The examples are sometimes said to demonstrate that the Pearson correlation assumes that the data follow a normal distribution, but this is only partially correct. The Pearson correlation can be accurately calculated for any distribution that has a finite covariance matrix, which includes most distributions encountered in practice. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient (taken together with the sample mean and variance) is only a sufficient statistic if the data is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. As a result, the Pearson correlation coefficient fully characterizes the relationship between variables if and only if the data are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution.

==Bivariate normal distribution==
If a pair formula_88 of random variables follows a bivariate normal distribution, the conditional mean formula_89 is a linear function of formula_7, and the conditional mean formula_91 is a linear function of formula_92 The correlation coefficient formula_93 between formula_94 and formula_95 and the marginal means and variances of formula_94 and formula_97 determine this linear relationship:

:formula_98

where formula_99 and formula_100 are the expected values of formula_94 and formula_95 respectively, and formula_103 and formula_104 are the standard deviations of formula_94 and formula_95 respectively. 
The empirical correlation formula_4 is an estimate of the correlation coefficient formula_108 A distribution estimate for formula_109 is given by

: formula_110

where formula_111 is the Gaussian hypergeometric function.

This density is both a Bayesian posterior density and an exact optimal confidence distribution density.

<text>Ville Hermanni Valo (; born 22 November 1976) is a Finnish singer, songwriter and musician. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the gothic rock band HIM.

Born and raised in Helsinki to a Hungarian mother and Finnish father, Valo began his career playing bass and drums in various bands around the city. In 1991, he co-founded and became the lead singer and main songwriter of HIM, which would go on to become one of the most successful Finnish bands of all time and the first to receive a gold record in the United States. Outside of HIM, Valo has collaborated with various other bands and artists during his career, including Agents, The 69 Eyes, and Apocalyptica. In 2020, Valo embarked on a solo career under the moniker VV. His debut album &quot;Neon Noir&quot; was released in 2023.

He is also the creator of the heartagram, HIM&#x27;s trademarked symbol, which has achieved great popularity outside of the band&#x27;s fanbase. Valo has received several accolades in the music industry and has been regarded as a sex symbol by several publications.

== Early life ==
Ville Hermanni Valo was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 22 November 1976, the son of a Hungarian mother and a Finnish father. His mother Anita worked as a shoe saleswoman and later for the city of Helsinki. His father Kari worked as a taxi driver, before opening a sex shop, where Valo would later work as a teenager. Valo also has a younger brother Jesse, who, like his older brother, embarked on a music career, before turning to professional kickboxing. A few months after Valo was born, the family moved from Vallila to Oulunkylä, where later Valo attended comprehensive school. Valo&#x27;s earliest musical memories pertain to his father, who would often listen to Finnish folk artists such as Tuomari Nurmio and Tapio Rautavaara while driving his taxi. Valo&#x27;s mother also recounted how Rauli &quot;Badding&quot; Somerjoki&#x27;s &quot;Paratiisi&quot; was the only thing that would sooth Valo as an infant. At age eight, Valo bought the album &quot;Animalize&quot; by Kiss, which sparked his interest in music.

After second grade, Valo was accepted into music-oriented class, where he took up bass guitar, inspired by Gene Simmons of Kiss. During third grade, Valo befriended Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen, who played bass as well. Around fourth or fifth grade, Valo joined his first band B.L.O.O.D., which played its first and only show in front of Valo&#x27;s class. Afterwards Valo joined the Eloveena Boys, who performed a variety of U2 and Dire Straits covers at school dances. Valo also wrote his first song while in the band. During seventh grade, Valo met guitarist Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindström, with whom he joined Aurora, which featured Valo on drums. During lower secondary school, Valo attended the Helsinki Pop &amp; Jazz Conservatory, whilst playing bass and drums in various other bands as well. Afterwards he applied to the music-oriented Sibelius Upper Secondary School, but was rejected. Valo eventually dropped out of school altogether to concentrate on his music career. He was also allowed to skip Finland&#x27;s national military service due to his asthma.

== Career ==
=== HIM ===
In 1991, Valo and Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen formed His Infernal Majesty. However, the band broke up in 1993 when Mige began his national military service. His Infernal Majesty was reformed in 1995 by Valo and Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindstöm. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as adding keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana &quot;Pätkä&quot; Rantala, His Infernal Majesty, now simply called HIM, released its debut album &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen and keyboardist Juska Salminen, HIM released &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, which reached the number one in Finland, Austria and Germany. After replacing Salminen with Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen, the band released &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; (2001) and &quot;Love Metal&quot; (2003), which continued to further HIM&#x27;s success across Europe. The albums also paved the way for HIM&#x27;s first tours in the United Kingdom and the United States.

In 2005, HIM released &quot;Dark Light&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date. It also gave HIM the distinction of being the first Finnish group in history to receive a gold record in the United States. &quot;Dark Light&quot; was followed up by 2007&#x27;s &quot;Venus Doom&quot;. While not as successful as its predecessor, it gave HIM its highest chart position in the United States and garnered the band its first and only Grammy nomination. After 2010&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, HIM entered an extended hiatus after Gas Lipstick was forced to take medical leave. Following several months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and released &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; in 2013. Gas Lipstick later announced his departure from the band in 2015. He was replaced by Jukka &quot;Kosmo&quot; Kröger. Preliminary work on another album was started, but the band ultimately felt like &quot;there was nothing left to give collectively&quot;. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced that the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour. HIM played its final show on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2017 as a part of its annual Helldone Festival.

=== Collaborations and solo career ===
Over the course of his career, Valo has contributed to numerous releases by other artists, including The 69 Eyes, Anathema, Andy McCoy, Bloodhound Gang, Cradle of Filth, Jeff Walker, Lullacry, MGT, The Mission and Tehosekoitin. Valo was also a member of Daniel Lioneye, a side project formed by Valo and fellow HIM members Linde Lindström and Mige. Valo played drums on the group&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;The King of Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, and its accompanying tour. In 2014, the band&#x27;s original line-up reunited at the Helldone Festival.
In 1999, Valo appeared as guest vocalist on the television show &quot;Laulava sydän&quot;, where he performed three songs with Finnish schlager group Agents. In 2004, Apocalyptica released &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, which featured guest vocals by Valo and Lauri Ylönen of The Rasmus. The song reached number one in Finland, while also cracking the top ten in Germany and Switzerland. Valo and Ylönen performed the song with Apocalyptica live for the first and only time in January 2005 at the Yhteinen ASIA benefit concert for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In 2006, Valo contributed vocals to the compilation album &quot;Synkkien laulujen maa&quot;. He performed the tracks &quot;Kun minä kotoani läksin&quot; and &quot;Täällä Pohjantähden alla&quot;, the latter of which was a duet with famed Finnish singer Kari Tapio. Valo later described recording the song with Tapio as one of the greatest experiences of his musical career. In 2007, Valo and German actress-singer Natalia Avelon recorded a cover version of Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s &quot;Summer Wine&quot; for the film &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;. The song charted at number one in Finland and Greece, as well as number two in Germany and Switzerland. It would later be certified platinum in Finland and Germany.

At 2014 edition of Helldone, Valo made his solo live debut, when he performed a set of songs under the pseudonym Rambo Rimbaud. In 2016, Valo released a cover version of &quot;Olet mun kaikuluotain&quot; (a Finnish version of John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Love Records. The single reached number one on the Finnish Digital Song Sales Chart. A music video, directed by Ykä Järvinen, was also produced. It would later receive the award for Video of the Year at the 2016 Emma Gala. In 2017, Valo provided the soundtrack for the virtual reality video game &quot;Downward Spiral: Prologue&quot; by 3rd Eye Studios. He would go on to score the 2018 sequel &quot;Downward Spiral: Horus Station&quot; as well.

In August 2018, it was announced that Valo would be reuniting with Agents to record songs (including previously unreleased ones) by late Finnish singer-songwriter Rauli &quot;Badding&quot; Somerjoki. Valo described the project as a huge honour, having been a fan of Somerjoki and Agents since childhood. Ville Valo &amp; Agents made their live debut at the 2018 Emma Gala. Their self-titled album was released on 15 February 2019, and it debuted at number one on the Finnish Albums Chart, going gold in less than a week. The group then began a tour of Finland, which concluded in August 2019, a year after the project&#x27;s initial announcement. According to Valo, the partnership was always intended to remain &quot;short but sweet&quot;, thus he and Agents parted ways after the tour. Their collaboration would go on to receive three Emma Award nominations.

On 20 March 2020, Valo released the surprise EP &quot;Gothica Fennica Vol. 1&quot;, under the moniker VV. Two of its three tracks charted in Finland. In April 2022, Valo released &quot;Loveletting&quot;, the first single from his debut solo album &quot;Neon Noir&quot;, which was released on 13 January 2023. It charted in six countries, debuting at number one in Finland and number four in Germany. It would also go on to win in the rock category at the Emma Awards. In support of the album, Valo embarked on a world tour beginning in January 2023. His backing band consists of lead guitarist Mikko Virta, rhythm guitarist Sampo Sundström, bassist Juho Vehmanen and drummer Risto Rikala. In September, Valo embarked on a North American co-headlining tour with Black Veil Brides. They also collaborated on a cover of &quot;Temple of Love&quot; by The Sisters of Mercy, which was released in June. The &quot;Neon Noir&quot; supporting tour concluded at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 10 May 2024.

=== Other work ===
Valo has made various appearances in television and film. In 1998, he had a small role in the Ilppo Pohjola directed short film &quot;Asphalto&quot;. In 2008, Valo voiced Moto Moto in the Finnish dub of &quot;&quot;. Valo has also appeared in several projects by Bam Margera, including &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; and &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. While he has received offers for several small acting roles, Valo has maintained that he is not an actor, jokingly stating in 2013: &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that [HIM needs] to sell about 80 million copies more for me to become an actor, a painter, an opera singer or a TV personality.&quot;

In 2005, Valo designed a limited line of Coca-Cola Light cans with the proceeds going to the Red Cross. In 2020, Valo was named the new face of Presidentti coffee by Paulig.

== Personal life ==
Valo resides in Helsinki, Finland. In 2006, Valo purchased a 19th-century tower house in Munkkiniemi, where he lived until 2015, when it was put up for sale.

Valo dated Finnish television host and model Jonna Nygrén in the early 2000s. They became engaged in 2005, but separated the following year. They briefly reunited in mid-2006, before breaking up again in 2007. Valo was then involved in a relationship with an undisclosed partner, who served as his main source of inspiration for HIM&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice&quot;. In 2012, Valo was linked to French model Sandra Mittica. They reportedly ended their relationship in 2015. Since 2016, Valo has been in a relationship with Finnish model Christel Karhu. The two made their first public appearance together in February 2017.

Valo has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager. In 2017, he described his diet as &quot;almost vegan&quot;.

In 2004, Valo was invited to the Presidential Independence Day reception at Finland&#x27;s presidential palace, but was unable to attend due to a fever. He attended later in 2006.

=== Substance abuse and legal issues ===
Valo has asserted his disinterest in narcotics, citing cigarettes and alcohol as his only two vices. In 2000, an intoxicated Valo nearly jumped off the thirteenth floor of a hotel in Germany, before being pulled back by friends. In November 2004, the &quot;New York Post&quot; ran an article where Valo was accused of performing drunk at HIM&#x27;s Irving Plaza concert. Valo reportedly threw half empty beer cans across the stage in addition to slurring his words and forgetting the lyrics to songs. In 2005, Valo&#x27;s drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards, and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was arrested at his home in Helsinki after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. He later elaborated on the incident, stating: &quot;It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée. And I got pissed off, I went to his door, I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that&#x27;s the whole thing.&quot;

During the making of HIM&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Venus Doom&quot;, Valo&#x27;s alcohol abuse worsened to the point where he was vomiting and defecating blood. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite a momentary recovery, Valo began drinking again during the mixing process. Eventually he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by HIM&#x27;s manager Seppo Vesterinen. Valo later cited depression and stress as contributing factors to his alcohol abuse at the time. On HIM&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice&quot;, Valo worked completely sober for the first time in the band&#x27;s history. He has since relapsed though he has maintained an effort to balance his drinking. In 2013, Valo stated: &quot;I&#x27;m an on and off guy. If I drink, I drink properly for long stretches of time. And if I don&#x27;t drink, I don&#x27;t drink at all.&quot; In 2017, Valo stated that he consumes alcohol only once a month. By 2023, Valo had quit drinking and smoking. However, he has refrained from calling himself a teetotaler, stating: &quot;I never say never. I have a habit if I forbid something, I want it twice as bad.&quot;

==Artistry and influences==

As a songwriter, many of Valo&#x27;s songs tackle themes of love. He has stated: &quot;I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It&#x27;s the only thing that moves me.&quot; Valo also takes inspiration from literature, but only certain aspects of it, explaining: &quot;As a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don&#x27;t necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive.&quot; Valo&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;oozing with blood-dripping hearts and gothic melodrama&quot;. Valo and the rest of HIM referred to the band&#x27;s music as &quot;love metal&quot;, the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements with heavier influences. He has described HIM&#x27;s music as &quot;sentimental, hard-hitting rock&quot;. Valo&#x27;s musical influences include Black Sabbath, Type O Negative, Neil Young, The Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, Elvis Presley, Rauli &quot;Badding&quot; Somerjoki, and Tapio Rautavaara. Some of his non-musical influences include Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Timo K. Mukka, Charles Baudelaire, Charles Bukowski, Austin Osman Spare, Maya Deren, and Shigeo Fukuda.

Much of HIM&#x27;s success has been attributed to Valo&#x27;s songwriting ability, public image, and charisma. He has a baritone voice. In 2006, he was ranked number 80 in &quot;Hit Parader&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked Valo as the 14th greatest metal frontman of the 21st century, stating: &quot;His baritone voice is undeniably gorgeous, his vampiric charisma is almost hypnotic, male fans desperately attempt to emulate him and female fans scream ballistically as if he was the second coming of Elvis.&quot; &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; described Valo as one of the early 2000s few new rockstars, stating: &quot;HIM were like no other band. They had a special something, but more importantly they had a special someone. Ville shone like a star with his blend of Mick Jagger posturing and Brandon Lee&#x27;s dark charms in &quot;The Crow&quot;.&quot; Valo has been voted a sex symbol in polls conducted by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;MTV3&quot;. Regarding these accolades, Valo said: &quot;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know what a sex symbol is. Compliments are nice, but I&#x27;ve always liked compliments on the music more.&quot; When asked if it frustrates him as a songwriter and a musician, Valo stated that ultimately &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;. He compared the situation to Kiss, noting how the visuals and music are part of one whole.

On his twentieth birthday, Valo created the heartagram, which would eventually become the symbol for HIM. A combination of a heart and a pentagram, it is meant to represent the juxtaposition of &quot;the soft and the hard, the male and the female, the yin and the yang&quot;. Musically, the heart represents the softer side of HIM, while the pentagram conveys the heavier elements of its sound. Valo has called the heartagram his greatest creation. He noted in 2013: &quot;There are a lot of people who have heartagram tattoos now. Kat Von D has one, Steve-O has a dickagram, which is like a heartagram but ends with a dick. It&#x27;s started to have a life of its own: there are a lot of people who have them who don&#x27;t actually know what it was, don&#x27;t relate it to the band, and in that sense, I consider that to be my greatest achievement. So it&#x27;ll be nice to have it on my tombstone. And it&#x27;ll be nice to see where it&#x27;s going to go next.&quot; During his solo career, Valo has used a variation of the heartagram with two extra lines forming the moniker VV. Regarding the symbol, Valo jokingly stated: &quot;Artistically speaking the main difference between HIM and VV is the extra line in the heartagram, but what an exquisite line it is!&quot;

<doc id="157059" wikidata="Q201984" url="?curid=157059" title="Covariance">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.

The sign of the covariance, therefore, shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. If greater values of one variable mainly correspond with greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for lesser values (that is, the variables tend to show similar behavior), the covariance is positive. In the opposite case, when greater values of one variable mainly correspond to lesser values of the other (that is, the variables tend to show opposite behavior), the covariance is negative. The magnitude of the covariance is the geometric mean of the variances that are in common for the two random variables. The correlation coefficient normalizes the covariance by dividing by the geometric mean of the total variances for the two random variables.

A distinction must be made between (1) the covariance of two random variables, which is a population parameter that can be seen as a property of the joint probability distribution, and (2) the sample covariance, which in addition to serving as a descriptor of the sample, also serves as an estimated value of the population parameter.

== Definition ==
For two jointly distributed real-valued random variables formula_1 and formula_2 with finite second moments, the covariance is defined as the expected value (or mean) of the product of their deviations from their individual expected values:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the expected value of formula_1, also known as the mean of formula_1. The covariance is also sometimes denoted formula_7 or formula_8, in analogy to variance. By using the linearity property of expectations, this can be simplified to the expected value of their product minus the product of their expected values:
formula_9
but this equation is susceptible to catastrophic cancellation (see the section on numerical computation below).

The units of measurement of the covariance formula_10 are those of formula_1 times those of formula_2. By contrast, correlation coefficients, which depend on the covariance, are a dimensionless measure of linear dependence. (In fact, correlation coefficients can simply be understood as a normalized version of covariance.)

===Complex random variables===
The covariance between two complex random variables formula_13 is defined as
formula_14

Notice the complex conjugation of the second factor in the definition.

A related &quot;pseudo-covariance&quot; can also be defined.

===Discrete random variables===
If the (real) random variable pair formula_15 can take on the values formula_16 for formula_17, with equal probabilities formula_18, then the covariance can be equivalently written in terms of the means formula_4 and formula_20 as
formula_21

It can also be equivalently expressed, without directly referring to the means, as
formula_22

More generally, if there are formula_23 possible realizations of formula_15, namely formula_16 but with possibly unequal probabilities formula_26 for formula_17, then the covariance is
formula_28

In the case where two discrete random variables formula_1 and formula_2 have a joint probability distribution, represented by elements formula_31 corresponding to the joint probabilities of formula_32, the covariance is calculated using a double summation over the indices of the matrix:

formula_33

==Examples==
Consider three independent random variables formula_34 and two constants formula_35.
formula_36
In the special case, formula_37 and formula_38, the covariance between formula_1 and formula_2 is just the variance of formula_41 and the name covariance is entirely appropriate.
Suppose that formula_1 and formula_2 have the following joint probability mass function, in which the six central cells give the discrete joint probabilities formula_44 of the six hypothetical realizations 

formula_1 can take on three values (5, 6 and 7) while formula_2 can take on two (8 and 9). Their means are formula_47 and formula_48. Then,
formula_49

== Properties ==
===Covariance with itself===
The variance is a special case of the covariance in which the two variables are identical:
formula_50

===Covariance of linear combinations===
If formula_1, formula_2, formula_53, and formula_54 are real-valued random variables and formula_55 are real-valued constants, then the following facts are a consequence of the definition of covariance:
formula_56

For a sequence formula_57 of random variables in real-valued, and constants formula_58, we have
formula_59

===Hoeffding&#x27;s covariance identity===
A useful identity to compute the covariance between two random variables formula_60 is the Hoeffding&#x27;s covariance identity:
formula_61
where formula_62 is the joint cumulative distribution function of the random vector formula_63 and formula_64 are the marginals.

===Uncorrelatedness and independence===

Random variables whose covariance is zero are called uncorrelated. Similarly, the components of random vectors whose covariance matrix is zero in every entry outside the main diagonal are also called uncorrelated.

If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent random variables, then their covariance is zero. This follows because under independence,
formula_67

The converse, however, is not generally true. For example, let formula_1 be uniformly distributed in formula_69 and let formula_70. Clearly, formula_1 and formula_2 are not independent, but
formula_73

In this case, the relationship between formula_2 and formula_1 is non-linear, while correlation and covariance are measures of linear dependence between two random variables. This example shows that if two random variables are uncorrelated, that does not in general imply that they are independent. However, if two variables are jointly normally distributed (but not if they are merely individually normally distributed), uncorrelatedness &quot;does&quot; imply independence.

formula_1 and formula_2 whose covariance is positive are called positively correlated, which implies if formula_78 then likely formula_79. Conversely, formula_1 and formula_2 with negative covariance are negatively correlated, and if formula_78 then likely formula_83.

=== Relationship to inner products ===
Many of the properties of covariance can be extracted elegantly by observing that it satisfies similar properties to those of an inner product:
# bilinear: for constants formula_84 and formula_85 and random variables formula_86 formula_87
# symmetric: formula_88
# positive semi-definite: formula_89 for all random variables formula_1, and formula_91 implies that formula_1 is constant almost surely.

In fact these properties imply that the covariance defines an inner product over the quotient vector space obtained by taking the subspace of random variables with finite second moment and identifying any two that differ by a constant. (This identification turns the positive semi-definiteness above into positive definiteness.) That quotient vector space is isomorphic to the subspace of random variables with finite second moment and mean zero; on that subspace, the covariance is exactly the L2 inner product of real-valued functions on the sample space.

As a result, for random variables with finite variance, the inequality
formula_93
holds via the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

Proof: If formula_94, then it holds trivially. Otherwise, let random variable
formula_95

Then we have
formula_96

== Calculating the sample covariance ==
The sample covariances among formula_97 variables based on formula_98 observations of each, drawn from an otherwise unobserved population, are given by the formula_99 matrix formula_100 with the entries

:formula_101

which is an estimate of the covariance between variable formula_102 and variable formula_103.

The sample mean and the sample covariance matrix are unbiased estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix of the random vector formula_104, a vector whose &quot;j&quot;th element formula_105 is one of the random variables. The reason the sample covariance matrix has formula_106 in the denominator rather than formula_107 is essentially that the population mean formula_108 is not known and is replaced by the sample mean formula_109. If the population mean formula_108 is known, the analogous unbiased estimate is given by

: formula_111.

== Generalizations ==
=== Auto-covariance matrix of real random vectors ===
For a vector formula_112 of formula_113 jointly distributed random variables with finite second moments, its auto-covariance matrix (also known as the variance–covariance matrix or simply the covariance matrix) formula_114 (also denoted by formula_115 or formula_116) is defined as
formula_117

Let formula_118 be a random vector with covariance matrix , and let be a matrix that can act on formula_118 on the left. The covariance matrix of the matrix-vector product is:
formula_120

This is a direct result of the linearity of expectation and is useful
when applying a linear transformation, such as a whitening transformation, to a vector.

=== Cross-covariance matrix of real random vectors ===
For real random vectors formula_121 and formula_122, the formula_123 cross-covariance matrix is equal to
|cellpadding = 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour = #F5FFFA}}

where formula_124 is the transpose of the vector (or matrix) formula_125.

The formula_126-th element of this matrix is equal to the covariance formula_127 between the -th scalar component of formula_118 and the -th scalar component of formula_125. In particular, formula_130 is the transpose of formula_131.

=== Cross-covariance sesquilinear form of random vectors in a real or complex Hilbert space===
More generally let formula_132 and formula_133, be Hilbert spaces over formula_134 or formula_135 with formula_136 anti linear in the first variable, and let formula_137 be formula_138 resp. formula_139 valued random variables. 
Then the covariance of formula_118 and formula_125 is the sesquilinear form on formula_142 
(anti linear in the first variable) given by
formula_143

== Numerical computation ==

When formula_144, the equation formula_145 is prone to catastrophic cancellation if formula_146 and formula_147 are not computed exactly and thus should be avoided in computer programs when the data has not been centered before. Numerically stable algorithms should be preferred in this case.

== Comments ==
The covariance is sometimes called a measure of &quot;linear dependence&quot; between the two random variables. That does not mean the same thing as in the context of linear algebra (see linear dependence). When the covariance is normalized, one obtains the Pearson correlation coefficient, which gives the goodness of the fit for the best possible linear function describing the relation between the variables. In this sense covariance is a linear gauge of dependence.

==Applications==

=== In genetics and molecular biology ===
Covariance is an important measure in biology. Certain sequences of DNA are conserved more than others among species, and thus to study secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, or of RNA structures, sequences are compared in closely related species. If sequence changes are found or no changes at all are found in noncoding RNA (such as microRNA), sequences are found to be necessary for common structural motifs, such as an RNA loop. In genetics, covariance serves a basis for computation of Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM) (aka kinship matrix), enabling inference on population structure from sample with no known close relatives as well as inference on estimation of heritability of complex traits.

In the theory of evolution and natural selection, the price equation describes how a genetic trait changes in frequency over time. The equation uses a covariance between a trait and fitness, to give a mathematical description of evolution and natural selection. It provides a way to understand the effects that gene transmission and natural selection have on the proportion of genes within each new generation of a population.

===In financial economics===

Covariances play a key role in financial economics, especially in modern portfolio theory and in the capital asset pricing model. Covariances among various assets&#x27; returns are used to determine, under certain assumptions, the relative amounts of different assets that investors should (in a normative analysis) or are predicted to (in a positive analysis) choose to hold in a context of diversification.

===In meteorological and oceanographic data assimilation===
The covariance matrix is important in estimating the initial conditions required for running weather forecast models, a procedure known as data assimilation. The &#x27;forecast error covariance matrix&#x27; is typically constructed between perturbations around a mean state (either a climatological or ensemble mean). The &#x27;observation error covariance matrix&#x27; is constructed to represent the magnitude of combined observational errors (on the diagonal) and the correlated errors between measurements (off the diagonal). This is an example of its widespread application to Kalman filtering and more general state estimation for time-varying systems.

===In micrometeorology ===
The eddy covariance technique is a key atmospherics measurement technique where the covariance between instantaneous deviation in vertical wind speed from the mean value and instantaneous deviation in gas concentration is the basis for calculating the vertical turbulent fluxes.

===In signal processing===
The covariance matrix is used to capture the spectral variability of a signal.

===In statistics and image processing ===
The covariance matrix is used in principal component analysis to reduce feature dimensionality in data preprocessing.

<text>The Battle of the Dunes (, ), also known as the Battle of Dunkirk, took place on 14 June 1658, near the strategic port of Dunkirk in what was then the Spanish Netherlands. Part of the Franco-Spanish War and concurrent Anglo-Spanish War, a French army under Turenne, supported by troops from the Commonwealth of England, had besieged Dunkirk. Led by John of Austria the Younger and Louis, Grand Condé, a Spanish force supported by English Royalists and French Fronde rebels attempted to raise the siege but suffered a severe defeat.

Despite this victory, both the French and Spanish were financially exhausted by the long running war and negotiated the Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659. England retained possession of Dunkirk until 1662 when the port was sold to France by Charles II.

A complex political situation resulted in both French and English forces fighting for both sides. When the government of Louis XIV formed an alliance with Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, the exiled Charles II of England allied himself with Philip IV of Spain. Charles set up his headquarters in Bruges and established his Royalist Army in Exile. The Spanish supplied only enough money to form five regiments. This was a disappointment for the Royalists, who had hoped to be able to form an army large enough to contemplate an invasion of the English Commonwealth. A renewal of a 1657 treaty between Cromwell and Louis XIV provided 6,000 Commonwealth infantry and a fleet to aid Turenne. Along with English forces, French forces fought on both sides with Condé, a French Prince of the blood, leading a contingent of French rebels of the Fronde.

The 15,000 French supported by 6,000 troops from the English Commonwealth besieged Dunkirk. Dunkirk was Spain&#x27;s greatest base for privateers, and these privateers had wreaked havoc on English merchant shipping. It was defended by a garrison of about 3,000 in May 1658, while an English fleet of 18 ships, under Edward Mountagu, blockaded the port and prevented any reinforcement or supply by sea. The Spanish and their allies were caught by surprise as they were convinced that Turenne would attack Cambrai, while they thought Dunkirk was merely a diversion, and they responded belatedly and hastily. The approach to Dunkirk was made difficult as the inhabitants had opened the sluices and flooded the area, but Turenne persisted and opened the trenches on the night of 4/5 June.

A Spanish army under the command of Don John of Austria, consisting of about 15,000 men, moved to raise the siege. It was divided in 2 corps, the Spanish Army of Flanders on the right and centre and the small corps of French rebels, of the Fronde, on the left under the command of Condé. The Spanish army included Spanish, German and Walloon troops, and a force of 2,000 English/Irish Royalists – formed as the nucleus of potential army for the invasion of England by Charles II, with Charles&#x27; brother James, Duke of York, amongst its commanders – was sent to relieve the town.

Leaving some 6,000 men to continue the siege, Turenne advanced to meet the Spanish army. The battle on 14 June 1658 which resulted from this manoeuvre became known as the &quot;Battle of the Dunes&quot; because the Spanish army formed their line upon a line of dunes, or sand-hills, also called the Downs, perpendicular to the sea. Napoleon described the battle as Turenne&#x27;s &quot;... most brilliant action&quot;. The red-coats of the New Model Army under the leadership of Sir William Lockhart, Cromwell&#x27;s ambassador at Paris in Turenne&#x27;s army, astonished both armies by the stubborn fierceness of their assault up a sand-hill high and strongly defended by Spanish veterans.

==Battle==
The Spanish army approached and camped upon a line of dunes north-east of Dunkirk. Turenne seized the initiative and marched out to meet the Spanish and attack them the following day. The French army of some 6,000 foot and 8,000 horse and 10 cannon were deployed with their left on the sea and their right on the canal. Turenne, before low tide, deployed his French-English force in two lines with cavalry on each flank. With the left flank cavalry on the beach, 40 squadrons strong, Turenne planned to take advantage of the turning tide going out to expose the Spanish right to his cavalry. Turenne placed 5 cannon on the right wing between the downs and the meadow and 5 cannon on the left along the strand. Cromwell&#x27;s English, under the command of Major General Thomas Morgan and William Lockhart, were lined up against the Spanish troops while the centre was the French infantry consisting of the Guards, the Swiss and the regiments of Picardy and Turenne facing the Wallons and Germans. The right flank French cavalry under the Duke de Crequi opposed Condé.
The Spanish army with 6,000 foot and 9,000 horse formed up with its right on the sea across the sand-hills to the canal of Furnes on their left. The regular Spanish infantry tercios were on the right under the command of Don Juan, the English Royalist regiments under the Duke of York were on their left to the right centre, the Walloon and German tercios were in the centre and on the left were the French rebel Frondeurs and some other troops. The Spanish cavalry was drawn up in line behind the infantry. In their rush to relieve Dunkirk the Spanish had left their artillery behind.

Turenne began the battle with four or five artillery salvoes from his two unopposed batteries, and the Spanish right flank was bombarded with some harassing fire from several frigates and sloops of the English fleet. The Anglo-French army began to advance, and the Cromwellian English pressed quickly ahead against the Spanish tercio of Don Caspar Boniface deployed on a sand dune that was somewhat in advance of the rest of their army. The English charged and crossed pikes with the Spanish tercio, driving it down the hill, and, by following up, the English formation became exposed. James, Duke of York, led two cavalry charges against the Cromwellian troops&#x27; flank, driving into the musketeers. Some Spanish cavalry from their reserve was sent forward and threatened the English but were defeated in turn by the French cavalry under Marquis de Castelneau. The French infantry consisting of the Guards, the Swiss and the regiments of Picardy and Turenne advanced on the Spanish centre, meeting little resistance. Marshal Turenne took advantage of the receding tide to concentrate most of his cavalry on his left, and its advance enveloped the Spanish right wing.
Condé on the Spanish left held off the initial attacks of the French right wing and even counterattacked them, getting unhorsed and nearly captured, but in the end he was also forced from the field. The German and Walloons of the centre retired at the onset of the French infantry, throwing the Spanish cavalry in the reserve into disorder so that it was carried away in the flight.

The battle lasted for about two hours, and by noon Turenne had a complete victory that ended with the rout of the Spanish forces. The Spanish lost about 1,200 killed, 3,000 wounded and some 5,000 captured while the French lost only about 400, about half of them English. Amongst the Cromwellian troops Lockhart&#x27;s regiment of foot bore the brunt of the fighting. Its lieutenant-colonel, Roger Fenwick, and two of its captains were killed, and nearly all the rest of its officers were wounded, and lost about forty or fifty other ranks killed in battle. Lillingston&#x27;s lost a captain and thirty or forty killed in battle, while the other regiments suffered only slight losses (the number of English dead rose because like Fenwick they died of wounds over the next few weeks). The French pursuit lasted until nightfall. One force of English Royalist guards held out, surrendering only when they were assured they would be allowed to rejoin Charles II at Ypres. The Duke of York&#x27;s troop of guards, which charged several times with the Duke himself at its head, suffered severely, but also remained fit for further service. The King&#x27;s forces after the battle numbered less than a thousand men, probably not more than seven or eight hundred. The French corps of Frondeurs on the left under the command of Condé retreated in good order.

==Aftermath==
Following his victory, Turenne took Dunkirk and advanced, capturing a series of towns and fortresses including Furnes, Dixmunde, Gravelines, Ypres and Oudenarde. The victory at the Battle of the Dunes and its consequences would lead to the end of ten years of war with the signing of Treaty of the Pyrenees. By this treaty France gained Roussillon and Perpignan, Thionville, Montmédy and other parts of Luxembourg, Artois and towns in Flanders, including Arras, Béthune and Gravelines, and a new border with Spain was fixed at the Pyrenees. The 1659 treaty also required the Spanish king to recognise and confirm all French gains in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.

The defeat of the Spanish relief force and the taking of Dunkirk ended the immediate prospect of a Royalist expedition to England. Dunkirk surrendered to French forces ten days after the battle on 24 June, and Cardinal Mazarin honoured the terms of the treaty with Oliver Cromwell and handed the port over to the Commonwealth. The campaign of the English contingent in Flanders did not end with the battle of the Dunes and the capture of Dunkirk. Part of the English contingent was left to garrison Dunkirk and Mardyke under the command of Sir William Lockhart, while the rest, under Sir Thomas Morgan, continued to serve with Turenne&#x27;s army in the field.

While the French received all of Artois, England had eliminated the greatest Spanish privateering base with the result that merchant shipping losses were much reduced. Cromwell died two months after the battle and was succeeded by his son&#x27;s protectorship, which ended nine months later, and the Commonwealth fell into confusion, whereupon Charles II returned to the throne in May 1660. Charles would sell Dunkirk back to the French in 1662 for £320,000.

==British involvement==
The Grenadier Guards can trace their origins back to Lord Wentworth&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Guards which was one of five regiments raised in 1656. The Life Guards can trace their origins back to two cavalry troops raised at this time &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Own Troop of Horse Guards&quot; and &quot;The Duke of York&#x27;s Troop of Horse Guards&quot;. In the Spanish army, the English/Irish royalists consisted of three battalions made up of five understrength regiments: The first battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Blague, of &quot;Lord Bristol&#x27;s&quot; regiment combined with &quot;Lord Wentworth&#x27;s&quot; regiment (also known as King Charles II&#x27;s footguards). The second battalion was command by Lord Muskerry and consisted of the &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s&quot; regiment. The third consisted of &quot;Lord Ormond&#x27;s&quot; regiment of Irish commanded by Colonel Richard Grace, and &quot;Lord Newburgh&#x27;s&quot; regiment of Scots under the command of Sir William Urry. English regiments were named after their colonels. In the French army the New Model Army on the left (by the coast): &quot;Cochrane&quot;, &quot;Alsop&quot;, &quot;Lillingston&quot; and &quot;Morgan&quot;, on the right 200 &quot;Montgommery&quot; musketeers. Cavalry: &quot;Lockhart&quot;, &quot;Gibbons&quot; and &quot;Salmo&quot; Two out of the three royalist battalions, Bristol&#x27;s and York&#x27;s Irish, broke and fled.

<doc id="157069" wikidata="Q267722" url="?curid=157069" title="Image map">
<text>In HTML and XHTML, an image map is a list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to different destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination). For example, a map of the world may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. The intention of an image map is to provide an easy way of linking various parts of an image without dividing the image into separate image files.

==Server-side==
Server-side image maps were first supported in Mosaic (web browser) version 1.1. Server-side image maps enable the web browser to send positional information to the server about where the user clicks within an image. This allows the server to make pixel-by-pixel decisions about what content to return in response (possible methods are to use image mask layers, database queries, or configuration files on the server).

The HTML code for this type of server-side image map requires the codice_1 tag to be inside an anchor tag codice_2 and the codice_1 must include the codice_4 attribute.

&lt;a href=&quot;/imagemapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;image.png&quot; ismap /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

When the user clicks inside the image the browser will append the X and Y coordinates (relative to the upper-left corner of the image) to the anchor URL as a query string and will access the resulting URL (for example, codice_5).

If the browser does not support codice_4 then the query string must not be added to the anchor URL and the server should respond appropriately (for example, by returning a text-only navigation page).

==Client-side==
Client-side image maps were introduced in HTML 3.2, and do not require any special logic to be executed on the server (they are fully client-side). They also do not require any JavaScript.

===Pure HTML===
A client-side imagemap in HTML consists of two parts:
# the actual image, which is embedded with the codice_1 tag. The image tag must have an attribute &quot;usemap,&quot; which names the imagemap to use for this image (multiple imagemaps may exist on a single page).
# A codice_8 element, and inside that, codice_9 elements, each of which defines a single clickable area within the imagemap. These are similar to the codice_10 defining which URL should be opened for an ordinary web link. A codice_11 attribute may be provided, which may be rendered as a tooltip if a desktop user hovers their mouse pointer over the area. For web accessibility reasons, it is often important – and in some cases it may even be a legal or contractual requirement – to provide an codice_12 attribute describing the link that screen reader software can read to, for example, blind users.

The codice_9 elements can be rectangles (codice_14), polygons (codice_15) or circles (codice_16).
Shape-Values are coordinate-pairs. Every pair has an X and a Y value (from left/top of an image) and is separated with a comma.

* Rectangle: Set four coordinates: &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot;
* Polygon: Set as many coordinates as desired (a multiple of two): &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2, [...] xn,yn&quot;
* Circle: One coordinate-pair and another value with a radius: &quot;x1,y1,radius&quot;

The following example defines a rectangular area (&quot;9,372,66,397&quot;). When a user clicks anywhere inside this area, they are taken to the English Wikipedia&#x27;s home page.

&lt;img src=&quot;image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Website map&quot; usemap=&quot;#mapname&quot; /&gt;
&lt;map name=&quot;mapname&quot;&gt;
 &lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; coords=&quot;9,372,66,397&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/&quot; alt=&quot;Wikipedia&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
===CSS===
A more recent approach is to overlay links on an image using CSS absolute positioning; however, this only supports rectangular clickable areas. This CSS technique may be suitable for making an image map work properly on iPhones, which can fail to rescale pure HTML image maps correctly.

==Creation and use==

It is possible to create client-side image maps by hand using a text editor, but doing so requires web designers to know how to code HTML as well as how to enumerate the coordinates of the areas they wish to place over the image. As a result, most image maps coded by hand are simple polygons.

Because creating image maps in a text editor requires much time and effort, many applications have been designed to allow web designers to create image maps quickly and easily, much as they would create shapes in a vector graphics editor. Examples of these applications are Adobe&#x27;s Dreamweaver or KImageMapEditor (for KDE), and the imagemap plugin found in GIMP. The free and open-source office suite LibreOffice also includes a dedicated ImageMap editor.

Image maps which do not make their clickable areas obvious risk subjecting the user to mystery meat navigation. Even when they do, where they lead may not be obvious. This can be partially remedied with rollover effects.

==SVG images==
Because the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image format provides its own mechanisms for adding hyperlinks and other, more sophisticated forms of interactivity to images, traditional image map techniques are generally not necessary when working with vector images in the SVG format.

<doc id="157081" wikidata="Q913604" url="?curid=157081" title="Battle of the Alma">
<text>The Battle of the Alma (short for Battle of the Alma River) took place during the Crimean War between an allied expeditionary force (made up of French, British, and Ottoman forces) and Russian forces defending the Crimean Peninsula on 20September 1854. The allies had made a surprise landing in Crimea on 14September. The allied commanders, Maréchal Jacques Leroy de Saint-Arnaud and Lord Raglan, then marched toward the strategically important port city of Sevastopol, away. Russian commander Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov rushed his available forces to the last natural defensive position before the city, the Alma Heights, south of the Alma River.

The allies made a series of disjointed attacks. The French turned the Russian left flank with an attack up cliffs that the Russians had considered unscalable. The British initially waited to see the outcome of the French attack, then twice unsuccessfully assaulted the Russians&#x27; main position on their right. Eventually, superior British rifle fire forced the Russians to retreat. With both flanks turned, the Russian position collapsed and they fled. The lack of cavalry meant that little pursuit occurred.

The battle cost the French roughly 1,600 casualties, the British 2,000, the Ottomans 503, and the Russians some 5,000.

==Background==
The allied fleet of 400 ships left the Ottoman port of Varna on 7September 1854 with no clear objective or specified landing point. The allies had been planning to capture Sevastopol in a &quot;coup de main&quot;, but decided instead to sail to Evpatoria, which a landing party captured on 13September. Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov, commander of Russian forces in the Crimea, was taken by surprise. He had not thought the allies would attack so close to the onset of winter, and had failed to mobilize sufficient troops to defend Crimea. He had only 38,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors along the southwestern coast, and 12,000 more around Kerch and Theodosia.

Allied forces reached Kalamita Bay on the western coast of the Crimea, north of Sevastopol, and started disembarking on 14September. The French disembarked first, and by nightfall, Général François Canrobert&#x27;s 1st Division, Général Pierre François Bosquet&#x27;s 2nd Division and Prince Napoleon&#x27;s 3rd Division were ashore with their artillery. The British landing took much longer to complete compared to the French, as the infantry was landed first, when the sea was calm, but by the time the British tried to get their cavalry ashore, the wind was up and the horses struggled in the heavy surf.

The Ottoman forces sent to Alma consisted of the 3rd Brigade commanded by Major General (&quot;Amirliwa&quot;) Suleiman Pasha Al Arnauti, the 3rd Brigade was made up of the 13th Infantry Regiment (commanded by Brigadier Mustafa Bek) and 14th Infantry Regiment (commanded by Brigadier Ali Bek)

The British troops and cavalry took five days to disembark. Many of the men were sick with cholera and had to be carried off the boats. No facilities for moving equipment overland existed, so parties had to be sent out to steal carts and wagons from the local Tatar farms. The only food or water for the men was the three days&#x27; rations they had been given at Varna. No tents or kitbags were offloaded from the ships, so the soldiers spent their first nights without shelter, unprotected from the heavy rain or the blistering heat.

The British force comprised 26,000 infantry: the 1st Infantry Division under the Duke of Cambridge; the 2nd Infantry Division under Sir George de Lacy Evans; the 3rd Infantry Division under Sir Richard England; the 4th Infantry Division under Sir George Cathcart; and the Light Division under Sir George Brown. The British also had a 1,000-strong Cavalry Division under Lord Lucan); four batteries of Royal Artillery; and one troop of Royal Horse Artillery).

Despite the plans for a surprise attack on Sevastopol being undermined by the delays, six days later on 19September, the army finally started to head south, with its fleets supporting them. The French were on the right of the allied line near the shore, with the Turks following them, and the British were on the left further inland. The march involved crossing five rivers: the Bulganak, the Alma, Kacha, Belbek, and Chernaya. By midday, the allied army reached the Bulganak and had its first sight of the Russians when a Cossack vanguard opened fire on the 13th Light Dragoons&#x27; scouting party. As the Light Brigade prepared to charge the Cossacks, Lord Raglan sent an order for it to retreat when a large Russian infantry force was discovered in a dip in the terrain ahead. The next morning, the allied army marched down the valley to engage the Russians, whose forces were on the other side of the river, on the Alma heights.

At the Alma, Prince Menshikov, commander-in-chief of Russian forces in the Crimea, decided to make his stand on the high ground south of the river. Although the Russian Army was numerically inferior to the combined Franco-British force (35,000 Russian troops as opposed to 60,000 Anglo-French-Ottoman troops), the heights they occupied were a natural defensive position, indeed, the last natural barrier to the allied armies on their approach to Sevastopol. Furthermore, the Russians had more than one hundred field guns on the heights they could employ with devastating effect from the elevated position; however, none were on the cliffs facing the sea, which were considered too steep for the enemy to climb.

The allies bivouacked on the northern bank of the Bulganak, next day marching the to the north bank of the Alma, where the ground sloped gently down to the river. The precipitous cliffs running along the southern bank of the river were high and continued inland from the river&#x27;s mouth for almost two mi (3 km), where they met a less steep, but equally high hill known as Telegraph Hill across the river from the village of Bourliouk. To its east lay Kourgane Hill, a natural strongpoint with fields of fire covering most approaches, and the key to the whole position. Two redoubts had been constructed to protect Kourgane Hill from infantry assault; the lesser redoubt on the eastern slope and the greater redoubt on the west. The road to Sevastopol ran between Telegraph and Kourgane Hills, covered by Russian batteries located on the hills and in the narrow valley between them.

==Battle==
===The French attack on the Russian left flank===
By mid-morning, the allied army was assembling on the plain, the British on the left of the Sevastopol Road, the French and the Turks on the right, stretching out towards the coast. According to the plan that the allies had agreed upon the day before, the two armies were to advance simultaneously on a broad front and try to turn the enemy&#x27;s flank on the left further inland. At the final moment, Raglan decided to delay the British advance until the French had broken through on the right; the troops were ordered to lie on the ground, within range of the Russian guns, in a position from which they could scramble to the river when the time was right. They lay there from 13:15 to 14:45, losing men as the Russian gunners found their range.

While the British were holding their advance, on the far right, Bosquet&#x27;s 2nd Division arrived at the river&#x27;s mouth and encountered steep cliffs rising 50 m above the river. The Russians considered the cliffs so steep that they deemed it unnecessary to defend the position with artillery. Leaving their kitbags on the riverbank, the Zouaves at the division&#x27;s head started to swim across the river and rapidly climbed the cliffs using the trees to scale it. Once they had reached the plateau, they hid behind rocks and bushes to engage the defending forces of the Moscow Regiment and held the position until reinforcements could arrive. Following the Zouaves, more soldiers scaled the cliffs and carried 12 guns up a ravine. They arrived just in time to meet the extra infantry and artillery that Menshikov had transferred from the center in an attempt to organize the resistance and prevent the Russian Army from being outflanked on its left.

The Russian situation became hopeless. Before a counterattack could be made, the whole of Bosquet&#x27;s division and many of the Turks had reached the plateau. The Russians had more guns28 to the French 12, but the French guns were of larger caliber and longer range, and Bosquet&#x27;s riflemen kept the Russian gunners at a distance where only the heavier French guns could take effect. The guns of the allied fleet also started pounding the Russian positions on the cliffs, undermining the morale of their troops. By the time the first Russian battery of artillery arrived, it found the remnants of the Moscow Regiment already in retreat. Under heavy fire from the Zouaves, the Minsk Regiment also began to retreat.

===Attack at the greater redoubt===
In the meantime on Bousquet&#x27;s left, Canrobert&#x27;s 1st Division and to Canrobert&#x27;s left Prince Napoleon&#x27;s 3rd Division were unable to cross the river in the face of heavy fire coming from Telegraph Hill, and their advance stalled. Prince Napoleon sent word to Lieutenant-General George de Lacy Evans, 2nd Division&#x27;s commander on his left, calling on the British to advance and take some pressure off the French. Raglan was still waiting for the French attack to succeed before committing British troops, and at first told Evans not to take orders from the French, but under pressure from Evans, he relented. At 14:45, he commanded the British Light, 1st and 2nd Divisions to advance, although without further orders. The British army was arrayed in two lines; the first consisted of the Light Division on the left led by Sir George Brown and Lacy Evans&#x27; 2nd Division on the right. Behind them was a second line - the 1st Division under Duke of Cambridge, consisting of the Highland and the Guards Brigades, which were deployed to support the first line&#x27;s advance. The remaining British troops were held in reserve.

The Light Division had not extended itself far enough left and advanced at an angle. Soon, the troops on the right of the Light Division and the left of the 2nd Division began merging. The strategic formation of the British line was lost. Once they had crossed the river, all order was also lost. Companies and regiments became jumbled together, and where the lines had been two men deep, now just a crowd resulted. The Russians, seeing this, began to advance down the hill from either side of the great redoubt, firing on the British below. Mounted British officers galloped round their men, urging them to reform their lines, but were unsuccessful in persuading them to move from the shelter of the riverbank. Some sat down and took out their water cans; others began to eat. Aware of the danger of the situation and unable to reorganize, Major-general William John Codrington, commander of the Light Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade, ordered his troops to fix bayonets and advance.

The densely packed Codrington&#x27;s Brigade started to advance uphill in a thick crowd. Without time and unable to put the soldiers in formation, the officers gave up and urged them to charge toward the Russian guns in the redoubt. As Russian artillery opened fire, the British continued scrambling upward until some of the Light Division&#x27;s advanced guard tumbled over the walls of the greater redoubt. As the Russians were trying to redeploy their cannons, soldiers clambered over the parapets and through the embrasures, capturing two guns in the confusion. However, realizing their lack of reinforcements, and as the Vladimirsky Regiment poured into the redoubt from the open higher ground, British buglers sounded the withdraw order. Russian infantry charged with fixed bayonets, driving out the British and firing at them as they retreated down the hill.

===Retreat and second attack===
By now, the 1st Division had finally crossed the river and the Russians in the greater redoubt saw approaching them the Guards&#x27; Brigade, with the Grenadier Guards on the right, the Scots Fusilier Guards in the centre, and the Coldstream Guards on the left. Out of sight on the far left was the Highland Brigade, commanded by Sir Colin Campbell. Campbell was irritated by the Guards&#x27; delay and ordered an immediate advance. A firm believer in the charge with bayonets, Campbell told his men not to fire their rifles until they were &quot;within a yard of the Russians&quot;.

The Scots Fusiliers, by then ahead of the rest of the division, started to move uphill immediately, repeating the Light Division&#x27;s mistake, which at that moment was running down from the redoubt, pursued by Russian infantry. The Light Division crashed into the advancing Scots Fusiliers with such force that the line was broken in many places. The Scots faltered, but emerged on the other side with only half their numbers and continued towards the great redoubt in a chaotic state. When they were from the redoubt, the Russians mounted a massive volley. The Scots Fusiliers were forced to retreat, stopping only when they reached the river; they remained in the riverbank shelter for the rest of the battle, ignoring repeated orders to advance.

The two other guards regiments filled the gap left by the Scots Fusiliers, but refused orders to charge with bayonets up the hill. Instead, the Grenadiers and the Coldstream formed into lines and started firing Minié volleys into the Russian advance parties. This stopped the Russians, and the Grenadiers and the Coldstream were soon able to close the gap between them; the Russians were again forced back into the redoubt.

===Final stage===
Without entrenchments to protect its infantry and artillery, the Russian Army was unable to defend its position on the heights against the deadly Minié rifles. Soon, the fire of the Guards was joined by the 2nd Division under Evans, on the British right. Its 30th Regiment of Foot could clearly see the gunners of three Russian batteries from the riverbank and take them out with their Minié rifles before they could redeploy the guns. As the Russian infantry and artillery withdrew, the British slowly advanced uphill. By 16:00, the allies were converging on the Russian positions from all directions, with the Guards on the left overcoming the last Russian reserves on the Kurgan Hill, Codrington&#x27;s men and the other Guards closing in on the great redoubt, and the 2nd Division pushing up the Sevastopol Road. With the French in command of the cliffs above the Alma, the battle clearly had been decided.

The Russians fled in all directions, running down into the valley and away from the enemy. Mounted officers tried in vain to stop the panicked flight, but the men had decided they had had enough. Most of the Russian soldiers retreated towards the Kacha River in small groups, without officers or any clear idea of what to do or where to go. Many were not reunited with their regiments for several days. At the top of Telegraph Hill, the French captured the abandoned carriage of Menshikov. In it they found a field kitchen, letters from the Tsar, 50,000 francs, pornographic French novels, the general&#x27;s boots, and some ladies&#x27; underwear. On the hill were abandoned picnics, parasols and field glasses, left behind by the spectators from Sevastopol.

==Aftermath==

The battle cost the French 1,600 casualties, the British 2,000, the Ottomans 503, and the Russians some 5,000. The British took two days to clear the battlefield of their wounded. Without any medical supplies, they had to requisition the commissariat carts to remove the wounded from the battlefield. As the Russian army had to abandon its wounded on the battlefield, many of the injured limped back to Sevastopol over the course of the next days. Some 1600 wounded had to wait several days before they could sail to the Scutari hospital in Constantinople. The allied commanders had no idea of the heavy losses on the Russian side. The necessity of collecting equipment scattered through the battlefield delayed the pursuit, and the lack of cavalry ruled out any possibility of an immediate chase of the Russians.

The French commemorated the battle with the naming of the Pont de l&#x27;Alma in Paris. The British gave the name Alma to a small settlement in North Otago and to a river in Marlborough (both in New Zealand). In the Province of New Brunswick, Canada, The Parish of Alma was created surrounding the Village of Alma in 1856, commemorating the then-recent Battle of Alma. Alma, Nova Scotia, Alma, Ontario, Alma, Michigan, and Alma, Quebec are named after the battle.

<text>A Teachta Dála ( , ; plural ), abbreviated as TD (plural TDanna in Irish, TDs in English), is a member of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas, the parliament of Ireland. The official English translation of the term is &quot;Dáil Deputy&quot;. An equivalent position would be a Member of Parliament (MP) in the UK or Member of Congress in the USA.

==Number of TDs==
Ireland is divided into Dáil constituencies, each of which elects three, four, or five TDs. Under the Constitution, the total number of TDs must be fixed at one TD for each 20,000 to 30,000 of the population. There are 174 TDs in the 34th Dáil, elected at the 2024 general election under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023. The outgoing Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned unless they announce their retirement before the dissolution of the Dáil.

==Qualification==
A candidate for election as TD must be an Irish citizen and over 21 years of age. Members of the judiciary, the Garda Síochána, and the Permanent Defence Forces are disqualified from membership of the Dáil.

==History==
The term was first used to describe those Irish parliamentarians who were elected at the 1918 general election, and who, rather than attending the British House of Commons at Westminster, to which they had been elected, assembled instead in the Mansion House in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to create a new Irish parliament: the First Dáil Éireann. Initially, the term (F.D.E.) was mooted, but &#x27;Teachta&#x27; was used from the first meeting. The term continued to be used after this First Dáil and was used to refer to later members of the Irish Republic&#x27;s single-chamber Dáil Éireann (or &#x27;Assembly of Ireland&#x27;) (1919–1922), members of the Free State Dáil (1922–1937), and of the modern Dáil Éireann.

==Style==
The initials &quot;TD&quot; are placed after the surname of the elected TD. For example, the current Taoiseach (head of government) is &quot;Micheál Martin, TD&quot;. The style used to refer to individual TDs during debates in Dáil Éireann is the member&#x27;s surname preceded by &quot;Deputy&quot; (): for example, &quot;Deputy McDonald&quot;, &quot;an Teachta Ní Dhomhnaill/Bhean Úi Dhomhnaill&quot; or &quot;an Teachta Ó Domhnaill&quot;.

==Salaries and expenses==
The basic salary of a backbench TD is €113,679. Cabinet ministers and junior ministers receive additional allowances. Office-holders (opposition party leaders, whips, the Ceann Comhairle, and Leas-Cheann Comhairle) also receive additional allowances.

After controversy regarding alleged abuses of the Oireachtas expenses provisions, the system was simplified in 2009 and 2010 into two allowances:

*Travel and accommodation allowance – ranging from €9,000 for TDs less than 25 km from Leinster House to €34,065 for those more than 360 km away.
*Public Representation Allowance – for maintaining a constituency office; €20,350 for backbench TDs, less for ministers. All expenses must be vouched, except for a &quot;petty cash&quot; allowance of €100 per month. Until December 2012 TDs could choose between a €25,000 vouched allowance or €15,000 unvouched.

<doc id="157089" wikidata="Q2745283" url="?curid=157089" title="Battle of Arras (1654)">
<text>The Battle of [[Arras, France|Arras]], known at that time as the &quot;Secours d&#x27;Arras&quot; &#x27;i.e. Arras Aid, fought on 25 August 1654, was a victory of a French army under Turenne against a Spanish army commanded by Don Ferdinand de Salis and the Prince de Condé. 

The place, held by a French garrison, was besieged by the Spaniards under the Great Condé. A relief army under Turenne, d&#x27;Hocquincourt and de la Ferté attacked the Spanish lines and totally routed them with a loss of at least 7,000 men. Condé succeeded in rallying the remainder of his army and made a masterful retreat to Cambrai.

Before the battle, Turenne risked exposing himself and his officers in order to reconnoitre the Spanish lines. He was criticised for taking such risks by some of his officers, but the Duke of York, the future King James II of England, later observed that these officers realised their error after they realised that Turenne had worked out where to attack during these reconnaissances. Turenne attacked at night, two hours before daybreak on 25 August. D&#x27;Hocquincourt attacked the troops from Lorraine, Turenne attacked the Spanish and provided support for de la Ferté, whose attack was less successful. In the morning Condé counter-attacked, falling on French troops who were pillaging the former Spanish camp. De la Ferté panicked and abandoned some high ground. Turenne rode up and placed some cannon on the high ground, forcing Condé to retreat. The young Louis XIV visited the battlefield and saw the disparity between the numbers of French and Spanish dead. This was Louis XIV&#x27;s first victory against a foreign army.

Cyrano de Bergerac, who is the subject of the classic French play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; by Edmond Rostand, participated in a siege of Arras in 1640, and not the battle of 1654.

<text>Caspar Willard Weinberger (August 18, 1917 – March 28, 2006) was an American politician and businessman. As a Republican, he served in a variety of state and federal positions for three decades, most notably as Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan from January 1981 to November 1987. He was indicted on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing government investigations as part of the Iran–Contra investigation, but was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush before facing trial.

Weinberger was a member of the California State Assembly from 1953 to 1959. He also served as Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and Director of the Office of Management and Budget under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He later became vice president and general counsel of Bechtel Corporation.

Weinberger&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of Defense was marked by his hard line against the Soviet Union, in disagreement with the State Department. He promoted the Strategic Defense Initiative, an orbital weapons program. Weinberger was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and an honorary British knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. In 1993, he became Chairman of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

==Early life==

Weinberger was born on August 18, 1917, in San Francisco, the younger of two sons of Herman Weinberger (1886-1944), an attorney, and Cerise Carpenter Weinberger (née Hampson; 1886-1975), a music teacher. His father was of Jewish descent from Austria-Hungary, while his maternal grandparents were of Christian descent from Wisconsin. Caspar Weinberger&#x27;s father, Herman, was the younger brother of Luella Weinberger McNeill, mother of Don McNeill. The 1910 Census shows Herman and Luella living in the household of Nathan Weinberger, the grandfather of Caspar Weinberger.

Weinberger&#x27;s paternal grandparents had left Judaism over a religious dispute while living in Bohemia. He was raised in a home with no denominational ties, though with a socially Christian orientation. Weinberger would later become an active Episcopalian and often expressed his faith in God. Weinberger had stated that his mother&#x27;s Episcopal religion was &quot;an enormous influence and comfort all my life&quot;.

===Education===
Weinberger attended San Francisco Polytechnic High School. He was academically gifted and gained admission to Harvard University, graduating in 1938 with a B.A., &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. Weinberger was offered a scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge but instead attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1941 with a Bachelor of Laws.

== Career ==

===Military service===
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Weinberger enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private. He was sent to the Army&#x27;s Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia (now Fort Moore), where he was commissioned a second lieutenant. During World War II, he served with the 41st Infantry Division in the Pacific; by the war&#x27;s end, he was a captain on the intelligence staff of General Douglas MacArthur. Early in life, Weinberger developed an interest in politics and history, and, during the war years, a special admiration for Winston Churchill, whom he would later cite as an important influence in his life. From 1945 to 1947, Weinberger was a law clerk for U.S. circuit judge William Edwin Orr of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He then entered private practice at a San Francisco law firm.

===California politics===
In 1952, Weinberger entered the race for California&#x27;s 21st State Assembly district in the San Francisco Bay area as a Republican at the persuasion of his wife, Jane Weinberger, who also served as his campaign manager. He won and was reelected in 1954 and 1956. As the chairman of the Assembly Government Organization Committee, Weinberger was responsible for the creation of the California Department of Water Resources and was instrumental in the creation of the California State Water Project. Weinberger also unsuccessfully opposed the construction of the Embarcadero Freeway, saying it would ruin the view of the Bay and damage property values. Weinberger felt vindicated when the freeway was removed after the 1989 earthquake. Although unsuccessful in his 1958 campaign for California Attorney General, Weinberger continued to be active in politics and was chosen by Nixon in 1962 to become chairman of the California Republican Party.

Governor Ronald Reagan named him chairman of the Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy in 1967 and appointed him State director of finance early in 1968. Weinberger moved to Washington in January 1970 to become chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. He is credited for having revitalized the FTC by enforcing consumer protection.

===Nixon cabinet===

Weinberger subsequently served under President Richard Nixon as deputy director (1970–1972) and director (1972–1973) of the Office of Management and Budget and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (1973–1975). While serving in the Office of Management and Budget, Weinberger earned the nickname &quot;Cap the Knife&quot; for his cost-cutting ability. For the next five years, Weinberger was vice president and general counsel of the Bechtel Corporation in California.

===&quot;Relf v. Weinberger&quot;===
In 1973, the Southern Poverty Law Center named Weinberger as a defendant in a case that sought restitution for the forced non-consensual sterilization and medical experimentation on three young Black American girls, Minnie Lee, Mary Alice, and Katie Relf in Montgomery, Alabama. An employee of Montgomery&#x27;s federally-funded Community Action organization took the Relf sisters to a family planning clinic under the pretext of needing “shots.” Staff gave Katie Relf a then-experimental birth control shot as well as inserted a contraceptive IUD device without parental knowledge or consent. On a separate occasion, doctors surgically sterilized Minnie Lee and Mary Alice who were twelve and fourteen years old respectively. At the time of the suit, the Office of Economic Opportunity was preparing to hand over funding and control of its associated family planning clinics to Weinberger&#x27;s Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

The SPLC&#x27;s complaint shows that the O.E.O. recently began providing funding for such sterilization procedures, while top OEO personnel intentionally did not distribute a medical memo containing guidelines on obtaining patient consent for such operations. Dr. Warren M. Hern authored the memo, and ultimately resigned in outrage that the guidelines were not distributed. Copies of the memo, which included age of consent laws whose criteria the Relf girls did not meet, sat undistributed in a DC warehouse. At the time of the suit, Weinberger&#x27;s most recent approved Health, Education, and Welfare budget included specific funding allotments for sterilization procedures, and thus he was named a defendant in the case. A district court involved in Relf V. Weinberger hearings found that anywhere from 100,000 to 150,000 poor people were sterilized annually using federal dollars, and some among those sterilized were coerced into the procedures by doctors who threatened to cut off welfare benefits. The case shined fresh light on numerous state sterilization and eugenics programs nationwide and led to compensation funds and settlements for some victims.

===Secretary of Defense===

Weinberger was vying for Reagan to appoint him as Secretary of State but was given the position of Secretary of Defense instead.

Weinberger took the lead in implementing a rollback strategy against Soviet communism. In 1984, journalist Nicholas Lemann interviewed Weinberger and summarized the strategy of the Reagan administration to roll back the Soviet Union:
Lemann notes that when he wrote that in 1984, he thought the Reaganites were living in a fantasy world. But in 2016, he says, that passage represents &quot;a fairly uncontroversial description of what Reagan actually did&quot;.

Although not widely experienced in defense matters, Weinberger had a reputation in Washington as an able administrator; his powers as a cost cutter earned him the sobriquet &quot;Cap the Knife&quot;. He shared Ronald Reagan&#x27;s conviction that the Soviet Union posed a serious threat to the United States, and that the defense establishment needed to be modernized and strengthened. Belying his nickname, at the Pentagon Weinberger became a vigorous advocate of Reagan&#x27;s plan to increase the Department of Defense budget. Readiness, sustainability, and modernization became the watchwords of the defense program. In his early years at the Pentagon, Cap Weinberger was known as &quot;Cap the Ladle&quot; for advocating large increases in defense spending.

As Secretary of Defense, Weinberger oversaw a massive rebuilding of US military strength. Major defense programs he championed included the B-1B bomber and the &quot;600-ship Navy&quot;. His efforts created economic and military-industrial pressures that were associated with the beginning of Perestroika and the beginning of the end of both the Cold War and the Soviet Union. However, this thesis was contested by a study on the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union by two prominent economists from the World Bank – William Easterly, and Stanley Fischer from MIT: &quot;...the study concludes that the increased Soviet defense spending provoked by Mr. Reagan&#x27;s policies was not the straw that broke the back of the Evil Empire. The Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Soviet response to Mr. Reagan&#x27;s Star Wars program caused only a relatively small rise in [USSR] defense costs. The massive US defense effort throughout the period from 1960 to 1987 contributed only marginally to Soviet economic decline.&quot;

The same study points out the key reason for the economic decline of the USSR was relying on centrally-planned industrial-expansion to drive economic growth, rather than driving growth by increasing worker productivity via incentives; France and Japan were also mentioned (in 1994) as other centrally-planned economies that could soon experience similar troubles. While the Reagan Doctrine was not a key factor in causing the economic implosion of the USSR, which was driven by internal contradictions, the Reagan proxy-rollback policy of the 1980s (which replaced Détente that Nixon and Carter generally pursued during the 1970s) was the key factor in preventing expansion of the Soviet economic empire, and sustenance of their declining domestic economy from external sources. Reagan was one of the few people to predict this possibility. The final piece of the puzzle was the Soviet leadership: Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko were hardline Communists, and prevented any significant changes, but Gorbachev was a reformer—and once economic reforms and political reforms began, they became unstoppable. British journalist Bernard Levin wrote in 1977:

These events came at the cost of helping to triple the US national debt, and funding radicals. Weinberger pushed for dramatic increases in the United States&#x27; nuclear funding, and was a strong advocate of the controversial SDI, an initiative which proposed a space- and ground-based missile defense shield.

Weinberger was reluctant to commit the armed forces, keeping only a token force of American marines in Lebanon that then became victims in the October 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. In the wake of that terrible event, he laid out his engagement policy in a November 1984 speech on &quot;The Uses of Military Power&quot; at the National Press Club as the Six Tests.

Unlike President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz, Weinberger did not regard any of Gorbachev&#x27;s actions—whether it was perestroika or glasnost—as reassuring indicators of his stated intentions. &quot;Not only did Gorbachev give up all of the Soviet &#x27;non-negotiable&#x27; demands [regarding the INF Treaty], but he gave us precisely the kind of treaty that the President had sought for seven years. That act of course does not mean—any more than does the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan—that the USSR has given up its long-term aggressive designs.&quot; Initially, Reagan&#x27;s views were in line with Weinberger&#x27;s views, but he began to reevaluate his perception of Gorbachev&#x27;s intentions in 1987, the year Gorbachev accepted the U.S. proposal on INF.

Weinberger resigned as Secretary of Defense on November 6, 1987.

====Iran–Contra affair====
The Iran–Contra affair concerned the selling of US missiles to Iran. The funds received from Iran were then channeled to guerilla rebels known as Contras, who were fighting the socialist government of Nicaragua. Such funding had been specifically denied by the US Congress.

Though he claimed to have been opposed to the sale on principle, Weinberger participated in the transfer of United States Hawk and TOW missiles to Iran at that time.

Iran–Contra resulted in a major scandal with several investigations which resulted in fourteen Reagan administration officials being indicted.

After his resignation as Secretary of Defense, legal proceedings against Weinberger were continued by Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. On June 17, 1992, Weinberger was indicted on five felony charges related to the Iran-contra affair, including accusations that he had lied to Congress and obstructed Government investigations. He was defended by defense attorney Carl Rauh.

Prosecutors brought an additional indictment just four days before the 1992 presidential election. This was controversial because it cited a Weinberger diary entry contradicting a claim made by President George H. W. Bush. Republicans claimed that this action contributed to Bush&#x27;s later defeat. On December 11, 1992, Judge Thomas F. Hogan threw out this indictment because it violated the five-year statute of limitations and improperly broadened the original charges.

Before Weinberger could be tried on the original charges, he received a pardon on December 24, 1992, from Bush, who had been Reagan&#x27;s vice president during the scandal.

===Later career===

Weinberger had been Secretary of Defense for six years and ten months, longer than anyone except for Robert McNamara and more recently Donald Rumsfeld. After Weinberger left the Pentagon, he joined Forbes, Inc., in 1989 as publisher of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. He was named chairman in 1993. Over the next decade, he wrote frequently on defense and national security issues. In 1990, he wrote &quot;Fighting for Peace&quot;, an account of his Pentagon years. In 1996, Weinberger co-authored a book entitled &quot;The Next War&quot;, which raised questions about the adequacy of US military capabilities following the end of the Cold War.

He was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford and a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh.

==Personal life==
In 1942, Weinberger married the former Rebecca Jane Dalton (1918–2009). A World War II Army nurse, and later author and publisher, she &quot;coaxed her husband ... into politics and was a loyal Washington wife during three Republican administrations before she began to write and publish children&#x27;s books&quot;.

===Death===
While residing on Mount Desert Island, Weinberger was treated for and died from complications of pneumonia at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Maine, aged 88. He was survived by his wife, their two children, and several grandchildren.

He was buried in Section 30, Grave 835–1 at Arlington National Cemetery on April 4, 2006.

Shortly after his death George W. Bush in a public statement said:

Then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated:

<doc id="157092" wikidata="Q178192" url="?curid=157092" title="Cross product">
<text>In mathematics, the cross product or vector product (occasionally directed area product, to emphasize its geometric significance) is a binary operation on two vectors in a three-dimensional oriented Euclidean vector space (named here formula_1), and is denoted by the symbol formula_2. Given two linearly independent vectors and , the cross product, (read &quot;a cross b&quot;), is a vector that is perpendicular to both and , and thus normal to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer programming. It should not be confused with the dot product (projection product).

The magnitude of the cross product equals the area of a parallelogram with the vectors for sides; in particular, the magnitude of the product of two perpendicular vectors is the product of their lengths. The units of the cross-product are the product of the units of each vector. If two vectors are parallel or are anti-parallel (that is, they are linearly dependent), or if either one has zero length, then their cross product is zero. 

The cross product is anticommutative (that is, ) and is distributive over addition, that is, . The space formula_1 together with the cross product is an algebra over the real numbers, which is neither commutative nor associative, but is a Lie algebra with the cross product being the Lie bracket.

Like the dot product, it depends on the metric of Euclidean space, but unlike the dot product, it also depends on a choice of orientation (or &quot;handedness&quot;) of the space (it is why an oriented space is needed). The resultant vector is invariant of rotation of basis. Due to the dependence on handedness, the cross product is said to be a pseudovector.

In connection with the cross product, the exterior product of vectors can be used in arbitrary dimensions (with a bivector or 2-form result) and is independent of the orientation of the space.

The product can be generalized in various ways, using the orientation and metric structure just as for the traditional 3-dimensional cross product; one can, in dimensions, take the product of vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them. But if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results, it exists only in three and seven dimensions. The cross-product in seven dimensions has undesirable properties (e.g. it fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity), so it is not used in mathematical physics to represent quantities such as multi-dimensional space-time. (See below for other dimensions.)

== Definition ==
The cross product of two vectors a and b is defined only in three-dimensional space and is denoted by . In physics and applied mathematics, the wedge notation is often used (in conjunction with the name &quot;vector product&quot;), although in pure mathematics such notation is usually reserved for just the exterior product, an abstraction of the vector product to dimensions.

The cross product is defined as a vector c that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to both a and b, with a direction given by the right-hand rule and a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span.

The cross product is defined by the formula

: formula_4

where

: &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between a and b in the plane containing them (hence, it is between 0° and 180°),
: ‖a‖ and ‖b‖ are the magnitudes of vectors a and b,
: n is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing a and b, with direction such that the ordered set (a, b, n) is positively oriented.

If the vectors a and b are parallel (that is, the angle &quot;θ&quot; between them is either 0° or 180°), by the above formula, the cross product of a and b is the zero vector 0.

=== Direction ===
The direction of the vector n depends on the chosen orientation of the space. Conventionally, it is given by the right-hand rule, where one simply points the forefinger of the right hand in the direction of a and the middle finger in the direction of b. Then, the vector n is coming out of the thumb (see the adjacent picture). Using this rule implies that the cross product is anti-commutative; that is, . By pointing the forefinger toward b first, and then pointing the middle finger toward a, the thumb will be forced in the opposite direction, reversing the sign of the product vector.

As the cross product operator depends on the orientation of the space, in general the cross product of two vectors is not a &quot;true&quot; vector, but a &quot;pseudovector&quot;. See for more detail.

== Names and origin ==

In 1842, William Rowan Hamilton first described the algebra of quaternions and the non-commutative Hamilton product. In particular, when the Hamilton product of two vectors (that is, pure quaternions with zero scalar part) is performed, it results in a quaternion with a scalar and vector part. The scalar and vector part of this Hamilton product corresponds to the negative of dot product and cross product of the two vectors. 

In 1881, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and independently Oliver Heaviside, introduced the notation for both the dot product and the cross product using a period () and an &quot;×&quot; (), respectively, to denote them.

In 1877, to emphasize the fact that the result of a dot product is a scalar while the result of a cross product is a vector, William Kingdon Clifford coined the alternative names scalar product and vector product for the two operations. These alternative names are still widely used in the literature.

Both the cross notation () and the name cross product were possibly inspired by the fact that each scalar component of is computed by multiplying non-corresponding components of a and b. Conversely, a dot product involves multiplications between corresponding components of a and b. As explained below, the cross product can be expressed in the form of a determinant of a special matrix. According to Sarrus&#x27;s rule, this involves multiplications between matrix elements identified by crossed diagonals.

== Computing ==

=== Coordinate notation ===

If formula_5 is a positively oriented orthonormal basis, the basis vectors satisfy the following equalities
:formula_6
A mnemonic for these formulas is that they can be deduced from any other of them by a cyclic permutation of the basis vectors. This mnemonic applies also to many formulas given in this article.

The anticommutativity of the cross product, implies that 
:formula_7

The anticommutativity of the cross product (and the obvious lack of linear independence) also implies that
:formula_8 (the zero vector).

These equalities, together with the distributivity and linearity of the cross product (though neither follows easily from the definition given above), are sufficient to determine the cross product of any two vectors a and b. Each vector can be defined as the sum of three orthogonal components parallel to the standard basis vectors:
:formula_9

Their cross product can be expanded using distributivity:
:formula_10

This can be interpreted as the decomposition of into the sum of nine simpler cross products involving vectors aligned with i, j, or k. Each one of these nine cross products operates on two vectors that are easy to handle as they are either parallel or orthogonal to each other. From this decomposition, by using the above-mentioned equalities and collecting similar terms, we obtain:
:formula_11

meaning that the three scalar components of the resulting vector s = &quot;s&quot;1i + &quot;s&quot;2j + &quot;s&quot;3k = are
:formula_12

Using column vectors, we can represent the same result as follows:
:formula_13

=== Matrix notation ===

The cross product can also be expressed as the formal determinant:

:formula_14

This determinant can be computed using Sarrus&#x27;s rule or cofactor expansion. Using Sarrus&#x27;s rule, it expands to
:formula_15

which gives the components of the resulting vector directly.

=== Using Levi-Civita tensors ===
* In any basis, the cross-product formula_16 is given by the tensorial formula formula_17 where formula_18 is the covariant Levi-Civita tensor (we note the position of the indices). That corresponds to the intrinsic formula given here.
* In an orthonormal basis having the same orientation as the space, formula_16 is given by the pseudo-tensorial formula formula_20 where formula_21 is the Levi-Civita symbol (which is a pseudo-tensor). That is the formula used for everyday physics but it works only for this special choice of basis.
* In any orthonormal basis, formula_16 is given by the pseudo-tensorial formula formula_23 where formula_24 indicates whether the basis has the same orientation as the space or not.

The latter formula avoids having to change the orientation of the space when we inverse an orthonormal basis.

== Properties ==

=== Geometric meaning ===


The magnitude of the cross product can be interpreted as the positive area of the parallelogram having a and b as sides (see Figure 1):
formula_25

Indeed, one can also compute the volume &quot;V&quot; of a parallelepiped having a, b and c as edges by using a combination of a cross product and a dot product, called scalar triple product (see Figure 2):

:formula_26

Since the result of the scalar triple product may be negative, the volume of the parallelepiped is given by its absolute value:

:formula_27

Because the magnitude of the cross product goes by the sine of the angle between its arguments, the cross product can be thought of as a measure of &quot;perpendicularity&quot; in the same way that the dot product is a measure of &quot;parallelism&quot;. Given two unit vectors, their cross product has a magnitude of 1 if the two are perpendicular and a magnitude of zero if the two are parallel. The dot product of two unit vectors behaves just oppositely: it is zero when the unit vectors are perpendicular and 1 if the unit vectors are parallel.

Unit vectors enable two convenient identities: the dot product of two unit vectors yields the cosine (which may be positive or negative) of the angle between the two unit vectors. The magnitude of the cross product of the two unit vectors yields the sine (which will always be positive).

=== Algebraic properties ===


If the cross product of two vectors is the zero vector (that is, ), then either one or both of the inputs is the zero vector, ( or ) or else they are parallel or antiparallel () so that the sine of the angle between them is zero ( or and ).

The self cross product of a vector is the zero vector:
:formula_28
The cross product is anticommutative,
:formula_29
distributive over addition,
: formula_30
and compatible with scalar multiplication so that
:formula_31

It is not associative, but satisfies the Jacobi identity:
:formula_32
Distributivity, linearity and Jacobi identity show that the R3 vector space together with vector addition and the cross product forms a Lie algebra, the Lie algebra of the real orthogonal group in 3 dimensions, SO(3).
The cross product does not obey the cancellation law; that is, with does not imply , but only that:
:formula_33

This can be the case where b and c cancel, but additionally where a and are parallel; that is, they are related by a scale factor &quot;t&quot;, leading to:
:formula_34
for some scalar &quot;t&quot;.

If, in addition to and as above, it is the case that then
:formula_35
As cannot be simultaneously parallel (for the cross product to be 0) and perpendicular (for the dot product to be 0) to a, it must be the case that b and c cancel: .

From the geometrical definition, the cross product is invariant under proper rotations about the axis defined by . In formulae:
:formula_36, where formula_37 is a rotation matrix with formula_38.

More generally, the cross product obeys the following identity under matrix transformations:
:formula_39
where formula_40 is a 3-by-3 matrix and formula_41 is the transpose of the inverse and formula_42 is the cofactor matrix. It can be readily seen how this formula reduces to the former one if formula_40 is a rotation matrix. If formula_40 is a 3-by-3 symmetric matrix applied to a generic cross product formula_45, the following relation holds true: 
:formula_46
The cross product of two vectors lies in the null space of the matrix with the vectors as rows:
:formula_47
For the sum of two cross products, the following identity holds:
:formula_48

=== Differentiation ===
The product rule of differential calculus applies to any bilinear operation, and therefore also to the cross product:
:formula_49

where a and b are vectors that depend on the real variable &quot;t&quot;.

=== Triple product expansion ===
The cross product is used in both forms of the triple product. The scalar triple product of three vectors is defined as

:formula_50

It is the signed volume of the parallelepiped with edges a, b and c and as such the vectors can be used in any order that&#x27;s an even permutation of the above ordering. The following therefore are equal:

:formula_51

The vector triple product is the cross product of a vector with the result of another cross product, and is related to the dot product by the following formula

:formula_52

The mnemonic &quot;BAC minus CAB&quot; is used to remember the order of the vectors in the right hand member. This formula is used in physics to simplify vector calculations. A special case, regarding gradients and useful in vector calculus, is
:formula_53

where ∇2 is the vector Laplacian operator.

Other identities relate the cross product to the scalar triple product:
:formula_54

where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix.

=== Alternative formulation ===
The cross product and the dot product are related by:
:formula_55

The right-hand side is the Gram determinant of a and b, the square of the area of the parallelogram defined by the vectors. This condition determines the magnitude of the cross product. Namely, since the dot product is defined, in terms of the angle &quot;θ&quot; between the two vectors, as:

:formula_56

the above given relationship can be rewritten as follows:

:formula_57

Invoking the Pythagorean trigonometric identity one obtains:
:formula_58

which is the magnitude of the cross product expressed in terms of &quot;θ&quot;, equal to the area of the parallelogram defined by a and b (see definition above).

The combination of this requirement and the property that the cross product be orthogonal to its constituents a and b provides an alternative definition of the cross product.

=== Cross product inverse ===

For the cross product , there are multiple vectors that give the same value of . As a result, it is not possible to rearrange this equation to yield a unique solution for in terms of and . Nevertheless, it is possible to find a family of solutions for , which are
:formula_59
where is an arbitrary constant.

This can be derived using the triple product expansion:
:formula_60
Rearrange to solve for to give
:formula_61
The coefficient of the last term can be simplified to just the arbitrary constant to yield the result shown above.

=== Lagrange&#x27;s identity ===
The relation
:formula_62

can be compared with another relation involving the right-hand side, namely Lagrange&#x27;s identity expressed as

:formula_63

where a and b may be &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vectors. This also shows that the Riemannian volume form for surfaces is exactly the surface element from vector calculus. In the case where , combining these two equations results in the expression for the magnitude of the cross product in terms of its components:
:formula_64

The same result is found directly using the components of the cross product found from
:formula_65

In R3, Lagrange&#x27;s equation is a special case of the multiplicativity of the norm in the quaternion algebra.

It is a special case of another formula, also sometimes called Lagrange&#x27;s identity, which is the three dimensional case of the Binet–Cauchy identity:

:formula_66

If and , this simplifies to the formula above.

=== Infinitesimal generators of rotations ===
The cross product conveniently describes the infinitesimal generators of rotations in R3. Specifically, if n is a unit vector in R3 and &quot;R&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;, n) denotes a rotation about the axis through the origin specified by n, with angle φ (measured in radians, counterclockwise when viewed from the tip of n), then
:formula_67
for every vector x in R3. The cross product with n therefore describes the infinitesimal generator of the rotations about n. These infinitesimal generators form the Lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group SO(3), and we obtain the result that the Lie algebra R3 with cross product is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3).

== Alternative ways to compute ==

=== Conversion to matrix multiplication ===
The vector cross product also can be expressed as the product of a skew-symmetric matrix and a vector:
formula_68
where superscript refers to the transpose operation, and [a]× is defined by:
formula_69

The columns [a]×,i of the skew-symmetric matrix for a vector a can be also obtained by calculating the cross product with unit vectors. That is,
formula_70
or
formula_71
where formula_72 is the outer product operator.

Also, if a is itself expressed as a cross product:
formula_73
then
formula_74

This result can be generalized to higher dimensions using geometric algebra. In particular in any dimension bivectors can be identified with skew-symmetric matrices, so the product between a skew-symmetric matrix and vector is equivalent to the grade-1 part of the product of a bivector and vector. In three dimensions bivectors are dual to vectors so the product is equivalent to the cross product, with the bivector instead of its vector dual. In higher dimensions the product can still be calculated but bivectors have more degrees of freedom and are not equivalent to vectors.

This notation is also often much easier to work with, for example, in epipolar geometry.

From the general properties of the cross product follows immediately that
formula_75   and   formula_76
and from fact that [a]× is skew-symmetric it follows that
formula_77

The above-mentioned triple product expansion (bac–cab rule) can be easily proven using this notation.

As mentioned above, the Lie algebra R3 with cross product is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3), whose elements can be identified with the 3×3 skew-symmetric matrices. The map a → [a]× provides an isomorphism between R3 and so(3). Under this map, the cross product of 3-vectors corresponds to the commutator of 3x3 skew-symmetric matrices.

===Index notation for tensors===
The cross product can alternatively be defined in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor &quot;Eijk&quot; and a dot product &quot;ηmi&quot;, which are useful in converting vector notation for tensor applications:

:formula_78

where the indices formula_79 correspond to vector components. This characterization of the cross product is often expressed more compactly using the Einstein summation convention as
:formula_80

in which repeated indices are summed over the values 1 to 3.

In a positively-oriented orthonormal basis &quot;ηmi&quot; = δ&quot;mi&quot; (the Kronecker delta) and formula_81 (the Levi-Civita symbol). In that case, this representation is another form of the skew-symmetric representation of the cross product:

:formula_82

In classical mechanics: representing the cross product by using the Levi-Civita symbol can cause mechanical symmetries to be obvious when physical systems are isotropic. (An example: consider a particle in a Hooke&#x27;s Law potential in three-space, free to oscillate in three dimensions; none of these dimensions are &quot;special&quot; in any sense, so symmetries lie in the cross-product-represented angular momentum, which are made clear by the abovementioned Levi-Civita representation).

=== Mnemonic ===

The word &quot;xyzzy&quot; can be used to remember the definition of the cross product.

If

:formula_83

where:

:formula_84

then:

:formula_85
:formula_86
:formula_87

The second and third equations can be obtained from the first by simply vertically rotating the subscripts, . The problem, of course, is how to remember the first equation, and two options are available for this purpose: either to remember the relevant two diagonals of Sarrus&#x27;s scheme (those containing i), or to remember the xyzzy sequence.

Since the first diagonal in Sarrus&#x27;s scheme is just the main diagonal of the above-mentioned 3×3 matrix, the first three letters of the word xyzzy can be very easily remembered.

=== Cross visualization ===
Similarly to the mnemonic device above, a &quot;cross&quot; or X can be visualized between the two vectors in the equation. This may be helpful for remembering the correct cross product formula.

If

:formula_83

then:

:formula_89

If we want to obtain the formula for formula_90 we simply drop the formula_91 and formula_92 from the formula, and take the next two components down:

:formula_93

When doing this for formula_94 the next two elements down should &quot;wrap around&quot; the matrix so that after the z component comes the x component. For clarity, when performing this operation for formula_94, the next two components should be z and x (in that order). While for formula_96 the next two components should be taken as x and y.

:formula_97

For formula_90 then, if we visualize the cross operator as pointing from an element on the left to an element on the right, we can take the first element on the left and simply multiply by the element that the cross points to in the right-hand matrix. We then subtract the next element down on the left, multiplied by the element that the cross points to here as well. This results in our formula_90 formula –

:formula_100

We can do this in the same way for formula_94 and formula_96 to construct their associated formulas.

== Applications ==
The cross product has applications in various contexts. For example, it is used in computational geometry, physics and engineering.
A non-exhaustive list of examples follows.

=== Computational geometry ===
The cross product appears in the calculation of the distance of two skew lines (lines not in the same plane) from each other in three-dimensional space.

The cross product can be used to calculate the normal for a triangle or polygon, an operation frequently performed in computer graphics. For example, the winding of a polygon (clockwise or anticlockwise) about a point within the polygon can be calculated by triangulating the polygon (like spoking a wheel) and summing the angles (between the spokes) using the cross product to keep track of the sign of each angle.

In computational geometry of the plane, the cross product is used to determine the sign of the acute angle defined by three points formula_103 and formula_104. It corresponds to the direction (upward or downward) of the cross product of the two coplanar vectors defined by the two pairs of points formula_105 and formula_106. The sign of the acute angle is the sign of the expression
:formula_107
which is the signed length of the cross product of the two vectors.
To use the cross product, simply extend the 2D vectors formula_108 to co-planar 3D vectors by setting formula_109 for each of them.

In the &quot;right-handed&quot; coordinate system, if the result is 0, the points are collinear; if it is positive, the three points constitute a positive angle of rotation around formula_110 from formula_111 to formula_112, otherwise a negative angle. From another point of view, the sign of formula_113 tells whether formula_112 lies to the left or to the right of line formula_115

The cross product is used in calculating the volume of a polyhedron such as a tetrahedron or parallelepiped.

=== Angular momentum and torque ===
The angular momentum of a particle about a given origin is defined as:

: formula_116

where is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin, is the linear momentum of the particle.

In the same way, the moment of a force applied at point B around point A is given as:

: formula_117

In mechanics the &quot;moment of a force&quot; is also called &quot;torque&quot; and written as formula_118

Since position linear momentum and force are all &quot;true&quot; vectors, both the angular momentum and the moment of a force are &quot;pseudovectors&quot; or &quot;axial vectors&quot;.

=== Rigid body ===
The cross product frequently appears in the description of rigid motions. Two points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; on a rigid body can be related by:

: formula_119

where formula_120 is the point&#x27;s position, formula_121 is its velocity and formula_122 is the body&#x27;s angular velocity.

Since position formula_120 and velocity formula_121 are &quot;true&quot; vectors, the angular velocity formula_122 is a &quot;pseudovector&quot; or &quot;axial vector&quot;.

=== Lorentz force ===

The cross product is used to describe the Lorentz force experienced by a moving electric charge 
: formula_126

Since velocity force and electric field are all &quot;true&quot; vectors, the magnetic field is a &quot;pseudovector&quot;.

=== Other ===
In vector calculus, the cross product is used to define the formula for the vector operator curl.

The trick of rewriting a cross product in terms of a matrix multiplication appears frequently in epipolar and multi-view geometry, in particular when deriving matching constraints.

== As an external product ==

The cross product can be defined in terms of the exterior product. It can be generalized to an external product in other than three dimensions. This generalization allows a natural geometric interpretation of the cross product. In exterior algebra the exterior product of two vectors is a bivector. A bivector is an oriented plane element, in much the same way that a vector is an oriented line element. Given two vectors &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, one can view the bivector as the oriented parallelogram spanned by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. The cross product is then obtained by taking the Hodge star of the bivector , mapping 2-vectors to vectors:

: formula_127

This can be thought of as the oriented multi-dimensional element &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the bivector. In a &quot;d-&quot;dimensional space, Hodge star takes a &quot;k&quot;-vector to a (&quot;d–k&quot;)-vector; thus only in &quot;d =&quot; 3 dimensions is the result an element of dimension one (3–2 = 1), i.e. a vector. For example, in &quot;d =&quot; 4 dimensions, the cross product of two vectors has dimension 4–2 = 2, giving a bivector. Thus, only in three dimensions does cross product define an algebra structure to multiply vectors.

== Handedness ==
=== Consistency ===
When physics laws are written as equations, it is possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system, including handedness. One should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two polar vectors, one must take into account that the result is an axial vector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be an axial vector. More generally, the result of a cross product may be either a polar vector or an axial vector, depending on the type of its operands (polar vectors or axial vectors). Namely, polar vectors and axial vectors are interrelated in the following ways under application of the cross product:

* polar vector × polar vector = axial vector
* axial vector × axial vector = axial vector
* polar vector × axial vector = polar vector
* axial vector × polar vector = polar vector
or symbolically
* polar × polar = axial 
* axial × axial = axial 
* polar × axial = polar 
* axial × polar = polar

Because the cross product may also be a polar vector, it may not change direction with a mirror image transformation. This happens, according to the above relationships, if one of the operands is a polar vector and the other one is an axial vector (e.g., the cross product of two polar vectors). For instance, a vector triple product involving three polar vectors is a polar vector.

A handedness-free approach is possible using exterior algebra.

=== The paradox of the orthonormal basis ===
Let (i, j, k) be an orthonormal basis. The vectors i, j and k do not depend on the orientation of the space. They can even be defined in the absence of any orientation. They can not therefore be axial vectors. But if i and j are polar vectors, then k is an axial vector for i × j = k or j × i = k. This is a paradox.

&quot;Axial&quot; and &quot;polar&quot; are &quot;physical&quot; qualifiers for &quot;physical&quot; vectors; that is, vectors which represent &quot;physical&quot; quantities such as the velocity or the magnetic field. The vectors i, j and k are mathematical vectors, neither axial nor polar. In mathematics, the cross-product of two vectors is a vector. There is no contradiction.

== Generalizations ==
There are several ways to generalize the cross product to higher dimensions.

=== Lie algebra ===

The cross product can be seen as one of the simplest Lie products, and is thus generalized by Lie algebras, which are axiomatized as binary products satisfying the axioms of multilinearity, skew-symmetry, and the Jacobi identity. Many Lie algebras exist, and their study is a major field of mathematics, called Lie theory.

For example, the Heisenberg algebra gives another Lie algebra structure on formula_128 In the basis formula_129 the product is formula_130

=== Quaternions ===

The cross product can also be described in terms of quaternions.
In general, if a vector is represented as the quaternion , the cross product of two vectors can be obtained by taking their product as quaternions and deleting the real part of the result. The real part will be the negative of the dot product of the two vectors.

=== Octonions ===

A cross product for 7-dimensional vectors can be obtained in the same way by using the octonions instead of the quaternions. The nonexistence of nontrivial vector-valued cross products of two vectors in other dimensions is related to the result from Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem that the only normed division algebras are the ones with dimension 1, 2, 4, and 8.

=== Exterior product ===

In general dimension, there is no direct analogue of the binary cross product that yields specifically a vector. There is however the exterior product, which has similar properties, except that the exterior product of two vectors is now a 2-vector instead of an ordinary vector. As mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted as the exterior product in three dimensions by using the Hodge star operator to map 2-vectors to vectors. The Hodge dual of the exterior product yields an -vector, which is a natural generalization of the cross product in any number of dimensions.

The exterior product and dot product can be combined (through summation) to form the geometric product in geometric algebra.

=== External product ===
As mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted in three dimensions as the Hodge dual of the exterior product. In any finite &quot;n&quot; dimensions, the Hodge dual of the exterior product of vectors is a vector. So, instead of a binary operation, in arbitrary finite dimensions, the cross product is generalized as the Hodge dual of the exterior product of some given vectors. This generalization is called external product.

=== Commutator product ===
Interpreting the three-dimensional vector space of the algebra as the 2-vector (not the 1-vector) subalgebra of the three-dimensional geometric algebra, where formula_131, formula_132, and formula_133, the cross product corresponds exactly to the commutator product in geometric algebra and both use the same symbol formula_2. The commutator product is defined for 2-vectors formula_135 and formula_136 in geometric algebra as:

: formula_137

where formula_138 is the geometric product.

The commutator product could be generalised to arbitrary multivectors in three dimensions, which results in a multivector consisting of only elements of grades 1 (1-vectors/true vectors) and 2 (2-vectors/pseudovectors). While the commutator product of two 1-vectors is indeed the same as the exterior product and yields a 2-vector, the commutator of a 1-vector and a 2-vector yields a true vector, corresponding instead to the left and right contractions in geometric algebra. The commutator product of two 2-vectors has no corresponding equivalent product, which is why the commutator product is defined in the first place for 2-vectors. Furthermore, the commutator triple product of three 2-vectors is the same as the vector triple product of the same three pseudovectors in vector algebra. However, the commutator triple product of three 1-vectors in geometric algebra is instead the negative of the vector triple product of the same three true vectors in vector algebra.

Generalizations to higher dimensions is provided by the same commutator product of 2-vectors in higher-dimensional geometric algebras, but the 2-vectors are no longer pseudovectors. Just as the commutator product/cross product of 2-vectors in three dimensions correspond to the simplest Lie algebra, the 2-vector subalgebras of higher dimensional geometric algebra equipped with the commutator product also correspond to the Lie algebras. Also as in three dimensions, the commutator product could be further generalised to arbitrary multivectors.

=== Multilinear algebra ===
In the context of multilinear algebra, the cross product can be seen as the (1,2)-tensor (a mixed tensor, specifically a bilinear map) obtained from the 3-dimensional volume form, a (0,3)-tensor, by raising an index.

In detail, the 3-dimensional volume form defines a product formula_139 by taking the determinant of the matrix given by these 3 vectors. By duality, this is equivalent to a function formula_140 (fixing any two inputs gives a function formula_141 by evaluating on the third input) and in the presence of an inner product (such as the dot product; more generally, a non-degenerate bilinear form), we have an isomorphism formula_142 and thus this yields a map formula_143 which is the cross product: a (0,3)-tensor (3 vector inputs, scalar output) has been transformed into a (1,2)-tensor (2 vector inputs, 1 vector output) by &quot;raising an index&quot;.

Translating the above algebra into geometry, the function &quot;volume of the parallelepiped defined by formula_144&quot; (where the first two vectors are fixed and the last is an input), which defines a function formula_141, can be &quot;represented&quot; uniquely as the dot product with a vector: this vector is the cross product formula_146 From this perspective, the cross product is &quot;defined&quot; by the scalar triple product, formula_147

In the same way, in higher dimensions one may define generalized cross products by raising indices of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume form, which is a formula_148-tensor.
The most direct generalizations of the cross product are to define either:
* a formula_149-tensor, which takes as input formula_150 vectors, and gives as output 1 vector – an formula_151-ary vector-valued product, or
* a formula_152-tensor, which takes as input 2 vectors and gives as output skew-symmetric tensor of rank – a binary product with rank tensor values. One can also define formula_153-tensors for other &quot;k&quot;.

These products are all multilinear and skew-symmetric, and can be defined in terms of the determinant and parity.

The formula_151-ary product can be described as follows: given formula_150 vectors formula_156 in formula_157 define their generalized cross product formula_158 as:
* perpendicular to the hyperplane defined by the formula_159
* magnitude is the volume of the parallelotope defined by the formula_159 which can be computed as the Gram determinant of the formula_159
* oriented so that formula_162 is positively oriented.
This is the unique multilinear, alternating product which evaluates to formula_163, formula_164 and so forth for cyclic permutations of indices.

In coordinates, one can give a formula for this formula_151-ary analogue of the cross product in R&quot;n&quot; by:

:formula_166

This formula is identical in structure to the determinant formula for the normal cross product in R3 except that the row of basis vectors is the last row in the determinant rather than the first. The reason for this is to ensure that the ordered vectors (v1, ..., v&quot;n&quot;−1, Λv&quot;i&quot;) have a positive orientation with respect to (e1, ..., e&quot;n&quot;). If &quot;n&quot; is odd, this modification leaves the value unchanged, so this convention agrees with the normal definition of the binary product. In the case that &quot;n&quot; is even, however, the distinction must be kept. This formula_151-ary form enjoys many of the same properties as the vector cross product: it is alternating and linear in its arguments, it is perpendicular to each argument, and its magnitude gives the hypervolume of the region bounded by the arguments. And just like the vector cross product, it can be defined in a coordinate independent way as the Hodge dual of the wedge product of the arguments. Moreover, the product formula_168 satisfies the Filippov identity,
:formula_169
and so it endows Rn+1 with a structure of n-Lie algebra (see Proposition 1 of ).

== History ==
In 1773, Joseph-Louis Lagrange used the component form of both the dot and cross products in order to study the tetrahedron in three dimensions.

In 1843, William Rowan Hamilton introduced the quaternion product, and with it the terms &quot;vector&quot; and &quot;scalar&quot;. Given two quaternions and , where u and v are vectors in R3, their quaternion product can be summarized as . James Clerk Maxwell used Hamilton&#x27;s quaternion tools to develop his famous electromagnetism equations, and for this and other reasons quaternions for a time were an essential part of physics education.

In 1844, Hermann Grassmann published a geometric algebra not tied to dimension two or three. Grassmann developed several products, including a cross product represented then by . (&quot;See also: exterior algebra.&quot;)

In 1853, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, a contemporary of Grassmann, published a paper on algebraic keys which were used to solve equations and had the same multiplication properties as the cross product.

In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford, known for a precursor to the Clifford algebra named in his honor, published &quot;Elements of Dynamic&quot;, in which the term &quot;vector product&quot; is attested. In the book, this product of two vectors is defined to have magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram of which they are two sides, and direction perpendicular to their plane.

In lecture notes from 1881, Gibbs represented the cross product by formula_170 and called it the &quot;skew product&quot;. In 1901, Gibb&#x27;s student Edwin Bidwell Wilson edited and extended these lecture notes into the textbook &quot;Vector Analysis&quot;. Wilson kept the term &quot;skew product&quot;, but observed that the alternative terms &quot;cross product&quot; and &quot;vector product&quot; were more frequent.

In 1908, Cesare Burali-Forti and Roberto Marcolongo introduced the vector product notation . This is used in France and other areas until this day, as the symbol formula_2 is already used to denote multiplication and the Cartesian product.

<doc id="157093" wikidata="Q181365" url="?curid=157093" title="Dot product">
<text>In mathematics, the dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number. In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used. It is often called the inner product (or rarely the projection product) of Euclidean space, even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space (see &quot;Inner product space&quot; for more). It should not be confused with the cross product.

Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. Geometrically, it is the product of the Euclidean magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. These definitions are equivalent when using Cartesian coordinates. In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined by using vector spaces. In this case, the dot product is used for defining lengths (the length of a vector is the square root of the dot product of the vector by itself) and angles (the cosine of the angle between two vectors is the quotient of their dot product by the product of their lengths).

The name &quot;dot product&quot; is derived from the dot operator &quot; · &quot; that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name &quot;scalar product&quot; emphasizes that the result is a scalar, rather than a vector (as with the vector product in three-dimensional space).

== Definition ==
The dot product may be defined algebraically or geometrically. The geometric definition is based on the notions of angle and distance (magnitude) of vectors. The equivalence of these two definitions relies on having a Cartesian coordinate system for Euclidean space.

In modern presentations of Euclidean geometry, the points of space are defined in terms of their Cartesian coordinates, and Euclidean space itself is commonly identified with the real coordinate space formula_1. In such a presentation, the notions of length and angle are defined by means of the dot product. The length of a vector is defined as the square root of the dot product of the vector by itself, and the cosine of the (non oriented) angle between two vectors of length one is defined as their dot product. So the equivalence of the two definitions of the dot product is a part of the equivalence of the classical and the modern formulations of Euclidean geometry.

=== Coordinate definition ===
The dot product of two vectors formula_2 and specified with respect to an orthonormal basis, is defined as:
formula_3
where formula_4 denotes summation and formula_5 is the dimension of the vector space. For instance, in three-dimensional space, the dot product of vectors and is:
formula_6

Likewise, the dot product of the vector with itself is:
formula_7

If vectors are identified with column vectors, the dot product can also be written as a matrix product
formula_8
where formula_9 denotes the transpose of formula_10.

Expressing the above example in this way, a 1 × 3 matrix (row vector) is multiplied by a 3 × 1 matrix (column vector) to get a 1 × 1 matrix that is identified with its unique entry:
formula_11

=== Geometric definition ===
In Euclidean space, a Euclidean vector is a geometric object that possesses both a magnitude and a direction. A vector can be pictured as an arrow. Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction to which the arrow points. The magnitude of a vector formula_12 is denoted by formula_13. The dot product of two Euclidean vectors formula_12 and formula_15 is defined by
formula_16
where formula_17 is the angle between formula_12 and formula_15.

In particular, if the vectors formula_12 and formula_15 are orthogonal (i.e., their angle is formula_22 or formula_23), then formula_24, which implies that
formula_25
At the other extreme, if they are codirectional, then the angle between them is zero with formula_26 and
formula_27
This implies that the dot product of a vector formula_12 with itself is
formula_29
which gives
formula_30
the formula for the Euclidean length of the vector.

=== Scalar projection and first properties ===

The scalar projection (or scalar component) of a Euclidean vector formula_12 in the direction of a Euclidean vector formula_15 is given by
formula_33
where formula_17 is the angle between formula_12 and formula_15.

In terms of the geometric definition of the dot product, this can be rewritten as
formula_37
where formula_38 is the unit vector in the direction of formula_15.
The dot product is thus characterized geometrically by
formula_40
The dot product, defined in this manner, is homogeneous under scaling in each variable, meaning that for any scalar formula_41,
formula_42
It also satisfies the distributive law, meaning that
formula_43

These properties may be summarized by saying that the dot product is a bilinear form. Moreover, this bilinear form is positive definite, which means that formula_44 is never negative, and is zero if and only if formula_45, the zero vector.

=== Equivalence of the definitions ===
If formula_46 are the standard basis vectors in formula_1, then we may write
formula_48
The vectors formula_49 are an orthonormal basis, which means that they have unit length and are at right angles to each other. Since these vectors have unit length,
formula_50
and since they form right angles with each other, if formula_51,
formula_52
Thus in general, we can say that:
formula_53
where formula_54 is the Kronecker delta.

Also, by the geometric definition, for any vector formula_49 and a vector formula_12, we note that
formula_57
where formula_58 is the component of vector formula_12 in the direction of formula_49. The last step in the equality can be seen from the figure.

Now applying the distributivity of the geometric version of the dot product gives
formula_61
which is precisely the algebraic definition of the dot product. So the geometric dot product equals the algebraic dot product.

== Properties==
The dot product fulfills the following properties if formula_12, formula_15, formula_64 and formula_65 are real vectors and formula_41, formula_67, formula_68 and formula_69 are scalars.

; Commutative : formula_70 which follows from the definition (formula_17 is the angle between formula_12 and formula_15): formula_74 The commutative property can also be easily proven with the algebraic definition, and in more general spaces (where the notion of angle might not be geometrically intuitive but an analogous product can be defined) the angle between two vectors can be defined as
formula_75
; Bilinear (additive, distributive and scalar-multiplicative in both arguments) : formula_76
; Not associative : Because the dot product is not defined between a scalar formula_77 and a vector formula_78 associativity is meaningless. However, bilinearity implies formula_79 This property is sometimes called the &quot;associative law for scalar and dot product&quot;, and one may say that &quot;the dot product is associative with respect to scalar multiplication&quot;.
; Orthogonal : Two non-zero vectors formula_12 and formula_15 are &quot;orthogonal&quot; if and only if formula_82.
; No cancellation
: Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers, where if formula_83, then formula_84 always equals formula_85 unless formula_86 is zero, the dot product does not obey the cancellation law: If formula_87 and formula_88, then we can write: formula_89 by the distributive law; the result above says this just means that formula_12 is perpendicular to formula_91, which still allows formula_92, and therefore allows formula_93.
; Product rule : If formula_12 and formula_15 are vector-valued differentiable functions, then the derivative (denoted by a prime formula_96) of formula_77 is given by the rule formula_98

=== Application to the law of cosines ===

Given two vectors formula_99 and formula_100 separated by angle formula_17 (see the upper image), they form a triangle with a third side formula_102. Let formula_103, formula_104 and formula_105 denote the lengths of formula_99, formula_100, and formula_108, respectively. The dot product of this with itself is:
formula_109
which is the law of cosines.
== Triple product ==
There are two ternary operations involving dot product and cross product.

The scalar triple product of three vectors is defined as
formula_110
Its value is the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the Cartesian coordinates of the three vectors. It is the signed volume of the parallelepiped defined by the three vectors, and is isomorphic to the three-dimensional special case of the exterior product of three vectors.

The vector triple product is defined by
formula_111
This identity, also known as &quot;Lagrange&#x27;s formula&quot;, may be remembered as &quot;ACB minus ABC&quot;, keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together. This formula has applications in simplifying vector calculations in physics.

== Physics ==
In physics, the dot product takes two vectors and returns a scalar quantity. It is also known as the &quot;scalar product&quot;. The dot product of two vectors can be defined as the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. Thus, formula_112 Alternatively, it is defined as the product of the projection of the first vector onto the second vector and the magnitude of the second vector.

For example:
* Mechanical work is the dot product of force and displacement vectors,
* Power is the dot product of force and velocity.

== Generalizations ==

=== Complex vectors ===
For vectors with complex entries, using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different properties. For instance, the dot product of a vector with itself could be zero without the vector being the zero vector (e.g. this would happen with the vector This in turn would have consequences for notions like length and angle. Properties such as the positive-definite norm can be salvaged at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the dot product, through the alternative definition
formula_113
where formula_114 is the complex conjugate of formula_115. When vectors are represented by column vectors, the dot product can be expressed as a matrix product involving a conjugate transpose, denoted with the superscript H:
formula_116

In the case of vectors with real components, this definition is the same as in the real case. The dot product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number, and it is nonzero except for the zero vector. However, the complex dot product is sesquilinear rather than bilinear, as it is conjugate linear and not linear in formula_12. The dot product is not symmetric, since
formula_118
The angle between two complex vectors is then given by
formula_119

The complex dot product leads to the notions of Hermitian forms and general inner product spaces, which are widely used in mathematics and physics.

The self dot product of a complex vector formula_120, involving the conjugate transpose of a row vector, is also known as the norm squared, formula_121, after the Euclidean norm; it is a vector generalization of the &quot;absolute square&quot; of a complex scalar (see also: &quot;Squared Euclidean distance&quot;).

=== Inner product ===

The inner product generalizes the dot product to abstract vector spaces over a field of scalars, being either the field of real numbers formula_122 or the field of complex numbers formula_123. It is usually denoted using angular brackets by formula_124.

The inner product of two vectors over the field of complex numbers is, in general, a complex number, and is sesquilinear instead of bilinear. An inner product space is a normed vector space, and the inner product of a vector with itself is real and positive-definite.

=== Functions ===
The dot product is defined for vectors that have a finite number of entries. Thus these vectors can be regarded as discrete functions: a length-formula_5 vector formula_126 is, then, a function with domain formula_127, and formula_128 is a notation for the image of formula_129 by the function/vector formula_126.

This notion can be generalized to square-integrable functions: just as the inner product on vectors uses a sum over corresponding components, the inner product on functions is defined as an integral over some measure space formula_131:
formula_132

For example, if formula_133 and formula_134 are continuous functions over a compact subset formula_135 of formula_136 with the standard Lebesgue measure, the above definition becomes:
formula_137

Generalized further to complex continuous functions formula_138 and formula_139, by analogy with the complex inner product above, gives:
formula_140

=== Weight function ===
Inner products can have a weight function (i.e., a function which weights each term of the inner product with a value). Explicitly, the inner product of functions formula_141 and formula_142 with respect to the weight function formula_143 is
formula_144

=== Dyadics and matrices ===
A double-dot product for matrices is the Frobenius inner product, which is analogous to the dot product on vectors. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices formula_145 and formula_146 of the same size:
formula_147
And for real matrices,
formula_148

Writing a matrix as a dyadic, we can define a different double-dot product (see &quot;&quot;) however it is not an inner product.

=== Tensors ===
The inner product between a tensor of order formula_5 and a tensor of order formula_150 is a tensor of order formula_151, see &quot;Tensor contraction&quot; for details.

== Computation ==

=== Algorithms ===

The straightforward algorithm for calculating a floating-point dot product of vectors can suffer from catastrophic cancellation. To avoid this, approaches such as the Kahan summation algorithm are used.
