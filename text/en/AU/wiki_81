<text>Cleansing is the fourth album by the American heavy metal band Prong, released on January 25, 1994, by Epic Records. It was produced by Terry Date, whereas Prong&#x27;s previous two albums had been produced by Mark Dodson. The album features ex-Killing Joke members Paul Raven on bass guitar and John Bechdel on keyboards and programming. Featuring an industrial-influenced sound, the record received moderate commercial success.

The single &quot;Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck&quot; received a commercial interest; its music video received heavy rotation on MTV and was featured on an episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. As a part of the album&#x27;s promotion, the band toured with Sepultura and Pantera as an opener for their &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; tours, respectively.

The record was reissued by SPV/Steamhammer in 2008.

==Background and style==
Prong&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist Tommy Victor has stated that the record was largely written in the bathroom of his Williamsburg apartment on an acoustic guitar at night. Despite the label&#x27;s opposition, the band chose Terry Date as the producer, recording the tracks at Bad Animals and Magic Shop recording studios. The album was mixed at Electric Lady Studios.

Compared to band&#x27;s New York hardcore-infused 1980s work, &quot;Cleansing&quot; incorporates Pantera-influenced guitar grooves and industrial metal sounds; the album&#x27;s style was also described as alternative metal. According to Victor, the band &quot;really went in the direction of anything that wasn&#x27;t thrash metal, because we were sick of the whole thing,&quot; with The Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Vision Thing&quot; being an influence on the record.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the record as &quot;the band&#x27;s most varied and best record yet,&quot; remarking that the record &quot;tightens up their trademark drilling guitars while adding some slight techno and industrial touches.&quot; Erlewine further noted that the new elements &quot;heightens the tension&quot; but also &quot;strengthens their already muscular metallic roar.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot;″s Joel McIver described the record as &quot;a respectable seller rather than a monster&quot; and wrote: &quot;although the album sounds great to this day, all slablike, noisegated riffs and pulsating beats, it wasn&#x27;t to be.&quot; McIver also compared the staccato guitar sound to the more commercial works of Fear Factory.
Jason Roche of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; included &quot;Cleansing&quot; on his list of Top 20 New York Hardcore and Metals Albums, saying that it &quot;proved to be as catchy as it was heavy&quot;. Tommy Victor has ranked it as the second best Prong album.

<doc id="155264" wikidata="Q1743870" url="?curid=155264" title="Kite aerial photography">
<text>Kite aerial photography (KAP) is a type of photography. A camera is lifted using a kite and is triggered either remotely or automatically to take aerial photographs. The camera rigs can range from the extremely simple, consisting of a trigger mechanism with a disposable camera, to complex apparatus using radio control and digital cameras. On some occasions it can be a good alternative to other forms of aerial photography.

==Camera rig and stabilisation==

The camera can be attached directly to the kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line at a distance from the kite. This distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher, stable air before the camera is attached. If possible, the camera is set to a high shutter speed to reduce motion blur. Cameras using internal image stabilization features can increase the number of sharp photos. In order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon, a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line.

===Pendulum suspension===

This simple levelling method involves suspending the camera from a rigid length of material below the kite line. Gravity naturally keeps the rig level, irrespective of the angle of the kite line. The pendulum will oscillate due to movement from the kite line and wind pressure, but the camera will remain steadier and more level than without a pendulum.

===Picavet suspension===
A Picavet suspension, named after its French inventor, Pierre Picavet, consists of a rigid cross suspended below the kite line from two points. A single line is threaded several times between the points of the cross and the points of attachment to the kite line and the rig is attached to the cross. The Picavet line runs through eye hooks or small pulleys so that the weight of the rig causes it to settle naturally into a level position. The dimensions and shape of the Picavet have been adapted many times in attempts to increase stability or to improve portability.

==Shutter release and camera positioning==
The shutter of the camera can be released in several ways, depending on the type of camera and complexity of the rig electronics, if used. Shutter release mechanisms include using a radio controlled servo to press the shutter release button, using an infrared signal or wired connection to instruct the camera to release the shutter, or by using the camera&#x27;s inbuilt intervalometer. Ideally the camera is allowed to reach its final altitude before the shutter is released to avoid taking photos during launch.

Fixing the camera directly to the kite or line makes changes to positioning awkward. If the camera is fitted within a frame, this &#x27;rig&#x27; can be designed to rotate horizontally and vertically and to change the picture format from portrait to landscape by rotating the camera. Adjustments to these angles can be made by manually setting the rig on the ground or by adjusting the rig while it is airborne using a remote control or an automatic controller in the rig. Commonly a radio control system, as used for model aircraft is used. The servos in these systems are readily adaptable to adjust rig positioning. Several automatic controllers have been developed that can take a photo, move the camera by a set angle, take the next photo and so on.

==Kites==

The most important aspect of any kite used to lift a camera is stability. Generally, single lined kites are used as they allow very long line lengths and need less intervention from the flyer than steerable designs. Almost any stable kite design can be used to lift lightweight camera rigs (up to approx 500g/1 lb). As weight increases, specific designs are chosen for their additional flying characteristics, such as line pull, wind speed, flying angle and ease of launch. Widely used designs are parafoil, rokkaku, delta (including variations such as delta conyne) and the new lighter-than-air helikite design. Of these, the parafoil is most popular as it generates a strong pull for its size, and can be easily stored in a small space due to its sparless construction. Sparred kites such as the rokkaku or delta tend to fly at a higher angle than parafoils, which is of benefit when the space between the launch site and photographic subject is limited. A higher flying angle permits the kite to lift more weight, as more of the generated force is acting vertically. Helikites allow reliable KAP in difficult conditions, thus opening up the use of KAP for professional photography.

==History==

The first kite aerial photographs were taken by British meteorologist Douglas Archibald in 1887 and by Arthur Batut in Labruguière (France) in 1888.

Manned kite flying and aerial photography were advanced also by French Marcel Maillot, British Robert Baden-Powell, Americans Charles Lamson and William Abner Eddy, Australian Lawrence Hargrave (inventor of box kite in 1893 and kite train in 1884) and French Captain Saconney.

A famous aerial photo of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake was taken by an early pioneer in KAP, George Lawrence, using a large panoramic camera and stabilizing rig he designed.
==KAP today==

With the advent of the Internet, light and affordable digital cameras, radio control and microelectronics, kite aerial photography has become increasingly popular. In latter years, kits have become available that enable a beginner to quickly assemble a functional KAP rig and start taking aerial pictures in the visible part of the spectrum and, with more experience, in the ultra-violet, near and thermal infra-red parts of the spectrum too.

Practical and commercial use of KAP is limited by the unpredictability of the weather (notably wind, sun and rain) and the fact that not every site is suitable to flying a kite. Launching a kite near buildings or downwind of trees can be problematic, due to heavy turbulence. The main applications today are amateur photography, art and, especially, archaeology as described on the webpages of the West Lothian Archaeological Trust. Another growing application is its use for community mapping and environmental monitoring by the widespread Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Research scientists are using kite aerial photography for monitoring bird species and also for studies in the geographical and geological sciences, including photogrammetry. Increasingly, kites are being employed where the use of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV, commonly known as a drone) is either impractical, or encounters legal or other constraints. Attempts to commercialize KAP have so far been largely unsuccessful.

<doc id="155265" wikidata="Q755" url="?curid=155265" title="Paul Verlaine">
<text>Paul-Marie Verlaine ( ; ; 30 March 1844 – 8 January 1896) was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement and the Decadent movement. He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; in international and French poetry.

==Biography==

===Early life=== 
Born in Metz, Verlaine was educated at the &quot;Lycée Impérial Bonaparte&quot; (now the Lycée Condorcet) in Paris and then took up a post in the civil service. He began writing poetry at an early age, and was initially influenced by the Parnassien movement and its leader, Leconte de Lisle. Verlaine&#x27;s first published poem was published in 1863 in &quot;La Revue du progrès&quot;, a publication founded by poet Louis-Xavier de Ricard. Verlaine was a frequenter of the salon of the Marquise de Ricard (Louis-Xavier de Ricard&#x27;s mother) at 10 Boulevard des Batignolles and other social venues, where he rubbed shoulders with prominent artistic figures of the day: Anatole France, Emmanuel Chabrier, inventor-poet and humorist Charles Cros, the cynical anti-bourgeois idealist Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam, Théodore de Banville, François Coppée, Jose-Maria de Heredia, Leconte de Lisle, Catulle Mendes and others. Verlaine&#x27;s first published collection, &quot;Poèmes saturniens&quot; (1866), though adversely commented upon by Sainte-Beuve, established him as a poet of promise and originality.

===Marriage and military service===
Mathilde Mauté became Verlaine&#x27;s wife in 1870. At the proclamation of the Third Republic in the same year, Verlaine joined the 160th battalion of the &quot;Garde nationale&quot;, turning Communard on 18 March 1871.

Verlaine became head of the press bureau of the Central Committee of the Paris Commune. Verlaine escaped the deadly street fighting known as the Bloody Week, or &quot;Semaine Sanglante&quot;, and went into hiding in the Pas-de-Calais.

===Relationships with Rimbaud and Létinois===
Verlaine returned to Paris in August 1871, and, in September, received the first letter from Arthur Rimbaud, who admired his poetry. Verlaine urged Rimbaud to come to Paris, and by 1872, he had lost interest in Mathilde, and effectively abandoned her and their son, preferring the company of Rimbaud, who was by now his lover. Rimbaud and Verlaine&#x27;s stormy affair took them to London in 1872. In Brussels in July 1873, in a drunken, jealous rage, he fired two shots with a pistol at Rimbaud, wounding his left wrist, though not seriously injuring the poet. As an indirect result of this incident, Verlaine was arrested and imprisoned at Mons, where he underwent a re-conversion to Roman Catholicism, which again influenced his work and provoked Rimbaud&#x27;s sharp criticism.

The poems collected in &quot;Romances sans paroles&quot; (1874) were written between 1872 and 1873, inspired by Verlaine&#x27;s nostalgically coloured recollections of his life with Mathilde on the one hand and impressionistic sketches of his on-again off-again year-long escapade with Rimbaud on the other. &quot;Romances sans paroles&quot; was published while Verlaine was imprisoned. Following his release from prison, Verlaine again travelled to England, where he worked for some years as a teacher, teaching French, Latin, Greek and drawing at William Lovell&#x27;s school in Stickney in Lincolnshire.
From there he went to teach in nearby Boston, before moving to Bournemouth. While in England, he produced another successful collection, &quot;Sagesse&quot;. Verlaine returned to France in 1877 and, while teaching English at a school in Rethel, fell in love with one of his pupils, Lucien Létinois, who inspired Verlaine to write further poems. Verlaine was devastated when Létinois died of typhus in 1883.

===Final years===
Verlaine&#x27;s last years saw his descent into drug addiction, alcoholism, and poverty. He lived in slums and public hospitals, and spent his days drinking absinthe in Paris cafés. However, the people&#x27;s love for his art resurrected support and brought in an income for Verlaine: his early poetry was rediscovered, his lifestyle and strange behaviour in front of crowds attracted admiration, and in 1894 he was elected France&#x27;s &quot;Prince of Poets&quot; by his peers.

Verlaine&#x27;s poetry was admired and recognized as ground-breaking, and served as a source of inspiration to composers. Gabriel Fauré composed many mélodies, such as the song cycles &quot;Cinq mélodies &quot;de Venise&quot;&quot; and &quot;La bonne chanson&quot;, which were settings of Verlaine&#x27;s poems. Claude Debussy set to music &quot;Clair de lune&quot; and six of the &quot;Fêtes galantes&quot; poems, forming part of the &quot;mélodie&quot; collection known as the &quot;Recueil Vasnier&quot;; he also made another setting of &quot;Clair de lune&quot;, and the poem inspired the third movement of his Suite bergamasque. Reynaldo Hahn set several of Verlaine&#x27;s poems as did the Belgian-British composer Poldowski (daughter of Henryk Wieniawski) and German composer Anna Teichmüller.

Verlaine&#x27;s drug dependence and alcoholism took a toll on his life. He died in Paris at the age of 51 on 8 January 1896; he was buried in the Cimetière des Batignolles (he was first buried in the 20th division, but his grave was moved to the 11th division—on the roundabout, a much better location—when the Boulevard Périphérique was built).

A bust monument to Verlaine sculpted by Rodo was erected in 1911. It sits in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris.

==Style==

Much of the French poetry produced during the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; was characterized as &quot;decadent&quot; for its lurid content or moral vision. In a similar vein, Verlaine used the expression &quot;poète maudit&quot; (&quot;cursed poet&quot;) in 1884 to refer to a number of poets like Stéphane Mallarmé, Arthur Rimbaud, Aloysius Bertrand, Comte de Lautréamont, Tristan Corbière or Alice de Chambrier, who had fought against poetic conventions and suffered social rebuke, or were ignored by the critics. But with the publication of Jean Moréas&#x27; &quot;Symbolist Manifesto&quot; in 1886, it was the term symbolism which was most often applied to the new literary environment. Along with Verlaine, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, Paul Valéry, Albert Samain and many others began to be referred to as &quot;Symbolists.&quot; These poets would often share themes that parallel Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics and notions of will, fatality and unconscious forces, and used themes of sex (such as prostitutes), the city, irrational phenomena (delirium, dreams, narcotics, alcohol), and sometimes a vaguely medieval setting.

In poetry, the symbolist procedure—as typified by Verlaine—was to use subtle suggestion instead of precise statement (rhetoric was banned) and to evoke moods and feelings through the magic of words and repeated sounds and the cadence of verse (musicality) and metrical innovation.

Verlaine described his typically decadent style in great detail in his poem &quot;Art Poétique,&quot; describing the primacy of musicality and the importance of elusiveness and &quot;the Odd.&quot; He spoke of veils and nuance and implored poets to &quot;Keep away from the murderous Sharp Saying, Cruel Wit, and Impure Laugh.&quot; It is with these lyrical veils in mind that Verlaine concluded by suggesting that a poem should be a &quot;happy occurrence.&quot;

==Portraits==
Numerous artists painted Verlaine&#x27;s portrait. Among the most illustrious were Henri Fantin-Latour, Antonio de la Gándara, Eugène Carrière, Gustave Courbet, Frédéric Cazalis, and Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen.

==Historical footnote==

* In preparation for Operation Overlord, the BBC via Radio Londres had signaled to the French Resistance that the opening lines of the 1866 Verlaine poem &quot;Chanson d&#x27;automne&quot; were to indicate the start of D-Day operations. The first three lines of the poem, &quot;&quot;Les sanglots longs&quot; / &quot;Des violons&quot; / &quot;De l&#x27;automne&quot;&quot; (&quot;Long sobs of autumn violins&quot;), meant that Operation Overlord was to start within two weeks. These lines were broadcast on 1 June 1944. The next set of lines, &quot;&quot;Blessent mon coeur&quot; / &quot;D&#x27;une langueur&quot; / &quot;Monotone&quot;&quot; (&quot;wound my heart with a monotonous languor&quot;), meant that it would start within 48 hours and that the resistance should begin sabotage operations especially on the French railroad system; these lines were broadcast on 5 June at 23:15.

==Legacy==
Among the admirers of Verlaine&#x27;s work was the Russian language poet and novelist Boris Pasternak. Pasternak went so far as to translate much of Verlaine&#x27;s verse into Russian. According to Pasternak&#x27;s mistress and muse, Olga Ivinskaya,Whenever [Pasternak] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating Paul Verlaine in a burst of enthusiasm like this – &quot;L&#x27;Art poétique&quot; was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry. 

=== Media portrayals ===
Verlaine&#x27;s relationship with Rimbaud was dramatised in the 1964 Australian TV play &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;, the 1995 film &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, based on Christopher Hampton&#x27;s 1967 play of the same name. and Jessica Benhamou&#x27;s 2025 film, Alchemy of the Word, starring James Craven as Rimbaud and Jordan Luke Gage as Verlaine.

==Works in English (translation)==
Although widely regarded as a major French poet—to the effect that towards the end of his life he was sobriquetted as &quot;Le Prince des Poètes&quot; (The Prince of Poets) in the French-speaking world—surprisingly very few of Verlaine&#x27;s major works have been translated &quot;in their entirety&quot; (vs. selections therefrom) into English. Here is a list to help track those known to exist.

<text>A power trio is a rock and roll band format having a lineup of electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit, leaving out a dedicated vocalist or an additional rhythm guitar or keyboard instrument that are often used in other rock music bands that are quartets and quintets. Larger rock bands often use one or more additional rhythm sections to fill out the sound with chords and harmony parts.

Most power trios in hard rock and heavy metal music use the electric guitar player in two roles; during much of the song, they play rhythm guitar, playing the chord progression for the song and performing the song&#x27;s important riffs, and then switching to a lead guitar role during the guitar solo. While one or more band members typically sing while playing their instruments, power trios in hard rock and heavy metal music generally emphasize instrumental performance and overall sonic impact over vocals and lyrics.

==History==
The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes while still being able to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the organ trio, a 1960s-era soul jazz group centered on the amplified Hammond organ, a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its blues rock incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of Chicago-style blues bands such as Muddy Waters&#x27; trio.
In addition to technological improvements, another impetus for the rise of the power trio was the virtuosity of guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Rory Gallagher, who could essentially cover both the rhythm guitar and lead guitar roles in a live performance. In 1964, Frank Zappa played guitar in a power trio, the Muthers, with Paul Woods on bass and Les Papp on drums. In 1966, the prototypical blues-rock power trio Cream was formed, consisting of Eric Clapton on guitar/vocals, Jack Bruce on bass/vocals, and Ginger Baker on drums. Other influential 1960s-era blues rock/hard rock power trio bands were the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Blue Cheer, Grand Funk Railroad, the James Gang featuring Joe Walsh, and Taste.
Well-known 1970s-era power trios include the Canadian progressive rock groups Rush and Triumph, the American band ZZ Top, the English heavy metal band Motörhead, and the Robin Trower Band. Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (as well as its offshoot Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell) is usually considered a power trio as Keith Emerson fulfilled the rhythm and lead playing on the keyboards that would usually fall on the guitarist, while bassist (and occasional guitarist) Greg Lake on vocals. In 1968, the power trio Manal was formed in Argentina, and were the first group that composed blues music in Spanish. 

Budgie were a Welsh Blues rock heavy metal band from Cardiff who formed in 1967. The band are considered a classic power trio who released ten albums. Budgie were one of the earliest heavy metal bands, and, according to Garry Sharpe-Young were a seminal influence on many acts of that scene, particularly the new wave of British heavy metal, and later acts such as Metallica, who covered &quot; Breadfan&quot; and &quot;Crash Course in Brain Surgery&quot; on their album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; The band have been noted as &quot;among the heaviest metal of its day&quot;.
After the 1970s, the phrase &quot;power trio&quot; was applied to the new wave group the Police, grunge band Nirvana, extreme metal bands Hellhammer and Gallhammer, alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü and Concrete Blonde, mod revivalists the Jam, hard rock/progressive metal band King&#x27;s X, post-grunge band Silverchair, alternative bands the Presidents of the United States of America, Goo Goo Dolls, Primus, Everclear, Muse, and Eve 6, pop punk bands such as Green Day, Blink-182, Alkaline Trio and MxPx, and Argentine rock bands like Soda Stereo, Divididos, A.N.I.M.A.L., and From Power Project. Also, by the 1990s, rock trios began to form around different instrumentation, from the band Morphine, featuring a baritone saxophone instead of an electric guitar, to Ben Folds Five&#x27;s replacing the guitar with various keyboards, principally the piano.

<text>Krzysztof Kieślowski (; 27 June 1941 – 14 March 1996) was a Polish film director and screenwriter. He is known internationally for &quot;Dekalog&quot; (1989), &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; (1991), and the &quot;Three Colours&quot; trilogy (1993–1994). Kieślowski received numerous awards during his career, including the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize (1988), FIPRESCI Prize (1988, 1991), and Prize of the Ecumenical Jury (1991); the Venice Film Festival FIPRESCI Prize (1989), Golden Lion (1993), and OCIC Award (1993); and the Berlin International Film Festival Silver Bear (1994). In 1995, he received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

In 2002, Kieślowski was listed at number two on the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; list of the top ten film directors of modern times. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked him at No. 47 on its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list.

==Early life==
Kieślowski was born in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Barbara (&quot;née&quot; Szonert) and Roman Kieślowski. He grew up in several small towns, moving wherever his engineer father, a tuberculosis patient, could find treatment. He was raised Roman Catholic and retained what he called a &quot;personal and private&quot; relationship with God. At sixteen, he attended a firefighters&#x27; training school but dropped out after three months. Without any career goals, he then entered the College for Theatre Technicians in Warsaw in 1957 because it was run by a relative. He wanted to become a theatre director, but lacked the required bachelor&#x27;s degree for the theatre department, so he chose to study film as an intermediate step.

==Career==
Leaving college and working as a theatrical tailor, Kieślowski applied to the Łódź Film School, which has Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda among its alumni. He was rejected twice. To avoid compulsory military service during this time, he briefly became an art student, and also went on a drastic diet to make himself medically unfit for service. After several months of avoiding the draft, he was accepted to the school&#x27;s directing department in 1964, on his third attempt. He attended Łódź Film School until 1968 and, despite state censorship and interdiction on foreign travel, was able to travel around Poland for his documentary research and filming. Kieślowski lost his interest in theatre and decided to make documentary films.

=== 1966–1980: Early work ===

Kieślowski&#x27;s early documentaries focused on the everyday lives of city dwellers, workers, and soldiers. Though he was not an overtly political filmmaker, he soon found that attempting to depict Polish life accurately brought him into conflict with the authorities. His television film &quot;Workers &#x27;71: Nothing About Us Without Us&quot;, which showed workers discussing the reasons for the mass strikes of 1970, was only shown in a drastically censored form. After &quot;Workers &#x27;71&quot;, he turned his eye on the authorities themselves in &quot;Curriculum Vitae&quot;, a film that combined documentary footage of Politburo meetings with a fictional story about a man under scrutiny by the officials. Though Kieślowski believed the film&#x27;s message was anti-authoritarian, he was criticized by his colleagues for cooperating with the government in its production.
Kieślowski later said that he abandoned documentary filmmaking due to two experiences: the censorship of &quot;Workers &#x27;71&quot;, which caused him to doubt whether truth could be told literally under an authoritarian regime, and an incident during the filming of &quot;Station&quot; (1981) in which some of his footage was nearly used as evidence in a criminal case. He decided that fiction not only allowed more artistic freedom but could portray everyday life more truthfully.

=== 1975–1988: Polish film career ===
His first non-documentary feature, &quot;Personnel&quot; (1975), was made for television and won him first prize at the Mannheim Film Festival. Both &quot;Personnel&quot; and his next feature, &quot;The Scar&quot; (&quot;Blizna&quot;), were works of social realism with large casts: &quot;Personnel&quot; was about technicians working on a stage production, based on his early college experience, and &quot;The Scar&quot; showed the upheaval of a small town by a poorly planned industrial project. These films were shot in a documentary style with many nonprofessional actors; like his earlier films, they portrayed everyday life under the weight of an oppressive system, but without overt commentary. &quot;Camera Buff&quot; (&quot;Amator&quot;, 1979) (which won the grand prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival) and &quot;Blind Chance&quot; (&quot;Przypadek&quot;, 1981) continued along similar lines, but focused more on the ethical choices faced by a single character rather than a community. During this period, Kieślowski was considered part of a loose movement with other Polish directors of the time, including Janusz Kijowski, Andrzej Wajda, and Agnieszka Holland, called the Cinema of moral anxiety. His links with these directors, Holland in particular, caused concern within the Polish government, and each of his early films was subjected to censorship and enforced re-shooting/re-editing, if not banned outright. For example, &quot;Blind Chance&quot; was not released domestically until 1987, almost six years after it had been completed.

&quot;No End&quot; (&quot;Bez końca&quot;, 1984) was perhaps his most clearly political film, depicting political trials in Poland during martial law, from the unusual point of view of a lawyer&#x27;s ghost and his widow. At the time it was harshly criticized by both the government, dissidents, and the church. Starting with &quot;No End&quot;, Kieślowski closely collaborated with two people, the composer Zbigniew Preisner and the trial lawyer Krzysztof Piesiewicz, whom Kieślowski met while researching political trials under martial law for a planned documentary on the subject. Piesiewicz co-wrote the screenplays for all of Kieślowski&#x27;s subsequent films. Preisner is best known for collaborating with Kieślowski on the scores for the Three Colors trilogy.

Preisner provided the musical score for &quot;No End&quot; and most subsequent of Kieślowski&#x27;s films and often plays a prominent part. Many of Preisner&#x27;s pieces are referred to and discussed by the films&#x27; characters as being the work of the (fictional) Dutch composer &quot;Van den Budenmayer&quot;.

&quot;Dekalog&quot; (1988), a series of ten short films set in a Warsaw tower block, each nominally based on one of the Ten Commandments, was created for Polish television with funding from West Germany; it is now one of the most critically acclaimed film cycles of all time. Co-written by Kieślowski and Piesiewicz, the ten one-hour-long episodes had originally been intended for ten different directors, but Kieślowski found himself unable to relinquish control over the project and directed all episodes himself. Episodes five and six were released internationally in a longer form as &quot;A Short Film About Killing&quot; and &quot;A Short Film About Love&quot; respectively. Kieślowski had also planned to shoot a full-length version of Episode 9 under the title &quot;A Short Film About Jealousy&quot;, but exhaustion eventually prevented him from making what would have been his thirteenth film in less than a year.

=== 1990–1994: Commercial success abroad ===
Kieślowski&#x27;s last four films, his most commercially successful, were foreign co-productions, made mainly with money from France and in particular from Romanian-born producer Marin Karmitz. These focused on moral and metaphysical issues along lines similar to &quot;Dekalog&quot; and &quot;Blind Chance&quot; but on a more abstract level, with smaller casts, more internal stories, and less interest in communities. Poland appeared in these films mostly through the eyes of European outsiders.

The first of these was &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; (&quot;La double vie de Veronique&quot;, 1990), which starred Irène Jacob. The commercial success of this film gave Kieślowski the funding for his ambitious final films (1993–94), the trilogy &quot;Three Colours&quot; (&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;), which explores the virtues symbolized by the French flag. The three films garnered prestigious international awards, including the Golden Lion for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival and the Silver Bear for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival, in addition to three Academy Award nominations.

Kieślowski announced his retirement from filmmaking after the premiere of his last film &quot;Red&quot; at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.

===Posthumous work===
At the time of his death, Kieślowski was working with his longterm collaborator Piesiewicz on a second trilogy: Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. After his death, the scripts were adapted and produced by three different directors: &quot;Heaven&quot; by Tom Tykwer in 2002; &quot;Hell&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot;) by Danis Tanović in 2005; and &quot;Purgatory&quot; in 2007.

==Personal life==

Kieślowski married his lifelong love, Maria (Marysia) Cautillo, on 21 January 1967 during his final year in film school. They had a daughter, Marta ( 8 January 1972), and remained married until his death.

He characterized himself as having &quot;one good characteristic, I am a pessimist. I always imagine the worst. To me, the future is a black hole.&quot; He has been described as &quot;conveying the sadness of a world-weary sage&quot;, &quot;a brooding intellectual and habitual pessimist&quot;. When visiting the United States, he was amazed at &quot;the pursuit of empty talk combined with a very high degree of self-satisfaction&quot;. Film director and Kieślowski&#x27;s friend, Agnieszka Holland, revealed that he used to experience depressive states.

He described himself as an agnostic; however, he considered the Old Testament and the Biblical Decalogue as a moral compass in difficult times.

== Death ==
On 14 March 1996, less than two years after he had retired, Kieślowski died at age 54 during open-heart surgery following a heart attack. He was interred in Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. His grave has a sculpture of the thumb and forefingers of two hands forming an oblong space; the classic view as if through a film camera. The small sculpture is in black marble on a pedestal slightly over a metre tall. The slab with Kieślowski&#x27;s name and dates lies below.

==Legacy==

Kieślowski remains one of Europe&#x27;s most influential directors, his works included in the study of film classes at universities throughout the world. The 1993 book &quot;Kieślowski on Kieślowski&quot; describes his life and work in his own words, based on interviews by Danusia Stok. He is also the subject of a biographical film, &quot;Krzysztof Kieślowski: I&#x27;m So-So&quot; (1995), directed by Krzysztof Wierzbicki.

After Kieślowski&#x27;s death, Harvey Weinstein, then head of Miramax Films, which distributed the last four Kieślowski films in the US, wrote a eulogy for him in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine.

Though he had claimed to be retiring after &quot;Three Colours&quot;, at the time of his death, Kieślowski was working on a new trilogy co-written with Piesiewicz, consisting of &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;Hell&quot;, and &quot;Purgatory&quot; and inspired by Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. As was originally intended for &quot;Dekalog&quot;, the scripts were ostensibly intended to be given to other directors for filming, but Kieślowski&#x27;s untimely death means it is unknown whether he might have broken his self-imposed retirement to direct the trilogy himself. The only completed screenplay, &quot;Heaven&quot;, was filmed by Tom Tykwer and premiered in 2002 at the Berlin International Film Festival. 
The other two scripts existed only as thirty-page treatments at the time of Kieślowski&#x27;s death; Piesiewicz has since completed these screenplays, with &quot;Hell&quot;, directed by Bosnian director Danis Tanović and starring Emmanuelle Béart, released in 2005. 
&quot;Purgatory&quot;, about a photographer killed in the Bosnian war, remains unproduced. 
The 2007 film &quot;Nadzieja (Hope)&quot;, directed by Ibo Kurdo and Stanislaw Mucha, also scripted by Piesiewicz, has been incorrectly identified as the third part of the trilogy, but is in fact, an unrelated project.

Jerzy Stuhr, who starred in several Kieślowski films and co-wrote &quot;Camera Buff&quot;, filmed his own adaptation of an unfilmed Kieślowski script as &quot;The Big Animal&quot; (&quot;Duże zwierzę&quot;) in 2000.
In an interview given at Oxford University in 1995, Kieślowski said:
It comes from a deep-rooted conviction that if there is anything worthwhile doing for the sake of culture, then it is touching on subject matters and situations which link people, and not those that divide people. There are too many things in the world which divide people, such as religion, politics, history, and nationalism. ... Feelings are what link people together, because the word &#x27;love&#x27; has the same meaning for everybody. Or &#x27;fear&#x27;, or &#x27;suffering&#x27;. We all fear the same way and the same things. And we all love in the same way. That&#x27;s why I tell about these things, because in all other things I immediately find division.

In the foreword to &quot;Dekalog: The Ten Commandments&quot;, American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick wrote: 
In 2012, Cyrus Frisch voted for &quot;A Short Film About Killing&quot; as one of &quot;the best-damned films&quot; with the comment: &quot;In Poland, this film was instrumental in the abolition of the death penalty.&quot; Since 1952, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine conducts a poll every ten years of the world&#x27;s finest film directors to determine the Ten Greatest Films of All Time, which has become the most recognised poll of its kind in the world.

Since 2011, the Polish Contemporary Art Foundation In Situ has been organizing The Sokołowsko Film Festival: Hommage à Kieślowski. It is an annual film festival in Sokołowsko, where Kieślowski spent a part of his youth, and commemorates the director&#x27;s work with screenings of his films, as well as films of younger generations of filmmakers both from Poland and Europe, accompanied by creative workshops, panel discussions, performances, exhibitions and concerts.

On June 27, 2021, Google celebrated his 80th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Filmography==
In total, Kieślowski wrote and directed 48 films, out of which 11 are feature films, 19 are documentaries, 12 are TV films, and 6 are shorts.

<text>Britwell is a residential housing estate and civil parish in the north west of Slough, Berkshire, South East England. It is about west of Charing Cross, the centremost point of London.

The name Britwell derives from the old English &quot;beorhtan wiellan&quot; meaning &#x27;bright, clear well&#x27;.

==History==

The place now known as the Britwell Estate was originally farm land. Modern-day Britwell, which has the well-defined geographic boundaries of Farnham Lane (in the north), Lower Britwell Road and Haymill Road (to the west), Whittaker Road and Northborough Road (south) and Long Readings Lane (east), was created as a large overspill housing estate for bombed-out Londoners at the end of the Second World War. Britwell was one of a number of London County Council estates built at the time, with other estates in places including Langley and Swindon. The first of 11,000 tenants arrived in August 1956 and were delighted with the &quot;roomy and modern&quot; houses, complete with large swivel windows – &quot;a boon to housewives&quot;. There was a dearth of amenities at first, but after the founding of the community association in 1959, the estate finally got a bus service into Slough, and a community centre in 1966.

When the Britwell Estate was created, its postal address was Farnham Royal, near Slough. The local authority at the time was Eton Rural District Council in the county of Buckinghamshire.

In 1965, the London County Council was one of a number of authorities replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC). When the GLC was in turn abolished in 1986, the social housing on Britwell was transferred to Slough Borough Council. Mortgages issued by the GLC authority were transferred to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.

==Government==
Following the Local Government Act 1972, Britwell was transferred to Berkshire, to form part of the borough of Slough. A civil parish was established at that point for the part of the estate that had previously lain in the Burnham civil parish. The current Parish Council had 13 parish councillors and covers approximately 60% of the Britwell Estate.

The Britwell Electoral ward included the parish area and extends westwards to the Five Points crossroads in Burnham. It has three borough councillors. The southern part of Long Readings Lane and the south side of Cowper Road became part of the Britwell ward for the first time in 2004 following a Boundary Commission review.

The Parish Council have provided premises for use as a Neighbourhood Police Office within their parish ground; this is well used by the local beat team, PCSOs and community wardens.

In 2018 the parish, and neighbouring Wexham Court, were scheduled for abolition in April 2019, but after an appeal by the parish councils and a judicial review the order was quashed and the parishes remain unchanged.

==Geography==
Britwell has two Local nature reserves, the first is on the South Western border of the village called Haymill Valley, and the other is on the northern border called Cocksherd Wood.

==In the media==
Britwell&#x27;s row of shops featured as a backdrop in the dystopia themed movie &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. Britwell has also featured in the ITV drama &quot;Torn&quot;. The shops also represented 1970s Belfast in the film &quot;Titanic Town&quot; starring Julie Walters.

<text>Chalvey () is a former village, which is now a suburb of Slough, in the unitary authority of Slough in Berkshire, England. It was transferred to Berkshire from Buckinghamshire in 1974.

It was first recorded in 1217 by an Old English word meaning &quot;Calf Island&quot;, from &quot;Cealf&quot; meaning calf. As the name implies, Chalvey lies low on the plain of the River Thames, and there may have been enough of a rise for an island to stand above the slough from which the later town takes its name.

Chalvey has never formed a parish on its own, being twinned with Upton in the parish of Upton-cum-Chalvey.

As Slough developed, Chalvey developed as a working-class community of small terraced houses. Nonconformist churches were established starting with the Congregationalists in 1806.

In 1849, the Slough to Windsor railway was built, passing through the middle of Chalvey. A halt was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1929 but closed the following year.

At some point between 1850 and 1880, a local legend developed about the &quot;Chalvey Stab Monkey&quot; involving an organ grinder and a stabbed monkey; the first person to get blind drunk on the anniversary of the monkey&#x27;s funeral is declared &quot;Mayor of Chalvey&quot;. Traditionally, residents of Chalvey have been known as &quot;stab-monks&quot;. A long-standing local joke suggests that Chalvey&#x27;s main industry is in the Treacle Mines. On occasion, this has been taken to be a reference to the local sewage works.

It was stated on the &quot;Immigration - How We Lost Count&quot; edition of the BBC1 documentary &quot;Panorama&quot; on 23 July 2007 that Chalvey is severely overcrowded, and that most of its residents are immigrants and members of ethnic minorities. Chalvey has a large Asian population.

The first recorded Lord of the Manor of Chalvey was recorded in the year 1502. The current Lord of Chalvey, Christopher Johnson, lives in the United States.

<text>Cippenham is a suburb of Slough. Close by are the neighbouring towns and villages of Beaconsfield, Farnham Common, Burnham, Gerrards Cross, Stoke Poges, Windsor and Taplow.

Originally part of the parish of Burnham in the county of Buckinghamshire, England, Cippenham was transferred to Slough in 1930, and therefore transferred to Berkshire in 1974. Slough became a unitary authority on 1 April 1998, when Berkshire County Council and the 1973–1998 Borough were abolished.

== Toponymy ==
The name Cippenham derives from the Old English &quot;Cippan-ham&quot;, meaning &quot;Cippa&#x27;s homestead&quot;.

== History ==
King Henry III had a palace here, marked on modern maps as &quot;Cippenham Moat&quot; and very close to the M4 motorway.

Cippenham Green was where villagers grazed their cows, until the end of the 19th century, and is the only ancient village green left within Slough&#x27;s boundaries. A 1925 document (Parishes: Burnham with Lower Boveney, a History of the County of Buckingham: Vol 3 (1925) pp 165–184) described Cippenham as some cottages and other buildings clustering around the green, with several large farms on the outskirts. Notable large houses included Western House, occupied by Mr Josiah Gregory. Western House is the name of the current primary school, which moved in April 2006 to new premises in the centre of the new Cedar Parks housing development. Other notable houses from the early 20th century include Cippenham Lodge and Cippenham Court. The Long Barn public house dates from the 17th century and was originally a farm outbuilding belonging to Cippenham Court: a market research company now occupies the original site of Cippenham Court. Cippenham Lodge still stands as a private dwelling in Lower Cippenham Lane. Much of the original farmland has now been built on in the major housing developments of Windsor Meadows and Cedar Parks, which is still in the final phases of development.

During the First World War a vehicle repair depot was established in the grounds of Cippenham Court Farm. After the war the site was sold to a group of businessmen called the Slough Trading Company, who changed their name in 1926 to Slough Estates Ltd. This formed the basis of Slough Trading Estate, the first trading estate established in the world.

== Sports ==
Cippenham was also home to Cippenham Sports Football Club who played in the East Berkshire Football League Division Two at Mercian Way Park.

The club was founded in 1923 as Cippenham F.C. and was a founder member of the Slough Town Challenge Cup and the old Windsor Slough &amp; District League. During the early 80s Cippenham Football Club amalgamated with Cippenham Cricket Club and originally played on the village green, crossed by a road. This led to problems with cricket fielding and the disbandment of the cricket side of the club in the early 1990s, and the move of the football team to Mercian Way. In the 2007–08 season they reached the East Berkshire League Cup final for the first time, beating three Premier League teams on the way. However, they missed out on winning the cup after suffering a 1–0 defeat to Waltham FC in a closely contested encounter. The end of the 2009–10 season saw the club relegated to Division Two. Unfortunately, due to a struggle to attract players, Cippenham Sports folded at the end of the 2013–14 season. At present there are no signs the club will be revived.

<text>Colnbrook is a village in the Slough district in Berkshire, England. It lies within the historic boundaries of Buckinghamshire, and straddles two distributaries of the Colne, the Colne Brook and Wraysbury River. These two streams have their confluence just to the southeast of the village. Colnbrook is centred southeast of the Slough town centre, east of Windsor, and west of central London.

Colnbrook forms the greater part of the civil parish of Colnbrook with Poyle (see also Poyle). Junctions of the M4 and M25 are near the village. To the east is Longford, London, and Bedfont and Stanwell which abut the south of London Heathrow Airport.

Colnbrook with Poyle is a suburban parish with significant industrial units, logistical premises and open land. The parish was created on 1 April 1995 as an amalgamation of Colnbrook from Iver to the north and the smaller Poyle from an unparished area of Stanwell to the south-east. At the 2011 census the whole civil parish had a population of 6,157 living in 2,533 homes.

==History==

Mentioned in William the Conqueror&#x27;s Domesday Book, Colnbrook is on the Colne Brook, a tributary of the River Colne, hence &quot;Colnbrook&quot;. Coaching inns were the village&#x27;s main industry. In 1106, the first one was founded by Milo Crispin, named &quot;the Hospice&quot; (subsequently the &#x27;Ostrich&#x27;, probably by way of corruption of the original name), the third oldest in England. By 1577, Colnbrook had no fewer than ten coaching inns. Colnbrook&#x27;s High Street was on the main London to Bath road and turn off point for Windsor and was used as a resting point for travellers.
In Thomas Deloney&#x27;s fictional &quot;Pleasant History of Thomas of Reading&quot; (c. 1598), Jarman, the landlord of the Crane Inn during the reign of Henry I, installed a large trap door under the bed in the best bedroom located immediately above the inn&#x27;s kitchen. The bed was fixed to the trap door and the mattress securely attached to the bedstead, so that when two retaining iron pins were removed from below in the small hours of the morning, the sleeping guest was neatly decanted into a boiling cauldron. In this way, more than sixty of his richer guests were murdered silently and with no bloodshed. Their bodies were then disposed of in the River Colne. The murder of a wealthy clothier, Thomas Cole of Reading, proved to be Jarman&#x27;s undoing in that he failed to get rid of Cole&#x27;s horse, leading to his confessing. The story ends with Jarman and his wife being hanged for robbery and murder, and the river and town being named &quot;Cole&quot; and &quot;Colebrooke&quot; respectively after Thomas Cole. According to local tradition, this inn was the Ostrich Inn. The inn is reportedly haunted and has been subject to investigations by the Sussex Paranormal Research Group and &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. On an episode of &quot;Ghosthunters International&quot; that aired on 21 July 2010, it is mentioned that the Jarman murders at the Ostrich Inn were the inspiration for the story of Sweeney Todd.

Colnbrook is also the place where Richard Cox (a retired brewer), in 1825, first grafted the Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin apple at his orchard named &quot;The Lawns&quot;.

A traditional coaching history has led to no fewer than four inns or public houses remaining, three in Colnbrook, one in Poyle.

In August 1902, a clock was installed by public subscription to celebrate the Coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra, which stood until the building it was attached to was demolished in 1935. The clock was kept in storage for a number of years while several attempts to reinstall it elsewhere were unsuccessful, and it is currently kept inside The Ostrich Inn. In 2012, a new free-standing clock was installed in front of Ye Old George Inn at the end of the High Street to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The new clock was unveiled on 29 June 2012 in a ceremony attended by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

===Administrative history===
Colnbrook has a complicated administrative history. The village was historically divided by the Colne Brook between the ancient parish of Stanwell in Middlesex in the east, and the parishes of Horton and Langley Marish in Buckinghamshire in the west. The parish vestries provided traditional poor relief and road maintenance but lay in the 19th century in different Poor Law Unions. Stanwell became part of Staines Rural District in 1894 and Staines Urban District in 1930. The Buckinghamshire parishes joined Eton Rural District in 1894.

In 1965 the eastern part of Colnbrook was transferred to Surrey with the rest of Staines Urban District. In 1974 Staines Urban District was absorbed into the new borough of Spelthorne. In 1974 most of the parish of Horton was transferred to the new borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, but the western part of Colnbrook remained in Buckinghamshire and was added to the parish of Iver, in the South Bucks district. Colnbrook was finally united on 1 April 1995, when the present combined parish of Colnbrook with Poyle was formed and added to the borough of Slough in Berkshire. That was the county&#x27;s last boundary change before Berkshire County Council was abolished to be replaced by six unitary authorities. When the county council was abolished in April 1998 the borough became more important for local government; however a Berkshire Fire and Rescue service persists, as do ceremonial roles, judicial roles and sporting competitions.

==Geography==
Colnbrook (with Poyle) is at the eastern end of the borough of Slough and is directly west of the M25 motorway which separates it from Heathrow Airport in the London Borough of Hillingdon in Greater London and the borough of Spelthorne in Surrey. Elevations vary between 22 and 20m Above Ordnance Datum with the Thames at 17m AOD south at Staines which is where the natural rivers generally drain toward. The river is unusual for its regional park (and walk) and seven mouths (distributaries).

==Economy==

The town&#x27;s industrial estates are important in fields such as transportation, food and drinks manufacture, warehousing and distribution and despite almost all being in Poyle, landlords have mostly preferred to let premises under the name Colnbrook – but not all, such as Coca-Cola. Beside the Greater London boundary and a historic part of Stanwell which forms the southern part of London Heathrow Airport, it is also equidistant between nearby accessible junctions of the M4 and M25 and a suburban parish with significant industrial/logistical buildings and open land.

==Politics==
Colnbrook is in the Windsor constituency and its Member of Parliament is Adam Afriyie (Conservative).

==Demography==
At the 2011 census, the whole civil parish had a population of 6,157 living in 2,533 homes, giving a density of 10.9 people per hectare (approximately a quarter of the density of the borough as a whole and just under one half of the average for England).

==Transport==

Colnbrook was before the M4 along the Roman-origin A4 (previously the Bath road) as well as to Windsor or Maidenhead by way of Slough, and had been a convenient halting-place for travellers before the introduction of railways.

Local bus services are operated by London United who run services on the 81 from the main village to Hounslow and First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley who run the remainder of the services.

===Abandoned railway===

Colnbrook was served by a railway line that ran to West Drayton, with a railway station serving the village until it was closed in 1965 under the Beeching Axe. The railway line formerly continued to also to Staines-upon-Thames.

<doc id="155277" wikidata="Q168155" url="?curid=155277" title="Zbigniew Preisner">
<text>Zbigniew Preisner (; born 20 May 1955 as Zbigniew Antoni Kowalski) is a Polish film score composer, best known for his work with film director Krzysztof Kieślowski. He is the recipient of the Gold Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis as well as the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He is a member of the French Film Academy.

==Life==
Zbigniew Preisner was born in Bielsko-Biała, southern Poland, and studied history and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. Never having received formal music lessons, he taught himself music by listening and transcribing parts from records. His compositional style represents a distinctively sparse form of tonal neo-Romanticism. Paganini and Jean Sibelius are acknowledged influences.

==Career==
Preisner is best known for the music composed for the films directed by fellow Pole Krzysztof Kieślowski. His &quot;Song for the Unification of Europe&quot;, based on the Greek text of 1 Corinthians 13, is attributed to a character in Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot; and plays a dominating role in the story. His music for &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot; includes a setting of Polish and French versions of a poem by Wisława Szymborska, a Polish Nobel Prize-winning poet.

After working with Kieślowski on &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot;, Preisner was hired by the producer Francis Ford Coppola to write the score for &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, directed by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Although Preisner is most closely associated with Kieślowski, he has collaborated with several other directors, winning a César in 1996 for his work on Jean Becker&#x27;s &quot;Élisa&quot;. He has won a number of other awards, including another César in 1994 for &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot;, and the Silver Bear from the 47th Berlin International Film Festival 1997 for &quot;The Island on Bird Street&quot;. He was nominated for Golden Globe awards for his scores for &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot; (1993) and At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991).

In 1998, &quot;Requiem for My Friend&quot;, Preisner&#x27;s first large scale work not written for film, premiered. It was originally intended as a narrative work to be written by Krzysztof Piesiewicz and directed by Kieślowski, but it became a memorial to Kieślowski after the director&#x27;s death. The &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; from this Requiem appears in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;. The &quot;Dies Irae&quot; from this Requiem appears in the film &quot;La Grande Bellezza&quot;, directed by Paolo Sorrentino and in the second season of the television series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

Preisner composed the theme music for the &quot;People&#x27;s Century&quot;, a monumental 26-part documentary made jointly in 1994 by the BBC television network in United Kingdom and the PBS television network in the United States. He has also worked with director Thomas Vinterberg on the 2003 film &quot;It&#x27;s All About Love&quot;. He provided orchestration for David Gilmour&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;On An Island&quot; as well as additional orchestrations for the show at Gdańsk shipyards at which he also conducted the Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra, this was documented on the album &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot; (2008). &quot;Silence, Night and Dreams&quot; is Zbigniew Preisner&#x27;s new recording project, a large-scale work for orchestra, choir and soloists, based on texts from the Book of Job. The premier recording, was released in 2007 with the lead singer of Madredeus, Teresa Salgueiro and boy soprano Thomas Cully from Libera.

==Van den Budenmayer==
Van den Budenmayer is a fictitious 17th-century Dutch composer created by Preisner and director Krzysztof Kieślowski for attributions in screenplays. Preisner said Van den Budenmayer is a pseudonym he and Kieślowski invented &quot;because we both loved the Netherlands&quot;. Music &quot;by&quot; the Dutch composer plays a role in three Kieślowski films. The first is &quot;Dekalog&quot; (1988). The second is &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; (1993) in which a theme from his &quot;musique funebres&quot; is quoted in the &quot;Song for the Unification of Europe&quot;. Its E minor soprano solo prefigured in the earlier film &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; (1991), where circumstances in the story prevent the solo from finishing. The third is &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot; (1994).

<doc id="155278" wikidata="Q2665449" url="?curid=155278" title="Langley, Berkshire">
<text>Langley, also known as Langley Marish, is an area of Slough in Berkshire, England. It is east of Slough town centre and west of Charing Cross in Central London. It was a separate civil parish and village until the 1930s, when the built-up part of Langley was incorporated into Slough. Langley was in the historic county of Buckinghamshire, being transferred to the administrative county of Berkshire in 1974.

==Etymology==
The place-name Langley derives from the Middle English word &quot;&quot;, meaning long, and &quot;&quot;, a wood or clearing. Langley was formed of a number of clearings: George Green, Horsemoor Green, Middle Green, Sawyers Green and Shreding Green. They became the sites for housing which merged into one village centred on the parish church in St Mary&#x27;s Road. The clearings are remembered in the names of streets or smaller green fields.

&quot;Marish&quot; or &quot;Maries&quot; commemorates Christiana de Marecis who held the manor for a short time in the reign of Edward I.

==History==

===Notable buildings===

The Church of St Mary the Virgin is in the Church of England diocese of Oxford. The church is a Grade I listed building and houses the Kedermister Library, given by Sir John Kedermister (or Kederminster), who also endowed the surviving almshouses of 1617 in the village. Other surviving almshouses include the Seymour Almshouses (1679–1688), given by Sir Edward Seymour who was a Speaker of the House of Commons, and those founded in 1839 by William Wild in Horsemoor Green.

The courtier Henry Norris owned a house, &quot;Parlaunt&quot; or &quot;Leving&quot;, at Langley Marish. The property was forfeited to the crown when he was executed in May 1536. When Henry married Anne of Cleves in 1540, furnishings from Parlaunt were taken to Oatlands Palace. There are no remains of this manor house.

Sir John Kedermister&#x27;s house, Langley Park (bought by Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough) was demolished and rebuilt to designs by Stiff Leadbetter, starting in 1756 and completed in the year of his death, 1758.

The Langley Academy secondary school opened in 2008 and was designed by architects Foster + Partners.

===Langley Airfield===
The Hawker Aircraft Company bought Parlaunt Farm at Langley in 1938 and built a major factory and airfield there. Over 9,000 military aircraft were manufactured at the site especially the Hurricane during World War II and also the Tempest and Sea Fury. The final Hurricane built (a MkIIC serialled PZ865, which still flies today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight) was completed here on 27 July 1944 and named &#x27;Last of The Many&#x27; in a special ceremony. Retiring Chief Test Pilot P W S &#x27;George&#x27; Bulman made the first flight of this the aeroplane on this occasion – he having made the first flight of the prototype from Brooklands almost nine years earlier.

The Hawker Tornado (1940), Typhoon (1940), Tempest (1942), Fury (1944), Sea Fury (1945), and the General Aircraft Hamilcar X tank-carrying glider (1945) all made their first flights from Langley. Postwar, the aerodrome was also used by Airwork Services, British South American Airways and Airflight for aircraft maintenance work.

The Hawker factory closed in 1958 having also manufactured Hawker Hunter fighters and earlier jet prototypes. Production and staff were transferred to the flight test airfield at Dunsfold Aerodrome and the parent Hawker factory in Kingston-on-Thames (now Kingston upon Thames), both in Surrey. Little of the factory or airfield remain today although the area&#x27;s aviation past is remembered in street-names such as &quot;Spitfire Close&quot; and &quot;Hurricane Way&quot;. A marker stone was unveiled by the Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust on 5 October 2019.

===Ford factory===
The Ford Motor Company opened a commercial vehicle component factory at Langley Airfield in 1949, and then bought the entire site from Hawker Siddeley in 1959. The former aircraft factory was re-used for commercial vehicle manufacture and the Ford Transit was built here until production was transferred to Ford&#x27;s Southampton plant at Swaythling, Southampton, and later the Ford Cargo. The Langley factory became part of Iveco in 1986 but finally closed in September 1997. Demolished a year later by Gregory Demolition, the site is now redeveloped with new housing, offices and warehousing (including Royal Mail&#x27;s Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, which services nearby Heathrow Airport).

===Miscellaneous===

Langley Carnival is held annually on the second Saturday in July at the Langley Park Memorial Recreation Ground.

The Cable Corporation, based at Langley, was the first cable company in the world to offer voice, video and data services to business and residential users.

Langley is reputed to be haunted by a ghost in a yellow coat.

==Transport==

Langley railway station, which includes an Isambard Kingdom Brunel period building, is on the Great Western Main Line to London Paddington. Great Western Railway operate a half-hourly service in each direction. In July 2012, the Department for Transport announced plans to build the Western Rail Approach between Langley and Iver stations.

On 15 December 2019, Langley station became part of the Elizabeth line with services operated under TfL Rail branding until 24 May 2022. Due to the addition of the Elizabeth line, the station was upgraded to include three new lifts along with a new ticket hall, new ticket office and new ticket gates.

==Governance==
Langley forms part of the unparished area of Slough. It therefore has no separate parish or community council, but is governed directly by Slough Borough Council.

Langley was formerly a separate parish, also known as Langley Marish or Langley Marsh. From 1835 the parish formed part of the Eton Poor Law Union. When parish and district councils were established under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish of Langley was given a parish council and was included in the Eton Rural District. Following significant development in the southern part of the parish adjoining Slough, the area south of the Grand Union Canal (including the parish church and old village centre of Langley), was transferred into the parish and urban district of Slough on 1 April 1930. The residual, more rural, part of the parish north of the Grand Union Canal continued to be administered as a parish called Langley for another four years before being finally abolished, with most of the northern rural area being transferred into the parish of Wexham on 1 April 1934, and smaller areas being transferred at the same time to the parishes of Fulmer and Iver. In 1931 the parish had a population of 1180.

<doc id="155280" wikidata="Q2286892" url="?curid=155280" title="Upton, Slough">
<text>Upton is a suburb of Slough, in the Slough district, in the ceremonial county of Berkshire, England. Until the local government reforms of 1974 it was in Buckinghamshire. It was one of the villages that developed into the town.

==History==
The Domesday Book survey of 1086 refers to Upton and a wood for 200 pigs, worth £15. Upton took its name from its situation at the top of the slope from the river terrace — the various levels in the area having been formed in the Last Ice Age.

The ancient parish, and the civil parish until 1894, included Chalvey and Slough, originally hamlets, and was formally known as Upton-cum-Chalvey. In 1894, the new civil parish of Slough was formed from the parish. In 1895 a detached part of the parish was transferred to Gerrards Cross, and in 1900 and 1901 the rump of the parish was divided between the neighbouring parishes of Eton, Langley, Slough and Wexham. The ecclesiastical parish is still known as Upton-cum-Chalvey.

==Church==

Upton&#x27;s Norman Church, St Laurence&#x27;s Church, is around 900 years old. It was the marriage place (7 May 1788) and burial place (1822) of Sir William Herschel (in whose memory there stands a newly erected stained-glass window depicting Uranus, which he discovered, and other planets), and the burial place of Charles Hatchett who discovered niobium.

==Other buildings==
Upton Court is the name of the original manorial buildings for the parish of Upton. Parts of Upton Court were built in 1325. In the 19th century, it was a seat of the Burton family and was, up until March 2010, home to the &quot;Slough Observer&quot; newspaper. The nearby Slough Grammar School, having previously been named Upton Grammar School from 1982 to 1993, changed its name in 2013 to Upton Court Grammar School.

The Mere is a 19th-century half-timbered building, built in 1887 by the grandson of Richard Bentley, is now the head office of the National Foundation for Educational Research. Long Close School was established in the area in 1940.

==Upton Park==
Upton Park forms one of Slough&#x27;s earliest planned estates. Laid out in 1842, the grounds (a public park as Herschel Park since 1949) are believed to have been designed by Joseph Paxton.

In 2011, the Grade II listed park and nature reserve underwent a restoration project to re-establish the area to its former Victorian glory with a lottery grant of £2.7m from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Friends of Herschel Park, a local conservation group, was created to manage the restoration, as well as to oversee the design and maintenance of the area. The park regularly holds events for adults and children throughout the year.

<doc id="155281" wikidata="Q4025730" url="?curid=155281" title="Wexham">
<text>Wexham is a civil parish in Buckinghamshire in southern England. The largest settlement in the parish is the hamlet of George Green; there are also Wexham Street (half of which is in Stoke Poges parish) and Middlegreen. The parish includes part of the forest of Burnham Beeches, and had a population of 2,458 at the 2021 census.

The separate parish of Wexham Court was created in 1974 from western parts of Wexham parish that were transferred to the Borough of Slough in Berkshire. Wexham Park Hospital is a large hospital within the Wexham Court parish.

==History==
The parish of Wexham originally covered a relatively small (1.2 square miles) according to the 1881 and 1891 censuses. It was almost doubled in 1934 by taking in and about 1,000 people from the dissolved Langley Marish parish, a very long strip parish part of which was taken in by Gerrards Cross almost four miles to the north.

Wexham civil parish was split into two parishes in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A new parish called Wexham Court was created from the southern part of the old parish, which was placed in the Borough of Slough and transferred to Berkshire. The reduced Wexham parish remained in Buckinghamshire.

Wexham Court has a parish council with 11 members. It and some additional unparished territory formed the current (adjustable) three-member Slough Borough Council ward of Wexham Lea.

In 2018, the parish of Wexham Court and neighbouring Britwell were scheduled for abolition in April 2019, but after an appeal by the parish councils and a judicial review the order was quashed and the parishes remain unchanged.

The village has a 12th-century parish church and the 16th century Wexham Court. It has protected green spaces comprising woodland, Langley Park and Black Park Country Park.

==Demography==
==Education==
The parish relies for its education on neighbouring villages with greater populations, save that the Japanese international boarding school Teikyo School United Kingdom is in Wexham.

<text>A car bomb, bus bomb, van bomb, lorry bomb, or truck bomb, also known as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED), is an improvised explosive device designed to be detonated in an automobile or other vehicles.

Car bombs can be roughly divided into two main categories: those used primarily to kill the occupants of the vehicle (often as an assassination) and those used as a means to kill, injure or damage people and buildings outside the vehicle. The latter type may be parked (the vehicle disguising the bomb and allowing the bomber to get away), or the vehicle might be used to deliver the bomb (often as part of a suicide bombing).

It is commonly used as a weapon of terrorism or guerrilla warfare to kill people near the blast site or to damage buildings or other property. Car bombs act as their own delivery mechanisms and can carry a relatively large amount of explosives without attracting suspicion. In larger vehicles and trucks, weights of around or more have been used, for example, in the Oklahoma City bombing. Car bombs are activated in a variety of ways, including opening the vehicle&#x27;s doors, starting the engine, remote detonation, depressing the accelerator or brake pedals, or simply lighting a fuse or setting a timing device. The gasoline in the vehicle&#x27;s fuel tank may make the explosion of the bomb more powerful by dispersing and igniting the fuel.

== History ==
Mario Buda&#x27;s improvised wagon used in the 1920 Wall Street bombing is considered a prototype of the car bomb.

The first non-suicide car bombing &quot;fully conceptualized as a weapon of urban warfare&quot; came January 12, 1947 when Lehi (also known as Stern Gang), a Zionist paramilitary organization, bombed the Haifa police station.

In the fall of 2005, there were 140 car bombings happening per month.

Car bombs are preceded by the 16th century hellburners, explosive-laden ships which were used to deadly effect by the besieged Dutch forces in Antwerp against the besieging Spanish. Though using a less refined technology, the basic principle of the hellburner is similar to that of the car bomb.

Car bombs would start out with animals such as horses and cows, then it eventually emerged into a car.

The first reported suicide car bombing (and possibly the first suicide bombing) was the Bath School bombings of 1927, where 45 people, including the bomber, were killed and half of a school was destroyed.

Mass-casualty suicide car bombings are predominantly associated with the Middle East, particularly in recent decades. A notable suicide car bombing was the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, when two simultaneous attacks killed 241 U.S. and 58 French peacekeepers. The perpetrator of these attacks has never been positively confirmed. In the Lebanese Civil War, an estimated 3,641 car bombs were detonated. The tactic was adopted by Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas, Fatah and Islamic Jihad, especially during the Second Intifada (2000–2005).

While not an adaptation of a people-carrying vehicle, the WW2 German Goliath remote control mine shares many parallels with a vehicle-based IED. It approached a target (often a tank or another armoured vehicle) at speed before exploding, destroying itself and the target. It was armoured so that it could not be destroyed en route. However, it was not driven by a person, instead operated by remote control from a safe distance.

Prior to the 20th century, bombs planted in horse carts had been used in assassination plots, notably the unsuccessful &quot;&quot;machine infernale&quot;&quot; attempt to kill Napoleon on 24 December 1800.

The first car bomb may have been the one used for the assassination attempt on Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1905 in Istanbul by Armenian separatists in the command of Papken Siuni belonging to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.

Car bombing was a significant part of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) campaign during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Dáithí Ó Conaill is credited with introducing the car bomb to Northern Ireland. Car bombs were also used by Ulster loyalist groups (for example, by the UVF during the Dublin and Monaghan bombings).

PIRA Chief of Staff Seán Mac Stíofáin defines the car bomb as both a tactical and a strategic guerrilla warfare weapon. Strategically, it disrupts the ability of the enemy government to administer the country, and hits simultaneously at the core of its economic structure by means of massive destruction. From a tactical point of view, it ties down a large number of security forces and troops around the main urban areas of the region in conflict.

==As a delivery system==

Car bombs are effective weapons as they are an easy way to transport a large number of explosives to a target. A car bomb also produces copious shrapnel, or flying debris, and secondary damage to bystanders and buildings. In recent years, car bombs have become widely used by suicide bombers.

===Countermeasures===
Defending against a car bomb involves keeping vehicles at a distance from vulnerable targets by using roadblocks and checkpoints, Jersey barriers, concrete blocks or bollards, metal barriers, or by hardening buildings to withstand explosions. The entrance to Downing Street in London has been closed since 1991 in reaction to the Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign, preventing the public from approaching Number 10. Where major public roads pass near buildings, road closures may be the only option (thus, for instance, in Washington, D.C. the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue immediately in front of the White House is closed to traffic). Historically these tactics have encouraged potential bombers to target &quot;soft&quot; or unprotected targets, such as markets.

===Suicide usage===
In the Iraqi and Syrian Civil War, the car bomb concept was modified so that it could be driven and detonated by a driver but armoured to withstand incoming fire. The vehicle would be driven to its target area, in a similar fashion to a kamikaze plane of WW2. These were known by the acronym SVBIED (from Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device) or VBIEDs. Ordinary civilian cars were outfitted with armour plating intended to protect the VBIED as it approached its target. Such SVBIEDs were driven into enemy troop areas or incoming enemy columns. Most often, the SVBIEDs were used by ISIL against Government forces, but also used by Syrian rebels (FSA and allied militias, especially the Al-Nusra Front) against government troops.

The vehicles have become more sophisticated, with armour plating on the vehicle, protected vision slits, armour plating over the wheels so they would withstand being shot at and occasionally additional metal grating over the front of the vehicle designed to crush or destroy incoming shaped charges such as those used on rocket propelled grenades.
Trucks were sometimes used to start an assault, and benefitted from their greater storage space that could contain very heavy explosives. Animal drawn carts, typically pulled by horse or mule, have also been used. Tactically, a single vehicle may be used, or an initial &quot;breakthrough&quot; vehicle, then followed by another vehicle.

While many car bombs are disguised as ordinary vehicles, some that are used against military forces have improvised vehicle armour attached to prevent the driver from being shot when attacking a fortified outpost.

===Operation===

Car bombs and detonators function in a diverse manner of ways and there are numerous variables in the operation and placement of the bomb within the vehicle. Earlier and less advanced car bombs were often wired to the car&#x27;s ignition system, but this practice is now considered more laborious and less effective than other more recent methods, as it requires a greater amount of work for a system that can often be quite easily defused. While it is more common nowadays for car bombs to be fixed magnetically to the underside of the car, underneath the passenger or driver&#x27;s seat, or inside of the mudguard, detonators triggered by the opening of the vehicle door or by pressure applied to the brakes or accelerating pedals are also used.

Bombs operating by the former method of fixation to the underside of the car more often than not make use of a device called a tilt fuse. A small tube made of glass or plastic, the tilt fuse is similar in operation to a mercury switch or medical tablet tube. One end of the fuse will be filled with mercury, while the other open end is wired with the ends of an open circuit to an electrical firing system. When the tilt fuse moves or is jerked, the supply of mercury will flow to the top of the tube and close the circuit. Thus, as the vehicle goes through the regular bumping and dipping that comes with driving over a terrain, the circuit is completed, and the explosive is detonated.

Car bombs are effective as booby traps because they also leave very little evidence. When an explosion happens, it is difficult for forensics to find any evidence because things either denigrate or become charred.

As a safety mechanism to protect the bomber, the placer of the bomb may rig a timing device incorporated with the circuit to activate the circuit only after a certain time period, therefore ensuring the bomber will not accidentally activate the bomb before they are able to get clear of the blast radius.

Even though right now car bombs are supposed to be stealth weapons that cause a good deal of damage, it is feared that they can become bigger, more lethal weapons such as the size of a trailer, making huge explosions and causing plenty of damage.

==Examples==

===20th century===
* 1920: The Wall Street bombing — Suspected that Italian anarchist Mario Buda (a member of the &quot;Galleanists&quot;) parked a horse-drawn wagon filled with explosives and shrapnel in the Financial District of New York City. The blast killed 38 and wounded 143.
* 1927: The Bath School disaster — Andrew Kehoe used a detonator to ignite dynamite and hundreds of pounds of pyrotol which he had secretly planted inside a school. As rescuers started gathering at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and detonated a bomb inside his shrapnel-filled vehicle, killing himself and the school superintendent, and killing and injuring several others. In total, Kehoe killed 44 people and injured 58 making the Bath School bombing the deadliest act of mass murder in a school in U.S. history. It is possibly the first suicide car bombing in history.
* Militant group Lehi were the first group to use car bombs in the British Mandate for Palestine during the 1940s.

* The Viet Cong guerrillas used them throughout the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s.
* The OAS used them at the end of the French rule in Algeria in 1961 and 1962.
* The Sicilian Mafia used them to assassinate independent magistrates starting in the 1960s and up to the early 1990s.
* The IRA used them frequently during its 1960s to 1990s campaign during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and England. The 1998 Omagh bombing by the Real IRA, an IRA splinter group, caused the most casualties in the Troubles from a single car bomb. Loyalist organisations in Northern Ireland of the 1960s and 1970s such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association used car bombs against civilians in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The 1974 UVF bombs in Dublin and Monaghan caused the most casualties in a single day during the Troubles.
* Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani was assassinated by a car bomb on 8 July 1972 with his 17-year-old niece Lamees Najim in Beirut by the Israeli Mossad.
* Former Chilean General Carlos Prats was killed by a car bomb on September 30, 1974, along with his wife.
* Freelance terrorist Carlos the Jackal claimed responsibility for three car bomb attacks on French newspapers accused of pro-Israeli bias during the 1970s.
* Cleveland mobster Danny Greene frequently used car bombs against his enemies, beginning in 1968. Afterwards, they also began to be used against Greene and his associates. The use of car bombs in Cleveland peaked in 1976, when 36 bombs exploded in the city, most of them car bombs, causing it to be nicknamed &quot;Bomb City.&quot; Several people, including innocent bystanders, were killed or wounded. Greene himself was finally killed in a car bomb explosion himself, on October 6, 1977.
* Agents of the Chilean intelligence agency DINA were convicted of using car bombs to assassinate Orlando Letelier in 1976 and Carlos Prats in 1974, who were exiled opponents of dictator Augusto Pinochet. Letelier was killed in Sheridan Circle, in the heart of Embassy Row in Washington, D.C.
* The Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka frequently made use of car bombs during that country&#x27;s civil war in a campaign which lasted from 1976 until the group&#x27;s defeat in 2009.
* From 1979 to early 1983, under the guise of the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners, Israel Defense Forces commanders Rafael Eitan, Avigdor Ben-Gal and Meir Dagan launched a campaign of bombings, including car, bicycle, and even donkey bombs. Initially conducted as a response to the killing of Israeli civilians at Nahariya. Largely indiscriminate in its targeting of those associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization in south, Lebanon, the FLLF attacks killed hundreds of Palestinians and Lebanese, mainly in Tyre, Lebanon, Sidon and the surrounding PLO run refugee camps. After 1981, as part of Ariel Sharon&#x27;s policy of goading the PLO into committing more acts of terror, justifying a military response, FLLF attacks escalated in intensity and scope, spreading to Beirut and northern Lebanon by September. The FLLF even took credit for fictional attacks on the IDF to maintain its cover as a Lebanese organisation. Its most prominent attack on October 1, 1981, in West Beirut killed at least 50 and injured over 250 people. Seven other similar bombs were found and defused before they could explode.
* The German Red Army Faction occasionally used car bombs, such as in an unsuccessful attempt to attack a NATO school for officers in 1984.
* The Basque separatist group (ETA) attempted their first car bomb assassination in September 1985 and carried out at least 80 massive car bomb attacks in Spain during the last decade before putting its activities on hold in 2011.
* Constable Angela Taylor died on her way to collect lunch, the sole fatality of the Russell Street bombing in Melbourne, Australia on 27 March 1986. 22 others were injured.
* On 23 November 1986, two members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation carried out the Melbourne Turkish consulate bombing using a car bomb, which resulted in the death of one of the attackers.
* Suicide car bombs were a regular feature against Israel in the 1982 Lebanon War which lasted from 1982 until Israel&#x27;s withdrawal in 2000. The bombing campaign was waged by several groups, most prominently Hezbollah.
* In the 1980s, the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar used vehicle bombs extensively against government forces and population centers in Colombia and Latin America. The most notable car bombing attack was the 1989 DAS Building bombing, which killed 63 and injured about 1,000. Also, on July 4, 1989, a car bomb killed governor of Antioquia Antonio Roldán Betancur and five others; a prominent member of Escobar&#x27;s Medellin Cartel later confessed to the crime.
* During the Soviet–Afghan War of the 1980s, at a variety of training camps in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), with the aid of the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Britain&#x27;s MI6, trained mujahideen in the preparation of car bombs. Car bombs became a regular occurrence during the war, the Afghan civil conflicts which followed, and then during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan from 2001 and the war in Afghanistan ending in 2021.
* On 26 February 1993, Islamist terrorists led by Ramzi Yousef detonated a Ryder van filled with explosives in the parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Yousef&#x27;s plan had been to cause one of the towers to collapse into the other, destroying both and killing thousands of people. Although this was not achieved, six people were killed, 1,402 others injured, and extensive damage was caused.
* On 18 April 1993, a tanker containing 500 kilograms of explosives exploded near the mosque in Vitez, destroying the offices of the Bosnian War Presidency, killing at least six people and injuring 50 others. The ICTY accepted that this action was a piece of pure terrorism committed by elements within the Croat forces, as an attack on the Bosniak population of Stari Vitez - Vitez old town. HVO members tied a Bosniak male civilian from a concentration camp to the steering wheel and set the truck in motion towards the old town.
* On 20 October 1994, Hamas-led bus bombing in Tel Aviv, Israel lead to the death of 22 civilians and the injury of 50. At that time, it was the deadliest suicide bombing in Israeli history, and the first successful attack in Tel Aviv.
* The Quebec Biker War that lasted from 1994 to 2002 involved the use of car bombings, including one that killed a drug dealer and an 11-year-old boy on 9 August 1995.
* On 19 April 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a Ryder box truck filled with an explosive mixture of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil (ANFO) in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City during the Oklahoma City bombing, killing 168 people, including 19 children who were in the daycare.
* On 25 June 1996, a truck bomb destroyed the Khobar Towers military complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and injuring 372 persons of all nationalities.
* In the late 1990s and early 2000s, vehicular explosives were used by Chechen nationalists against targets in Russia.
* On 20 April 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold planned to use two car bombs as the last act of the Columbine High School massacre, apparently to murder first responders. Both failed to explode.

===21st century===
*On 2 December 2001, a Hamas assailant boarded a bus in Haifa, Israel, and then detonated himself, leading to the death of 15 civilians.
*Southeast Asia-based militant Islamist group Jemaah Islamiyah utilized car bombs in their campaigns during the early 2000s, the most prominent being the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people.
*Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was assassinated by a car bomb during Valentine&#x27;s Day of 2005. 21 others were also killed.
*A car bomb which had misfired was discovered in Times Square, New York City on May 1, 2010. The bomb had been planted by Faisal Shahzad. Evidence suggests that the bombing was planned by the Pakistani Taliban.
*On 11 December 2010, a car bomb exploded in central Stockholm in Sweden, slightly injuring two bystanders. Twelve minutes later, an Iraqi-born Swedish citizen accidentally detonated six pipe bombs he was carrying, but only one exploded. The bomber was killed but there were no other casualties. It is believed that the attacks were the work of homegrown terrorists who were protesting Sweden&#x27;s involvement in the war in Afghanistan and the publication in Sweden of cartoons depicting Muhammad.
*On 22 July 2011, in the Norway massacre, far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb within the executive government quarter of Oslo, Norway, killing 8 people.
*In 2013, Afghan security forces intercepted a truck bomb deployed by the Haqqanis. It was the largest truck bomb ever built, with some 61,500 lbs of explosives. It was ultimately defused. The bomb was over 10 times the size of the car bomb used on the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. While the bomb was not detonated, it caused security changes throughout the region and the closure of the US Army base FOB Goode near Gardez.
*During June 2015, in Ramadi, Iraq, a vehicle-borne IED resulted in the collapse of an 8-story tall building during battle between the Iraqi military and Daesh (ISIS). The Daesh truck bomb was fired upon by a rocket-propelled grenade to detonate it.
*On 30 August 2016, Kurdish female soldier from YPJ, Asia Ramazan Antar, was killed in Manbij offensive, when ISIS suicide bombers drove cars filled with explosives towards the Kurdish front. 
*On 16 October 2017, Maltese journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia died in a car bomb attack.

* On 14 November 2021, a car bomb exploded outside of a women&#x27;s hospital in Liverpool after a man detonated an IED suicide vest inside a taxi, killing him and severely injuring the driver.
* During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian partisans have made extensive use of vehicular bomb attacks on Russian and collaborative officials in occupied areas, such as in the 2022 Crimean Bridge explosion
*On 20 August 2022, Aleksandr Dugin&#x27;s daughter, Darya Dugina, was killed in Bolshiye Vyazyomy, Moscow Oblast by a bomb placed on Dugin&#x27;s car.
*In late February 2023, it was reported that the Russian Army attempted to use a MT-LB filled with OFAB-100-120 aerial bombs and mine-clearing charges from the UR-77 vehicle against Ukrainian positions. 
*On 18 June 2023, the Russian Army was documented as using a T-55 tank filled with approximately 6 tons of high explosives against entrenched Ukrainian Forces near Marinka, Donetsk Oblast with the intent of clearing the trenches.
*On 10 September 2023, it was reported that Ukraine&#x27;s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade converted a captured T-62 tank into a VBIED filled with 1.5 tons of explosives and drove it against Russian positions in the Zaporizhzhia region. The tank hit a mine and exploded before it could reach the enemy positions.
*On 13 July 2024, Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks attempt was unsuccessful and he was killed in the process. Following his death, investigators found explosive devices in the trunk of his car, suggesting he planned to set off an explosion remotely as a possible distraction.
*On January 1, 2025, at approximately 8:39 a.m. PST, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the main entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Special Forces Sergeant Matthew Alan Livelsberger from Colorado Springs, Colorado, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just before the explosion. Seven bystanders sustained minor injuries from the blast.

<text>Sir John Betjeman, (; 28 August 190619 May 1984) was an English poet, writer, and broadcaster. He was Poet Laureate from 1972 until his death. He was a founding member of The Victorian Society and a passionate defender of Victorian architecture, helping to save St Pancras railway station from demolition. He began his career as a journalist and ended it as one of the most popular British Poets Laureate and a much-loved figure on British television.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Betjeman was born in London to a prosperous silverware maker of Dutch descent. His parents, Mabel () and Ernest Betjemann, had a family firm at 34–42 Pentonville Road which manufactured the kind of ornamental household furniture and gadgets distinctive to Victorians.

During the First World War the family name was changed to the less German-looking Betjeman. His father&#x27;s forebears had actually come from the present day Netherlands more than a century earlier, setting up their home and business in Islington, London, and during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War had, ironically, added the extra &quot;-n&quot; to avoid the anti-Dutch sentiment existing at the time.

Betjeman was baptised at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Highgate Rise, a 19th-century church at the foot of Highgate West Hill. The family lived at Parliament Hill Mansions in the Lissenden Gardens private estate in Gospel Oak in north London.

In 1909, the Betjemanns moved half a mile north to more opulent Highgate. From West Hill they lived in the reflected glory of the Burdett-Coutts estate:

Betjeman&#x27;s early schooling was at the local Byron House and Highgate School, where he was taught by poet T. S. Eliot. After this, he boarded at the Dragon School preparatory school in North Oxford and Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire. In his penultimate year, he joined the secret Society of Amici in which he was a contemporary of both Louis MacNeice and Graham Shepard. He founded &quot;The Heretick&quot;, a satirical magazine that lampooned Marlborough&#x27;s obsession with sport. While at school, his exposure to the works of Arthur Machen won him over to High Church Anglicanism, a conversion of importance to his later writing and conception of the arts. Betjeman left Marlborough in July 1925.

===Magdalen College, Oxford===
Betjeman entered the University of Oxford with difficulty, having failed the mathematics portion of the university&#x27;s matriculation exam, Responsions. He was, however, admitted as a commoner (i.e., a non-scholarship student) at Magdalen College and entered the newly created School of English Language and Literature. At Oxford, Betjeman made little use of the academic opportunities. His tutor, a young C. S. Lewis, regarded him as an &quot;idle prig&quot; and Betjeman in turn considered Lewis unfriendly, demanding, and uninspiring as a teacher. Betjeman particularly disliked the coursework&#x27;s emphasis on linguistics, and dedicated most of his time to cultivating his social life, his interest in English ecclesiastical architecture, and private literary pursuits.

At Oxford, he was a friend of Maurice Bowra, later to be Warden of Wadham (1938 to 1970). Betjeman had a poem published in &quot;Isis&quot;, the university magazine, and served as editor of the &quot;Cherwell&quot; student newspaper during 1927. His first book of poems was privately printed with the help of fellow student Edward James. He brought his teddy bear Archibald Ormsby-Gore up to Magdalen with him, the memory of which inspired his Oxford contemporary Evelyn Waugh to include Sebastian Flyte&#x27;s teddy Aloysius in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. Much of this period of his life is recorded in his blank verse autobiography, &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;, published in 1960 and made into a television film in 1976.

It is a common misapprehension, cultivated by Betjeman himself, that he did not complete his degree because he failed to pass the compulsory holy scripture examination, known colloquially as &quot;Divvers&quot;, short for &quot;Divinity&quot;. In Hilary term 1928, Betjeman failed Divinity for the second time. He had to leave the university for the Trinity term to prepare for a retake of the exam; he was then allowed to return in October. Betjeman then wrote to the Secretary of the Tutorial Board at Magdalen, G. C. Lee, asking to be entered for the Pass School, a set of examinations taken on rare occasions by undergraduates who are deemed unlikely to achieve an honours degree. In &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot; Betjeman claims that his tutor, C. S. Lewis, said &quot;You&#x27;d have only got a third&quot; – but he had informed the tutorial board that he thought Betjeman would not achieve an honours degree of any class.

Permission to sit the Pass School was granted. Betjeman decided to offer a paper in Welsh. Osbert Lancaster tells the story that a tutor came by train twice a week (first class) from Aberystwyth to teach Betjeman. However, Jesus College had a number of Welsh tutors who more probably would have taught him. Betjeman finally had to leave at the end of the Michaelmas term, 1928. Betjeman did pass his Divinity examination on his third try but was expelled after failing the Pass School. He had achieved a satisfactory result in only one of the three required papers (on Shakespeare and other English authors). Betjeman&#x27;s academic failure at Oxford rankled him for the rest of his life and he was never reconciled with C. S. Lewis, towards whom he nursed a bitter detestation. This situation was perhaps complicated by his enduring love of Oxford, from which he accepted an honorary doctorate of letters in 1974.

===After university===

Betjeman left Oxford without a degree. Whilst there, however, he had made the acquaintance of people who would later influence his work, including Louis MacNeice and W. H. Auden. He worked briefly as a private secretary, school teacher and film critic for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, where he also wrote for their high-society gossip column, the &quot;Londoner&#x27;s Diary&quot;. He was employed by the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; between 1930 and 1935, as a full-time assistant editor, following their publishing of some of his freelance work. Timothy Mowl (2000) says, &quot;His years at the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; were to be his true university&quot;. At this time, while his prose style matured, he joined the MARS Group, an organisation of young modernist architects and architectural critics in Britain.

In 1937, Betjeman was a churchwarden at Uffington, the Berkshire village (in Oxfordshire since boundary changes of 1974) where he lived from 1934 to 1945. That year, he paid for the cleaning of the church&#x27;s royal arms and later presided over the conversion of the church&#x27;s oil lamps to electricity.

The &quot;Shell Guides&quot; were developed by Betjeman and Jack Beddington, a friend who was publicity manager with Shell-Mex &amp; BP, to guide Britain&#x27;s growing number of motorists around the counties of Britain and their historical sites. They were published by the Architectural Press and financed by Shell. By the start of World War II 13 had been published, of which &quot;Cornwall&quot; (1934) and &quot;Devon&quot; (1936) were written by Betjeman. A third, &quot;Shropshire&quot;, was written with and designed by his good friend John Piper in 1951.

In 1939, Betjeman was rejected for military service in World War II but found war work with the films division of the Ministry of Information. In 1941, he became British press attaché in neutral Dublin, Ireland, working with Sir John Maffey. He is reported to have been selected for murder by the IRA. The order was rescinded after a meeting with an unnamed Old IRA man who was impressed by his works.

Betjeman wrote poems based on his experiences in Ireland during the &quot;Emergency&quot; (the war) including &quot;The Irish Unionist&#x27;s Farewell to Greta Hellstrom in 1922&quot; (written during the war) which contained the refrain &quot;Dungarvan in the rain&quot;. The object of his affections, &quot;Greta&quot;, remained a mystery until revealed to have been a member of a well-known Anglo-Irish family of Western county Waterford. His official brief included establishing friendly contacts with leading figures in the Dublin literary scene: he befriended Patrick Kavanagh, then at the very start of his career. Kavanagh celebrated the birth of Betjeman&#x27;s daughter with a poem &quot;Candida&quot;; another well-known poem contains the line &quot;Let John Betjeman call for me in a car&quot;. From March to November 1944 Betjeman was assigned to another wartime job, working on publicity for the Admiralty in Bath.

===After the Second World War===

By 1948, Betjeman had published more than a dozen books. Five of these were verse collections, including one in the USA. Sales of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1958 reached 100,000. The popularity of the book prompted Ken Russell to make a film about him, &quot;John Betjeman: A Poet in London&quot; (1959). Filmed in 35 mm and running 11 minutes and 35 seconds, it was first shown on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; programme. From 1945 till 1951 he lived at The Old Rectory, Farnborough, Wantage, Berkshire. In 1951 he moved to the Mead in Wantage, until 1971. His daughter Candida was married in the church there in May 1963.

Betjeman continued writing guidebooks and works on architecture during the 1960s and 1970s and began to broadcast. Betjeman was closely associated with the culture and spirit of Metro-land, as outer reaches of the Metropolitan Railway were known before the war. 
In 1967, Betjeman was considered as a candidate to be the new Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, following the death of John Masefield. He was rejected after the Prime Minister&#x27;s Appointments Secretary John Hewitt consulted with Dame Helen Gardner, the Merton Professor of English at the University of Oxford (who stated that Betjeman was &quot;a lightweight, amusing but rather trivial&quot; with &quot;critical views about the establishment&quot;) and Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, chair of The Poetry Society (who stated that Betjeman &quot;called himself a poetic hack and there was some truth to this&quot;). Prime Minister Harold Wilson ultimately selected Cecil Day-Lewis after Hewitt recommended him over Betjeman, whom Hewitt described to Wilson as a &quot;backward-looking choice&quot; and &quot;the songster of tennis lawns and cathedral cloisters&quot;. 

Betjeman would become Poet Laureate in 1972 following the death of Day-Lewis, the first Knight Bachelor to be appointed (the only other, Sir William Davenant, was knighted after his appointment). This role, combined with his profile from television appearances, ensured that his poetry reached a wider audience. Similarly to Tennyson, he managed to voice the thoughts and aspirations of many ordinary people while retaining the respect of many of his fellow poets. This is partly because of the apparently simple traditional metrical structures and rhymes he uses. 
In the early 1970s, he began a recording career of four albums on Charisma Records - &quot;Banana Blush&quot;, &quot;Late Flowering Love&quot; (both 1974), &quot;Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s Britain&quot; (1977) and &quot;Varsity Rag&quot; (1981) where his poetry reading is set to music composed by Jim Parker with overdubbing by leading musicians of the time. Madeleine Dring set five of Betjeman&#x27;s poems to music in 1976, just before her death. His recording catalogue extends to nine albums, four singles and two compilations.

In 1973, he made a well-regarded television documentary for the BBC called &quot;Metro-Land&quot;, directed by Edward Mirzoeff. In 1974, Betjeman and Mirzoeff followed up &quot;Metro-Land&quot; with &quot;A Passion for Churches&quot;, a celebration of Betjeman&#x27;s beloved Church of England, filmed entirely in the Diocese of Norwich. In 1975, he proposed that the Fine Rooms of Somerset House should house the Turner Bequest, so helping to scupper the plan of the Minister for the Arts for a Theatre Museum to be housed there. In 1977, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Realm: A Prospect of England&quot;, an aerial anthology of English landscape, music and poetry, selected by Betjeman and produced by Edward Mirzoeff, in celebration of the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee.

Betjeman was fond of the ghost stories of M. R. James and supplied an introduction to Peter Haining&#x27;s book &quot;M. R. James – Book of the Supernatural&quot;. He was susceptible to the supernatural; Diana Mitford recalled Betjeman staying at her country home, Biddesden House in Wiltshire, in the 1920s. She said: &quot;he had a terrifying dream, that he was handed a card with wide black edges, and on it his name was engraved, and a date. He knew this was the date of his death&quot;. 

===Personal life and death===
On 29 July 1933, Betjeman married the Hon. Penelope Chetwode, the daughter of Field Marshal Lord Chetwode. The couple lived in Berkshire and had a son, Paul, in 1937, and a daughter, Candida, in 1942. She became a Roman Catholic in 1948. The couple drifted apart and in 1951 he met Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, with whom he developed an immediate and lifelong friendship.

Betjeman&#x27;s sexuality can best be described as bisexual. His longest and best documented relationships were with women, and a fairer analysis of his sexuality may be that he was &quot;the hatcher of a lifetime of schoolboy crushes – both gay and straight&quot;, most of which progressed no further. Nevertheless, he has been considered &quot;temperamentally gay&quot;, and even became a penpal of Lord Alfred &#x27;Bosie&#x27; Douglas, friend and lover of Oscar Wilde.

For the last decade of his life, Betjeman suffered increasingly from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died at his home in Trebetherick, Cornwall, on 19 May 1984, aged 77, and is buried nearby at St Enodoc&#x27;s Church.
Betjeman was an Anglican and his religious beliefs come through in some of his poems. In a letter written on Christmas Day 1947, he said: &quot;Also my view of the world is that man is born to fulfil the purposes of his Creator i.e. to Praise his Creator, to stand in awe of Him and to dread Him. In this way I differ from most modern poets, who are agnostics and have an idea that Man is the centre of the Universe or is a helpless bubble blown about by uncontrolled forces.&quot; He combined piety with a nagging uncertainty about the truth of Christianity. Unlike Thomas Hardy, who disbelieved in the truth of the Christmas story while hoping it might be so, Betjeman affirms his belief even while fearing it might be false. In the poem &quot;Christmas&quot;, one of his most openly religious pieces, the last three stanzas that proclaim the wonder of Christ&#x27;s birth do so in the form of a question &quot;And is it true...?&quot; His views on Christianity were expressed in his poem &quot;The Conversion of St. Paul&quot;, a response to a radio broadcast by humanist Margaret Knight:
==Poetry==

Betjeman&#x27;s poems are often humorous, and in broadcasting he exploited his bumbling and fogeyish image. His wryly comic verse is accessible and has attracted a great following for its satirical and observant grace. Auden said in his introduction to &quot;Slick But Not Streamlined&quot;, &quot;so at home with the provincial gaslit towns, the seaside lodgings, the bicycle, the harmonium.&quot; His poetry is similarly redolent of time and place, continually seeking out intimations of the eternal in the manifestly ordinary. There are constant evocations of the physical chaff and clutter that accumulates in everyday life, the miscellanea of an England now gone but not beyond the reach of living memory.

He talks of Ovaltine and Sturmey-Archer bicycle gears. &quot;Oh! Fuller&#x27;s angel cake, Robertson&#x27;s marmalade,&quot; he writes, &quot;Liberty lampshades, come shine on us all.&quot;

In a 1962 radio interview he told teenage questioners that he could not write about &#x27;abstract things&#x27;, preferring places, and faces. Philip Larkin wrote of his work, &quot;how much more interesting &amp; worth writing about Betjeman&#x27;s subjects are than most other modern poets, I mean, whether so-and-so achieves some metaphysical inner unity is not really so interesting to us as the overbuilding of rural Middlesex&quot;.

Prompted by the rapid development of the Buckinghamshire town before World War II, Betjeman wrote the ten-stanza poem &quot;Slough&quot; to express his dismay at the industrialisation of Britain. He later came to regret having written it. The poem was first included in his 1937 collection &quot;Continual Dew&quot;.
==Betjeman and architecture==


Betjeman had a fondness for Victorian architecture at a time when it was unfashionable, and he was a founding member of The Victorian Society. He wrote on this subject in &quot;First and Last Loves&quot; (1952) and more extensively in &quot;London&#x27;s Historic Railway Stations&quot; in 1972, defending the beauty of 12 stations. He led the campaign to save Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, in London when it was threatened with demolition in the early 1970s. He was also a founding member of the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1957.

He fought a spirited but unsuccessful campaign to save the Propylaeum, known commonly as the Euston Arch, London. He is considered instrumental in helping to save St Pancras railway station, London, and was commemorated when it became an international terminus for Eurostar in November 2007. He called the plan to demolish St Pancras a &quot;criminal folly&quot;. About it he wrote, &quot;What [the Londoner] sees in his mind&#x27;s eye is that cluster of towers and pinnacles seen from Pentonville Hill and outlined against a foggy sunset and the great arc of Barlow&#x27;s train shed gaping to devour incoming engines and the sudden burst of exuberant Gothic of the hotel seen from gloomy Judd Street&quot;. On the reopening of St Pancras station in 2007, the Statue of John Betjeman was commissioned from curators Futurecity. A proposal by artist Martin Jennings was selected from a shortlist. The finished work was erected in the station at platform level, including a series of slate roundels depicting selections of Betjeman&#x27;s writings.

Betjeman was given the remaining two-year lease on Victorian Gothic architect William Burges&#x27;s Tower House in Holland Park after leaseholder Mrs E. R. B. Graham died in 1962. Betjeman felt he could not afford the financial implications of taking over the house permanently, with his potential liability for £10,000 of renovations upon the expiry of the lease. After damage from vandals, restoration began in 1966. Betjeman&#x27;s lease included furniture from the house by Burges and Betjeman gave three pieces, the Zodiac settle, the Narcissus washstand and the Philosophy cabinet, to Evelyn Waugh.

He edited, and wrote large sections of, &quot;The Collins Guide to English Parish Churches&quot; (1958); his substantial editorial preface was described by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; as &quot;pure gold&quot;. The classic status of this book is acknowledged by Simon Jenkins in his &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;: &quot;Three ghosts inhabit all English churches ... They are those of John Betjeman, Alec Clifton-Taylor and Nikolaus Pevsner.&quot;

Betjeman responded to architecture as the visible manifestation of society&#x27;s spiritual life as well as its political and economic structure. He attacked speculators and bureaucrats for what he saw as their rapacity and lack of imagination. In the preface of his collection of architectural essays &quot;First and Last Loves&quot; he wrote
In a BBC film made in 1968, but not broadcast at that time, Betjeman described the sound of Leeds to be of &quot;Victorian buildings crashing to the ground&quot;. He went on to lambast John Poulson&#x27;s British Railways House (now City House), saying how it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money with no architectural merit. He also praised the architecture of Leeds Town Hall. In 1969, Betjeman contributed the foreword to Derek Linstrum&#x27;s &quot;Historic Architecture of Leeds&quot;.

Betjeman was for over 20 years a trustee of the Bath Preservation Trust and was vice-president from 1965 to 1971, at a time when Bath—a city rich in Georgian architecture—was coming under increasing pressure from modern developers and a road had been proposed to cut across it. He also created a short television documentary, &quot;Architecture of Bath&quot;, in which he voiced his concerns about the way the city&#x27;s architectural heritage was being mistreated. From 1946 to 1948, he had served as Secretary to the Oxford Preservation Trust. Betjeman was also instrumental in saving the Duke of Cornwall Hotel in Plymouth.

===Prizes===
The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings annually presents a John Betjeman award to recognise the repair and conservation of places of worship in England and Wales.

The John Betjeman Poetry Competition for Young People began in 2006 and was open to 10- to 13-year-olds living anywhere in the British Isles (including the Republic of Ireland), with a first prize of £1,000. In addition to prizes for individual finalists, state schools who enter pupils may win one of six one-day poetry workshops. In 2020, &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported that the prize was to close after thirteen years.

<doc id="155290" wikidata="Q2753237" url="?curid=155290" title="Blyth, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Blyth is a village and civil parish in the Bassetlaw district of the county of Nottinghamshire, in the East Midlands, north west of East Retford, on the River Ryton. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 1,233, and this increased to 1,265 in 2021. It sits at a junction with the A1, and the end of the motorway section from Doncaster.

==Geography==
The village is situated on the A1 at the southern end of the fifteen-mile A1(M) Doncaster bypass, which opened in 1961. The Blyth roundabout was replaced in March 2008 by a grade separated junction (junction 34).

The £320,000 (equivalent to £ in ), 1½ mile A614 Blyth Bypass was built at the same time as the Nottinghamshire section of the Doncaster Bypass and opened in October 1960. 

The A614 became the A1 when the Doncaster bypass opened. Also passing through the village is the A634 from Maltby to Barnby Moor. The dual-carriageway £964,000 (equivalent to £ in ), five-mile section of the A1 from Chequer House (Ranby) to Blyth opened in August 1966. The former A614 road through the town is now the A634 and B6045.

===Services===
The Blue Star service area closed on Wednesday 18 December 1985. It had opened in 1956.

The Moto Blyth Services are also at this junction.

==History==
===Blyth Priory===

The priory church of St. Mary and St. Martin is one of the oldest examples of Norman architecture in the country. It was part of a Benedictine monastery founded in 1088. This priory was founded by Roger de Builli of Tickhill Castle, one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s followers.

The founder and later benefactors endowed Blyth with lands, money and churches. It was staffed at first by monks from the Mother House, Holy Trinity Priory at Rouen France. In 1286 Thomas Russel had to be returned to Rouen because of his intolerable conduct and also John de Belleville, as the climate did not suit him. There are other records of the unruly conduct of French monks.

During a visitation of the priory in 1536 it was alleged that five of the monks were guilty of grave offences and it was surrendered. George Dalton, the Prior, received a pension of twenty marks, and this seems to have been the only pension awarded. The net annual income at the date of the surrender was £180. (equivalent to £ in ).

After the Dissolution the east part of the church was demolished and a tower built at the west end of the nave.

See St Mary and St Martin&#x27;s Church, Blyth for more information.

===Blyth Hall===
In 1603 Sir Edward Stanhope sold the Blyth estate to Robert Saunderson, of Gilthwaite, Rotherham.

In 1635 the 490-acre estate was sold by the Saunderson family to John Mellish, a London merchant. His son Edward, a merchant in Portugal, returned to England in 1671 and in 1684 commissioned the demolition of the old priory and the building of Blyth Hall immediately north of the church. The hall stood at approximately 53°22&#x27;45.39&quot;N 1° 3&#x27;48.46&quot;W. He was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1692–93 and died unmarried in 1703, leaving the property to Joseph Mellish, his cousin&#x27;s son. It descended in the Mellish family until 1806, when it was sold to Joshua Walker, the son of an ironmaster from Rotherham.

Joshua&#x27;s son and heir, Henry Frederick Walker (born 1807), was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1852–53. At the end of the 19th century the hall was bought by Francis Willey, 1st Baron Barnby, a Bradford wool merchant. He was High Sheriff for 1908–09 and was succeeded by his son Vernon Willey, 2nd Baron Barnby, who was the MP for South Bradford.

The hall was demolished in 1972 and the site is now occupied by a housing estate.

On the village green is the former Leper Hospital of St John the Evangelist, said to have been built by the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem. It was refounded in 1226, and was being used as a school in 1695.

Blyth is situated near to Hodsock Priory.

<text>The Denis d’or () was reportedly the first musical instrument in history that involved electricity.

==Background==
The Czech theologian Václav Prokop Diviš, who had his parish in the Moravian town Přímětice near Znojmo, was interested in both music and electricity. He studied the use of electricity first for medical and agrarian purposes, and later for the prevention of thunderstorms. He also tried to apply it to music when he created his own musical instrument that he named &quot;Denis d&#x27;or&quot;, with the French &quot;Denis&quot; (etymologically going back to &quot;Dionysus&quot;), whose Czech counterpart is &quot;Diviš&quot;—hence the name.

The earliest written mention of the Denis d&#x27;or dates from 1753, but it is likely that it already existed around 1748. Some sources even date its existence as far back as the year 1730, but this claim is historically untenable and not supported by any available information on Diviš&#x27;s biography and work. Unfortunately, after Diviš&#x27;s death in 1765 the unique instrument was sold and eventually brought to Vienna, where it vanished without trace.

Surviving descriptions of the Denis d&#x27;or are short and very few, so that it is not even possible to clarify whether it was truly an electrophone or not. Diviš has been called the first person to foster the idea of an aesthetic connection between music and electricity. However, Jean-Baptiste Thillaie Delaborde built the clavecin électrique a few years later, an instrument that is much better documented.

==Properties of the instrument==
The Denis d&#x27;or was reported to have 14 registers, most of which were twofold, and its complex mechanism fitted in a symmetrical wooden cabinet equipped with a keyboard and a pedal. It was about long, wide, and high. Basically, it was a chordophone not unlike a clavichord—in other words, the strings were struck, not plucked. The suspension and the tautening of the allegedly 790 metal strings was described as more elaborate than a clavichord. The mechanism which had been worked out by Diviš was such that the Denis d’or could imitate the sounds of a variety of other instruments, including chordophones such as harpsichords, harps, lutes and wind instruments. This was mainly owing to the responsiveness and combinability of the stops, which permitted the player to vary the sound in multiple ways, thereby generating far more than a hundred different tonal voices altogether.

Finally, the novelty instrument produced electric shocks as practical jokes on the player. When the German theologian Johann Ludwig Fricker (1729–1766) visited Diviš in 1753 and saw the Denis d&#x27;or with his own eyes, he referred to it in a journal of the University of Tübingen as an &quot;Electrisch-Musicalische[s] Instrument&quot;—the literal translation of which is &quot;electric musical instrument&quot;.

It is disputed whether the Denis d&#x27;or sounds were also produced by electricity or if it was an otherwise acoustical instrument like the clavichord. Allegedly, Diviš could charge the iron strings with electricity in order to enhance the sound quality. This would be a possible explanation for effects that the audience perceived as electric in nature and might have been achieved with Leyden jars or similar equipment commonly used in early research on electricity.

<text>Liam Cosgrave (13 April 1920 – 4 October 2017) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Taoiseach from 1973 to 1977, Leader of Fine Gael from 1965 to 1977, Leader of the Opposition from 1965 to 1973, Minister for External Affairs from 1954 to 1957, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Government Chief Whip from 1948 to 1951. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1943 to 1981.

Born in Castleknock, Dublin, Cosgrave was the son of W. T. Cosgrave, the first President of the Executive Council in the newly formed Irish Free State. After qualifying as a barrister he began a political career. He was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1943 general election and sat in opposition alongside his father. In the first inter-party government in 1948, Cosgrave was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach John A. Costello. He became a cabinet member in 1954 when he was appointed Minister for External Affairs. The highlight of his three-year tenure was Ireland&#x27;s successful entry into the United Nations. In 1965, Cosgrave was the unanimous choice of his colleagues to succeed James Dillon as leader of Fine Gael. He lost the 1969 general election to the incumbent Taoiseach Jack Lynch, but won the 1973 general election and became Taoiseach in a Fine Gael-Labour Party government.

Cosgrave died on 4 October 2017, at the age of 97. He remains to date the longest-lived Taoiseach, and was also the last Taoiseach born before the partition of Ireland.

==Early life==
Cosgrave displayed a keen interest in politics from an early age, discussing the topic with his father as a teenager before eventually joining Fine Gael at the age of 17, speaking at his first public meeting the same year. He was educated at Synge Street CBS, then later at Castleknock College, Dublin, and later at King&#x27;s Inns. He studied law and was called to the Irish Bar in 1943.

==Political career==
===Political beginnings===

To the surprise of his family, Liam sought election to Dáil Éireann in the 1943 general election and was elected as a TD for Dublin County at the age of 23, sitting in the 11th Dáil alongside his father W. T. Cosgrave who was one of the founders of the Irish Free State in the 1920s. Cosgrave rapidly rose through the ranks of Fine Gael, and was regarded as being by far the most able and active of Fine Gael&#x27;s newer TDs. His election in 1943 occurred during a long period when his party was in opposition, from 1932 to 1948.

Cosgrave wrote to the Party Leader, Richard Mulcahy, in May 1947, on the poor attendance in the Dáil, and informed his leader that &quot;I cannot any longer conscientiously ask the public to support the party as a party, and in the circumstances I do not propose to speak at meetings outside my constituency.&quot; Nevertheless, when the First Inter-Party government was formed after the 1948 general election, Taoiseach John A. Costello nominated Cosgrave for appointment by the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Chief Whip and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 24 February 1948. He served in these positions until the dissolution of the Dáil on 7 May 1951.

===Minister===
After the 1954 general election, a Second Inter-Party government was formed on 2 June 1954, led again by John A. Costello. Cosgrave, at the age of 34, was appointed to the position of Minister for External Affairs. Cosgrave took part in trade discussions and chaired the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1955. He also presided over Ireland&#x27;s admission to the United Nations in 1955. Cosgrave outlined the three principles of his foreign policy to the Dáil in June 1956: adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, independence and non-alignment, and &quot;to do whatever we can as a member of the UN to preserve the Christian civilisation of which we are a part and with that end in view to support whenever possible those powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in their resistance to the spread of communist power and influence&quot;. Ireland was non-aligned in favour of the United States. The second Inter-Party government collapsed amid severely deflationary policies set by the Minister for Finance, Gerard Sweetman. Cosgrave held Sweetman personally responsible for Fine Gael&#x27;s defeat at the 1957 general election, and told him so, reportedly stating that Fine Gael &quot;was no longer led by people living in big houses at the end of long avenues.&quot; He did not speak to Sweetman for some years.

===Opposition===
Cosgrave remained active in opposition. He privately supported Fianna Fáil&#x27;s referendum to abolish the system of proportional representation in June 1959, which was defeated. This opposition was to count against him later that year in the leadership contest. In October 1959, the dual leadership of Fine Gael, Mulcahy and Costello, stood down. Costello wanted to continue his practice as a senior counsel as well as being a leader. He had asked Cosgrave to be his &quot;managing director&quot; in the Dáil while he was absent on legal work, which had declined to do. James Dillon and Cosgrave contested the leadership with Dillon decisively being elected as leader. With Fine Gael in opposition during the 1960s, an internal struggle for the policy direction of the party was beginning. A large body of members called on Fine Gael to move decisively towards social democracy. A set of eight principles known as the &quot;Just Society&quot; was put forward to the party leadership by Declan Costello, the son of John A. Costello. The principles called for higher state spending on health and social welfare with a greater state role in the economy. Despite his conservative credentials, Cosgrave adopted a somewhat positive attitude to the Just Society document. Fianna Fáil went on to win the 1965 general election and Fine Gael remained in opposition.

===Fine Gael leader===
In 1965, when James Dillon resigned as leader of Fine Gael after the 1965 general election loss, Liam Cosgrave easily won the leadership. He led his party to defeat in the 1969 election and was under constant threat and challenge by younger more social democratic elements represented by Garret FitzGerald who was elected to the Dáil in 1969. Cosgrave&#x27;s erstwhile opponent, Declan Costello, had retired in 1969. Cosgrave&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1970. He played a key role in the Arms Crisis, when, as Leader of the Opposition, he pressured then Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to take action against senior ministers who were involved in importing arms intended for the Provisional IRA. The information had been leaked to him by the Garda Special Branch, who had already informed the Taoiseach.

Cosgrave&#x27;s determination to support government anti-terrorist legislation in votes in the Dáil, in the face of opposition from his party, almost cost him his leadership. The growing liberal wing of Fine Gael was opposing the Government&#x27;s stringent laws on civil liberty grounds. Cosgrave put the security of the State and its institutions first. At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis in May 1972, Cosgrave faced down his political opponents. In a speech littered with references to Fine Gael&#x27;s founding fathers, he contrasted the difficulties posed by the IRA in Northern Ireland with those faced by the first Free State government in dealing with the anti-treatyites. Departing from his script, Cosgrave rounded on his leadership rivals. Asking delegates if they did any hunting Cosgrave declared that &quot;… some of these commentators and critics are now like mongrel foxes; they are gone to ground but I&#x27;ll dig them out, and the pack will chop them when they get them&quot;. Though he was criticised for taking a &quot;partionist&quot; or unionist stance in his speech, Cosgrave led Fine Gael to office a year later. Cosgrave supported the government&#x27;s Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill in November 1972, despite the position taken by Fine Gael to oppose the Bill.

==Taoiseach (1973–1977)==
 
After the 1973 general election, Cosgrave led a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, formed on 14 March. He adhered to the implementation of the Fourteen Point Plan on which the National Coalition was elected. Among the government ministers were future Taoiseach and writer Garret FitzGerald, former United Nations diplomat Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, television presenter and veterinary professor Justin Keating. Cosgrave balanced these with hardline Christian Democrats such as Richard Burke, former teacher Peter Barry and west Dublin farmer Mark Clinton. He appointed Richie Ryan rather than Garret FitzGerald as his Minister for Finance when the Labour Party leader, Brendan Corish, declined the position in 1973. Ryan, a Dublin solicitor, was of typically conservative Fine Gael stock. Nevertheless, Ryan (dubbed &quot;Red Richie&quot; by Fianna Fáil) implemented the Coalition&#x27;s plans to replace death duties with a range of capital taxes, including Capital Gains Tax and Wealth Tax. Fianna Fáil strongly opposed these new capital taxes and garnered considerable support from the wealthy and propertied classes as a result that would stand them in good stead in future elections.

The world energy crisis triggered by the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, which caused inflationary problems, and constrained the coalition fiscally.

===Contraception===
In December 1973, the Supreme Court declared the ban on the importation of contraceptives by married persons to be unconstitutional. Patrick Cooney, the Minister for Justice, introduced legislation in 1974 to regulate and allow married couples to obtain contraceptives. Fianna Fáil opposed any liberalisation of the law on family planning and opposed the bill in the Dáil on grounds of protection of public morality and health. In line with his conservative credentials, and on a free vote, Cosgrave, without warning, crossed the floor to help defeat the bill in the summer of 1974.

===Clashes with the Presidency===
The coalition suffered an early electoral defeat in the 1973 presidential election, when Fine Gael candidate Tom O&#x27;Higgins was defeated by the Fianna Fáil candidate, Erskine H. Childers. Childers had sought the presidency with promises of making the office more open and hands-on, in particular with plans to create a think tank within Áras an Uachtaráin to develop an outline for Ireland&#x27;s future. Cosgrave refused to allow it, and frustrated Childers&#x27; plans to break with the restrained precedent of his office.

Childers died suddenly in November 1974. His successor Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, a former Chief Justice of Ireland and former Attorney General of Ireland, was an agreed candidate in an unopposed election. Ó Dálaigh was identified with Fianna Fáil.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryIreland2007-09/10a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ó Dálaigh was also a noted critic of the curtailment of free speech and was highly critical of the introduction of Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, which forbade the broadcast of the voices of Sinn Féin members. This put him at odds with Cosgrave, whose government had strengthened the Act. Cosgrave also briefed President Ó Dálaigh only once every six months, which was, in the President&#x27;s opinion, too infrequently as well as too inadequately. In addition, Cosgrave frequently interfered in Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s constitutional role as the state&#x27;s representative to foreign governments; he was not permitted to receive the Legion of Honour from France, although former president Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly had previously received it, and Cosgrave attended the United States&#x27; bicentennial celebrations in 1976 in Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s place.

The government had introduced the Emergency Powers Bill following the assassination in July of the British Ambassador to Ireland, Christopher Ewart-Biggs, by the IRA; it had passed the Dáil on 21 September. After consultation with the Council of State, Ó Dálaigh exercised his power to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court two days later to test its constitutionality, bringing him into more direct conflict with the government. Although the Court ruled that the Bill was constitutional, and Ó Dálaigh signed the Bill into law on 16 October, an IRA action on the same day in Mountmellick resulted in the death of a member of Garda Michael Clerkin. Cosgrave&#x27;s government, already infuriated, blamed Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s delaying enactment of the bill for Clerkin&#x27;s murder. On 18 October Minister for Defence Paddy Donegan attacked the President for sending the bill to the Supreme Court, calling him a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot;.

Cosgrave called Ó Dálaigh to inform him of Donegan&#x27;s speech, but refused to meet with him in person to discuss the matter, partly due to his dislike for Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s Fianna Fáil links and perceived pretensions, fuelling the president&#x27;s anger. He refused to receive Donegan when he came to personally apologise. When Cosgrave then refused to accept Donegan&#x27;s resignation, this proved the last straw for Ó Dálaigh, who resigned on 22 October 1976 &quot;to protect the dignity and independence of the presidency as an institution&quot;.

===Northern Ireland===
The Government signed the Sunningdale Agreement in December 1973, an attempt to resolve political troubles in Northern Ireland. A power-sharing executive was set up and a Council of Ireland was to be established. The institutions established under the Agreement collapsed in May 1974 as a consequence of the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council Strike. In addition, many Republican voters were angered by what they saw as Cosgrave&#x27;s harsh line on the Provisional IRA and the handling of the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings.

The 2003 Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings noted that the Fine Gael/Labour government of the time &quot;showed little interest in the bombings&quot; and did not do enough to help the investigation. &quot;When information was given to them suggesting that the British authorities had intelligence naming the bombers, this was not followed up&quot;. It failed to put political pressure on the British government to secure better co-operation from the RUC. It was also alleged that the Fine Gael/Labour government caused or allowed the Garda investigation to end prematurely, for fear that the findings would play into the hands of republicans. However, the Inquiry had insufficient evidence the investigation was stopped as a result of political interference.

Both &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and the &quot;Irish Press&quot;, which was edited by Tim Pat Coogan, were extremely critical of the government&#x27;s curtailment of freedom of speech and in particular of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien which was used against the IRA. Coogan declared what he dubbed &quot;editorial war&quot; on the government after a, now notorious, interview between Bernard Nossiter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and O&#x27;Brien in August 1976 regarding the passage of the Emergency Powers Bill. During the course of the interview, O&#x27;Brien stated that he would&#x27;ve liked the bill to be used against teachers who glorified Irish revolutionaries and against newspaper editors who published letters in support of Republicans. The coalition attempted to prosecute &quot;The Irish Press&quot; for its coverage of the maltreatment of republican prisoners by the Garda &quot;Heavy Gang&quot;, with the paper winning the case. Cosgrave was accused of taking an anti-republican or pro-unionist line on Northern Ireland.

===Economic measures===
The Cosgrave government&#x27;s tough austerity measures alienated the public. Finance Minister Richie Ryan was nicknamed &#x27;Richie Ruin&#x27; on a satirical TV programme, &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot;. Marginal income tax rates came to 77% one year. The electorate had not experienced unemployment and hardship of this nature since the fifties and the Government became quite unpopular. The hard-line approach to law and order, and the economic difficulties were quite damaging to Cosgrave and Corish&#x27;s popularity.

===Welfare measures===
In the field of social security, a number of important reforms in welfare provision were introduced during Cosgrave&#x27;s premiership. In 1974, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and occupational injuries coverage were extended to all employees, while earnings-related components were added to the basic flat-rate sickness benefit, the basic flat-rate short-term occupational injury benefit, and the basic flat-rate unemployment benefit. That same year, pension insurance was extended to all employees, and a means-tested allowance for the wives of prisoners was introduced. In addition, welfare benefits were increased by 125% during the course of Cosgrave&#x27;s premiership.

===&quot;Blow-Ins&quot;: 1977 election===
In May 1977, Cosgrave addressed a Fine Gael Ard Fheis on the eve of the general election. He made a strong attack on &quot;blow-ins&quot; who could &quot;blow out or blow up&quot;. This was taken to be an attack either on Kader Asmal, founder of the Irish Anti Apartheid Movement and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or on Bruce Arnold, the British-born political writer in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper who had been vociferously opposed to Cosgrave&#x27;s policies, particularly regarding the President and the wealth tax. While the Fine Gael grassroots loved it, it backfired politically.

James Tully, the Labour Minister for Local Government had redrawn the constituency boundaries (the &quot;Tullymander&quot;) and had expected that the new boundaries would favour the two government parties. Dublin, apart from Dún Laoghaire, was divided into some 13 three-seat constituencies where Fine Gael and Labour were to take one seat each reducing Fianna Fáil to a minority rump in the capital. The election campaign started without Cosgrave taking any opinion polls in advance and was therefore unaware of the extent of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s support. During the campaign, the National Coalition made up some ground but the Fianna Fáil manifesto of promises (including the abolition of rates, and the car tax) was proved very popular in the electorate and the National Coalition was heavily defeated, with Fianna Fáil winning an unprecedentedly large parliamentary majority, including unexpected second seats in many Dublin constituencies.

In the immediate aftermath, Liam Cosgrave resigned as Fine Gael leader, to be succeeded by Garret FitzGerald. Cosgrave retired at the 1981 general election.

==Post-Taoiseach==

In 1981, Cosgrave retired as Dáil Deputy for Dún Laoghaire to be replaced by his son, Liam T. Cosgrave. He reduced his involvement in public life but he made occasional appearances and speeches; in October 2010 he attended the launch of &quot;The Reluctant Taoiseach&quot;, a book about former Taoiseach John A. Costello written by David McCullagh. He also appeared in public for the Centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016, watching on from a car as the military parade marched through Dublin. On 8 May 2016, in a joint appearance with the grandsons of Éamonn Ceannt and Cathal Brugha, he unveiled a plaque commemorating the 1916 Rising at St. James&#x27;s Hospital, the former site of the South Dublin Union.

He received an annual pension payment of €133,082. He lived in Knocklyon.

==Family==
His wife, Vera Cosgrave, died on 15 September 2016, aged 90. His son, Liam T. Cosgrave, is a former politician.

==Death==
Cosgrave died on 4 October 2017 at the age of 97 of natural causes. He had been at Tallaght Hospital for several months prior to his death there.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said &quot;Liam Cosgrave was someone who devoted his life to public service; a grateful country thanks and honours him for that and for always putting the nation first. Throughout his life, he worked to protect and defend the democratic institutions of our State and showed great courage and determination in doing so. He always believed in peaceful cooperation as the only way of achieving a genuine union between the people on this island, and in the 1970s he celebrated that this country had embarked, in his own words, &#x27;on a new career of progress and development in the context of Europe&#x27;. I had the honour on a few occasions to meet and be in the presence of Liam Cosgrave, and I was always struck by his commanding presence and great humility, which in him were complementary characteristics.&quot; His funeral was held on 7 October 2017, after which he was interred alongside his father at Inchicore&#x27;s Goldenbridge Cemetery.

He was the longest-lived Taoiseach, dying at the age of , on 4 October 2017, having surpassed Éamon de Valera&#x27;s record in early March 2013.

<text>Heavy Metal is a 1981 Canadian adult animated science fantasy anthology film directed by Gerald Potterton (in his director debut) and produced by Ivan Reitman and Leonard Mogel, who also was the publisher of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, which was the basis for the film. It starred the voices of Rodger Bumpass, Jackie Burroughs, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Don Francks, Martin Lavut, Marilyn Lightstone, Eugene Levy, Alice Playten, Harold Ramis, Percy Rodriguez, Susan Roman, Richard Romanus, August Schellenberg, John Vernon, and Zal Yanovsky. The screenplay was written by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum.

The film is an anthology of various science-fiction and fantasy stories tied together by a single theme of an evil force that is &quot;the sum of all evils&quot;. It was adapted from &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine and original stories in the same spirit. Like the magazine, the film features a great deal of graphic violence, sexuality, and nudity. Its production was expedited by having several animation houses working simultaneously on different segments.

Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics but was a moderate commercial success and has since achieved a cult following. Its soundtrack was packaged by music manager Irving Azoff and included several popular rock bands and artists, including Black Sabbath, Blue Öyster Cult, Sammy Hagar, Don Felder, Cheap Trick, DEVO, Journey, and Nazareth, among others.

A sequel, &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;, was released in 2000.

Original story by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum; based on &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; by Moebius.

In a dystopian and crime-ridden New York City in 2031, cynical taxicab driver Harry Canyon narrates his day in film noir style, grumbling about his fares and frequent robbery attempts he thwarts with a disintegrator installed in the back of his seat. He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a red-haired young woman from Rudnick, a gangster who murdered her father. She explains that her father discovered the Loc-Nar, and they have been pursued relentlessly by people attempting to obtain it. Harry takes her to his apartment, where they have sex. She decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the money with Harry. Rudnick is disintegrated by the Loc-Nar at the exchange, and she attempts to double-cross Harry to keep the money for herself. When she pulls out a gun, Harry uses the disintegrator on her. He keeps the money, and summarizes the incident as a &quot;two-day ride with one hell of a tip&quot;.

===&quot;Den&quot;===
Based on the character of the same name created by Richard Corben.

A nerdy teenager finds a &quot;green meteorite&quot; near his house and adds it to his rock collection. During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the young man into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, muscular man called Den, an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. There, Den witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a beautiful young woman who is about to be sacrificed to Uhluhtc. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. The two start having sex, but are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. After being taken to see Ard, Den demands to see Katherine. His request is ignored and Ard orders his men to castrate Den. Den fights off the soldiers and shoots Ard, who is immortal and heals immediately. The girl turns out to be sleeping, encased in glass under a spell where only Ard can awaken her. Ard offers Den a deal: if he gets the Loc-Nar from the Queen and brings it to him, the girl will be released. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace along with Ard&#x27;s best soldier, Norl. They are promptly caught by the Queen&#x27;s guards, but she offers leniency if Den has sex with her. He complies, thereby distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Den suspects that they were teleported to Earth. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset, content to remain in Neverwhere. As for the Loc-Nar, it rises into the sky and lands on a space station where it is picked up by someone else.

===&quot;Captain Sternn&quot;===
Based on the character of the same name created by Bernie Wrightson.

On a space station, crooked space captain Lincoln F. Sternn is on trial for numerous serious charges presented by the prosecutor consisting of 12 counts of murder in the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 counts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape — and one moving violation. Pleading &quot;not guilty&quot; against the advice of his lawyer Charlie, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness named Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand upon being called to by the prosecutor, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out highly incriminating statements about Sternn (though whether or not any of them are true is unknown) before changing him into a hulking muscular brute that chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, who gives him his promised payoff, and he promptly shrinks back to his scrawny original form. Sternn opens a trap door under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with Fiste&#x27;s flaming severed hand still clinging to it.

===&quot;Neverwhere Land&quot;===
Because of time constraints, a segment called &quot;Neverwhere Land&quot;, which would have connected &quot;Captain Sternn&quot; to &quot;B-17&quot;, was cut.

The story follows the influence of the Loc-Nar upon the evolution of a planet, from the Loc-Nar landing in a body of water, influencing the rise of the industrial age, and a world war. This original story was created by Cornelius Cole III.

The original rough animatics are set to a loop of the beginning of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot;. The 1996 VHS release included this segment at the end of the tape. On the DVD release, this segment is included as a bonus feature. In both released versions, the sequence is set to the music of &quot;Passacaglia&quot; (from &quot;Magnificat&quot;), composed and conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki and with animation studio being produced by Duck Soup Produckions.

===&quot;B-17&quot;===
A World War II B-17 bomber nicknamed the &quot;Pacific Pearl&quot; makes a difficult bombing run and suffers heavy damage with all of the crew except the pilot and co-pilot killed by gunfire. As the bomber limps home, the co-pilot goes back to check on the crew. Finding nothing but dead bodies, he notices the Loc-Nar trailing the plane. Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as zombies. The co-pilot is killed, while the pilot parachutes away in time. He lands on an island where he finds a graveyard of airplanes from various times, along with the wrecked airplanes&#x27; zombified airmen, who surround him, sealing the horrified pilot&#x27;s fate.

===&quot;So Beautiful &amp; So Dangerous&quot;===
Based on the comic of the same name by Angus McKie.

Dr. Anrak, a prominent scientist, arrives at The Pentagon for a meeting regarding mysterious mutations that are plaguing the United States. At the meeting, the doctor tries to dismiss the occurrences. When he sees the Loc-Nar in the locket of Gloria, a beautiful buxom stenographer, he begins to behave erratically and motorboats her. A colossal starship drills through the roof and abducts the doctor and, by accident, Gloria. The ship&#x27;s robot is irritated at Anrak, who is actually a malfunctioning android, but its mood changes when it sees Gloria. With the help of the ship&#x27;s alien pilot Edsel and co-pilot Zeke, the robot convinces Gloria to stay on board and have &quot;robot sex&quot; (albeit off-screen). Meanwhile, Edsel and Zeke snort a huge amount of a powdered drug called Plutonian Nyborg before flying home, zoning out on the cosmos. Too intoxicated to fly straight, they crash-land unharmed in a huge space station.

===&quot;Taarna&quot;===
Original story by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum; based on &quot;Arzach&quot; by Moebius.

The Loc-Nar, now the size of a giant meteor, crashes into a volcano on another world and draws a large mass of curious people. As they begin to climb the volcano, it erupts and green slime covers the crowd, mutating them into an evil barbarian army. The mutants subsequently attack a nearby city of peaceful scholars. Desperate, the city leaders mentally summon the Taarakians, a once powerful yet now declining warrior race with whom the city had a pact, but the city falls before the call can be answered.

Taarna, a beautiful and mute warrior and the last of the Taarakians, receives the summons. After ritually preparing herself, she and her avian mount fly to the beleaguered city, only to find the citizens dead. Determined to avenge them, she begins following the trail of their murderers and encounters a small band of the mutant barbarians. After killing them and with more information at hand, she travels towards the mutant camp, but she and her mount are captured.

Taarna is tortured and thrown into an open pit, unconscious. Her mount escapes and rescues her. She tries going for the Loc-Nar, but the mutants pursue and shoot her mount down. The mutant leader faces Taarna in a duel to the death, wounding her, but Taarna manages to kill him. With the last of their strength, Taarna and her companion make a death flight to the volcano. As they approach, the Loc-Nar warns her off, claiming that sacrificing herself would be futile. Ignoring the Loc-Nar, Taarna unleashes the power imbued in her sword and dives into the volcano, destroying the Loc-Nar.

===&quot;Epilogue&quot;===
As the final story ends, the Loc-Nar that was terrorizing the girl destabilizes and begins breaking up. The girl flees it and her home. The Loc-Nar then explodes, destroying the mansion in the process. Taarna&#x27;s reborn mount appears outside and the girl happily flies away on it. It is then revealed that Taarna&#x27;s soul has been reincarnated in the girl, transforming her into a new Taarakian.

==Production==
Ivan Reitman gained a deal with Columbia Pictures to create an animated film and asked Gerald Potterton to oversee it.

The initial script had Arzach as the framing device for the film, but the script was thrown out after Jean Giraud refused to allow the usage of his characters. Len Blum and Daniel Goldberg created Taarna and a green orb instead. Chris Achilléos did the character design for Taarna.

Michael Mills was hired to create the opening and closing segments, but script rewrites had the sequences redrawn multiple times. Reitman, displeased with the high expenses, withheld payment. Mills sued and the case was settled out of court. Reitman hired Jimmy T. Murakami to create a new opening.

Atkinson Film-Arts animated &quot;Harry Canyon&quot;, directed by Pino van Lamsweerde, and the B-17 segment by Barrie Nelson. &quot;Captain Sternn&quot; was animated by Boxcar films under the direction of Paul Sebella and Julian Szuchopa. Halas and Batchelor and TVC animated the other segments. &quot;Taarna&quot; was created in Montreal by 11 designers, 30 animators, and 54 assistants under the direction of John Bruno. José Abel, Danny Antonucci, and Zdenko Gašparović worked on &quot;Taarna&quot;.

Animator Robert Balser directed the animation of the &quot;Den&quot; sequence for the film. The film uses the rotoscoping technique of animation in several shots. This process consists of shooting models and actors, then tracing the shot onto film. There is also a short shot of the Pentagon in &quot;So Beautiful &amp; So Dangerous&quot; that contains CGI.

==Release==
The film was released on August 7, 1981. It was a financial success, grossing over $20 million on a $9 million budget (equivalent to a gross of $ million in ).

==Reception==
The film was met with mixed response. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 66% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10 and the critical consensus: &quot;It&#x27;s sexist, juvenile, and dated, but &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; makes up for its flaws with eye-popping animation and a classic, smartly-used soundtrack.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;for anyone who doesn&#x27;t think an hour and a half is a long time to spend with a comic book, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; is impressive,&quot; and noted that the film &quot;was scored very well, with music much less ear-splitting than the title would suggest.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;Initial segments have a boisterous blend of dynamic graphics, intriguing plot premises and sly wit that unfortunately slide gradually downhill ... Still, the net effect is an overridingly positive one and will likely find its way into upbeat word-of-mouth.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars, writing that it &quot;isn&#x27;t intended for close scrutiny on a literal level. The film clearly is intended as a trip, and on that level it works very nicely.&quot; He criticized the film as &quot;blatantly sexist&quot; and for having &quot;wildly romanticized&quot; violence. Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Somehow a great deal of the charm [of the magazine] leaked out on the way to the movie house, but all of the sadism stayed put. And then some. It&#x27;s the most expensive adolescent fantasy revenge fulfillment wet dream ever to slither onto a screen.&quot; John Pym of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; found that it was &quot;to put it mildly, something of a hodge-podge.&quot; Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 stars out of 4 in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, calling the feature &quot;... uneven, but great fun on a mindless, adolescent level.&quot;

On the whole, in terms of individual segments, critics were typically most favorable towards the &quot;Den&quot; story. Maslin of the &quot;Times&quot; gave the segment a positive review, writing, &quot;The other highly memorable story is about a bookworm from earth who winds up on another planet, where his spindly body is transformed into that of an extraterrestrial Hercules.&quot; She also complimented John Candy&#x27;s vocal performance as Den.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #11 and commented that &quot;Sadly, what could have been a true boost for animation in this country is a weak, opportunistic failure, put together with very little care and no love at all.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; aired frequently on HBO/Cinemax throughout the 1980s and 90s.

Prior to official release on VHS and LaserDisc in 1996, the film was re-released to 54 theatres on March 8, 1996, remixed in Sony&#x27;s 8-track SDDS audio system, taking in US$550,000 (). The subsequent home video release, the first animated film issued on the VHS format to be THX-certified, moved over one million units.

The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on February 1, 2011 as a Best Buy exclusive and it was later released everywhere on June 14, 2011.

A remastered 4K version was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 19, 2022, bundled with a Blu-ray Disc release of the sequel, &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; (2000).

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack was released on LP in 1981, but for legal reasons, was not released on CD until 1995. The album peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Heavy Metal (Takin&#x27; a Ride)&quot; was sung by Don Felder. It was released as a single in the U.S. and reached number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number five on the Mainstream Rock chart on September 19, 1981.

Blue Öyster Cult wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Vengeance (The Pact)&quot; for the film, but the producers declined to use the song because the lyrics provided a capsulized summary of the &quot;Taarna&quot; vignette. &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot; was used instead. Both songs can be found on Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s album &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot;. Although used in the film, the songs &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; by Devo and &quot;E5150&quot; by Black Sabbath were not included in the released soundtrack album. These songs are on &quot;New Traditionalists&quot; and &quot;Mob Rules&quot;, respectively.

The legal difficulties surrounding the use of some songs in the film delayed its release to home media. The production company&#x27;s use of some songs was limited solely to the theatrical release and soundtrack and did not include home media releases. It was not until 1996 that there was an official home media release on VHS when Kevin Eastman, who had bought the publishing rights of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine in 1992 and previously contributed to the magazine, reached a settlement with the music copyright holders.

The original LP contained four tracks per side and was programmed in stackable order (A, D, B, C).

Rhino Records reissued the two-LP collection in 2017, programmed in standard order (A, B, C, D), as part of their &quot;Rocktober&quot; collection.

===Score===
Unusual for the time, an LP recording of Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score was released alongside the soundtrack in 1981, and it featured the composer&#x27;s first use of the ondes Martenot, an instrument which became a trademark of Bernstein&#x27;s later career. On March 13, 2008, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released an official, expanded CD release of Bernstein&#x27;s score, which he conducted. The score was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the London Voices and Jeanne Loriod on the ondes Martenot.

==Sequel==
The sequel, titled &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;, was released in 2000. Upon its release, &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; received negative reviews from critics and has fallen into obscurity.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==
Several years after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; managed to achieve a strong cult following mainly through midnight screenings, TV showings, and home video releases.

The film served as inspiration for many animation and science fiction films and shows following it, such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;Gandahar&quot; (1987), &quot;Akira&quot; (1988), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; (2000), &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016), Mandy (2018), &quot;The Spine of Night&quot; (2021), &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;Rick &amp; Morty&quot;.

The film was parodied in a season 12 episode of the adult animated comedy series &quot;South Park&quot; entitled &quot;Major Boobage&quot; (2008; S12E03), which also featured songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Some news reports have suggested that &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; was an influence for Elon Musk when he launched a Tesla Roadster alongside a fake spaceman in the front seat into orbit in 2018, which seems to reference the film&#x27;s title sequence &quot;Soft Landing&quot;, in which a space traveler lands on Earth in a Chevrolet Corvette convertible two-seater.

Both &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and the British animated film &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1978) served as strong influences on the animation and anthology styles of the music video &quot;At the Door&quot; by The Strokes.

==Remake==
In March 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Paramount Pictures was set to make another animated film with David Fincher &quot;spearheading the project&quot;. Kevin Eastman, who was at the time the owner and publisher of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, was to direct a segment, as would Tim Miller, &quot;whose Blur Studio will handle the animation for what is being conceived as an R-rated, adult-themed feature&quot;.

Entertainment website IGN announced, on July 14, 2008, &quot;David Fincher&#x27;s edgy new project has suffered a serious setback after it was dropped by Paramount, according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; quoted Tim Miller as saying &quot;David really believes in the project. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.&quot;

In September 2008, Eastman was quoted as saying &quot;Fincher is directing one, Guillermo del Toro wants to direct one, Zack Snyder wants to direct one, Gore Verbinski wants to direct one&quot;. It was reported that the film had been moved to Sony division Columbia Pictures (which had released the original) and had a budget of $50 million.

In June 2009, Eastman said &quot;I&#x27;ve got breaking news that Fincher and James Cameron are going to be co-executive producers on the film, Cameron will direct one. Mark Osborne and Jack Black from Tenacious D were going to do a comedy segment for the film.&quot;

Production is stalled indefinitely, as no film distributor or production company has shown interest in distributing or producing the remake since Paramount Pictures decided to forgo being the film&#x27;s distributor, who purportedly thought such a film was &quot;too risqué for mainstream audiences&quot;.

In July 2011, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez announced at San Diego Comic-Con that he had purchased the film rights to &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios. On March 11, 2014, with the formation of his own television network, El Rey, Rodriguez considered switching gears and bringing it to TV.

On March 15, 2019, the reboot was released on Netflix as a reimagining titled &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot;.

<text>Michael Derek Elworthy Jarman (31 January 1942 – 19 February 1994) was an English artist, film maker, costume designer, stage designer, writer, poet, gardener, and gay rights activist.

==Biography==
Jarman was born at the Royal Victoria Nursing Home in Northwood, Middlesex, England, the son of Elizabeth Evelyn (&quot;née&quot; Puttock) and Lancelot Elworthy Jarman. His father was a Royal Air Force officer, born in New Zealand.

After a prep school education at Hordle House School, Jarman went on to board at Canford School in Dorset and from 1960 studied English and art at King&#x27;s College London. This was followed by four years at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London (UCL), starting in 1963. From 1966-1969 he rented a two-room flat on the top floor of 60 Liverpool Road, London, sharing rooms during the last year with fellow artist Keith Milow. In August 1969 he moved to Upper Ground, opposite Blackfriars Bridge, the first of a series of warehouses on the river front. In his own words: &quot;an exhilarating change after seven years in cramped Georgian terrace houses and basements [..] the warehouse allowed me to slip quietly away from the &#x27;scene&#x27; which for five years had been the centre of my life – and had now exhausted itself – and establish my own idiosyncratic mode of living&quot;. In the 1970s he had a studio at Butler&#x27;s Wharf. Jarman was outspoken about homosexuality, his public fight for gay rights, and his personal struggle with AIDS.

On 22 December 1986, Jarman was diagnosed as HIV positive and discussed his condition in public. His illness prompted him to move to Prospect Cottage, Dungeness, in Kent, near the nuclear power station. In 1994, he died of an AIDS-related illness in London, aged 52. He was an atheist. He is buried in the graveyard at St Clement&#x27;s Church, Old Romney, Kent.

In his last years, Jarman was emotionally and practically supported by the companionship of Keith Collins (1963–2018), a young man he had met in 1987. While not lovers (Collins had his own partner), the friendship became essential for both of them. Jarman left Prospect Cottage to him.

A blue plaque commemorating Jarman was unveiled at Butler&#x27;s Wharf in London on 19 February 2019, the 25th anniversary of his death.

==Films==
Jarman&#x27;s first films were experimental Super 8mm shorts, a form he never entirely abandoned, and later developed further in his films &quot;Imagining October&quot; (1984), &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; (1985), &quot;The Last of England&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Garden&quot; (1990) as a parallel to his narrative work. &quot;The Garden&quot; was entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; featured Toby Mott and other members of the Grey Organisation, a radical artist collective.

Jarman first became known as a stage designer. His break in the film industry came as production designer for Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971). He made his mainstream narrative filmmaking debut with &quot;Sebastiane&quot; (1976), about the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. This was one of the first British films to feature positive images of gay sexuality; its dialogue was entirely in Latin.

He followed this with &quot;Jubilee&quot; (shot 1977, released 1978), in which Queen Elizabeth I of England is seen to be transported forward in time to a desolate and brutal wasteland ruled by her twentieth-century namesake. &quot;Jubilee&quot; has been described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s only decent punk film&quot;, and featured punk groups and figures such as Jayne County of Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs, Jordan, Toyah Willcox, Adam and the Ants and The Slits.

This was followed in 1979 by an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

During the 1980s, Jarman was a leading campaigner against Clause 28, which sought to ban the &quot;promotion&quot; of homosexuality in schools. He also worked to raise awareness of AIDS. His artistic practice in the early 1980s reflected these commitments, especially in &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; (1985), a film in which the imagery is accompanied by Judi Dench&#x27;s voice reciting Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.

Jarman spent seven years making experimental Super 8mm films and attempting to raise money for &quot;Caravaggio&quot; (he later claimed to have rewritten the script seventeen times during this period). Released in 1986, &quot;Caravaggio&quot; attracted a comparatively wide audience; it is still, barring the cult hit &quot;Jubilee&quot;, probably Jarman&#x27;s most widely known work. This is partly due to the involvement, for the first time with a Jarman film, of the British television company Channel 4 in funding and distribution. Funded by the British Film Institute and produced by film theorist Colin MacCabe, &quot;Caravaggio&quot; became Jarman&#x27;s most famous film to date, and marked the beginning of a new phase in his filmmaking career: from then onwards, all his films would be partly funded by television companies, often receiving their most prominent exhibition in TV screenings. &quot;Caravaggio&quot; also saw Jarman work with actress Tilda Swinton for the first time. Overt depictions of homosexual love, narrative ambiguity, and the live representations of Caravaggio&#x27;s most famous paintings are all prominent features in the film.

The conclusion of &quot;Caravaggio&quot; also marked the beginning of a temporary abandonment of traditional narrative in Jarman&#x27;s films. Frustrated by the formality of 35mm film production, and by the dependence on institutions and the resultant prolonged inactivity associated with it (which had already cost him seven years with &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, as well as derailing several long-term projects), Jarman returned to and expanded the super 8mm-based form he had previously worked in on &quot;Imagining October&quot; and &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot;. &quot;Caravaggio&quot; was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement.

The first film to result from this new semi-narrative phase, &quot;The Last of England&quot; told the death of a country, ravaged by its own internal decay and the economic restructuring of Thatcher&#x27;s government. &quot;Wrenchingly beautiful … the film is one of the few commanding works of personal cinema in the late 80&#x27;s – a call to open our eyes to a world violated by greed and repression, to see what irrevocable damage has been wrought on city, countryside and soul, how our skies, our bodies, have turned poisonous&quot;, wrote a &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic.

In 1989, Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;War Requiem&quot; produced by Don Boyd brought Laurence Olivier out of retirement for what would be Olivier&#x27;s last screen performance. The film uses Benjamin Britten&#x27;s eponymous anti-war requiem as its soundtrack and juxtaposes violent footage of war with the mass for the dead and the passionate humanist poetry of Wilfred Owen.

During the making of his film &quot;The Garden&quot;, Jarman became seriously ill. Although he recovered sufficiently to complete the work, he never attempted anything on a comparable scale afterwards, returning to a more pared-down form for his concluding narrative films, &quot;Edward II&quot; (perhaps his most politically outspoken work, informed by his gay activism) and the Brechtian &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;, a delicate tragicomedy based on the life of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Jarman made a side income by directing music videos for various artists, including Marianne Faithfull, The Smiths and the Pet Shop Boys.

By the time of his 1993 film &quot;Blue&quot;, Jarman was losing his sight and dying of AIDS-related complications. &quot;Blue&quot; consists of a single shot of saturated blue colour filling the screen, as background to a soundtrack composed by Simon Fisher Turner, and featuring original music by Coil and other artists, in which Jarman describes his life and vision. When it was shown on British television, Channel 4 carried the image whilst the soundtrack was broadcast simultaneously on BBC Radio 3. &quot;Blue&quot; was unveiled at the 1993 Venice Biennale with Jarman in attendance and subsequently entered the collections of the Walker Art Institute; Centre Georges Pompidou, MoMA and Tate. His final work as a film-maker was the film &quot;Glitterbug&quot;, made for the &quot;Arena&quot; slot on BBC Two, and broadcast shortly after Jarman&#x27;s death.

==Other works==

Jarman&#x27;s work broke new ground in creating and expanding the fledgling form of &#x27;the pop video&#x27; in England (eg. using his father&#x27;s WWII archival footage (one of the first people to use a color home movie camera which included the director as a toddler) on the early version of Wang Chung&#x27;s &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot;), and in gay rights activism.

Jarman also directed the 1989 tour by the UK duo Pet Shop Boys. By pop concert standards this was a highly theatrical event with costume and specially shot films accompanying the individual songs. Jarman was the stage director of Sylvano Bussotti&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;Ispirazione&quot;, first staged in Florence in 1988.

Jarman is also remembered for his famous shingle cottage-garden at Prospect Cottage, created in the latter years of his life, in the shadow of Dungeness nuclear power station. The cottage is built in vernacular style in timber, with tar-based weatherproofing, like others nearby. Raised wooden text on the side of the cottage is the first stanza and the last five lines of the last stanza of John Donne&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Sun Rising&quot;. The cottage garden was made by arranging flotsam washed up nearby, interspersed with endemic salt-loving beach plants, both set against the bright shingle. The garden has been the subject of several books. At this time, Jarman also began painting again.

In 2020 the Garden Museum in London held an exhibition called &quot;Derek Jarman: my Garden&#x27;s Boundaries are the Horizon&quot; parts of the garden and Prospect Cottage were recreated for the exhibition as well as artifacts from Jarman&#x27;s estate.

Jarman was the author of several books including his autobiography &quot;Dancing Ledge&quot; (1984), which details his life until the age 40. He provides his own insight on the history of gay life in London (1960s-1980s), discusses his own acceptance of his homosexuality at age 16 and accounts of the financial and emotional hardships of a life devoted to filmmaking. A collection of poetry &quot;A Finger in the Fishes Mouth&quot;, two volumes of diaries &quot;Modern Nature&quot; and &quot;Smiling In Slow Motion&quot; and two treatises on his work in film and art &quot;The Last of England&quot; (also published as &quot;Kicking the Pricks&quot;) and &quot;Chroma&quot;.

Other notable published works include film scripts (&quot;Up in the Air&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;War Requiem&quot;, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, &quot;Queer Edward II&quot; and &quot;Wittgenstein: The Terry Eagleton Script/The Derek Jarman Film&quot;), a study of his garden at Dungeness &quot;Derek Jarman&#x27;s Garden&quot;, and &quot;At Your Own Risk&quot;, a defiant celebration of gay sexuality.

== Musical tributes ==
After his death, the band Chumbawamba released &quot;Song for Derek Jarman&quot; in his honour. Andi Sexgang released the CD &quot;Last of England&quot; as a Jarman tribute. The ambient experimental album &quot;The Garden Is Full of Metal&quot; by Robin Rimbaud included Jarman speech samples.

Manic Street Preachers&#x27; bassist Nicky Wire recorded a track titled &quot;Derek Jarman&#x27;s Garden&quot; as a b-side to his single &quot;Break My Heart Slowly&quot; (2006). On his album &quot;In the Mist&quot;, released in 2011, ambient composer Harold Budd features a song titled &quot;The Art of Mirrors (after Derek Jarman)&quot;.

Coil, which in 1985 contributed a soundtrack for Jarman&#x27;s &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; released the 7&quot; single &quot;Themes for Derek Jarman&#x27;s Blue&quot; in 1993. In 2004, Coil&#x27;s Peter Christopherson performed his score for the Jarman short &quot;The Art of Mirrors&quot; as a tribute to Jarman live at L&#x27;étrange Festival in Paris. In 2015, record label Black Mass Rising released a recording of the performance. In 2018, composer Gregory Spears created a work for chorus and string quartet, titled &quot;The Tower and the Garden&quot;, commissioned by conductors Donald Nally, Mark Shapiro, Robert Geary and Carmen-Helena Téllez, setting a poem by Keith Garebian from his collection &quot;Blue: The Derek Jarman Poems&quot; (2008).

The French musician and composer Romain Frequency released his first album &quot;Research on a nameless colour&quot; in 2020 as a tribute to Jarman&#x27;s final collection of Essays “Chroma” released in 1994, the year he died and written while struggling with illness (facing the irony of an artist going blind).
The songs are devoted to an unexisting colour and their attendant emotion as a transposition of a certain contemplative state into sound.
The album received a positive response from the press.

At the time of his death, Jarman was slated to direct the Annie Lennox music video for &quot;Every Time We Say Goodbye&quot; from her &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; project (1990). As a tribute, the video features family film footage of Jarman&#x27;s childhood.

<text>Leinster House () is the seat of the Oireachtas, the parliament of Ireland. Originally, it was the ducal palace of the Dukes of Leinster. 

Since 1922, it has been a complex of buildings which houses Oireachtas Éireann, its members and staff. The most recognisable part of the complex and the &quot;public face&quot; of Leinster House continues to be the former ducal palace at the core of the complex.

==History==
===Ducal palace===

Leinster House was the former ducal residence in Dublin of the Duke of Leinster, and since 1922 has served as the parliament building of the Irish Free State, the predecessor of the modern Irish state, before which it functioned as the headquarters of the Royal Dublin Society. The society&#x27;s famous Dublin Spring Show and Dublin Horse Show were held on its Leinster Lawn, facing Merrion Square. The building is the meeting place of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, the two houses of the Oireachtas, and as such the term &#x27;Leinster House&#x27; has become a metonym for Irish political activities.

===Irish Parliament===
Ireland&#x27;s parliament over the centuries had met in a number of locations, most notably in the Irish Houses of Parliament at College Green, next to Trinity College Dublin. Its medieval parliament consisted of two Houses, a House of Commons and a House of Lords. Ireland&#x27;s senior peer, the Earl of Kildare, had a seat in the Lords. Like all the aristocrats of the period, for the duration of the Social Season and parliamentary sessions, he and his family resided in state in a Dublin residence.
From the late eighteenth century, Leinster House (then called &quot;Kildare House&quot;) was the Earl&#x27;s official Dublin residence. When it was first built in 1745–48 by James FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare, it was located on the unfashionable and isolated south side of the city, far from the main locations of aristocratic residences, namely Rutland Square (now Parnell Square) and Mountjoy Square. The Earl predicted that others would follow; in succeeding decades Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square became the primary location of residences of the aristocracy, with many of their northside residences being sold (many subsequently deteriorating and ending up as slums). The building itself was designed by architect Richard Cassels while some of the later elements and interior were designed by Isaac Ware.

In the history of aristocratic residences in Dublin, no other mansion matched Kildare House for its sheer size or status. When the Earl was made the first Duke of Leinster in 1766, the family&#x27;s Dublin residence was renamed Leinster House. Its first and second floors were used as the floor model for the White House by Irish architect James Hoban, while the house itself was used as a model for the original stone-cut White House exterior.

One famous member of the family who occasionally resided in Leinster House was Lord Edward FitzGerald, who became involved with Irish nationalism during the 1798 Rebellion, which cost him his life. With the passage of the Act of Union in 1800, Ireland ceased to have its own parliament. Without a House of Lords to attend, increasing numbers of aristocrats stopped coming to Dublin, selling off their Dublin residences, in many cases to buy residences in London, where the new united parliament met.

===RDS headquarters 1815–1922===
The 3rd Duke of Leinster sold Leinster House in 1815 to the Royal Dublin Society. In 1853 the Great Industrial Exhibition was hosted in its grounds. The Natural History Museum was built on the site in 1857. Around the same time, two new wings were added, to house the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland.

===Oireachtas from 1922===
The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 provided for the creation of a self-governing Irish dominion, to be called the Irish Free State. As plans were made to bring the new state into being, the Provisional Government under W. T. Cosgrave sought a temporary venue for the meetings of the new Chamber of Deputies Dáil Éireann and Senate Seanad Éireann. Plans were made to turn Royal Hospital Kilmainham, an eighteenth-century former soldiers&#x27; home in extensive parklands, into a full-time Parliament House. However, as it was still under the control of the British Army, who had yet to withdraw from it, and the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State was due to deliver the Speech from the Throne opening parliament within weeks, Michael Collins decided to hire the Leinster House complex for use from September 1922 as a temporary Dáil chamber as it housed a large lecture theatre that could easily be adapted to the needs of the Oireachtas.

In 1924, due to financial constraints, plans to turn the Royal Hospital into a parliament house were abandoned; Leinster House, instead becoming the chapel of democracy, was bought, pending the provision of a proper parliament house at some stage in the future. A new Senate or Seanad chamber was created in the Duke&#x27;s old ballroom, while wings from the neighbouring Royal College of Science were taken over and used as Government Buildings. The entire Royal College of Science, which by then had been merged with University College Dublin, was subsequently taken over in 1990 and turned into state-of-the-art Government Buildings.

Since then, a number of extensions have been added, most recently in 2000, to provide adequate office space for 166 TDs, 60 senators, members of the press and other staff. Among the world leaders who have visited Leinster House to address joint sessions of the Oireachtas are U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton; British Prime Minister Tony Blair; Australian prime ministers Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, and John Howard; and French President François Mitterrand.


A number of monuments stand or have stood, around Leinster House. Its Kildare Street frontage used to be dominated by &quot;Queen Victoria&quot;, a large seated bronze statue by John Hughes, first unveiled by King Edward VII in 1908. Considering it inappropriate to have the British Queen overlooking the Irish parliament it was relocated to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham in 1948, as part of moves by the Irish state towards declaring a Republic. It was re-erected in 1987 in front of the Queen Victoria Building in Sydney, Australia. Facing the garden front on its Merrion Square side, stands a large triangular monument commemorating three founding figures of Irish independence, President of Dáil Éireann Arthur Griffith, who died in 1922, Michael Collins, who was shot and killed in an ambush by anti-treaty forces in 1922, and Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the Chairman of the Provisional Government and the Vice-President of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister), who was assassinated in 1927. Another statue commemorates the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, who held his major Irish Exhibition on Leinster Lawn in the 1850s.

==Extensions==

The main building has undergone regular extensions from Victorian times, through to a major extension to create offices for TDs in the 1960s, to most recently the building of Leinster House 2000, a new block of offices built to the north of the original ducal palace. The main extensions are:
*the Victorian additions to the complex which contain the Dáil Chamber
*a 1930s addition which houses Labour Party TDs and Senators
*the so-called &quot;Block 66&quot; a five-storey office block which was built circa 1966 and which houses Fine Gael TDs and senators, with two restaurants and two bars at ground-floor level and which houses the office suite of the leader of the largest party in the Oireachtas (currently Fianna Fáil) and the party&#x27;s meeting rooms. One of the bars is for visitors while the other is reserved for parliamentarians, the teachtaí dála and senators.
*&quot;Leinster House 2000&quot;, a new wing erected in 2000, which houses members of all parties, committee rooms and contains the office suites of the leaders of Labour and Fianna Fáil
*some modern offices across Kildare Street in &quot;Kildare House&quot;
*the top floors of &quot;Agriculture House&quot;, the Department of Agriculture building which on those floors house offices for independent TDs and independent senators
*offices on Molesworth Street which are used also by some members of the Oireachtas, most notably the office provided for former taoisigh.

==Structural concerns and restoration==

A commissioned report delivered to the Ceann Comhairle&#x27;s office in 2008 cast serious doubts on the safety of Leinster House without major remedial work. Warning that the building presented a risk to the safety and health of occupants and the public, the report outlined nine serious risks to the building, due to a combination of factors, including:
*the age of the building
*renovations over the centuries to the ducal palace made by its various owners which were substandard
*significant overloading of floors on upper levels
*inadequate and outdated wiring

If repairs were not carried out it outlined as a worst-case scenario &quot;The facility is damaged/contaminated beyond habitable use. Most items/assets are lost, destroyed or damaged beyond repair/restoration.&quot;

The building underwent massive restoration and conservation work from December 2017 until August 2019, during which time the entire original Kildare House section was shielded from the elements under a temporary scaffold and plastic roof. Granite from Golden Hill quarry in County Wicklow was originally used in the construction of the Merrion Street side of the building in the 1740s, but was exhausted as a quarry by 1850. To ensure consistency in the type of granite used in the repairs, the Office of Public Works opted for stone from Ballyknockan quarry, being the nearest geographical substitute.

<doc id="155311" wikidata="Q161531" url="?curid=155311" title="War and Peace">
<text>War and Peace (; pre-reform Russian: ; ) is a literary work by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the work comprises both a fictional narrative and chapters in which Tolstoy discusses history and philosophy. An early version was published serially beginning in 1865, after which the entire book was rewritten and published in 1869. It is regarded, with &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, as Tolstoy&#x27;s finest literary achievement, and it remains an internationally praised classic of world literature.

The book chronicles the French invasion of Russia and its aftermath during the Napoleonic era. It uses five interlocking narratives following different Russian aristocratic families to illustrate Napoleon&#x27;s impact on Tsarist society. Portions of an earlier version, titled &quot;The Year 1805&quot;, were serialized in &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869.

Tolstoy said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to classify &quot;War and Peace&quot;, saying it is &quot;not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle.&quot; Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative. He regarded &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; as his first true novel.

==Composition history==
Tolstoy began writing &quot;War and Peace&quot; in 1863, the year that he married and settled down at his country estate. In September of that year, he wrote to Elizabeth Bers, his sister-in-law, asking if she could find any chronicles, diaries, or records from the Napoleonic period in Russia. He was dismayed to find that there were few written records of Russian domestic life from that time and tried to rectify these omissions in early drafts of the novel. The first half of the book was named &quot;1805&quot;. During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. Tolstoy wrote in a letter to Afanasy Fet that what he had written in &quot;War and Peace&quot; is also said by Schopenhauer in &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;. However, Tolstoy approaches &quot;it from the other side.&quot;

The first draft of the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical (&quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;) published the first part of this draft under the title &quot;1805&quot; and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869. Tolstoy&#x27;s wife, Sophia Tolstaya, copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it ready for publication. The version that was published in had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title &quot;War and Peace&quot; in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was quickly translated after publication into many other languages.

It is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name of the work to &quot;War and Peace&quot; (&quot; in reformed orthography, and &#x27;Война и миръ&#x27; in pre-reform orthography, pronounced ). He may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: (&quot;War and Peace&quot; in French). The title may also be a reference to the Roman Emperor Titus, who reigned from 79 to 81 AD and was described as being a master of &quot;war and peace&quot; in &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, written by Suetonius in 119.

The &quot;1805&quot; manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia in 1983 and has been since translated into English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Albanian, Korean, and Czech.

Tolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His narrative structure is noted not only for its god&#x27;s-eye point of view over and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed an individual character&#x27;s viewpoint. His use of visual detail is often comparable to cinema, using literary techniques that resemble panning, wide shots, and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.

The standard Russian text of &quot;War and Peace&quot; is divided into four volumes, comprising fifteen books, and an epilogue split into two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as the second part of the epilogue, increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war, power, history, and historiography. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during Tolstoy&#x27;s life, simply moved these essays into an appendix.

==Realism==
The plot of the novel is set 60 years before Tolstoy wrote it, but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 French invasion of Russia. He read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars as well as letters, journals, autobiographies, and biographies of Napoleon and other key players of that era. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

He worked from primary source materials, such as interviews and other documents, as well as from history books, philosophy texts, and other historical novels. Tolstoy used a great deal of his own experience in the Crimean War to bring vivid detail and first-hand accounts of how the Imperial Russian Army was structured.

Tolstoy was critical of standard history, especially military history, in &quot;War and Peace&quot;. He explains at the start of the novel&#x27;s third volume his own views on how history ought to be written.

==Language==

Although the book is mainly in Russian, significant portions of dialogue are in French. It has been suggested that the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy, and more generally the aristocracies of continental Europe at the time. In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants: Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar with her country&#x27;s native language that she has to take Russian lessons.

The use of French diminishes as the book progresses. It is suggested that this is to demonstrate Russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination, and to show that a once-friendly nation has turned into an enemy. By midway through the book, several of the Russian aristocracy are eager to find Russian tutors for themselves.

==Background and historical context==
The novel spans the period from 1805 to 1820. The era of Catherine the Great was still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine had made French the language of her royal court. For the next 100 years, it became a social requirement for the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.

The historical context of the novel begins with the execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien in 1805, while Russia is ruled by Alexander I during the Napoleonic Wars. Key historical events woven into the novel include the Ulm Campaign, the Battle of Austerlitz, the Treaties of Tilsit, and the Congress of Erfurt. Tolstoy also references the Great Comet of 1811 just before the French invasion of Russia.

Tolstoy then uses the Battle of Ostrovno and the Battle of Shevardino Redoubt in his novel, before the occupation of Moscow and the subsequent fire. The novel continues with the Battle of Tarutino, the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, the Battle of Vyazma, and the Battle of Krasnoi. The final battle cited is the Battle of Berezina, after which the characters move on with rebuilding Moscow and their lives.

==Principal characters==

The novel tells the story of five families—the Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys.

The main characters are:

*The Bezukhovs
** Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov: the father of Pierre
** Count Pyotr Kirillovich (&quot;Pierre&quot;) Bezukhov: The central character and often a voice for Tolstoy&#x27;s own beliefs or struggles. Pierre is the socially awkward illegitimate son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov, who has fathered dozens of illegitimate sons. Educated abroad, Pierre returns to Russia as a misfit. His unexpected inheritance of a large fortune makes him socially desirable.
*The Bolkonskys 
**Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky: The father of Andrei and Maria, the eccentric prince possesses a gruff exterior and displays great insensitivity to the emotional needs of his children. Nevertheless, his harshness often belies hidden depth of feeling.
** Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky: A strong but skeptical, thoughtful and philosophical in the Napoleonic Wars.
** Princess Elisabeta &quot;Lisa&quot; Karlovna Bolkonskaya (also Lise) – née Meinena. Wife of Andrei. Also called &quot;little princess&quot;.
** Princess Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya: Sister of Prince Andrei, Princess Maria is a pious woman whose father attempted to give her a good education. The caring, nurturing nature of her large eyes in her otherwise plain face is frequently mentioned. Tolstoy often notes that Princess Maria cannot claim a radiant beauty (like many other female characters of the novel) but she is a person of very high moral values and of high intelligence.
*The Rostovs
** Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov: The pater-familias of the Rostov family; hopeless with finances, generous to a fault. As a result, the Rostovs never have enough cash, despite having many estates.
** Countess Natalya Rostova: The wife of Count Ilya Rostov, she is frustrated by her husband&#x27;s mishandling of their finances, but is determined that her children succeed anyway
** Countess Natalya Ilyinichna &quot;Natasha&quot; Rostova: A central character, introduced as &quot;not pretty but full of life&quot;, romantic, impulsive and highly strung. She is an accomplished singer and dancer.
** Count Nikolai Ilyich &quot;Nikolenka&quot; Rostov: A hussar, the beloved elder son of the Rostov family.
** Sofia Alexandrovna &quot;Sonya&quot; Rostova: Orphaned cousin of Vera, Nikolai, Natasha, and Petya Rostov and is in love with Nikolai.
** Countess Vera Ilyinichna Rostova: Eldest of the Rostov children, she marries the German career soldier, Berg.
** Pyotr Ilyich &quot;Petya&quot; Rostov: Youngest of the Rostov children.
*The Kuragins

** Princess Elena Vasilyevna &quot;Hélène&quot; Kuragina: A beautiful and sexually alluring woman who has many affairs, including (it is rumoured) with her brother Anatole.
** Prince Anatole Vasilyevich Kuragin: Hélène&#x27;s brother, a handsome and amoral pleasure seeker who is secretly married yet tries to elope with Natasha Rostova.
** Prince Ippolit Vasilyevich (Hippolyte) Kuragin: The younger brother of Anatole and perhaps most dim-witted of the three Kuragin children.
*The Drubetskoys
** Prince Boris Drubetskoy: A poor but aristocratic young man driven by ambition, even at the expense of his friends and benefactors, who marries Julie Karagina for money and is rumored to have had an affair with Hélène Bezukhova.
** Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskaya: The impoverished mother of Boris, whom she wishes to push up the career ladder.
*Other prominent characters
** Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov: A cold, almost psychopathic officer, he ruins Nikolai Rostov by luring him into an outrageous gambling debt after unsuccessfully proposing to Sonya Rostova. He is also rumored to have had an affair with Hélène Bezukhova and he provides for his poor mother and hunchbacked sister.
** Adolf Karlovich Berg: A young German officer, who desires to be just like everyone else and marries the young Vera Rostova.
** Anna Pavlovna Scherer: Also known as Annette, she is the hostess of the salon that is the site of much of the novel&#x27;s action in Petersburg and schemes with Prince Vasily Kuragin.
** Maria Dmitryevna Akhrosimova: An older Moscow society lady, good-humored but brutally honest.
** Amalia Evgenyevna Bourienne: A Frenchwoman who lives with the Bolkonskys, primarily as Princess Maria&#x27;s companion and later at Maria&#x27;s expense.
** Vasily Dmitrich Denisov: Nikolai Rostov&#x27;s friend and brother officer, who unsuccessfully proposes to Natasha.
** Platon Karataev: The archetypal good Russian peasant, whom Pierre meets in the prisoner-of-war camp.
** Osip Bazdeyev: a Freemason who convinces Pierre to join his mysterious group.
** Bilibin: A diplomat with a reputation for cleverness, an acquaintance of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

In addition, several real-life historical characters (such as Napoleon and Prince Mikhail Kutuzov) play a prominent part in the book. Many of Tolstoy&#x27;s characters were based on real people. His grandparents and their friends were the models for many of the main characters; his great-grandparents would have been of the generation of Prince Vassily or Count Ilya Rostov.

==Plot summary==

===Book One===
The novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soirée given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer, the maid of honour and confidante to the dowager empress Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count. He is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance, since the count is dying after a series of strokes. Educated abroad at his father&#x27;s expense following his mother&#x27;s death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father&#x27;s favorite of all the old count&#x27;s illegitimate progeny. They respect Pierre during the soirée because his father, Count Bezukhov, is a very rich man, and as Pierre is his favorite, most aristocrats think that the fortune of his father will be given to him even though he is illegitimate.

Also attending the soirée is Pierre&#x27;s friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life, feeling that his wife is empty and superficial. Pierre does not quite know what to do with this and is made uncomfortable witnessing the marital discord. Pierre was sent to Petersburg by his father to choose a career but is uncomfortable because he cannot find one and people frequently ask about it. Andrei tells Pierre he has decided to become to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war (the Battle of Austerlitz) against Napoleon in order to escape a life he cannot stand.

The plot moves to Moscow, Russia&#x27;s former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Saint Petersburg. The Rostov family is introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but worried about their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer. Boris&#x27;s mother is Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, a childhood friend of the countess Natalya Rostova. Boris is also the godson of Pierre&#x27;s father, Count Bezukhov. Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage to a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age.

At Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys&#x27; country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father and suspicion that the young man would be unfaithful to her.

The second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. At the Schöngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now an ensign in the hussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by Tsar Alexander&#x27;s charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov, and Denisov are involved in the disastrous Battle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard.

The Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching &quot;day [will] be his Toulon, or his Arcola&quot;, references to Napoleon&#x27;s early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, &quot;so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended&quot;. Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.

===Book Two===
Book Two begins with Nikolai Rostov returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his Pavlograd Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Denisov falls in love with her and proposes marriage but is rejected. Nikolai meets Dolokhov, and they grow closer as friends. Dolokhov falls in love with Sonya, Nikolai&#x27;s cousin, but as she is in love with Nikolai, she rejects Dolokhov&#x27;s proposal. Nikolai meets Dolokhov sometime later. The resentful Dolokhov challenges Nikolai at cards, and Nikolai loses every hand until he sinks into a 43,000-ruble debt. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, he refuses. Instead, he promises to marry his childhood crush and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya.

Pierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in Russian society. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin&#x27;s beautiful and immoral daughter Hélène (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hélène, who is rumored to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatole, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hélène is also rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hélène denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.

Pierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.

Burdened with nihilistic disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is interested in panentheism and the possibility of an afterlife.

Pierre&#x27;s wife, Hélène, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hélène establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society.

Prince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Saint Petersburg, naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Saint Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei&#x27;s father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, insisting that the couple wait a year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau.

Natasha visits the Moscow opera, where she meets Hélène and her brother Anatole. Anatole has since married a Polish woman whom he abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei&#x27;s sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole&#x27;s marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill.

Pierre is initially horrified by Natasha&#x27;s behavior but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As the Great Comet of 1811–12 streaks across the sky, life appears to begin anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha&#x27;s breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal.

===Book Three===
With the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon&#x27;s army and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; and that Pierre himself has an eschatological role. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.

Back in Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of Tzar Alexander and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the Cathedral of the Assumption by the Tzar. He is nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist.

Napoleon himself is the main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over four hundred thousand troops of the French (only one hundred and forty thousand of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of Smolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the Battle of Borodino from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil, he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eugène&#x27;s artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon&#x27;s reputedly invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in such disarray that no one can be notified.

The Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it became clear that Kutuzov had retreated past Moscow. The Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either flee or fight. Count Fyodor Rostopchin, the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religious icons, while at the same time urging them to fight with pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn the city. However, Tolstoy states that the burning of an abandoned city mostly built of wood was inevitable, and while the French blame the Russians, these blame the French. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is among the wounded.

When Napoleon&#x27;s army finally occupies an abandoned and burning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a naïve mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.

Pierre saves the life of a French officer who, seeking shelter, enters the home of a dead friend of Pierre&#x27;s, in which Pierre has been living since departing his own home. The two have a long, amicable conversation. The next day Pierre goes into the street to resume his assassination plan. He rescues a young girl from a burning house and then comes across two French soldiers robbing an Armenian family. When one of the soldiers tries to rip the necklace off the young Armenian woman&#x27;s neck, Pierre intervenes by attacking the soldiers, and is taken prisoner by the French army.

===Book Four===

After his capture, Pierre believes he will be executed. In the end he is spared, but witnesses the execution of other prisoners with horror. Pierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. After months of tribulation—during which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French—Pierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.

Meanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to Yaroslavl. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. In an internal transformation, he loses the fear of death and forgives Natasha in a last act before dying.

As the novel draws to a close, Pierre&#x27;s wife Hélène dies from an overdose of an abortifacient (Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei&#x27;s death and Pierre of Karataev&#x27;s. Both are aware of a growing bond between them in their bereavement.

===Epilogue in two parts===

====First part====

The first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813. Nikolai becomes worried about his family&#x27;s finances and leaves the army after hearing of Petya&#x27;s death. There is little hope for recovery. Given the Rostovs&#x27; ruin, he does not feel comfortable with the prospect of marrying the wealthy Marya Bolkonskaya, but when they meet again, they both still feel love for each other. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. Although he finds marrying women for money repugnant, he gives in to his love for Princess Maria and marries her.

Nikolai and Maria then move to her inherited estate of Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. Nikolai and Maria have children together, and also raise Prince Andrei&#x27;s orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky.

As in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couples – Pierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Maria – remain devoted. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the Decembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father &quot;would be satisfied&quot; (presumably as a revolutionary in the Decembrist revolt).

====Second part====
The second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy&#x27;s critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of &quot;heroes&quot; and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (a summation which he earlier, in Part III chapter 1, compared to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis, and free will being based on consciousness and therefore inherently unpredictable. Tolstoy also ridicules newly emerging Darwinism as overly simplistic, comparing it to plasterers covering over the windows, icons, and scaffolding with plaster, impressed with the smooth result. He wrestles with the tension between our consciousness of freedom and the apparent need for necessity to develop laws of science and history, saying at times that the first is as real as the second, and yet that its reality would destroy the second. He concludes that just as astronomy had to adopt the Copernican hypothesis of the earth&#x27;s movement, not because it fits our immediate perceptions, but to avoid absurdities, so too must historical science accept some conception of necessary laws of human action, even though we feel free in our ordinary lives. In an appendix, he tries to further resolve the tension with the suggestion that we are most free, or feel most free, in arbitrary acts affecting us alone, but less free in acts affecting other people, where moral or other principles force or forbid certain responses.

===Philosophical chapters===
&quot;War and Peace&quot; is Tolstoy&#x27;s longest work, consisting of 361 chapters. Of those, 24 are philosophical chapters with the author&#x27;s comments and views, rather than narrative. These chapters discuss historical events but do not touch on the fictional plot of the novel.

==Reception==
The novel that made its author &quot;the true lion of the Russian literature&quot; (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press&#x27;s initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper &quot;Golos&quot; (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: &quot;What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?... Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?&quot;

Writer and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in (#6, 1867), suggested that &quot;War and Peace&quot; was &quot;neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel&quot;, but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. &quot;The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century,&quot; was his suggestion. &quot;It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation&#x27;s life,&quot; wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define &quot;War and Peace&quot; in the foreword for his French translation of &quot;The Two Hussars&quot; (published in Paris by in 1875).

In general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the &quot;author&#x27;s inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel&quot;, as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it. Articles by D. Minayev, Vasily Bervi-Flerovsky and N. Shelgunov in magazine characterized the novel as &quot;lacking realism&quot;, showing its characters as &quot;cruel and rough&quot;, &quot;mentally stoned&quot;, &quot;morally depraved&quot; and promoting &quot;the philosophy of stagnation&quot;. Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with &quot;how strongly this Count has stung our higher society&quot;. Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article &quot;Russian Gentry of Old&quot; (, , #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy&#x27;s realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, &#x27;idealized&#x27; the old nobility, expressing &quot;unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards&quot; the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and &quot;patriotic&quot; authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the &quot;patriotic feelings of our fathers&quot; and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.

One of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;. The critic praised Tolstoy&#x27;s masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. &quot;The dazzling side of the novel,&quot; according to Annenkov, was &quot;the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.&quot; Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two &quot;great raznotchintsys&quot;, Speransky and Arakcheyev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel &quot;this relatively rough but original element.&quot; In the end the critic called the novel &quot;the whole epoch in the Russian fiction.&quot;

Slavophiles declared Tolstoy their &quot;&quot; and pronounced &quot;War and Peace&quot; &quot;the Bible of the new national idea&quot;. Several articles on &quot;War and Peace&quot; were published in 1869–70 in &quot;Zarya&quot; magazine by Nikolay Strakhov. &quot;&quot;War and Peace&quot; is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before&quot;, he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. &quot;It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the &quot;War and Peace&quot; was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning&quot;, the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy&#x27;s novel to be a masterpiece of a level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of &quot;meek Russian character&#x27;s supremacy over the rapacious European kind&quot; (using Apollon Grigoryev&#x27;s formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov&#x27;s own book &quot;The World as a Whole&quot;, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoryev&#x27;s concept (of &quot;Russian meekness &quot;vs.&quot; Western bestiality&quot;) and Strakhov&#x27;s interpretation of it.

Among the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy&#x27;s battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the &quot;Russky Invalid&quot; newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Schöngrabern scenes &quot;bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness&quot; and totally agreed with the author&#x27;s view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in (&quot;The Military Almanac&quot;, 1868–70), while disputing some of Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas concerning the &quot;spontaneity&quot; of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use &quot;War and Peace&quot; as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as &quot;incomparable&quot; and &quot;serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.&quot;

Unlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring &quot;War and Peace&quot; the masterpiece of Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878, letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish &quot;War and Peace&quot;, adding: &quot;This is positively what might be called a Russian &quot;Iliad&quot;. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever&quot;. In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; to start with, Goncharov insisted: &quot;&quot;War and Peace&quot; is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history&#x27;s glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel&#x27;s] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.&quot; In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy&#x27;s works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of &quot;War and Peace&quot;. &quot;Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]&quot;, he remarked.

Fyodor Dostoevsky (in a May 30, 1871, letter to Strakhov) described &quot;War and Peace&quot; as &quot;the last word of the landlord&#x27;s literature and the brilliant one at that.&quot; In a draft version of &quot;The Raw Youth&quot; he described Tolstoy as &quot;a historiograph of the , or rather, its cultural elite.&quot; &quot;The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools,&quot; he added. In 1876 Dostoevsky wrote: &quot;My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge—not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.&quot;

Nikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in (&quot;The Stock Exchange Herald&quot;), wrote several articles praising highly &quot;War and Peace&quot;, calling it &quot;the best ever Russian historical novel&quot; and &quot;the pride of the contemporary literature&quot;. Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy&#x27;s book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for &quot;having lifted up the people&#x27;s spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved&quot;. &quot;While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers&quot;, Leskov wrote.

Afanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870, letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. &quot;You&#x27;ve managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it&quot;, he added.

Ivan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel&#x27;s historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy&#x27;s psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper , Turgenev described Tolstoy as &quot;the most popular Russian writer&quot; and &quot;War and Peace&quot; as &quot;one of the most remarkable books of our age.&quot; &quot;This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there&#x27;s true, real Russia,&quot; Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev&#x27;s efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.

Since then many world-famous authors have praised &quot;War and Peace&quot; as a masterpiece of world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: &quot;This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.&quot; Later John Galsworthy called &quot;War and Peace&quot; &quot;the best novel that had ever been written&quot;. Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote, &quot;This work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.&quot; Thomas Mann thought &quot;War and Peace&quot; to be &quot;the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.&quot; When Virginia Woolf finished the book, she declared &quot;There remains the greatest of all novelists—for what else can we call the author of &quot;War and Peace&quot;?&quot; Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to &quot;write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did&quot;, Hemingway asserted in his 1955 &quot;Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time&quot; anthology.

Isaac Babel said, after reading &quot;War and Peace&quot;, &quot;If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.&quot; Tolstoy &quot;gives us a unique combination of the &#x27;naive objectivity&#x27; of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.&quot;

==English translations==
&quot;War and Peace&quot; has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators Constance Garnett and Aylmer and Louise Maude knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoy&#x27;s often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. Only about two percent of &quot;War and Peace&quot; is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later. Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French; Briggs and Shubin use no French, while Pevear–Volokhonsky&#x27;s and Amy Mandelker&#x27;s revisions of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.

===Comparing translations===
In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English&quot;, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit has this to say about the translations of &quot;War and Peace&quot; available in 2000: &quot;Of all the translations of &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Dunnigan&#x27;s (1968) is the best. ... Unlike the other translators, Dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris&#x27;s mother pronounced his name with a stress on the &quot;o&quot; – an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady&#x27;s affectation.&quot;

On the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: &quot;her ...&quot;War and Peace&quot; is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms. Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi.&quot; On the Maudes&#x27; translation she comments: &quot;this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes&#x27; lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general, place this version below Dunnigan&#x27;s.&quot; She further comments on Edmonds&#x27;s revised translation, formerly on Penguin: &quot;[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude.&quot;

<text>The Hippocratic facies () is the change produced in the face recognisable as a medical sign known as facies and prognostic of death. It may also be seen as due to long illness, excessive defecation, or excessive hunger, when it can be differentiated from the sign of impending death. (The term &quot;typhoid facies&quot; refers to the staring expression often seen in typhoid fever).

&quot;[If the patient&#x27;s facial] appearance may be described thus: the nose sharp, the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their lobes distorted, the skin of the face hard, stretched and dry, and the colour of the face pale or dusky ... and if there is no improvement within [a prescribed period of time], it must be realized that this sign portends death.&quot;

The Hippocratic facies is named after Hippocrates, who first described it.

A related term is cachexia, which is the bodily wasting syndrome often associated with death.

<text>Samuel Moore Walton (March 29, 1918 – April 5, 1992) was an American business magnate best known for founding the retailers Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club, which he started in Rogers, Arkansas, and Midwest City, Oklahoma, in 1962 and 1983 respectively. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world&#x27;s largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the United States. His family has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around $440.6 billion US as of January 2025. In 1992 at the age of 74, Walton died of blood cancer and was buried at the Bentonville Cemetery in his longtime home of Bentonville, Arkansas.

==Early life==
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother&#x27;s Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance, where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.

He and his family (now with another son, James, born in 1921) moved from Oklahoma. They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in Shelbina, Missouri, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout in the state&#x27;s history. In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

Eventually the family moved to Columbia, Missouri. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver &quot;Columbia Daily Tribune&quot; newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions. Upon graduating from David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, he was voted &quot;Most Versatile Boy&quot;.

After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was also tapped by QEBH, the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and Stephens College. Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, he was voted &quot;permanent president&quot; of the class.

Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.

Walton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa, three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II. In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.

==The first stores==
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, Leland Robson, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.

Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good as or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home. Walton ensured the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny &quot;Eagle&quot; department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.

With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.
Admiring Sam&#x27;s great success and desiring to reclaim the store and franchise rights for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store&#x27;s inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called &quot;a fair price&quot;.
With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, Walton, his wife, Helen, and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam&#x27;s knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal and reimburse Helen&#x27;s father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.

Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.

==A chain of Ben Franklin stores==
With the new Bentonville &quot;Five and Dime&quot; opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.

After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Walton became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James &quot;Bud&quot; Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.).

In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).

==First Walmart==
The first true Walmart opened on July 2, 1962, in Rogers, Arkansas. Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.

As the Meijer store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer&#x27;s original innovative concept.
Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton&#x27;s model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.

To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day&#x27;s drive of Walmart&#x27;s regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growthfrom 1977&#x27;s 190 stores to 1985&#x27;s 800was achieved.

Given its scale and economic influence, Walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store. These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the &quot;Walmart Effect&quot;.

==Personal life==
Walton married Helen Robson on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946–2005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.

Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students. The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of “service leadership” into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of Christ being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in Christianity.

Walton was diagnosed and treated for Hairy cell leukemia.

===Death===
Walton died on Sunday, April 5, 1992 (three months shy of Walmart&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary), of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, in Little Rock, Arkansas. A few days earlier, according to his son, Walton was still reviewing sales data in his hospital bed. The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Walmart stores. At the time, his company employed 400,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50 billion flowed from 1,735 Walmarts, 212 Sam&#x27;s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.

His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam&#x27;s brother Bud Walton — Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie — hold smaller shares in the company.

==Legacy==

In 1998, Walton was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s list of 100 most influential people of the 20th Century. Walton was honored for his work in retail in March 1992, just one month before his death, when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from then-President George H. W. Bush.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Sam Walton as the richest person in the United States from 1982 to 1988, ceding the top spot to John Kluge in 1989 when the editors began to credit Walton&#x27;s fortune jointly to him and his four children. (Bill Gates first headed the list in 1992, the year Walton died.) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam&#x27;s Club warehouse stores. Walmart operates in the United States and in more than fifteen international markets, including: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Eswatini (Swaziland), Honduras,
Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.

At the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.

<text>Data acquisition is the process of sampling signals that measure real-world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a computer. Data acquisition systems, abbreviated by the acronyms &quot;DAS,&quot; &quot;DAQ,&quot; or &quot;DAU,&quot; typically convert analog waveforms into digital values for processing. The components of data acquisition systems include:

* Sensors, to convert physical parameters to electrical signals.
* Signal conditioning circuitry, to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values.
* Analog-to-digital converters, to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values.

Data acquisition applications are usually controlled by software programs developed using various general purpose programming languages such as Assembly, BASIC, C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, LabVIEW, Lisp, Pascal, etc. Stand-alone data acquisition systems are often called data loggers.

There are also open-source software packages providing all the necessary tools to acquire data from different, typically specific, hardware equipment. These tools come from the scientific community where complex experiment requires fast, flexible, and adaptable software. Those packages are usually custom-fit but more general DAQ packages like the Maximum Integrated Data Acquisition System can be easily tailored and are used in several physics experiments.

==History==
In 1963, IBM produced computers that specialized in data acquisition. These include the IBM 7700 Data Acquisition System, and its successor, the IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control System. These expensive specialized systems were surpassed in 1974 by general-purpose S-100 computers and data acquisition cards produced by Tecmar/Scientific Solutions Inc. In 1981 IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer and Scientific Solutions introduced the first PC data acquisition products.

==Methodology==

===Sources and systems===

Data acquisition begins with the physical phenomenon or physical property to be measured. Examples of this include temperature, vibration, light intensity, gas pressure, fluid flow, and force. Regardless of the type of physical property to be measured, the physical state that is to be measured must first be transformed into a unified form that can be sampled by a data acquisition system. The task of performing such transformations falls on devices called &quot;sensors&quot;. A data acquisition system is a collection of software and hardware that allows one to measure or control the physical characteristics of something in the real world. A complete data acquisition system consists of DAQ hardware, sensors and actuators, signal conditioning hardware, and a computer running DAQ software. If timing is necessary (such as for event mode DAQ systems), a separate compensated distributed timing system is required.

A sensor, which is a type of &quot;transducer&quot;, is a device that converts a physical property into a corresponding electrical signal (e.g., strain gauge, thermistor). An acquisition system to measure different properties depends on the sensors that are suited to detect those properties. Signal conditioning may be necessary if the signal from the transducer is not suitable for the DAQ hardware being used. The signal may need to be filtered, shaped, or amplified in most cases. Various other examples of signal conditioning might be bridge completion, providing current or voltage excitation to the sensor, isolation, and linearization. For transmission purposes, single ended analog signals, which are more susceptible to noise can be converted to differential signals. Once digitized, the signal can be encoded to reduce and correct transmission errors.

===DAQ hardware===

DAQ hardware is what usually interfaces between the signal and a PC. It could be in the form of modules that can be connected to the computer&#x27;s ports (parallel, serial, USB, etc.) or cards connected to slots (S-100 bus, AppleBus, ISA, MCA, PCI, PCI-E, etc.) in a PC motherboard or in a modular crate (CAMAC, NIM, VME). Sometimes adapters are needed, in which case an external breakout box can be used.

DAQ cards often contain multiple components (multiplexer, ADC, DAC, TTL-IO, high-speed timers, RAM). These are accessible via a bus by a microcontroller, which can run small programs. A controller is more flexible than a hard-wired logic, yet cheaper than a CPU so it is permissible to block it with simple polling loops. For example:
Waiting for a trigger, starting the ADC, looking up the time, waiting for the ADC to finish, move value to RAM, switch multiplexer, get TTL input, let DAC proceed with voltage ramp.

Today, signals from some sensors and Data Acquisition Systems can be streamed via Bluetooth.

=== DAQ device drivers ===
DAQ device drivers are needed for the DAQ hardware to work with a PC. The device driver performs low-level register writes and reads on the hardware while exposing API for developing user applications in a variety of programs.

===Input devices===
*3D scanner
*Analog-to-digital converter
*Time-to-digital converter

===Hardware===
*Computer Automated Measurement and Control (CAMAC)
*Industrial Ethernet
*Industrial USB
*LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation
*Network interface controller
*PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation
*VMEbus
*VXI

===DAQ software===
Specialized DAQ software may be delivered with the DAQ hardware. Software tools used for building large-scale data acquisition systems include EPICS. Other programming environments that are used to build DAQ applications include ladder logic, Visual C++, Visual Basic, LabVIEW, and MATLAB.

<doc id="155325" wikidata="Q11762529" url="?curid=155325" title="Longdendale">
<text>Longdendale is a valley in the Peak District of England, north of Glossop and southwest of Holmfirth. The name means &quot;long wooded valley&quot; and the valley is mostly in the counties of Derbyshire and Greater Manchester.

==Geography==
The eastern part of the valley is in the non-metropolitan county of Derbyshire and includes the village of Tintwistle and, further east, part of the Peak District National Park, with the last half-mile or so falling into the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire. The western part of the valley, including the villages of Broadbottom, Mottram in Longdendale and Hollingworth is part of Tameside in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The whole of Longdendale forms the easternmost extension of the lands within the historic boundaries of Cheshire.

The River Etherow, a tributary of the River Mersey, rises south of Holmfirth and then flows through a chain of six reservoirs known as the Longdendale Chain: Woodhead Reservoir, Torside Reservoir, Rhodeswood Reservoir, Valehouse Reservoir, Bottoms Reservoir and Arnfield Reservoir. There was a seventh reservoir at Hollingworth, but it was abandoned in 1990 and now forms part of Swallows Wood Nature Reserve.

==History==
===The Romans===
There is a Roman fortlet at Highstones on the south-facing slope overlooking Torside Reservoir. It is an oval-shaped area, with an obvious ditch, and about across. A footpath runs immediately to the north of it, and to the west is Highstones Farm. A Roman road may have run along the valley connecting it with Melandra Castle (Glossop).

===Feudal estates===
The lordship of Longdendale was an ancient feudal estate encompassing the medieval manors of Godley, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Matley, Mottram, Newton, Staley, Tintwistle and Werneth. The lordship was created by the Earl of Chester in the late twelfth century; William de Neville was the first lord of Longdendale, as appointed by the Earl of Chester. Buckton Castle, near Carrbrook, was probably built by William de Neville in the late twelfth century and was also probably the centre of lordship of Longdendale as it is the only castle within the lordship. One of the privileges of the lordship was to carry out trial by combat. The lordship of Longdendale was passed from de Neville to his son in law, Thomas de Burgh, in 1211 on his death. The lordship reverted to the control of the crown in 1357, and remained under crown control until 1374. The lordship was given to Matilda Lovell and the Lovells controlled Longdendale until 1465 when control again reverted to the crown. The lordship was granted to Sir William Stanley in 1489, however the lordship once again reverted to the crown when Stanley was executed in 1495 as a supporter of Perkin Warbeck. In 1554 the lordship was granted to Richard Wilbraham. Tollemache family inherited lordship of Longdendale from the Wilbrahams in the 1690s. It was part of the Hundred of Macclesfield. An estate survey, or &#x27;Extent&#x27; of the lordship for 1360 was published by the Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire in July 2005.

===Salt trade===

A packhorse route called a saltway was maintained from the Middle Ages onwards for the purpose of allowing the export of salt from the Cheshire &quot;wiches&quot; of Nantwich, Northwich and Middlewich across the Pennines. The passing trade brought prosperity to settlements along the route. The importance of the salt trade along such saltways is shown by surviving placenames; for example Salter&#x27;s Brook () is where the saltway forked, with one route leading to Wakefield and another to Barnsley. The stone Lady Shaw Bridge still exists at this point, as do the ruins of an old inn. The bridge is just wide enough for a packhorse, though it is suspected that the bridge may have originally been wider and was deliberately narrowed when the Saltersbrook turnpike was built, to prevent vehicles bypassing the toll barrier.

===Turnpike road===
The turnpike road from Manchester to Saltersbrook connected to further turnpikes for Yorkshire destinations and was built in the mid-18th century, based on the older saltway route.

===The reservoirs===

The Longdendale catchment exceeds and has an annual rainfall of . The civil engineer John Frederick Bateman recognised the potential and conceived a plan to deliver this water to Manchester and Salford, while still maintaining the flow in the River Etherow that was needed to power the mills of Tintwistle and Glossop. The six reservoirs have a capacity of . A tunnel was built at a depth of to carry the water from Longdendale into the valley of the River Tame. The Manchester Corporation Waterworks Act 1847 (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. cciii) (9 July 1847) was passed to allow the land to be acquired and construction to commence.

===The railway===

The first railway line between Manchester and Sheffield was constructed between 1839 and 1845 on the south side of the reservoir chain by 1,500 navvies of whom many died and most suffered illness. The three-mile-long double Woodhead Tunnel was, for a time, the longest tunnel in the country. It was replaced by a single, larger tunnel in 1954. The first tunnel was subsequently used by CEGB to reroute the main high-voltage link up the valley and through the National Park underground. The railway line ceased to be economical, and in 1970 the passenger service ceased, followed in 1981 by the goods service. The passenger service was adversely affected by the requirement to keep the Hope Valley line open, whilst the freight service was affected by the falloff in Trans-Pennine coal traffic. The track was lifted in 1986. There have been plans to re-open the railway at various times since it was closed, but none have gained planning approval.

==Recreation==

===Cycling and walking===

After the rail line was closed, the trackbed was taken up and the Longdendale Trail constructed along its route. It is now part of the Trans-Pennine Trail (Sustrans National Cycle Route 62) which, in its turn, is part of the European walking route E8 from Liverpool to Istanbul. Holme Moss and Woodhead Pass are on the chosen route of the 2014 Tour de France, during the second stage between York and Sheffield.

The Pennine Way crosses Longdendale, descending from Bleaklow to the south and ascending Black Hill to the north. The youth hostel at Crowden is a traditional stop after the first day&#x27;s walk from Edale. The circular walk known as &#x27;The Longdendale Edges&#x27; takes in the high ground (at about the level) on both sides of the valley. It is about long and is &#x27;not recommended in doubtful weather&#x27;. The detailed route, clockwise from Crowden Youth Hostel, is given in &quot;Peak District Walking Guide No.2&quot;, published by the Peak Park Planning Board.

===Sailing===
Torside Reservoir is home to Glossop Sailing Club.

==Transport==

===Woodhead pass road===
The M67 motorway starts at the M60 motorway in Manchester and heads east where it currently terminates at Mottram in Longdendale. There were plans in the 1960s to extend it through the National Park to the M1 motorway and Sheffield but it was never built. From here the A628 runs through the valley to join the A616.

As of January 2008 there are advanced plans to improve the A628 route by bypassing Mottram and Tintwistle to the north with a spur to the A57 road. Known as the &#x27;A57/A628 Mottram-in-Longdendale, Hollingworth &amp; Tintwistle Bypass&#x27; or Longdendale Bypass, the public inquiry has been adjourned four times and is currently adjourned &#x27;indefinitely&#x27;.

== Governance ==

The valley gave its name to the Longdendale Urban District, which covered the western part of the valley around Mottram and Hollingworth. That district was created in 1936 as one of the districts of Cheshire, and was abolished in 1974 when its area became part of the metropolitan borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

Traditionally, Longdendale was in the County palatine of Chester. Up until local government reforms in 1974, Longdendale Urban District, along with Tintwistle Rural District, formed part of the administrative county of Cheshire; the Municipal Borough of Glossop was in Derbyshire; and Penistone Rural District was in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Today, the valley is split between the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, the Borough of High Peak in Derbyshire, and the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

==Longdendale lights==

The valley and the surrounding area has a reputation for strange phenomena, including unexplained lights and allegedly supernatural apparitions and has become a centre of attention for UFO and ghost hunters. It has, however, been suggested that the lights may be &quot;earth lights&quot; produced by pressure on the underlying rocks.

<doc id="155327" wikidata="Q191928" url="?curid=155327" title="Polysemy">
<text>Polysemy ( or ; ) is the capacity for a sign (e.g. a symbol, a morpheme, a word, or a phrase) to have multiple related meanings. For example, a word can have several word senses. Polysemy is distinct from &quot;monosemy&quot;, where a word has a single meaning.

Polysemy is distinct from homonymy—or homophony—which is an accidental similarity between two or more words (such as &quot;bear&quot; the animal, and the verb ); whereas homonymy is a mere linguistic coincidence, polysemy is not. In discerning whether a given set of meanings represent polysemy or homonymy, it is often necessary to look at the history of the word to see whether the two meanings are historically related. Dictionary writers often list polysemes (words or phrases with different, but related, senses) in the same entry (that is, under the same headword) and enter homonyms as separate headwords (usually with a numbering convention such as &quot;¹bear&quot; and &quot;²bear&quot;).

==Polysemes==
A polyseme is a word or phrase with different, but related, senses. Since the test for polysemy is the vague concept of the relatedness, judgments of polysemy can be difficult to make. Because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change, looking at words&#x27; etymology is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution; as words become lost in etymology, what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so. Some seemingly unrelated words share a common historical origin, however, so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy, and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers&#x27; intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology. English has many polysemous words. For example, the verb &quot;to &quot; can mean &quot;procure&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll get the drinks&quot;), &quot;become&quot; (&quot;she got scared&quot;), &quot;understand&quot; (&quot;I get it&quot;) etc.

In linear or vertical polysemy, one sense of a word is a subset of the other. These are examples of hyponymy and hypernymy, and are sometimes called autohyponyms. For example, &#x27;dog&#x27; can be used for &#x27;male dog&#x27;. Alan Cruse identifies four types of linear polysemy:

* autohyponymy, where the basic sense leads to a specialised sense (from &quot;drinking (anything)&quot; to &quot;drinking (alcohol)&quot;) 
* automeronymy, where the basic sense leads to a subpart sense (from &quot;door (whole structure)&quot; to &quot;door (panel)&quot;)
* autohyperonymy or autosuperordination, where the basic sense leads to a wider sense (from &quot;(female) cow&quot; to &quot;cow (of either sex)&quot;)
* autoholonymy, where the basic sense leads to a larger sense (from &quot;leg (thigh and calf)&quot; to &quot;leg (thigh, calf, knee and foot)&quot;)

In non-linear polysemy, the original sense of a word is used figuratively to provide a different way of looking at the new subject. Alan Cruse identifies three types of non-linear polysemy:

* metonymy, where one sense &quot;stands for&quot; another (from &quot;hands (body part)&quot; to &quot;hands (manual labourers)&quot;)
* metaphor, where there is a resemblance between senses (from &quot;swallowing (a pill)&quot; to &quot;swallowing (an argument)&quot;)
* other construals (for example, from &quot;month (of the year)&quot; to &quot;month (30 days)&quot;)

There are several tests for polysemy, but one of them is zeugma: if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in different contexts, it is probable that the contexts bring out different polysemes of the same word. If the two senses of the same word do not seem to &quot;fit,&quot; yet seem related, then it is probable that they are polysemous. This test again depends on speakers&#x27; judgments about relatedness, which means that it is not infallible, but merely a helpful conceptual aid.

The difference between homonyms and polysemes is subtle. Lexicographers define polysemes within a single dictionary lemma, while homonyms are treated in separate entries, numbering different meanings (or lemmata). Semantic shift can separate a polysemous word into separate homonyms. For example, &quot;check&quot; as in &quot;bank check&quot; (or &quot;Cheque&quot;), &quot;check&quot; in chess, and &quot;check&quot; meaning &quot;verification&quot; are considered homonyms, while they originated as a single word derived from chess in the 14th century. Psycholinguistic experiments have shown that homonyms and polysemes are represented differently within people&#x27;s mental lexicon: while the different meanings of homonyms (which are semantically unrelated) tend to interfere or compete with each other during comprehension, this does not usually occur for the polysemes that have semantically related meanings. Results for this contention, however, have been mixed.

For Dick Hebdige, polysemy means that, &quot;each text is seen to generate a potentially infinite range of meanings,&quot; making, according to Richard Middleton, &quot;any homology, out of the most heterogeneous materials, possible. The idea of &quot;signifying practice&quot;—texts not as communicating or expressing a pre-existing meaning but as &#x27;positioning subjects&#x27; within a &quot;process&quot; of semiosis—changes the whole basis of creating social meaning&quot;.

Charles Fillmore and Beryl Atkins&#x27; definition stipulates three elements: (i) the various senses of a polysemous word have a central origin, (ii) the links between these senses form a network, and (iii) understanding the &#x27;inner&#x27; one contributes to understanding of the &#x27;outer&#x27; one.

One group of polysemes are those in which a word meaning an activity, perhaps derived from a verb, acquires the meanings of those engaged in the activity, or perhaps the results of the activity, or the time or place in which the activity occurs or has occurred. Sometimes only one of those meanings is intended, depending on context, and sometimes multiple meanings are intended at the same time. Other types are derivations from one of the other meanings that leads to a verb or activity.

===Examples in English===
;Man
:# The human species (i.e., man vs. other organisms)
:# Males of the human species (i.e., man vs. woman)
:# Adult males of the human species (i.e., man vs. boy)
:#(As a verb) to operate or constitute a vehicle or machine (To man a ship)
This example shows the specific polysemy where the same word is used at different levels of a taxonomy.

;Bank
:# a financial institution
:# the physical building where a financial institution offers services
:# to deposit money or have an account in a bank (e.g. &quot;I bank at the local credit union&quot;)
:# a supply of something held in reserve: such as &quot;banking&quot; brownie points
:# a synonym for &#x27;rely upon&#x27; (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m your friend, you can &quot;bank&quot; on me&quot;). It is different, but &quot;related,&quot; as it derives from the theme of security initiated by 1.
:However: 1 is borrowed from Italian &quot;banco&quot;, a money lender&#x27;s bench, while a river &quot;bank&quot; is a native English word. Today they can be considered homonyms with &quot;completely different&quot; meanings. But originally they were polysemous, since Italian borrowed the word from a Germanic language. The Proto-Germanic cognate for &quot;bank&quot; is *bankiz. A river bank is typically visually bench-like in its flatness.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the three most polysemous words in English are &quot;run&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, and &quot;set&quot;, in that order.

==Related ideas==
A notion related to polysemy is colexification – namely, the case when several meanings are expressed by the same word. The main difference between the two notions is one of perspective: &quot;polysemy&quot; is usually taken in a semasiological way, going from a form to its meanings; whereas &quot;colexification&quot; is onomasiological, starting from individual meanings and observing how they are colexified (or its opposite, &quot;dislexified&quot;) in languages.

A lexical conception of polysemy was developed by B. T. S. Atkins, in the form of lexical implication rules. These are rules that describe how words, in one lexical context, can then be used, in a different form, in a related context. A crude example of such a rule is the pastoral idea of &quot;verbizing one&#x27;s nouns&quot;: that certain nouns, used in certain contexts, can be converted into a verb, conveying a related meaning.

Another clarification of polysemy is the idea of predicate transfer—the reassignment of a property to an object that would not otherwise inherently have that property. Thus, the expression &quot;I am parked out back&quot; conveys the meaning of &quot;parked&quot; from &quot;car&quot; to the property of &quot;I possess a car&quot;. This avoids incorrect polysemous interpretations of &quot;parked&quot;: that &quot;people can be parked&quot;, or that &quot;I am pretending to be a car&quot;, or that &quot;I am something that can be parked&quot;. This is supported by the morphology: &quot;We are parked out back&quot; does not mean that there are multiple cars; rather, that there are multiple passengers (having the property of being in possession of a car).

<doc id="155337" wikidata="Q43201039" url="?curid=155337" title="Hypernymy and hyponymy">
<text>Hypernymy and hyponymy are the between a generic term (hypernym) and a more specific term (hyponym). The hypernym is also called a supertype, umbrella term, or blanket term. The hyponym names a subtype of the hypernym. The semantic field of the hyponym is included within that of the hypernym. For example, &quot;pigeon&quot;, &quot;crow&quot;, and &quot;hen&quot; are all hyponyms of &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;; &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;animal&quot; are both hypernyms of &quot;pigeon, crow,&quot; and &quot;hen&quot;.

A core concept of hyponymy is &quot;type of&quot;, whereas &quot;instance of&quot; is differentiable. For example, for the noun &quot;city&quot;, a hyponym (naming a type of city) is &quot;capital city&quot; or &quot;capital&quot;, whereas &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;London&quot; are instances of a city, not types of city.

== Hypernyms and hyponyms ==
In linguistics, semantics, general semantics, and ontologies, hyponymy () shows the relationship between a generic term (hypernym) and a specific instance of it (hyponym). A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym. The semantic field of a hypernym, also known as a superordinate, is broader than that of a hyponym. An approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms. This, however, becomes more difficult with abstract words such as &quot;imagine&quot;, &quot;understand&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot;. While hyponyms are typically used to refer to nouns, it can also be used on other parts of speech. Like nouns, hypernyms in verbs are words that refer to a broad category of actions. For example, verbs such as &quot;stare&quot;, &quot;gaze&quot;, &quot;view&quot; and &quot;peer&quot; can also be considered hyponyms of the verb &quot;look&quot;, which is their hypernym.

The meaning relation between hyponyms and hypernyms applies to lexical items of the same word class (that is, part of speech), and holds between senses rather than words. For instance, the word &quot;screwdriver&quot; as most immediately understood refers to the screwdriver tool, and not to the screwdriver drink.
Hypernymy and hyponymy are converse relations. If X is a kind of Y, then X is a hyponym of Y and Y is a hypernym of X. Hyponymy is a transitive relation: if X is a hyponym of Y, and Y is a hyponym of Z, then X is a hyponym of Z. For example, &quot;violet&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;purple&quot; and &quot;purple&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;color&quot;; therefore &quot;violet&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;color&quot;. A word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym: for example &quot;purple&quot; is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of &quot;crimson&quot; and &quot;violet&quot;.

The hierarchical structure of semantic fields can be seen in hyponymy. These can be conceptualized as a vertical arrangement, where the higher level is more general and the lower level is more specific. For example, &quot;living things&quot; will be the highest level followed by &quot;plants&quot; and &quot;animals&quot;, and the lowest level may comprise &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;wolf&quot;.

=== Taxonymy ===
Taxonymy (not to be confused with, though related to, &quot;taxonomy&quot;) is a sub-variety of hyponymy. Within the structure of a taxonomic lexical hierarchy, two types of hyponymic relation may be distinguished: the first—exemplified in &quot;An X is a Y&quot;—corresponds to so-called &quot;simple&quot; hyponymy; the second—that which is exemplified in &quot;An X is a &quot;kind/type of&quot; Y&quot;—is more discriminating, and functions as the &quot;vertical&quot; relation in the taxonomy. This latter relation is that which may be termed &quot;taxonymy&quot;.

(Note that a taxonomic lexical hierarchy is structured by, in addition to the above inclusion relations, their corresponding relations of exclusion: &quot;A Z is not a Y&quot;, or &quot;incompatibility&quot;; and &quot;A Z is a different kind/type of Y than X&quot;, or &quot;co-taxonymy&quot;.)

=== Co-hyponyms ===
If the hypernym Z consists of hyponyms X and Y, then X and Y are identified as co-hyponyms, also known as coordinate terms. Co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate hyponyms share the same hypernym but are not hyponyms of one another, unless they happen to be synonymous. For example, &quot;screwdriver&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;, &quot;knife&quot;, and &quot;hammer&quot; are all co-hyponyms of one another and hyponyms of &quot;tool&quot;, but not hyponyms of one another: *&quot;A hammer is a type of knife&quot; is false.

Co-hyponyms are often but not always related to one another by the relation of incompatibility. For example, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;peach&quot; and &quot;plum&quot; are co-hyponyms of &quot;fruit&quot;. However, an &quot;apple&quot; is not a &quot;peach&quot;, which is also not a &quot;plum&quot;. Thus, they are incompatible. Nevertheless, co-hyponyms are not necessarily incompatible in all senses. A &quot;queen&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; are both hyponyms of &quot;woman&quot; but there is nothing preventing the &quot;queen&quot; from being a &quot;mother&quot;. This shows that compatibility may be relevant.

=== Autohyponyms ===

A word is an autohyponym if it is used for both a hypernym and its hyponym: it has a stricter sense that is entirely a subset of a broader sense. For example, the word &quot;dog&quot; describes both the species &quot;Canis familiaris&quot; and male individuals of &quot;Canis familiaris&quot;, so it is possible to say &quot;That dog isn&#x27;t a dog, it&#x27;s a bitch&quot; (&quot;That hypernym Z isn&#x27;t a hyponym Z, it&#x27;s a hyponym Y&quot;). The term &quot;autohyponym&quot; was coined by linguist Laurence R. Horn, in his 1984 paper &quot;Ambiguity, negation, and the London School of Parsimony&quot;. Linguist Ruth Kempson had already observed that if there are hyponyms for one part of a set but not another, the hypernym can complement the existing hyponym by being used for the remaining part. For example, fingers describe all digits on a hand, but the existence of the word thumb for the first finger means that fingers can also be used for &quot;non-thumb digits on a hand&quot;. Autohyponymy is also called &quot;vertical polysemy&quot;.

Horn called this &quot;licensed polysemy&quot;, but found that autohyponyms also formed even when there is no other hyponym. Yankee is autohyponymous because it is a hyponym (native of New England) and its hypernym (native of the United States), even though there is no other hyponym of Yankee (as native of the United States) that means &quot;not a native of New England&quot;. Similarly, the verb to drink (a beverage) is a hypernym for to drink (an alcoholic beverage).

In some cases, autohyponyms duplicate existing, distinct hyponyms. The hypernym &quot;smell&quot; (to emit any smell) has a hyponym &quot;stink&quot; (to emit a bad smell), but is autohyponymous because &quot;smell&quot; can also mean &quot;to emit a bad smell&quot;, even though there is no &quot;to emit a smell that isn&#x27;t bad&quot; hyponym.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hyperonym&quot; and &quot;hypernym&quot; mean the same thing, with both in use by linguists. The form &quot;hypernym&quot; interprets the &quot;-o-&quot; of &quot;hyponym&quot; as a part of &quot;hypo&quot;, such as in &quot;hypertension&quot; and &quot;hypotension&quot;. However, etymologically the &quot;-o-&quot; is part of the Greek stem &quot;ónoma&quot;. In other combinations with this stem, e.g. &quot;synonym&quot;, it is never elided. Therefore, &quot;hyperonym&quot; is etymologically more faithful than &quot;hypernym&quot;. &quot;Hyperonymy&quot; is used, for instance, by John Lyons, who does not mention &quot;hypernymy&quot; and prefers &quot;superordination&quot;. The nominalization &quot;hyperonymy&quot; is rarely used, because the neutral term to refer to the relationship is &quot;hypernymy&quot;.

== Usage ==
Computer science often terms this relationship an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship. For example, the phrase &quot;Red is-a color&quot; can be used to describe the hyponymic relationship between &quot;red&quot; and &quot;color&quot;.
Hyponymy is the most frequently encoded relation among synsets used in lexical databases such as WordNet. These semantic relations can also be used to compare semantic similarity by judging the distance between two synsets and to analyse anaphora.

As a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym, the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization.

The notion of hyponymy is particularly relevant to language translation, as hyponyms are very common across languages. For example, in Japanese the word for older brother is , and the word for younger brother is . An English-to-Japanese translator presented with a phrase containing the English word &quot;brother&quot; would have to choose which Japanese word equivalent to use. This would be difficult, because abstract information (such as the speakers&#x27; relative ages) is often not available during machine translation.

<doc id="155339" wikidata="Q1899648" url="?curid=155339" title="Point cloud">
<text>A point cloud is a discrete set of data points in space. The points may represent a 3D shape or object. Each point position has its set of Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z). Points may contain data other than position such as RGB colors, normals, timestamps and others. Point clouds are generally produced by 3D scanners or by photogrammetry software, which measure many points on the external surfaces of objects around them. As the output of 3D scanning processes, point clouds are used for many purposes, including to create 3D computer-aided design (CAD) or geographic information systems (GIS) models for manufactured parts, for metrology and quality inspection, and for a multitude of visualizing, animating, rendering, and mass customization applications.

== Alignment and registration ==

When scanning a scene in real world using Lidar, the captured point clouds contain snippets of the scene, which requires alignment to generate a full map of the scanned environment.

Point clouds are often aligned with 3D models or with other point clouds, a process termed point set registration.

The Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm can be used to align two point clouds that have an overlap between them, and are separated by a rigid transform. Point clouds with elastic transforms can also be aligned by using a non-rigid variant of the ICP (NICP). With advancements in machine learning in recent years, point cloud registration may also be done using end-to-end neural networks.

For industrial metrology or inspection using industrial computed tomography, the point cloud of a manufactured part can be aligned to an existing model and compared to check for differences. Geometric dimensions and tolerances can also be extracted directly from the point cloud.

== Conversion to 3D surfaces ==


While point clouds can be directly rendered and inspected, point clouds are often converted to polygon mesh or triangle mesh models, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surface models, or CAD models through a process commonly referred to as surface reconstruction.

There are many techniques for converting a point cloud to a 3D surface. Some approaches, like Delaunay triangulation, alpha shapes, and ball pivoting, build a network of triangles over the existing vertices of the point cloud, while other approaches convert the point cloud into a volumetric distance field and reconstruct the implicit surface so defined through a marching cubes algorithm.

In geographic information systems, point clouds are one of the sources used to make digital elevation model of the terrain. They are also used to generate 3D models of urban environments. Drones are often used to collect a series of RGB images which can be later processed on a computer vision algorithm platform such as on AgiSoft Photoscan, Pix4D, DroneDeploy or Hammer Missions to create RGB point clouds from where distances and volumetric estimations can be made.

Point clouds can also be used to represent volumetric data, as is sometimes done in medical imaging. Using point clouds, multi-sampling and data compression can be achieved.

== MPEG Point Cloud Compression ==

MPEG began standardizing point cloud compression (PCC) with a Call for Proposal (CfP) in 2017. Three categories of point clouds were identified: category 1 for static point clouds, category 2 for dynamic point clouds, and category 3 for Lidar sequences (dynamically acquired point clouds). Two technologies were finally defined: G-PCC (Geometry-based PCC, ISO/IEC 23090 part 9) for category 1 and category 3; and V-PCC (Video-based PCC, ISO/IEC 23090 part 5) for category 2. The first test models were developed in October 2017, one for G-PCC (TMC13) and another one for V-PCC (TMC2). Since then, the two test models have evolved through technical contributions and collaboration, and the first version of the PCC standard specifications was expected to be finalized in 2020 as part of the ISO/IEC 23090 series on the coded representation of immersive media content.

<doc id="155349" wikidata="Q176665" url="?curid=155349" title="Hymn to Liberty">
<text>The &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, also known as the &quot;Hymn to Freedom&quot;, is a Greek poem written by Dionysios Solomos in 1823 and set to music by Nikolaos Mantzaros in 1828. It officially became the national anthem of Greece in 1864 and Cyprus in 1966. Consisting of 158 stanzas in total, is the longest national anthem in the world by length of text. 

== History ==
Dionysios Solomos wrote &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; in 1823 in Zakynthos, and one year later it was printed in Messolonghi. In October 1824 it was published in London by the Philhellenic Committee, and an Italian translation was published in the Messolonghi newspaper &quot;Ellinika Chronika&quot; at about the same time.

It was set to music in 1828 by the Corfiot operatic composer Nikolaos Mantzaros, who composed a choral versions, in 24 parts, and dedicated it to the first King of Greece, Otto. Otto awarded Mantzaros with the Silver Cross of the Order of the Redeemer as a token of appreciation, but during Otto&#x27;s reign (1832–1862), an anthem based on God Save the King was used, with a text glorifying Otto. 

After Otto&#x27;s ouster in 1862, the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; was adopted as the national and royal anthem of Greece in 1864. The &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; was also adopted as the national anthem of Cyprus by order of the Council of Ministers in 1966.

== Lyrics ==
Inspired by the Greek War of Independence, Solomos wrote the hymn to honour the struggle of Greeks for independence after centuries of Ottoman rule.

&quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; recounts the misery of the Greeks under the Ottomans and their hope for freedom. He describes different events of the War, such as the execution of Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople, the reaction of the Great Powers, extensively the Siege of Tripolitsa and the Christian character of the struggle.

The following are the first 8 verses of the national anthem of Greece.



== Uses ==
An adapted version was used during the short-lived Cretan State as the Cretan Anthem. The &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; had been the Greek royal anthem since 1864.

&quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; has been the national anthem of Cyprus since 1966.

&quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, to pay tribute to Greece as the birthplace of the Olympic Games. Most renditions performed during the closing ceremonies are instrumental. Until the 2024 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, the Greek anthem was sung for three times during the Sydney, Athens (as Greece was the host country), and Vancouver.

The version commonly played by military bands is an arrangement composed by Lieutenant Colonel Margaritis Kastellis (1907–1979), former director of the Greek Music Corps.

<doc id="155350" wikidata="Q768549" url="?curid=155350" title="Munsell color system">
<text>In colorimetry, the Munsell color system is a color space that specifies colors based on three properties of color: hue (basic color), value (lightness), and chroma (color intensity). It was created by Albert H. Munsell in the first decade of the 20th century and adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as the official color system for soil research in the 1930s.

Several earlier color order systems had placed colors into a three-dimensional color solid of one form or another, but Munsell was the first to separate hue, value, and chroma into perceptually uniform and independent dimensions, and he was the first to illustrate the colors systematically in three-dimensional space. Munsell&#x27;s system, particularly the later renotations, is based on rigorous measurements of human subjects&#x27; visual responses to color, putting it on a firm experimental scientific basis. Because of this basis in human visual perception, Munsell&#x27;s system has outlasted its contemporary color models, and though it has been superseded for some uses by models such as CIELAB (&quot;L*a*b*&quot;) and CIECAM02, it is still in wide use today.

== Explanation ==
The system consists of three independent properties of color which can be represented cylindrically in three dimensions as an irregular color solid:
* &quot;hue&quot;, measured by degrees around horizontal circles
* &quot;chroma&quot;, measured radially outward from the neutral (gray) vertical axis
* &quot;value&quot;, measured vertically on the core cylinder from 0 (black) to 10 (white)
Munsell determined the spacing of colors along these dimensions by taking measurements of human visual responses. In each dimension, Munsell colors are as close to perceptually uniform as he could make them, which makes the resulting shape quite irregular. As Munsell explains:

=== Hue ===

Since the first rendition of the Munsell color system, each horizontal circle is divided into five principal &quot;hues&quot;: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple, along with 5 intermediate hues between adjacent principal hues: YR, GY, BG, PB, and RP. Despite trichromatic color being best described with 3 primary colors or 4 unique hues, Munsell chose to define his color space with 5 principal hues to keep it decimalized. Munsell describes the intermediate hues as orange, grass green, peacock blue, violet and plum, but opts to simplify the notation with the portmanteaus of the principal colors for the sake of intuition.

In later renditions, these 10 principal and intermediate colors were further subdivided into 10 steps each, so that at least 100 hues are definable. The sub-steps are numbered 1 to 10, which prepends the hue letter(s), e.g. &quot;8GY&quot;. However, further subdivisions are possible through interpolation, e.g. &quot;8.7GY&quot;. In practice, color charts conventionally specify 40 hues, in increments of 2.5, progressing as for example 10R to 2.5YR.

Two colors of equal value and chroma, on opposite sides of a hue circle, are complementary colors, and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value. The diagram below shows 40 evenly spaced Munsell hues, with complements vertically aligned. The sRGB values of the samples are provided inside each one of the squares.

=== Value ===
&quot;Value&quot;, or lightness, varies vertically along the color solid, from black (value 0) at the bottom, to white (value 10) at the top. Neutral grays lie along the vertical axis between black and white.

Several color solids before Munsell&#x27;s plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top, with a gray gradient between them, but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices. Instead, they plotted fully saturated yellow (light), and fully saturated blue and purple (dark) along the equator.

=== Chroma ===
&quot;Chroma&quot;, measured radially from the center of each slice, represents the “purity” of a color (related to saturation), with lower chroma being less pure (more washed out, as in pastels). Note that there is no intrinsic upper limit to chroma. Different areas of the color space have different maximal chroma coordinates. For instance light yellow colors have considerably more potential chroma than light purples, due to the nature of the eye and the physics of color stimuli. This led to a wide range of possible chroma levels—up to the high 30s for some hue–value combinations (though it is difficult or impossible to make physical objects in colors of such high chromas, and they cannot be reproduced on current computer displays). Vivid solid colors are in the range of approximately 8.
 

=== Specifying a color ===
A color is fully specified by listing the three numbers for hue, value, and chroma in that order. For instance, a purple of medium lightness and fairly saturated would be 5P 5/10 with 5P meaning the color in the middle of the purple hue band, 5/ meaning medium value (lightness), and a chroma of 10 (see swatch). An achromatic color is specified by the syntax . For example, a medium grey is specified by &quot;N 5/&quot;.

In computer processing, the Munsell colors are converted to a set of &quot;HVC&quot; numbers. The V and C are the same as the normal chroma and value. The H (hue) number is converted by mapping the hue rings into numbers between 0 and 100, where both 0 and 100 correspond to 10RP.

As the Munsell books, including the 1943 renotation, only contains colors for some points in the Munsell space, it is non-trivial to specify an arbitrary color in Munsell space. Interpolation must be used to assign meanings to non-book colors such as &quot;2.8Y 6.95/2.3&quot;, followed by an &quot;inversion&quot; of the fitted Munsell-to-xyY transform. The ASTM has defined a method in 2008, but Centore 2012 is known to work better.

== History and influence ==


The idea of using a three-dimensional color solid to represent all colors was developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Several different shapes for such a solid were proposed, including: a double triangular pyramid by Tobias Mayer in 1758, a single triangular pyramid by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772, a sphere by Philipp Otto Runge in 1810, a hemisphere by Michel Eugène Chevreul in 1839, a cone by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1860, a tilted cube by William Benson in 1868, and a slanted double cone by August Kirschmann in 1895. These systems became progressively more sophisticated, with Kirschmann’s even recognizing the difference in value between bright colors of different hues. But all of them remained either purely theoretical or encountered practical problems in accommodating all colors. Furthermore, none was based on any rigorous scientific measurement of human vision; before Munsell, the relationship between hue, value, and chroma was not understood.

Albert Munsell, an artist and professor of art at the Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts College of Art and Design, or MassArt), wanted to create a &quot;rational way to describe color&quot; that would use decimal notation instead of color names (which he felt were &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;), which he could use to teach his students about color. He first started work on the system in 1898 and published it in full form in &quot;A Color Notation&quot; in 1905.

The original embodiment of the system (the 1905 Atlas) had some deficiencies as a physical representation of the theoretical system. These were improved significantly in the 1929 &quot;Munsell Book of Color&quot; and through an extensive series of experiments carried out by the Optical Society of America in the 1940s resulting in the notations (sample definitions) for the modern &quot;Munsell Book of Color&quot;. Though several replacements for the Munsell system have been invented, building on Munsell&#x27;s foundational ideas—including the Optical Society of America&#x27;s Uniform Color Scales, and the International Commission on Illumination’s CIELAB (&quot;L*a*b*&quot;) and CIECAM02 color models—the Munsell system is still widely used, by, among others, ANSI to define skin color and hair color for forensic pathology, the USGS for matching soil color, in prosthodontics during the selection of tooth color for dental restorations, and breweries for matching beer color.

The original Munsell color chart remains useful for comparing computer models of human color vision.

<text>The Second Dáil () was Dáil Éireann as it convened from 16 August 1921 until 8 June 1922. From 1919 to 1922, Dáil Éireann was the revolutionary parliament of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic. The Second Dáil consisted of members elected at the 1921 elections, but with only members of Sinn Féin taking their seats. On 7 January 1922, it ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty by 64 votes to 57 which ended the War of Independence and led to the establishment of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

==1921 Election==

Since 1919, those elected for Sinn Féin at the 1918 general election had abstained from the House of Commons and established Dáil Éireann as a parliament of a self-declared Irish Republic, with members calling themselves Teachtaí Dála or TDs. In December 1920, in the middle of the Irish War of Independence, the British Government passed the Government of Ireland Act, which enacted partition by establishing two home rule parliaments in separate parts of Ireland. These provisions arose out of discussions held at the Irish Convention held in 1917, from which Sinn Féin had abstained. In May 1921 the first elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland were held, by means of the single transferable vote. On 10 May 1921, the Dáil passed a resolution that the elections scheduled to take place later in the month in both parts of the country would be &quot;regarded as elections to Dáil Éireann&quot;.

In the elections for Southern Ireland, all seats were uncontested, with Sinn Féin winning 124 of the 128 seats, and Independent Unionists winning the four seats representing the Dublin University. In the election for Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party won 40 of the 52 seats, with Sinn Féin and the Nationalist Party winning 6 seats each. Of the six seats won by Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, five were held by people who had also won seats in Southern Ireland; therefore when the Second Dáil met, there were 125 Sinn Féin TDs.

The Second Dáil responded favourably to the proposal from King George V on 22 June 1921 for a Truce, which became effective from noon on 11 July 1921. This was upheld by nearly all of the combatants while the months-long process of arranging a treaty got under way. The Truce allowed the Dáil to meet openly without fear of arrest for the first time since September 1919, when it had been banned and driven underground.

==The Treaty==

During the Second Dáil the Irish Republic and the British Government of David Lloyd George agreed to hold peace negotiations. As President of Dáil Éireann (, or literally First Minister) Éamon de Valera was the highest official in the Republic at this time but was notionally only the head of government. In August 1921, to strengthen his status in the negotiations, the Dáil amended the Dáil Constitution to grant him the title &quot;President of the Republic&quot;, and he thereby became head of state. The purpose of this change was to impress upon the British the Republican doctrine that the negotiations were between two sovereign states with delegates accredited by their respective heads of state: the British king and the Irish president.

On 14 September 1921, the Dáil ratified the appointment of Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy as envoys plenipotentiary for the peace conference in England. Of the five, Collins, Griffith and Barton were members of the cabinet. These envoys eventually signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December. Between the Truce and the signing of the Treaty the Second Dáil only sat on 10 days, and did not discuss in detail the options available to it. The debate on the Treaty started on 14 December, and continued for thirteen days of debate until 7 January 1922. On that date, the Dáil approved the treaty by 64 in favour to 57 against. The Treaty Debates were the first publicly reported debate on what Sinn Féin felt that it had achieved and could achieve. In the vote, the deputies who represented more than one constituency were each only permitted to vote once, but this would not have changed the outcome. As the leader of the anti-Treaty minority de Valera resigned as president. He allowed himself to be nominated again, but was defeated on a vote of 60–58. He was succeeded as president by Arthur Griffith. The anti-Treaty deputies continued to attend the Dáil, with de Valera becoming the first Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil.

The ratification specified by the Treaty was by &quot;a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland&quot;. The Dáil vote did not fulfil this because four unionists were absent and one Northern Ireland member was present. The requisite approval came at a separate meeting on 14 January 1922 attended by the unionists and boycotted by anti-Treaty TDs. The meeting on 14 January also approved a Provisional Government led by Collins, which ran in parallel to Griffith&#x27;s Dáil government and with overlapping membership. This meeting was not of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland itself, but merely of &quot;the members elected to sit in&quot; it. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 required the Commons to be summoned by the Lord Lieutenant and its members to take an oath of allegiance to the king, whereas the meeting on 14 January was summoned by Griffith and the members present did not take an oath.

==Supersession and Republican continuation==

Under the terms of the Treaty, a Constituent Assembly was to be elected to draft a Constitution for the Irish Free State to take effect by 6 December 1922. The assembly would also serve as a &quot;Provisional Parliament&quot; to hold the Provisional Government responsible. This election was held on 16 June pursuant to both a resolution by the Second Dáil on 20 May and a proclamation by the Provisional Government on 27 May. The Dáil resolution also approved a pact agreed by Collins and de Valera in a vain attempt to prevent the Treaty split leading to Civil War. The pact was to have at the election &quot;a National Coalition Panel for this Third Dáil, representing both Parties in the Dáil, and in the Sinn Féin Organisation&quot;. On 8 June 1922, the Second Dáil &quot;adjourned to Friday, 30th June, 1922&quot;. The pact negotiators envisaged that the Second Dáil would meet on 30 June and formally appoint the Third Dáil as its successor. The Provisional Government proclamation called for an election &quot;pursuant to the provisions of&quot; the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922 (passed by the Westminster Parliament in April) and naming 1 July 1922 for the first meeting of the Provisional Parliament. The outbreak of Civil War hostilities on 28 June meant the 30 June meeting did not happen and the 1 July meeting was repeatedly postponed by the Provisional Government until 9 September. By then, Collins and Griffith were dead and the Dáil government and Provisional Government had been merged under William T. Cosgrave. The preamble to the 9 September meeting cited the 27 May proclamation but not the 20 May resolution. On 6 December the Constitution and Free State came into effect, the Provisional Government became the Free State&#x27;s Executive Council and the Provisional Parliament became the lower house of the Free State&#x27;s Oireachtas (parliament). The Civil War lasted until May 1923.

De Valera during the Civil War, and other republican theorists in later years, argued that the Second Dáil remained in existence as the legitimate parliament of a continuing Irish Republic. Whereas, in the Westminster system, a dissolution of parliament always precedes a general election and terminates the term of the existing parliament and the next meeting of newly elected members is considered to be the start of a new parliament, this convention was explicitly broken by the transition from the First Dáil to the Second Dáil (which effectively opted for the Continental European system where the term of the old Parliament continues all the way until the first meeting of the new one, albeit without adopting the Continental European nomenclature that a dissolution merely triggers a snap election without ending the old Parliament&#x27;s term), and implicitly by the transition provisions agreed in May–June 1922. In both cases, TDs wanted to guard against a breach in continuity which would happen if the old Dáil had been dissolved but the envisaged election then failed to occur because of a deteriorating security situation. The fact that no explicit transfer of authority took place allowed republicans to claim the Second Dáil remained in existence and that the new constituent assembly/provisional parliament was illegitimate and its name &quot;Third Dáil&quot; a misnomer. If the Third Dáil was illegitimate, then so was the Free State constitution enacted by it, and the Free State itself. On this basis anti-Treaty TDs abstained from taking seats in the Third Dáil. A few symbolic secret meetings of the continuing &quot;Second Dáil&quot; were attended by anti-Treaty TDs, the first in October 1922 appointing a republican government under de Valera. In 1924 de Valera formed Comhairle na dTeachtaí to replenish the diminishing numbers of Second-Dáil TDs elected in 1921 with Sinn Féin abstentionists returned at the general elections of 1922 and of 1923. T. Ryle Dwyer characterised this as recognising the Second Dáil as the de jure authority, Comhairle na dTeachtai as the &quot;de jure de facto&quot; authority, and the Free State Oireachtas as the &quot;de facto de facto&quot; authority.

In 1925 an anti-Treaty IRA convention withdrew its allegiance from the republican government to its own Army Council. Second Dáil TDs had taken an oath of fidelity to the Irish Republic, and Sinn Féin regarded those who implicitly or explicitly endorsed the Treaty or Free State constitution as having violated this oath and thereby vacated their seats. In 1926 de Valera founded Fianna Fáil to take a more pragmatic opposition than Sinn Féin to the Free State, and the following year the party abandoned abstentionism by entering the Free State Dáil. Fianna Fáil TD Seán Lemass famously described it in March 1928 as &quot;a slightly constitutional party&quot;. De Valera came to power in 1932 and in 1937 proposed a new Constitution which was adopted by plebiscite, removing to his own satisfaction any remaining reservations about the state&#x27;s legitimacy. In December 1938, seven of those elected in 1921 who continued to regard the Second Dáil as the last legitimate Dáil assembly, and that all other surviving members had disqualified themselves by taking the oath of allegiance, gathered at a meeting with the IRA Army Council under Seán Russell, and signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of Dáil Éireann to the Army Council until such a time as a new Dáil could once again be democratically elected by all the people of Ireland in all 32 counties. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. Official Sinn Féin in 1969–70 and Provisional Sinn Féin in 1986 abandoned abstentionism and began a gradual recognition of the legitimacy of the modern Irish state; the smaller Republican Sinn Féin retains the view that the Second Dáil was the last legitimate Irish legislature.

<text>John Christian Watson (born Johan Cristian Tanck; 9 April 186718 November 1941) was an Australian politician who served as the third prime minister of Australia from April to August 1904. He held office as the inaugural federal leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1901 to 1907 and was the first member of the party to serve as prime minister.

Watson was born in Valparaíso, Chile, the son of a German Chilean seaman. He grew up on the South Island of New Zealand, taking the surname of his step-father when his Irish-born mother remarried. He left school at a young age, working in the printing industry as a compositor. Watson moved to Sydney in 1886 and became prominent in the local labour movement. He helped establish the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales and directed the party&#x27;s campaign at the 1891 general election. Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1894 election, aged 27, and quickly became a leading figure in the ALP. He and most party members opposed Federation on the grounds that the proposed constitution was undemocratic.

In 1901, Watson was elected to the House of Representatives at the inaugural federal election. He became a founding member of the ALP caucus in federal parliament and was elected as the party&#x27;s inaugural leader. During the first term of parliament he supported the Liberal Protectionist governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin, and was a strong supporter of the White Australia policy. At the 1903 election, the ALP secured the balance of power in the House and a strong position in the Senate. Watson formed a minority government in April 1904, aged 37, after the ALP withdrew its support from Deakin. He was one of the first socialists to head a government in a parliamentary system, attracting international attention, and remains Australia&#x27;s youngest prime minister.

After less than four months in office, the Watson government lost a confidence motion and Watson was succeeded as prime minister by anti-socialist George Reid. He was leader of the opposition until 1905, when he helped reinstall Deakin as prime minister. The ALP continued to offer its support to Deakin after the 1906 election, despite the opposition of some in the party. Watson resigned the party&#x27;s leadership in 1907, citing family concerns, and left parliament at the 1910 election. He was expelled from the ALP during the 1916 split over conscription and became a Nationalist, although he never again stood for public office. He subsequently had a successful business career, including as president of the NRMA and chairman of Ampol.

While Watson did not succeed in passing legislation while in office, his term as prime minister is seen as significant as a demonstration that the ALP could form a competent government. His successor as party leader Andrew Fisher would lead the ALP to a majority government at the 1910 election, in which many of Watson&#x27;s ministers played a key role.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Watson was born Johan Cristian Tanck on 9 April 1867 in Valparaíso, Chile. He was the only child of Martha (née Minchin) and Johan Cristian Tanck, senior. His father was also born in Valparaíso, a German Chilean whose ancestors had emigrated from the Kingdom of Hanover and established an import–export firm. He worked as a merchant seaman, possibly a ship&#x27;s carpenter, on trade routes across the Pacific. He arrived in New Zealand aboard &quot;La Joven Julia&quot; on 24 December 1865 and married Martha Minchin in Port Chalmers less than a month later, on 19 January 1866. Their marriage was later registered at Valparaíso&#x27;s Iglesia de la Matriz. Watson&#x27;s mother was born in County Tipperary, Ireland, and was 16 years old at the time of her marriage to Tanck. She joined him on board the &quot;Julia&quot;, which eventually returned to Chile and docked in Valparaíso a few days before Watson&#x27;s birth. In the months after his birth the ship worked a regular route carrying timber between Valparaíso and Chiloé Island.

In 1868, Watson moved to New Zealand with his mother, returning to her family on the South Island. The fate of his father is uncertain, as no records of his death have been found. On 15 February 1869, his mother married George Thomas Watson at the registry office in Waipori, describing herself as a widow. Her second husband was a 30-year-old miner born in Ballymoney, Ireland, who had come to New Zealand after several years working in Scotland. Watson came to have nine half-siblings from his mother&#x27;s second marriage, born between 1869 and 1887. He was treated as the biological child of George Watson, adopting his step-father&#x27;s surname; his given names were also anglicised.

As an adult, Watson gave incorrect and contradictory information about the circumstances of his birth and the identity of his parents. He allowed some biographical profiles to list him as born in New Zealand, while his second wife and daughter understood that he had been born to British parents in international waters outside Valparaíso. On legal documents he listed George Watson as his biological father and provided an incorrect maiden name for his mother. Watson&#x27;s biographers have suggested he may have originally concealed his background for convenience, but later deliberately did so for political reasons, including concerns over parliamentary eligibility and possible xenophobia. Birth overseas to a non-British father would have made him an alien ineligible for election to federal parliament under section 44(i) of the constitution.

===Childhood and move to Australia===
Watson attended the state school in Oamaru, North Otago, New Zealand until ten years of age when he left to become a rail nipper. Then after a period of helping on the family farm, at thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a compositor at &quot;The North Otago Times&quot;, a newspaper run by prominent reformist politician William Steward, with the public affairs exposure augmenting his minor formal schooling. Following the death of his mother and the loss of his job, he migrated to Sydney in 1886 at nineteen years of age. He worked for a month as a stablehand at Government House, then found employment as a compositor for a number of newspapers including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Australian Star&quot;. Through this proximity to newspapers, books and writers he furthered his education and developed an interest in politics and became active in the printing union. He married Ada Jane Low, a British-born Sydney seamstress, at the Unitarian Church on Liverpool Street in Sydney on 27 November 1889.

==Colonial parliament==
In the months prior to the 1891 New South Wales colonial election, Watson was a founding member of the Labour Electoral League of New South Wales which stemmed from the nascent Australian labour movement and would later develop into the Australian Labour (later Labor) Party. In the election, Labour won the balance of power and provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority government led by Premier George Dibbs which brought down the incumbent majority government of the Free Trade Party led by Premier Henry Parkes. Watson was an active trade unionist, and became vice-president of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council in January 1892. In June 1892, he settled a dispute between the Trades and Labour Council and the Labour Party and as a result became the president of the council and chairman of the party. In 1893 and 1894, he worked hard to resolve the debate over the solidarity pledge and established the Labour Party&#x27;s basic practices, including the sovereignty of the party conference, caucus solidarity, the pledge required of parliamentarians and the powerful role of the extra-parliamentary executive. At the 1894 colonial election which saw the defeat of the Protectionist Party government, Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the country seat of Young.

At the 1895 colonial election the incumbent Free Trade Party minority government led by Premier George Reid increased their support but remained several seats short of a majority. Labour at this time had a policy of &quot;support in return for concessions&quot;, and Watson voted with his colleagues to strategically provide such legislative support to the incumbent government. Following the 1898 colonial election, despite a significant swing against the incumbent government, Watson and Labour leader James McGowen decided to allow the incumbent government to remain so that it could complete the work of establishing the Federation of Australia.

==Federation==
Watson was involved in shaping party policy regarding the movement for Federation from 1895, and was one of ten Labour candidates nominated for the Australasian Federal Convention on 4 March 1897, but none of these candidates managed to be elected. The party endorsed Federation, but nevertheless most leading party figures viewed the draft Commonwealth Constitution as undemocratic, and believed that the Senate as proposed was much too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist Colonial state upper houses and the UK House of Lords. When the draft was submitted to a referendum on 3 June 1898, Labour opposed it, with Watson prominent in the campaign, and saw the referendum rejected.

Watson was devoted to the idea of the referendum as an ideal feature of democracy. To ensure that Reid might finally bring New South Wales into national union on an amended draft constitution, Watson helped to negotiate a deal, involving the party executive, that included the nomination of four Labour members to the New South Wales Legislative Council.

At the March 1899 annual party conference, Billy Hughes and Holman moved to have those arrangements nullified and party policy on Federation changed, thus thwarting Reid&#x27;s plans. Although rarely known to resort to anger, on this occasion Watson &#x27;jumped to his feet in a most excited manner and in heated tones ... contended ... that they should not interfere with the referendum&#x27;. The motion was lost and the four party men were nominated to the council on 4 April. The bill approving the second referendum, to be held on 20 June 1899, was passed on 20 April.

Labour leaders, including Watson opposed the final terms of the Commonwealth Constitution. Nonetheless, they could not stop it from going ahead, and Watson, unlike Holman and Hughes, believed that it should be submitted to the people. Nevertheless, Watson joined all but two of the Labour parliamentarians in campaigning against the &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote at the referendum. When the Constitution was accepted, he agreed that &#x27;the mandate of the majority will have to be obeyed&#x27;.

==Federal parliament==

Watson was elected to the new federal Parliament of Australia at the inaugural 1901 federal election, representing the rural House of Representatives rural seat of Bland.

Watson arrived in Melbourne, which at the time served as the temporary seat of government, in May 1901. Watson was elected the first leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party (usually known as the Caucus) on 8 May 1901, the day before the opening of the parliament.

Watson pursued the same policy as Labor had done in New South Wales, where Labor was the smallest of the three parties but held the balance of power. Under Watson, Labor provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin in exchange for legislation enacting the Labour platform, such as the immensely popular White Australia policy which left the free Trade Party led by George Reid to form the opposition.

Watson, as a Labor moderate, genuinely admired Deakin and shared his liberal views on many subjects. Deakin reciprocated this sentiment. Deakin wrote in one of his anonymous articles in a London newspaper that &quot;The Labour section has much cause for gratitude to Mr Watson, the leader whose tact and judgement have enabled it to achieve many of its Parliamentary successes.&quot;

===White Australia===
Watson was a white nationalist and white supremacist who played a key role in the creation of the White Australia policy. According to , the &quot;ideal of a white Australia stood at the centre of Watson&#x27;s political ideology, a touchstone of Australian identity that Watson repeatedly stressed in interviews, speeches and articles&quot;. However, some of his biographers have noted that his racial views were widespread among Australians at the time and that all three major parties supported White Australia.

During the debate over what became the &quot;Immigration Restriction Act 1901&quot;, Watson stated that the issue of racial purity was &quot;the larger and more important one&quot; for the passage of the bill, where some speakers had emphasised concerns over the economic impact of cheap foreign labour. He opposed the government&#x27;s dictation test provision on the grounds that it could be easily circumvented, and that &quot;education does not eliminate the objectionable qualities of the Baboo Hindoo&quot;. He instead sought to explicitly ban any Asian or African from entering Australia. During the same debate he spoke of &quot;racial contamination&quot; and referred to Chinese people using a racial slur, rhetorically asking &quot;whether we would desire that our sisters or our brothers should be married into any of these races to which we object&quot;. In 1905, Watson drafted a new plank for the ALP platform calling for &quot;an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity&quot;. He successfully moved for its adoption at both state and federal conferences, stating that the party should &quot;cleanse their own doorstep with the hope that thus the street would be cleansed&quot;.

==Prime Minister in 1904==
Labour under Watson doubled their vote at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power despite all three parties holding about the same number of seats. In April 1904, however, Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Reid declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour Prime Minister of Australia, the world&#x27;s first Labour head of government at a national level (Anderson Dawson had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), indeed the world&#x27;s first socialist or social democratic government at a national level. He was aged only 37, and remains the youngest prime minister in Australia&#x27;s history.

Billy Hughes later recalled the first meeting of the Labour Cabinet with characteristic sharp wit:


Despite the apparent fitness of the new prime minister for his role, the government hung on the fine thread of Deakin&#x27;s promise of &#x27;fair play&#x27;. The triumph of the historic first Australian Labour government was a qualified one – Labour did not have the numbers to implement key policies. The &#x27;three elevens&#x27; – the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election – dogged Watson just as it had Deakin.

Six bills were enacted during Watson&#x27;s brief government. All but one – an amended &quot;Acts Interpretation Act 1904&quot; – were supply bills. The most significant legislative achievement of the Watson government was the advancement of the troublesome Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Another accomplishment was the appointing of a Royal Commission on a Bill related to Navigation and Shipping, whose report (presented a couple of years later) led to &quot;major redrafting of the Navigation Act&quot; and improvements in conditions for Australian seamen. Once he became the Prime Minister Watson recognised the limitations of his position in the Labour caucus and endorsed the concept of a deputy leader. Andrew Fisher won the position by one vote over the more dynamic Billy Hughes.

==Defeat and final years as leader==

Although Watson sought a dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held, the Governor-General Lord Northcote refused. Unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives, Watson resigned the premiership less than four months after taking office, his term ending on 18 August 1904 (Deakin was later defeated on a similar bill). Reid became prime minister and four months later his government managed to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after compromising to extend the scope to state public servants as Watson had proposed.

Deakin again became prime minister after Reid lost confidence of the parliament in July 1905. Watson led Labour to the 1906 federal election and improved their position again. At this election the seat of Bland was abolished, so he shifted to the seat of South Sydney. But in October 1907, recognising his work for the foundation of the parliamentary party was complete and also due to fatigue and concern over the health of his wife Ada, he resigned the Labour leadership in favour of Andrew Fisher.

From August 1906, Watson was an early influential supporter of Canberra, as the site of the national capital.

Watson retired from politics, aged only 42, prior to the 1910 federal election, at which Labour won with 50 percent of the primary vote. It was the first time a party had been elected to majority government in the House of Representatives, it was also the first time a party won a Senate majority, and it was the world&#x27;s first Labour Party majority government at a national level. The ALP vote had risen rapidly, going from 15 percent against two larger and more established parties in 1901, to 50 percent in 1910, after a majority of the Protectionist Party merged with the Anti-Socialist Party, creating the Commonwealth Liberal Party which received 45 percent.

==Later life==
===Political activities===
In the Australian Labor Party split of 1916, numerous Labor MPs were expelled from the party for supporting World War I conscription in Australia. Watson sided with ex-Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the conscriptionists and had his party membership terminated as a result. Watson remained active in the affairs of Hughes&#x27; Nationalist Party until 1922, but after that he drifted out of politics altogether.

In 1931 he was state president of the Australian Industries Protection League and supported the Scullin government&#x27;s high-tariff policies.

===Business activities===

In December 1910, Watson was recruited by a syndicate of Sydney businessmen to lead a gold-seeking expedition in South Africa. He also engaged in land speculation in Sutherland, but development did not occur rapidly enough. He was appointed as a director of Labor Papers Limited, the publisher of the AWU&#x27;s official newspaper &quot;The Australian Worker&quot;.

Watson joined the council of the newly established National Roads Association (NRA) in March 1920, and in August was elected as the association&#x27;s inaugural president. The NRA was intended as a peak body for New South Wales motorists, lobbying the state government to create a Main Roads Board and borrow money to improve local highways. It was initially hampered by its small membership and lack of financial resources, with a budget of only £15 per week. Watson was able to attract publicity through the launch of a magazine and a successful campaign to raise speed limits. He was again chosen as president in 1923 when the NRA was reorganised into the NRMA, and would retain the position for the rest of his life. By the end of the following year the organisation had grown from 550 to 5,000 members. It subsequently expanded into vehicle insurance and motor touring, acquiring a series of properties for camping. As well as his involvement with the NRMA, Watson also was a director of a taxi company, Yellow Cabs of Australia, and as chairman of the state government&#x27;s Traffic Advisory Committee. In 1936, he became the inaugural chairman of petrol retailer Ampol.

==Personal life==
Watson&#x27;s first wife Ada died in 1921. On 30 October 1925 he married Antonia Mary Gladys Dowlan in the same church as his first wedding. She was a 23-year-old waitress from Western Australia whom he had met when she served his table at a Sydney club. In 1927, they had one daughter, Jacqueline Dunn née Watson.

Watson and his second wife moved to a villa in Double Bay in 1934. In retirement he became a keen bridge player and was also a regular attendee at Randwick Racecourse and the Sydney Cricket Ground, serving on the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. He visited the United States for business reasons and also returned to New Zealand on a number of occasions in a private capacity. After several weeks of ill health, Watson died at his home in Double Bay on 18 November 1941, aged 74. He was granted a state funeral at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, with Joseph Cook, Albert Gardiner, John Curtin and William McKell serving as pallbearers. His ashes were interred at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.

==Evaluation and honours==

According to Percival Serle, Watson &quot;left a much greater impression on his time than this would suggest. He came at the right moment for his party, and nothing could have done it more good than the sincerity, courtesy and moderation which he always showed as a leader&quot;. Alfred Deakin wrote of Watson: &quot;The Labour section has much cause for gratitude to Mr Watson, the leader whose tact and judgement have enabled it to achieve many of its Parliamentary successes&quot;.

In April 2004 the Labor Party marked the centenary of the Watson government with a series of public events in Canberra and Melbourne, attended by then party leader Mark Latham and former ALP Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Watson&#x27;s daughter, Jacqueline Dunn, 77, was guest of honour at these functions. The Canberra suburb Watson and the federal electorate of Watson are named after him. In 1969 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.

<text>Emanuel Theodore Bronner (born Emanuel Heilbronner; February 1, 1908 – March 7, 1997) was the founder of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps. He used product labels to promote his moral and religious ideas, including a belief in the goodness and unity of humanity.

== History ==
Bronner was born in Heilbronn, Germany, to the Heilbronner family of soap makers. He emigrated to the United States in 1929, dropping &quot;Heil&quot; from his name due to its association with Nazism. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1936. As his family was Jewish, he pleaded with his parents to emigrate with him for fear of the then-ascendant Nazi Party, but they refused. His last contact with his parents was in the form of a censored postcard saying, &quot;You were right. —Your loving father.&quot; His parents were murdered in the Holocaust.

== Career ==
He started his business making products such as castile soap by hand in his home. The product labels are crowded with statements of Bronner&#x27;s philosophy, which he called &quot;All-One-God-Faith&quot; and the &quot;Moral ABC&quot;, both of which he included on the label of every soap bottle he produced. Many of Bronner&#x27;s references came from Jewish and Christian sources, such as the Shema and the Beatitudes; others from writers such as Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Paine. On his labels, he referred to the Jewish sage Hillel the Elder as &quot;Rabbi Hillel&quot; and to Jesus Christ as &quot;Rabbi Jesus.&quot; The labels became famous for their idiosyncratic style, including hyphens to join long strings of words and the liberal use of exclamation marks.

In 1946, while promoting his &quot;Moral ABC&quot; at the University of Chicago, Bronner was arrested for refusing to leave the dean&#x27;s office, despite the fact he was invited to the campus to lecture by a local student group, and then was committed to the Elgin Mental Health Center, a mental hospital in Elgin, Illinois, from which he escaped after shock treatments. Bronner believed those shock treatments brought about his eventual blindness.

After escaping from Elgin, Bronner hitch-hiked to Los Angeles, California. Over time Bronner started a family and eventually settled in Escondido, California, where his soap-making operation grew into a small factory. At his death in 1997, it produced more than a million bottles of soap and other products per year, but was still not mechanized. The firm has been the subject of many published articles and has supported many charitable causes.

==Legacy==
After Bronner&#x27;s death, his family has continued to run the business. His grandson David Bronner is currently CEO.

His life was the subject of a 2007 documentary film, &quot;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soapbox&quot;, which premiered on the Sundance TV channel, on 3 July 2007.

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has a ship, the , donated by the soap company.

<text>John Curtin (8 January 1885 – 5 July 1945) was an Australian politician who served as the 14th prime minister of Australia from 1941 until his death in 1945. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), having been most notable for leading the country through the majority of World War II, including all but the last few weeks of the war in the Pacific. Curtin&#x27;s leadership skills and personal character were acclaimed by his political contemporaries, and he is frequently ranked as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest prime ministers and political leaders.

Curtin left school at the age of 13 and became involved in the labour movement in Melbourne. He joined the Labor Party at a young age and was also involved with the Victorian Socialist Party. He became state secretary of the Timberworkers&#x27; Union in 1911 and federal president in 1914. Curtin was a leader of the &quot;No&quot; campaign during the 1916 referendum on overseas conscription, and was briefly jailed for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination. He moved to Perth the following year to become the editor of the &quot;Westralian Worker&quot;, and later was state president of the Australian Journalists&#x27; Association.

After three unsuccessful attempts, Curtin was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1928 federal election, winning the Division of Fremantle. He is the only prime minister to have represented a constituency in Western Australia. He remained loyal to the Labor government during the party split of 1931. He lost his seat in Labor&#x27;s landslide defeat at the 1931 election, but won it back in 1934. The following year, Curtin was elected party leader in place of James Scullin, defeating Frank Forde by a single vote. The party gained seats at the 1937 and 1940 elections, with the latter resulting in a hung parliament. The ALP eventually formed a minority government in October 1941, when the Fadden government lost a confidence motion.

The Japanese attacks on British Malaya and Pearl Harbor occurred two months after Curtin became prime minister, and Australia entered the war against Japan. Bombing raids on northern Australia soon followed. Curtin led the nation&#x27;s war effort and made significant decisions about how the war was conducted. He placed Australian forces under the command of the American general Douglas MacArthur, with whom he formed a close relationship, and successfully negotiated the issue of overseas conscription that had split his party during World War I. The ALP won almost two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives at the 1943 election, which remains a party record. Curtin died in office in July 1945, after months of ill health attributed to the stresses of the war. Many of his post-war reconstruction plans were implemented by his successor Ben Chifley, who in 1946 led the ALP to consecutive victories for the first time.

==Early life and education==
===Birth and family background===
Curtin was born in Creswick, Victoria, on 8 January 1885. He was christened &quot;John Joseph Ambrose&quot;, although his middle names were not recorded on his birth certificate and he stopped using them in later life. Within his family he was known as &quot;Jack&quot;. Curtin was the oldest of four children – his younger brother George was born in 1887, followed by his younger sisters Molly and Hannah in 1889 and 1891. His parents were both born in County Cork, Ireland. His father, John Curtin Sr., had arrived in South Australia in 1873, with two of his brothers. His brothers settled in Adelaide, but he moved on to Victoria and found work as a warder at Pentridge Prison. He later joined the Victoria Police, where in thirteen years he never rose above the rank of a constable; he received reprimands for indecent assault and using excessive force against children. In 1883, he married Catherine Agnes Bourke (known as &quot;Kate&quot;), who had arrived in Melbourne in 1875. She was the sister of one of his police colleagues.

===Childhood and education===

Curtin was born with congenital strabismus of the left eye, which remained noticeable throughout his life. It was largely a cosmetic defect, but he was quite self-conscious about it. According to his biographer David Day, it had &quot;a considerable psychological effect&quot; on him, and likely exacerbated his natural shyness. Curtin lived in Creswick until 1890, when his father retired from the police. His father suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis and syphilis, and was assessed as medically unable to resume his police duties. He was offered a choice between an annual pension and a lump-sum pay-out, and opted for the latter. He subsequently moved his family to inner Melbourne, taking over the lease of a pub on Little Lonsdale Street and moving into rented accommodation in Brunswick.

Curtin began his education at St Francis&#x27; Boys School, a Christian Brothers school attached to St Francis&#x27; Church. He later briefly attended St Bridget&#x27;s School in Fitzroy. He also attended Macedon Primary School in Macedon. In 1894, Curtin and his family moved to Charlton, a small country town in north-west Victoria. His father had failed to prosper in Melbourne, which was in the middle of an economic downturn. In Charlton, he took over the lease of a pub owned by his brother-in-law, John Bourke. Curtin was enrolled in the local state school, as a Catholic school had not yet been established. He excelled academically, and was seen as a potential &quot;scholarship boy&quot;. However, he and his family left Charlton in 1896. Struggling financially, they spent the following two years moving around country Victoria, as his father managed pubs in Dromana, Drouin, and Mount Macedon. Curtin attended the local state schools, ending his formal education in 1898 at the age of 13.

===Early working life===
In early 1899, Curtin began working as an office boy at a weekly magazine called &quot;The Rambler&quot;, earning five shillings per week. His employer was the artist and writer Norman Lindsay, who had also grown up in Creswick and knew his family. The magazine did not last long, and over the following years Curtin held down a series of short-term jobs, including as a copy boy at &quot;The Age&quot;, a potter&#x27;s apprentice, and a houseboy at a gentlemen&#x27;s club. These were interspersed with periods of unemployment. He did not secure a permanent job until he was 18, taking up a position as an estimates clerk with the Titan Manufacturing Company in South Melbourne in September 1903. By that time he was the family&#x27;s primary breadwinner, as his father was a virtual invalid.

As a youth, Curtin was a talented sportsman. Between 1903 and 1907, he played as a half-forward flanker for the Brunswick Football Club in the semi-professional Victorian Football Association (VFA). His teammates gave him the nickname &quot;Bumble&quot;. His nephew Claude played for Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Curtin also played cricket for the Brunswick Cricket Club, where he had a reputation as a solid batsman. He remained involved in both sports throughout the remainder of his life, as an administrator and supporter. He was said to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of cricket statistics.

=== Political views ===

From a young age, Curtin was active in both the Australian Labor Party and the Victorian Socialist Party, which was a Marxist organisation. While a member of the Victorian Socialist Party Curtin held strong anti-imperialist and anti-militarist views, and in opposition to the mainstream of the Labor movement, opposed racism due to his belief that racial hatred was used as a tool of the &quot;exploiting class&quot;. Labor historian Graeme Osborne describes Curtin&#x27;s stance as &quot;anticipating Lenin in the view that imperialism was capitalism in its last stage&quot;.

He wrote for radical and socialist newspapers. From 1911 until 1915, Curtin was employed as state secretary of the Timberworkers&#x27; Union. He was elected federal president of the union in 1914. During World War I he was a militant anti-conscriptionist; he was briefly imprisoned in December 1916 for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination, even though he knew he would fail the exam due to his very poor eyesight. He also stood (unsuccessfully) as the Labor candidate for Balaclava in the 1914 federal election. The strain of this period led him to drink heavily and regularly, a vice which blighted his career for many years. He proposed to Elsie Needham on St Kilda Beach, and they were married on 21 April 1917 in the dining room of a private home in West Leederville.

Curtin moved to Perth, Western Australia, in 1917 to become an editor for the &quot;Westralian Worker&quot;, the official trade union newspaper. He settled in the suburb of Cottesloe where his residence is now heritage-listed as &quot;John Curtin&#x27;s House&quot;. He enjoyed the less pressured life of Western Australia and his political views gradually moderated. He joined the Australian Journalists&#x27; Association (AJA) in 1917 and was elected its Western Australian President in 1920. He wore his AJA badge (WA membership #56) every day he was prime minister. In addition to his stance on labour rights, Curtin was also a strong advocate for the rights of women and children. In 1927, the Federal Government convened a Royal Commission on Child Endowment, and Curtin was appointed as a member of that commission.

==Early political career==

Curtin stood for Parliament a second time in 1925, this time for Fremantle, although he lost heavily to the incumbent William Watson. Watson retired in 1928, and Curtin ran again, this time winning on the second count. Re-elected in Labor&#x27;s sweeping election victory the following year, he expected to be named as a member of Prime Minister James Scullin&#x27;s Cabinet, but disapproval of his heavy drinking habit meant that he remained on the backbench. William Watson chose to briefly come out of retirement in 1931, and easily defeated Curtin in an election that saw Labor collapse to just 14 seats in Parliament. After the loss, Curtin became the advocate for the Western Australian Government with the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He stood for his old seat in 1934 after Watson announced his retirement for the second time, and was able to win it back.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
In 1935, when Scullin resigned as Labor Leader, Curtin stood in the election to replace him, although he was not expected to win. His opponent was Frank Forde, the deputy leader of the party since 1931 who had been closely associated with the economic policies of the Scullin government. This led left wing factions and trade unions to support Curtin, in an attempt to block Forde from getting the leadership. With their support, Curtin was able to defeat Forde by just one vote to become Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition. The groups that had supported Curtin did so on the basis that he promise to give up alcohol, which he subsequently did. Although Labor made little progress at the 1937 election, by 1939 Labor&#x27;s position had vastly improved. Curtin led Labor to a five-seat swing in the 1940 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. In that election, Curtin&#x27;s own seat of Fremantle had been in doubt. United Australia Party challenger Frederick Lee appeared to have won the seat on the second count after most of independent Guildford Clarke&#x27;s preferences flowed to him, and it was not until the final counting of preferential votes that Curtin knew he had won the seat.

In September 1939, the Second World War commenced when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. In line with the king&#x27;s declaration of war, Prime Minister Robert Menzies declared war on Germany and announced Australia&#x27;s support for the British war effort. In 1941, Menzies travelled to Britain to discuss Australia&#x27;s role in the war strategy, and to express concern at the reliability of Singapore&#x27;s defences, only to be drawn into Winston Churchill&#x27;s disastrous Greek campaign. While he was in Britain, Menzies lost the support of his own party, and was forced to resign as prime minister. The Coalition elected Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party, as Menzies&#x27; replacement, even though the UAP was the senior partner in the Coalition. Curtin adroitly refused calls from his own caucus to bring about the defeat of the government through a motion of no confidence.

==Prime minister==
Curtin had refused Menzies&#x27; initial offer to form a wartime &quot;national government&quot;, partly because he feared that it would split the Labor Party, although he did agree to join the Advisory War Council. In October 1941, Arthur Coles and Alexander Wilson, the two independent MPs who had been keeping the Coalition in office since 1940 (first under Menzies, then under Fadden), joined forces with Labor in defeating Fadden&#x27;s budget and bringing the government down. Governor-General Lord Gowrie was reluctant to call an election for a Parliament barely a year old, especially given the international situation. He summoned Coles and Wilson and made them promise that if he named Curtin prime minister, they would support him for the remainder of the Parliament to end the instability in government. The independents agreed, and Curtin was sworn in as prime minister on 7 October, aged 56. He became the first and only prime minister to come from Western Australia.

=== War in the Pacific ===

On 8 December 1941, the Pacific War broke out when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Curtin addressed the nation on the radio, saying, &quot;Men and women of Australia...we are at war with Japan. This is the gravest hour of our history. We Australians have imperishable traditions. We shall maintain them. We shall vindicate them. We shall hold this country and keep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place where civilisation will persist.&quot; On 10 December, and were both sunk by Japanese bombers off the Malayan coast. Curtin cabled the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Churchill on 23 December, saying, &quot;The fall of Singapore would mean the isolation of the Philippines, the fall of the Netherlands East Indies and attempts to smother all other bases. It is in your power to meet the situation... we would gladly accept United States commanders in the Pacific area. Please consider this as a matter of urgency.&quot;

Curtin made crucial decisions linking Australia to the United States. On 28 December, the Sydney &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; published a public statement of his government&#x27;s new attitude:

This speech was one of the most important in Australia&#x27;s history, marking a turning point in Australia&#x27;s relationship with its founding country, the United Kingdom. Many felt that Prime Minister Curtin was abandoning Australia&#x27;s traditional ties to the British Isles without any solid partnership in place with the United States. This speech also received criticism at high levels of government in Australia, Britain and the US; it angered Churchill, and Roosevelt said that it &quot;smacked of panic&quot;. The speech nevertheless achieved the effect of drawing attention to the possibility that Australia would be invaded by Japan. Before this speech, the Australian response to the war effort had been troubled by attitudes swinging from &quot;she&#x27;ll be right&quot; to gossip-driven panic. By 1943, when the threat of Japanese invasion had passed, Curtin increasingly returned to a commitment to the British Empire. Downplaying nationalism, he said that Australia comprised &quot;seven million Britishers&quot;. He saw the United States as a predatory economic and military power that would threaten Australia&#x27;s own ambitions in the Pacific. Australia moved closer to New Zealand, and suggested a lesser role for the United States after the war. Washington was annoyed.

Concurrently, the Curtin government enacted the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, under which Australia accepted the dominion status which Britain had conferred in 1930, but which the Australian federal government had not accepted until then. The Adoption Act took effect retroactively as of 3 September 1939, the outbreak of World War II. Although politically a product of the government&#x27;s policy of re-orientation towards the United States, constitutionally, this marked the moment that Australia became an independent nation with a separate Crown, no longer subject to the supremacy of British law and the British Crown.

===Military policies===

The Curtin government agreed that the Australian Army&#x27;s I Corps – centred on the 6th and 7th Divisions – would be transferred from North Africa to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command in the Netherlands East Indies for the defence of Java and Sumatra. Before they could arrive, Singapore fell on 15 February 1942. Most of the 8th Division was taken into captivity, although a small number, including its commander, Major General Gordon Bennett, managed to escape. &quot;The fall of Singapore&quot;, Curtin announced in a radio address to the nation on 16 February, &quot;can only be described as Australia&#x27;s Dunkirk. It will be recalled that the fall of Dunkirk initiated the Battle for Britain. The fall of Singapore opens the Battle for Australia. On its issue depends not merely the fate of this Commonwealth but the frontier of the United States of America and, indeed, all the Americas and, therefore, in a large measure the fate of the British-speaking world.&quot;

The Japanese threat was further underlined on 19 February, when Japan bombed Darwin, the first of many air raids on northern Australia. Churchill attempted to divert I Corps to reinforce British troops in Burma, without Australian approval. Curtin insisted that it return to Australia. Roosevelt supported Churchill, offering to send an American division to Australia instead, while the Chief of the Australian General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, threatened to resign if his advice was ignored and the troops were diverted to Burma. Curtin prevailed, although he agreed that the main body of the 6th Division could garrison Ceylon.

In the 1943 Australian federal election campaign the following year, Curtin was forced to publicly defend his decision. &quot;Had we held Rangoon, or had we even held the district, of Akyab&quot;, media magnate Keith Murdoch wrote in an editorial on 13 August 1943, &quot;we would have held the door to the vast manpower of China and the jumping-off fields for the devastation of Japanese cities. Multitudes of the finest lives of Australia, Britain, and America would have been saved; the long years of toil, death, and separation, which assuredly stretch ahead, would have been shortened.&quot;

Curtin formed a close working relationship with the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. Curtin realised that Australia would be ignored unless it had a strong voice in Washington, D.C., and he wanted that voice to be MacArthur&#x27;s. He gave over control of Australian forces to MacArthur, directing Australian commanders to treat MacArthur&#x27;s orders as if they came from the Australian Government. Biographer John Edwards wrote:

By mid-1942, the results of the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway had averted the perceived threat of invasion. Despite the &quot;beat Germany first&quot; policy, 346,000 Americans were fighting in the Pacific in 1942. Curtin had previously opposed conscription for overseas service during World War I, and again in 1940 when it was introduced by Menzies, although he had supported softening it to allow conscripts to serve in Australian territories.

Curtin recognised that the restriction of the Australian conscripts to Australia and its territories was morally indefensible and politically unviable. To remove what was now a major obstacle to the government&#x27;s re-election prospects, he moved to remove the restriction. While there was support from the Communist Party of Australia and its sympathisers, there was trenchant opposition from the Catholic Church, represented by B. A. Santamaria and Arthur Calwell. Ultimately, the &quot;Defence Act&quot; was amended so that conscripts could be deployed outside of Australia to &quot;such other territories in the South-West Pacific Area as the Governor-General proclaims as being territories associated with the defence of Australia&quot;.

The stress of the war and especially this bitter internal battle within Labor took a great toll on Curtin&#x27;s health, which had never been robust even at the best of times. He had suffered all of his life from stress-related illnesses, and depression; he was also a heavy smoker.

=== Homefront policies ===
Curtin made very heavy use of newspapers and broadcast media, especially through press conferences, speeches, and newsreels. Australians gained a sense it was a people&#x27;s war in which they were full participants.
In terms of social policy, the Curtin government enacted a wide range of progressive social reforms during its time in office. Pensions were introduced for deserted wives and widows, while the establishment of the Women&#x27;s Employment Board led to increased wages for some women during the war. Aboriginal Australians were provided with significantly increased entitlement to welfare benefits, while maternity allowances were extended. In addition, pensions for the elderly and infirm were increased.

In 1942, temporary public employees became eligible to apply to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme if they had been employed for no less than five years and were certified as having indefinite future employment, while the Commonwealth Employees&#x27; Furlough Act of 1943 provided long service leave for all temporary Commonwealth employees. In 1943, the Universities Commission was established to exempt students from war service to undertake or continue university studies and to assist those students by exempting them from fees and, subject to a means test, by providing them with living allowances.

&quot;Asiatics&quot; who were subjects of Australia became eligible for a pension in 1941, and eligibility was extended the following year to Pacific Islanders known as &quot;Kanakas&quot;, and from that July that year &quot;Aboriginal natives&quot; of Australia became eligible for pensions if they were not subject to a state law &quot;relating to the control of Aboriginal natives&quot; or if they lived in a state where they could not be exempt from such laws but were of eligible for pension on the grounds of &quot;character, standard of intelligence and development&quot;. That same year, pension became exempt from income tax. In 1943, funeral benefits were introduced, together with a Wife&#x27;s Allowance for wives of incapacitated age pensioners &quot;where she lived with him, was his legal wife and did not receive a pension in her own right&quot;.

From June 1942, Widows&#x27; Pension Class B was paid to widows without dependent children who were aged 50 and over. The term &quot;widow&quot; included de facto widows who had lived with the deceased spouse for at least three years prior to his death and had been maintained by him. Eligibility was also extended to deserted de jure wives who had been deserted for at least six months, divorced women who had not remarried and women whose husbands were in hospitals for those considered to be insane. From July that year, Widows&#x27; Pension Class B was exempted from income tax.

In 1942, eligibility for maternity allowances was extended to Aboriginal women who were exempted from State laws relating to the control of Aboriginal natives and who were considered suitable to receive the benefits. From 1943, the income test for maternity allowances was abolished and the rate of the allowance was increased to 15 pounds where there were no other children under the age of 14 years, 16 pounds where there were one or two other children, and 17 pounds 10 shillings in cases of three or more children. These amounts included an additional allowance of 25 shillings per week in respect of the period four weeks before and four weeks after the birth, to be paid after the birth of the child. That same year, eligibility for Child Endowment was extended to children in Government institutions, to Aboriginal children who lived for six months per year on a mission station, and to children who were maintained from a deceased estate.

The Child&#x27;s Allowance was introduced in 1943, payable at the rate of five shillings per week for a first for an unendowed child under 16 years dependent on an invalid or permanently incapacitated old-age pensioner. From July 1945 onwards, Additional Benefit for Children of five shillings per week became payable in respect of the first child to any person qualified to receive unemployment or sickness benefit having the custody, care and control of one or more children under the age of 16.

In 1945, Curtin ordered the preparation of the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia. The White Paper was the defining document of the official economic policy in Australia until the 1970s. For the first time, the Australian government accepted an obligation to guarantee full employment and to intervene as necessary to implement that guarantee.

===1943 re-election===
Curtin went into the 1943 election in a very strong position. Even allowing for the advantages that an incumbent government has in wartime, Fadden and Hughes had been unable to get the better of Curtin, and the Coalition had become almost moribund. In the election, Curtin led Labor to its greatest-ever victory, winning two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives on a two-party preferred vote of 58.2% and a 17-seat swing. The Coalition was reduced to only 19 seats nationwide, including only one west of Broken Hill. Fadden&#x27;s Country Party took a particularly severe beating, winning only seven seats. Labor also won the primary vote in all states in the Senate, and thus all 19 seats, to hold a majority of 22 out of 36 seats.

Buoyed by this success, Curtin called a referendum which would give the government control of the economy and resources for five years after the war was over. The 1944 Australian Referendum contained one referendum question: &quot;Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled &#x27;Constitution Alteration (Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights) 1944&#x27;?&quot; Constitution Alteration (Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights) 1944 was known as the 14 powers, or 14 points referendum. It sought to give the government power, over a period of five years, to legislate on monopolies, corporations, trusts, national health, family allowances, freedom of speech, religion, ex-servicemen rehabilitation, the ability to legislate for Indigenous Australians, and safeguards against the abuse of legislative power. The referendum was defeated, receiving a majority only in Western Australia and South Australia. Nationally overall, 54 percent voted against the question in the referendum.

==Death==
By 1944—a time when he was travelling to and from London and Washington for meetings with Churchill, Roosevelt and other Allied leaders—Curtin had already developed heart disease. He had a heart attack in November 1944, and did not return to work until January 1945. With the end of the war in sight, his health began to deteriorate seriously and at a rapid pace.

At 4:00am on 5 July 1945, as Australia&#x27;s 7th Division began its last operation against Japanese forces in the Battle of Balikpapan, John Curtin died at The Lodge at the age of 60. He was the second Australian prime minister to die in office within six years, a fact even contemporary commentators ascribed to the extreme stressors such an office demanded. Upon his death he was described by beacons of the local press to be a self-sacrificial casualty of war, a sentiment echoed by Presbyterian minister Hector Harrison. The next day, Curtin&#x27;s body was laid in state at the King&#x27;s Hall in Parliament House, where a memorial service was held, conducted by Harrison, who had been one of Curtin&#x27;s friends. Ben Chifley and Enid Lyons were seen to weep openly. Harrison seemed to include Curtin among the Australian servicemen who had made the ultimate sacrifice:&quot;His Calvary was the anguish of a man of peace who loathed war with all his heart and soul. A one who spent his life in an attempt to promote human understanding, and journeyed oft in that attempt. And yet who, by a strange irony of fate, was chosen by destiny to lead the nation in her hour of direst peril... when the hosts of the North came down like a mighty flood, confident in strength and exalted in victory, he did not shrink from the hazards of the conflict but threw himself into his work with an utter devotion which at length laid him low and at last called for the supreme sacrifice. We pay him today the homage of a grateful people as one whose name will live forever more in the land he loved and among the free peoples of the world.Bearing his coffin from the King&#x27;s Hall were Opposition Leader Robert Menzies, and former prime ministers Billy Hughes, Earle Page and James Scullin. His body was returned to Perth on a RAAF Dakota escorted by a flight of nine fighter aircraft. After lying in state, he was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth; the service was attended by over 30,000 at the cemetery, with many more lining the streets.
Curtin was initially succeeded as prime minister by his deputy, Frank Forde; seven days later, a party ballot installed Ben Chifley as Labor Leader and therefore prime minister. Many of Curtin&#x27;s post-war reconstruction plans were implemented by his successor Chifley, who in 1946 led the ALP to consecutive victories for the first time. Curtin&#x27;s 9 years and 277 days as leader of the federal ALP would remain a record until it was surpassed by Gough Whitlam in 1975.

==Personal life==
Curtin was introduced to Elsie Needham on a visit to Tasmania in April 1912. Fred Katz, an acquaintance from the Victorian Socialist Party, had taken Curtin to visit Elsie&#x27;s father Abraham Needham, a candidate in the 1912 Tasmanian state election. Curtin proposed to her in Melbourne in 1915, and they were married in Perth on 21 April 1917. Their first child, a daughter also named Elsie, was born at the end of that year. Their second child, a son named John, was born in 1921.

Curtin had an ambivalent relationship with religion and has been described as agnostic. A Catholic priest called at The Lodge as Curtin lay dying, but he was turned away. Curtin had refused to so much as set foot inside a Catholic church throughout his adult life, not even to attend the weddings of friends. However, he was known to ask his press secretary, Fred McLaughlin, to join him in prayer while prime minister. On the day that Singapore fell, Curtin made time to speak at the re-consecration of a church, because, &quot;The fatherhood of God was closely related to the brotherhood of man.&quot; Near the end of his life, he asked his friend Hector Harrison, the Minister of the Presbyterian Church by Parliament, to conduct a Christian memorial service on his death. Kim Beazley Sr., who succeeded Curtin as the Member for Fremantle, didn&#x27;t believe Curtin was agnostic at all, saying, &quot;though Curtin never lost his distrust of religious institutions, faith grew within him.&quot;

==Legacy==
Jack Beadly said of Curtin that &quot;he was one of the greatest of wartime statesmen, and the preservation of Australia from invasion will be his immemorial monument&quot;. Curtin is credited with leading the Labor Party to its best federal election success in history, with a record 55.1 percent of the primary half-senate vote, winning all seats, and a two-party-preferred lower house estimate of 58.2 percent at the 1943 election, winning two-thirds of seats.

One legacy of Curtin was the significant expansion of social services under his leadership. In 1942, uniform taxation was imposed on the various states, which enabled the Curtin government to set up a far-reaching, federally administered range of social services. These included a widows&#x27; pension (1942), maternity benefits for Indigenous Australians (1942), funeral benefits (1943), a second form of maternity benefit (1943), a wife&#x27;s allowance (1943), additional allowances for the children of pensioners (1943), unemployment, sickness and Special Benefits (1945), and pharmaceutical benefits (1945). Substantial improvements to pensions were made, with invalidity and old-age pensions increased, the qualifying period of residence for age pensions halved, and the means test liberalised. Other social security benefits were significantly increased, while child endowment was liberalised, a scheme of vocational training for invalid pensioners was set up, and pensions extended to cover Aborigines. The expansion of social security under John Curtin was of such significance that, as summed up by one historian: &quot;Australia entered World War II with only a fragmentary welfare provision: by the end of the war it had constructed a &#x27;welfare state&#x27;.&quot;
Curtin defended the White Australia policy in a speech in which he stated: &quot;This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.&quot; The Curtin government&#x27;s October 1942 enactment of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, reversing the stance of four previous governments, marked Australian legal independence. This law, along with the Constitution of Australia and the Australia Act 1986, is one of the key components of Australia&#x27;s modern constitutional framework.

His early death and the sentiments it aroused have given Curtin a unique place in Australian political history. Successive Labor leaders, particularly Bob Hawke and Kim Beazley, have sought to build on the Curtin tradition of &quot;patriotic Laborism&quot;. Even some political conservatives pay at least formal homage to the Curtin legend. Immediately after his death, the parliament agreed to pay John Curtin&#x27;s wife Elsie a £1,000 per annum pension until legislation was passed and enacted to pay a pension to a past prime minister or their widow after their death.

Curtin is commemorated by the federal seat of Curtin, the Canberra suburb of Curtin, Curtin University in Perth, John Curtin College of the Arts in Fremantle, the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra, the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library, Curtin Springs in the Northern Territory, RAAF Base Curtin near Derby, John Curtin House, the former headquarters of the Australian Labor Party, Curtin House in Swanston Street, Melbourne, and many other buildings, roads, parks and structures throughout Australia. In 1975 Curtin was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post. On 14 August 2005, the 60th anniversary of V-P Day, a bronze statue of Curtin in front of Fremantle Town Hall was unveiled by Premier of Western Australia Geoff Gallop.
The John Curtin Hotel in Carlton, Victoria, is named after Curtin.

<doc id="155379" wikidata="Q380467" url="?curid=155379" title="Bill Hewlett">
<text>William Redington Hewlett ( ; May 20, 1913 – January 12, 2001) was an American engineer and the co-founder, with David Packard, of the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP).

==Early life and education==
Hewlett was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father taught at the University of Michigan Medical School. In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school&#x27;s Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.

Hewlett received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Stanford in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford.

==Career==

===Hewlett-Packard===
Hewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names. Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

The company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.

Hewlett was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and CEO from 1968 to 1978, after which he was succeeded by John A. Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then was vice chairman of the board until 1987.

A young Steve Jobs, then age twelve, called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs&#x27; initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters. Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP. Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, &quot;You win some, you lose some.&quot;

===Military service===
Hewlett served in the Army during World War II as a Signal Corps Officer. He then led the electronics section of the Development Division, a new part of the War Department Special Staff. After the war he was part of a special team that inspected Japanese Industry.

===Other companies===
Hewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora&#x27;s brother in law Roscoe &quot;Bud&quot; Hughes) from 1956 to 1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett was a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969 to 1980. Hewlett was also elected to the board of directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983.

==Philanthropy==
Starting in the 1960s Hewlett committed much of his time and wealth towards numerous philanthropic causes. In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.

==Personal life==
Hewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.

He was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.

Hewlett died of heart failure in Palo Alto, California on January 12, 2001 at the age of 87, and was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.

==Legacy==
In 1999, the William R. Hewlett Teaching Center at Stanford was named in his honor. The building is located in the Science and Engineering Quad, adjacent to the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building.

Nachmanides was born in Girona in 1194, where he grew up and studied (hence he is also called &quot;Mosheh ben Nahman Gerondi&quot;, or &quot;Moses son of Nahman the Gironan&quot;), and died in the Land of Israel about 1270. He was a descendant of Isaac ben Reuben of Barcelona and cousin of Jonah Gerondi (Rabbeinu Yonah). Among his teachers in Talmud were Judah ben Yakar and Nathan ben Meïr of Trinquetaille, and he is said to have been instructed in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) by his countryman Azriel of Gerona, who was in turn a disciple of Isaac the Blind.




According to the responsa of Shlomo ibn Aderet Nachmanides studied medicine. During his teens he began to get a reputation as a learned Jewish scholar. At age 16, he began his writings on Jewish law. In his &quot;Milhamot Hashem&quot; (Wars of the Lord) he defended Alfasi&#x27;s decisions against the criticisms of Zerachiah ha-Levi of Girona. These writings reveal a conservative tendency that distinguished his later works — an unbounded respect for the earlier authorities.

In the view of Nachmanides, the wisdom of the rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud, as well as the Geonim (rabbis of the early medieval era) was unquestionable. Their words were to be neither doubted nor criticized. &quot;We bow,&quot; he says, &quot;before them, and even when the reason for their words is not quite evident to us, we submit to them&quot; (&quot;Aseifat Zekkenim&quot;, commentary on &quot;Ketubot&quot;). Nachmanides&#x27; adherence to the words of the earlier authorities may be due to piety, or the influence of the northern French Jewish school of thought. However, it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of Greco-Arabic philosophy among the Jews of Spain and Provence; this occurred soon after the appearance of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. This work gave rise to a tendency to allegorize Biblical narratives, and to downplay the role of miracles. Against this tendency Nachmanides strove, and went to the other extreme, not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the Geonim to be questioned.

== Attitude toward Maimonides ==
Called upon, about 1238, for support by Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier, who had been excommunicated by supporters of Maimonides, Nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of Aragon, Navarre, and Castile, in which Solomon&#x27;s adversaries were severely rebuked. However, the great respect he professed for Maimonides (though he did not share the latter&#x27;s views), reinforced by innate gentleness of character, kept him from allying himself with the anti-Maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator. Maimonides was 58 years old when Nachmanides was born. 

In a letter addressed to the French rabbis, he draws attention to the virtues of Maimonides and holds that Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah – his Code of Jewish Law – not only shows no leniency in interpreting prohibitions within Jewish law, but may even be seen as more stringent, which in Nachmanides&#x27; eyes was a positive factor. As to Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief, but for those who had been led astray by the non-Jewish philosophical works of Aristotle and Galen. (Note that Nachmanides&#x27;s analysis of the &quot;Guide&quot; is not the consensus view of modern scholars.) &quot;If,&quot; he says, &quot;you were of the opinion that it was your duty to denounce the Guide as heretical, why does a portion of your flock recede from the decision as if it regretted the step? Is it right in such important matters to act capriciously, to applaud the one to-day and the other tomorrow?&quot;

To reconcile the two parties, Nachmanides proposed that the ban against the philosophical portion of Maimonides&#x27;s Code of Jewish law should be revoked, but that the ban against public study of the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, and against those who rejected allegorical interpretation of the Bible, should be maintained and even strengthened. 

Due to the existence of three variant editions of Nachmanides&#x27; letter, there is some debate as to the contents of his proposed resolution. The Savaral manuscript reads as follows:

This compromise, which might have ended the struggle, was rejected by both parties in spite of Nachmanides&#x27; authority.

==&quot;Iggeret ha-Kodesh&quot;==

The book &quot;Iggeret ha-Kodesh&quot; (אגרת הקודש - The Holy Epistle) on the topics of marriage, holiness, and sexual relations was commonly attributed to Nachmanides, who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift. However, modern scholarship attributes it to a different author, perhaps Rabbi Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla.

In this book, the author criticizes Maimonides for stigmatizing man&#x27;s sexual nature as a disgrace to man. In the view of the author, the body with all its functions being the work of God, is holy, and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable.

== Views on death, mourning and the resurrection ==
In Nachmanides&#x27;s &quot;Torat ha-Adam&quot;, which deals with mourning rites, burial customs, etc., Nachmanides sharply criticizes writers who strove to render man indifferent to both pleasure and pain. This, he declares, is against the Law, which commands man to rejoice on the day of joy and weep on the day of mourning. The last chapter, entitled &quot;Shaar ha-Gemul&quot;, discusses reward and punishment, resurrection, and kindred subjects. It derides the presumption of the philosophers who pretend to a knowledge of the essence of God and the angels, while even the composition of their own bodies is a mystery to them.

For Nachmanides, divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions, and proceeds to give his views on Jewish views of the afterlife. He holds that as God is eminently just, there must be reward and punishment. This reward and punishment must take place in another world, for the good and evil of this world are relative and transitory.

Besides the animal soul, which is derived from the &quot;Supreme powers&quot; and is common to all creatures, man possesses a special soul. This special soul, which is a direct emanation from God, existed before the creation of the world. Through the medium of man it enters the material life; and at the dissolution of its medium it either returns to its original source or enters the body of another man. This belief is, according to Nachmanides, the basis of the levirate marriage, the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father, but also his soul, and thus continues its existence on the earth. The resurrection spoken of by the prophets, which will take place after the coming of the Messiah, is referred by Nachmanides to the body. The physical body may, through the influence of the soul, transform itself into so pure an essence that it will become eternal.

Nachmanides thinks that at the coming of Messiah the knowledge is deeper and also the Kabbalah may be known with Holy Spirit with ten Sefirot while before this the Holy Spirit could achieve only seven Sefirot. Ten Sefirot include Chokhmah, Binah and Keter also with the seven because thinking with Messiah is very strong and all truth must be really known.

Nachmanides gives much importance to the messianic era, especially in relation to the end of the 4 exiles, the last of which is that of Edom identified in Rome. He considers many prophecies of the Tanakh concerning the Messiah and in particular the Book of Daniel: here he considers the exact moment before the messianic revelation while admitting not to be completely aware of what should happen in every detail. It is however evident that divine knowledge will be widely spread and this has always been a topic of debate even among the Jewish wise men (the Chakhamim) following the prophets and the rabbis of the Talmud.

== Commentary on the Torah ==
Nachmanides&#x27; commentary on the Torah (five books of Moses) was his last work, and his most well known. He frequently cites and critiques Rashi&#x27;s commentary, and provides alternative interpretations where he disagrees with Rashi&#x27;s interpretation. He was prompted to record his commentary by three motives: (1) to satisfy the minds of students of the Law and stimulate their interest by a critical examination of the text; (2) to justify the ways of God and discover the hidden meanings of the words of Scripture, &quot;for in the Torah are hidden every wonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every beauty of wisdom&quot;; (3) to soothe the minds of the students by simple explanations and pleasant words when they read the appointed sections of the Pentateuch on Sabbaths and festivals. His exposition, intermingled with aggadic and mystical interpretations, is based upon careful philology and original study of the Bible.

His commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance:
As in his preceding works, he vehemently attacks the Greek philosophers, especially Aristotle, and frequently criticizes Maimonides&#x27; biblical interpretations. Thus he assails Maimonides&#x27; interpretation of Gen. 18:8, asserting that Maimonides&#x27; preferred understanding is contrary to the evident meaning of the Biblical words and that it is sinful even to hear it. While Maimonides endeavored to reduce the miracles of the Bible to the level of natural phenomena, Nachmanides emphasizes them, declaring that &quot;no man can share in the Torah of our teacher Moses unless he believes that all our affairs, whether they concern masses or individuals, are miraculously controlled, and that nothing can be attributed to nature or the order of the world.&quot; See further on this debate under Divine Providence. David Berger has argued that Nachmanides did subscribe to the existence of a natural order.

Next to belief in miracles Nachmanides places three other beliefs, which are, according to him, the Jewish principles of faith, namely, the belief in creation out of nothing, in the omniscience of God, and in divine providence.

Nachmanides, in this commentary, often fiercely criticized Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, particularly regarding ibn Ezra&#x27;s negative attitude towards Kabbalah. Nevertheless, he had tremendous respect for ibn Ezra, as is evidenced in his introduction to the commentary.

Over time, Nachmanides updated his commentary in at least 250 places, particularly after moving from Spain to the land of Israel. These updates are attested to in different versions of his commentary which survived in manuscript.

== Disputation of Barcelona, 1263 ==
Nachmanides, first as rabbi of Girona and later as chief rabbi of Catalonia, seems to have led a largely untroubled life. When well advanced in years, however, his life was interrupted by an event which made him leave his family and his country and wander in foreign lands. This was the religious disputation in which he was called upon to defend his faith in 1263. The debate was initiated by a Pablo Christiani, a Jewish convert to Christianity, who had been sent by the Dominican Master General, Raymond de Penyafort, to King James I of Aragon, with the request that the king order Nachmanides to respond to charges against Judaism.

Pablo Christiani had been trying to make the Jews convert to Christianity. Relying upon the reserve his adversary would be forced to exercise due to fear of offending the feelings of the Christians, Pablo assured the King that he would prove the truth of Christianity from the Talmud and other rabbinical writings. Nachmanides answered the order of the King, but asked that complete freedom of speech should be granted. For four days (July 20–24) he debated with Pablo Christiani in the presence of the King, the court, and many churchmen.

The subjects discussed were:
# whether the Messiah had appeared;
# whether the Messiah announced by the Prophets was to be considered as divine or as a man born of human parents
# whether the Jews or the Christians were in possession of the true faith.

Christiani argued, based upon several aggadic passages, that the Pharisee sages believed that the Messiah had lived during the Talmudic period, and that they ostensibly believed that the Messiah was therefore Jesus. Nachmanides countered that Christiani&#x27;s interpretations were distortions; the rabbis would not hint that Jesus was Messiah while, at the same time, explicitly opposing him as such. He further said that if the sages of the Talmud believed that Jesus was the messiah then most certainly they would have been Christians and not Jews, and the fact that the sages of the Talmud were Jews is beyond dispute. Nachmanides proceeded to provide context for the proof-texts cited by Christiani, showing that they were most clearly understood differently than as proposed by Christiani. Furthermore, Nachmanides demonstrated from numerous biblical and talmudic sources that traditional Jewish belief ran contrary to Christiani&#x27;s postulates.

Nachmanides argued that the Biblical prophets regarded the future messiah as a human, a person of flesh and blood, and not as divine, in the way that Christians view Jesus. He stated that their promises of a reign of universal peace and justice had not yet been fulfilled, that since the appearance of Jesus, the world had been filled with violence and injustice, and that among all denominations the Christians were the most warlike.

[... it seems most strange that... ] the Creator of Heaven and Earth resorted to the womb of a certain Jewish lady, grew there for nine months and was born as an infant, and afterwards grew up and was betrayed into the hands of his enemies who sentenced him to death and executed him, and that afterwards... he came to life and returned to his original place. The mind of a Jew, or any other person, simply cannot tolerate these assertions. You have listened all your life to the priests who have filled your brain and the marrow of your bones with this doctrine, and it has settled into you because of that accustomed habit. [I would argue that if you were hearing these ideas for the first time, now, as a grown adult], you would never accept them.

He noted that questions of the Messiah were of less dogmatic importance to Jews than most Christians imagine. The reason given by him for this bold statement was that it was more meritorious for the Jews to observe the precepts under a Christian ruler, while in exile and suffering humiliation and abuse, than under the rule of the Messiah, when every one would perforce act in accordance with the Law.

As the disputation seemed to turn in favor of Nachmanides, the Jews of Barcelona, fearing the resentment of the Dominicans, entreated him to discontinue; but the King, whom Nachmanides had acquainted with the apprehensions of the Jews, desired him to proceed. The controversy was therefore resumed, and concluded in what was considered a complete victory for Nachmanides, who was dismissed by the King with a gift of three hundred gold pieces as a mark of his respect. The King remarked that he had never encountered a man who, while yet being wrong, argued so well for his position. An alternative text reproduced by Julius Eisenstein in his Otzar Vicuchim (quoted by Charles Ber Chavel in his edition of the collected writings of Nachmanides) has the king saying that he never saw a man with no legal training argue a case so successfully.

The Dominicans, nevertheless, claimed the victory, and Nachmanides felt obligated to publish the text of the debates. From this publication Pablo selected certain passages which he construed as blasphemies against Christianity and denounced to the head of his order, Raymond de Penyafort. A capital charge was then instituted, and a formal complaint against the work and its author was lodged with the King. James was obliged to entertain the charge, but, mistrusting the Dominican court, called an extraordinary commission, and ordered that the proceedings be conducted in his presence. Nachmanides admitted that he had stated many things against Christianity, but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the King, who had granted him freedom of speech.

The justness of his defense was recognized by the King and the commission, but to satisfy the Dominicans, Nachmanides was sentenced to exile for two years and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned. He may also have been fined, but this was lifted as a favor to Benveniste ça Porta, who according to some authorities was Nachmanides&#x27; brother. The Dominicans, however, found this punishment too mild and, through Pope Clement IV, they seem to have succeeded in turning the two years&#x27; exile into perpetual banishment.

Other scholars believe that the identification of Bonastruc ça Porta with Nachmanides is incorrect. If so, then there were actually two people who were found to be blasphemous in the same time period and location.

== In Jerusalem ==
Nachmanides left Aragon and sojourned for three years somewhere in Castille or in the southern part of the Kingdom of France. In 1267, seeking refuge from Christian persecution in Muslim lands, he made aliyah to Jerusalem. There he established a synagogue in the Old City that exists until the present day, known as the Ramban Synagogue. Nachmanides then settled at Acre, where he was very active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time very much neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. Karaites were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder, who later became one of the greatest Karaite authorities (although Graetz writes that there is no veracity to that). It was to arouse the interest of the local Jews in the exposition of the Bible that Nachmanides wrote the greatest of his works, the above-mentioned commentary on the Torah.
Although surrounded by friends and pupils, Nachmanides keenly felt the pangs of exile. &quot;I left my family, I forsook my house. There, with my sons and daughters, the sweet, dear children I brought up at my knees, I left also my soul. My heart and my eyes will dwell with them forever.&quot; During his three-year stay in the Holy Land, Nachmanides maintained a correspondence with his native land, by means of which he endeavored to bring about a closer connection between Judea and Spain. Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City, where there were at that time only two Jewish inhabitants—brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre he counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nachmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality.

==Death and burial==
Nachmanides died in the Holy Land after having passed the age of seventy or seventy-six. Different traditions suggest that he was buried in Haifa, Acre, Hebron, or in the Cave of the Ramban in Jerusalem.

== Works ==
Nachmanides, as above, was a leading Torah scholar of the Middle Ages, authoring major commentaries on Torah and the Talmud. Further, as a &quot;posek&quot; he wrote stand-alone works on &quot;Halachic&quot; topics, as well as works on mysticism, science and philosophy.

===Commentary on Torah===

As detailed above, Ramban&#x27;s commentary on the Torah, &quot;Bi&#x27;ur&quot; or &quot;Perush &#x27;al ha-Torah&quot;, is considered a leading work in the &quot;genre&quot;; 
it was his last, and his best known.
As outlined, he often critiques earlier commentaries - especially Rashi, Ibn Ezra and Rambam - and incorporates kabbalistic teachings. This commentary also reflects his love of &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot;.

===Talmudic commentary===

Ramban&#x27;s major work on the Talmud is referred to as &quot;Chiddushei haRamban&quot;. 
The commentary reflects his depth of knowledge and his deep respect for the legal authorities that came before him.
It is not structured as running commentary on the Talmud; instead it focuses on specific parts of the Talmudic discussion.
In approach, it fully utilizes the Tosafist dialectical style, and systematically integrates this with the classic Sephardic teachings. 

It thus bears a distinct similarity to the writings of the Tosafists; here, though, it will often provide a different perspective on a variety of issues.
It is also heavily influenced by the teachings of Provence.

===Other works===
Nachmanides was a leading and prolific scholar; his output, as outlined, spanned &quot;Halacha&quot;, mysticism, science and philosophy.

*Nachmanides&#x27; known halakhic works - after the model of Isaac Alfasi - are:
** &quot;Mishpetei ha-Cherem&quot;, the laws concerning excommunication, reproduced in &quot;Kol Bo&quot;
** &quot;Hilkhot Bedikkah&quot;, on the examination of the lungs of slaughtered animals, cited by Shimshon ben Tzemach Duran in his &quot;Yavin Shemu&#x27;ah&quot;
** &quot;Torat ha-Adam&quot;, on the laws of mourning and burial ceremonies, in thirty chapters, the last of which, entitled &quot;Sha&#x27;ar ha-Gemul&quot;, deals with eschatology (Constantinople, 1519, and frequently reprinted).

*Nachmanides&#x27; writings in the defense of Simeon Kayyara and Alfasi also belong in the category of his Talmudic and halachic works. These writings are:
** &quot;Milhamot HaShem&quot;, defending Alfasi against the criticisms of Zerachiah ha-Levi of Girona (published with the &quot;Alfasi&quot;, Venice, 1552; frequently reprinted; separate edition, Berlin, 1759)
** &quot;Sefer ha-Zekhut&quot;, in defense of Alfasi against the criticisms of Abraham ben David (RABaD; printed with Abraham Meldola&#x27;s &quot;Shiv&#x27;ah &#x27;Enayim&quot; Leghorn, 1745; under the title &quot;Machaseh u-Magen&quot;, Venice, 1808)
** &quot;Hassagot&quot; (Constantinople, 1510; frequently reprinted), in defense of Simeon Kayyara against the criticisms of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Sefer Hamitzvot&quot; (Book of Precepts).

*Ethical, mystical and philosphic works:
**&quot;Derashah&quot;, sermon delivered in the presence of the King of Castile
**&quot;Sefer ha-Ge&#x27;ulah&quot;, or &quot;Sefer Ketz ha-Ge&#x27;ulah&quot;, on the time of the arrival of the Messiah (in Azariah dei Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Me&#x27;or &#x27;Enayim Imre Binah,&quot; ch. xliii., and frequently reprinted)
**&quot;Iggeret ha-Musar&quot;, ethical letter addressed to his son (in the &quot;Sefer ha-Yir&#x27;ah,&quot; or &quot;Iggeret ha-Teshuvah,&quot; of Jonah Gerondi)
**&quot;Iggeret ha-Chemdah&quot;, letter addressed to the French rabbis in defense of Maimonides (with the &quot;Ta&#x27;alumot Chokmah&quot; of Joseph Delmedigo)
**&quot;Vikkuach&quot;, religious controversy with Pablo Christiani (in the &quot;Milchamot Chovah&quot;)
**&quot;Perush Iyyov&quot;, commentary on Job

A collection of responsa are also commonly attributed to Nachmanides; they may in fact have been written by his student Shlomo ibn Aderet.
&quot;Sodot HaTefilah&quot;, a Hebrew manuscript ascribed to Nachmanides, is similarly likely by Eleazar of Worms.

<text>Emile Alphonse Griffith (February 3, 1938 – July 23, 2013) was an American professional boxer who won world titles in three weight divisions. He held the world light middleweight, undisputed welterweight, and middleweight titles. His best-known contest was a 1962 title match with Benny Paret. Griffith won the bout by knockout; Paret never recovered consciousness and died in the hospital 10 days later.

In 1963 and 1964, Griffith was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. In 2002, he was listed #33 on &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of 80 greatest fighters of the past 80 years. Griffith currently ranks #127 in BoxRec&#x27;s ranking of the greatest pound for pound boxers of all time. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.

==Career==
===Amateur===
Griffith was born on February 3, 1938. As a teen he was working at a hat factory on a steamy day when his boss, the factory owner, agreed to Griffith&#x27;s request to work shirtless. When the owner, a former amateur boxer, noticed his frame, he took Griffith to trainer Gil Clancy&#x27;s gym.

Griffith won the 1958 New York Golden Gloves 147 lb Open Championship, defeating Osvaldo Marcano of the Police Athletic Leagues Lynch Center in the final. In 1957 Griffith advanced to the finals of the 147-lb Sub-Novice division and was defeated by Charles Wormley of the Salem Crescent Athletic Club. Griffith trained at the West 28th Street Parks Department Gym in New York City.

===Professional===
Griffith turned professional in 1958 and fought frequently in New York City. He captured the Welterweight title from Cuban Benny &quot;The Kid&quot; Paret by knocking him out in the 13th round on April 1, 1961. Six months later, Griffith lost the title to Paret in a narrow split decision. Griffith regained the title from Paret on March 24, 1962, in the controversial bout after which Paret died (see below).

Griffith waged a classic four-fight series with Luis Rodríguez, losing their second fight and winning the other three. He defeated middleweight contender Holley Mims but was knocked out in one round by Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter. Three years later, on April 25, 1966, he faced middleweight champion Dick Tiger and won a 15-round unanimous decision and the middleweight title. He also lost, regained and then lost the middleweight crown in three classic fights with Nino Benvenuti.

But many boxing fans believed he was never quite the same fighter after Paret&#x27;s death. From the Paret bout to his retirement in 1977, Griffith fought 80 bouts but only scored twelve knockouts. He later admitted to being gentler with his opponents and relying on his superior boxing skills because he was terrified of killing someone else in the ring. Many thought that Griffith fought past his prime, only winning nine of his last twenty three fights. Other boxers whom he fought in his career included world champions American Denny Moyer, Cuban Luis Rodríguez, Argentine Carlos Monzón, Cuban José Nápoles, and in his last title try, German Eckhard Dagge. After 18 years as a professional boxer, Griffith retired with a record of 85 wins (25 by knockout), 24 losses and 2 draws.

====Benny Paret====

Griffith and Paret&#x27;s third fight, which was nationally televised by ABC, occurred on March 24, 1962, at Madison Square Garden. Griffith had been incensed by an anti-gay slur directed at him by Paret during the weigh-in. Paret touched Griffith&#x27;s buttocks and whispered into his opponent&#x27;s ear &quot;maricón, maricón&quot;, Spanish slang for &quot;faggot&quot;. Griffith had to be restrained from attacking Paret on the spot. The media at the time either ignored the slur or used euphemisms such as &quot;anti-man&quot;. Griffith&#x27;s girlfriend asked him about the incident, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know about you being that way.&quot;

In the sixth round Paret came close to stopping Griffith with a multi-punch combination, but Griffith was saved by the bell. After the sixth round Griffith&#x27;s trainer, Gil Clancy, later said he told him, &quot;When you go inside I want you to keep punching until Paret holds you or the referee breaks you! But you keep punching until he does that!&quot;.

Griffith told a television interviewer: &quot;I&#x27;m very proud to be the welterweight champion again. I hope Paret is feeling very good.&quot; When the seriousness of the situation become known, Griffith went to the hospital where Paret was being treated and unsuccessfully attempted for several hours to gain entry to Paret&#x27;s room. Following that, he ran through the streets while being insulted by passersby. He would later receive hate mail from Paret supporters who were convinced Griffith intentionally killed Paret.

New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller created a seven-man commission to investigate the incident and the sport. Griffith reportedly felt guilt over Paret&#x27;s death and suffered nightmares about Paret for 40 years.

The fight, and the widespread publicity and criticism of boxing which accompanied it, became the basis of the 2005 documentary &quot;Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story&quot;.

===Trainer===
Griffith trained other boxers, including Wilfred Benítez and Juan Laporte of Puerto Rico. Both won world championships. Griffith is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 1979–80, he was in Denmark serving as the coach of the Danish Olympic boxing team.

==Personal life==

In 1971, two months after they met, Griffith married another Virgin Islander, Mercedes &quot;Sadie&quot; Donastorg, who was then a member of the dance troupe &quot;Prince Rupert and the Slave Girls&quot;. Griffith adopted Donastorg&#x27;s daughter, but the marriage only lasted a few months. After retiring from boxing, Griffith worked as a corrections officer at the Secaucus, New Jersey Juvenile Detention Facility.

In 1992, Griffith was viciously beaten and almost killed on a New York City street after leaving a gay bar near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. He was in the hospital for four months after the assault. It was not clear if the violence was motivated by homophobia.

Griffith was bisexual. He was quoted in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as saying &quot;I like men and women both. But I don&#x27;t like that word: homosexual, gay or faggot. I don&#x27;t know what I am. I love men and women the same, but if you ask me which is better ... I like women.&quot;

===Death===
A long-time resident of Weehawken, New Jersey, Griffith died July 23, 2013, at a care facility in Hempstead, New York. In his final years, he suffered from dementia pugilistica and required full-time care. His adopted son, Luis Rodrigo Griffith, was his primary caregiver. He was buried in St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Queens, New York City.

<text>Francis Michael Forde (18 July 189028 January 1983) was an Australian politician who served as the 15th prime minister of Australia from 6 to 13 July 1945, in a caretaker capacity following the death of John Curtin. He was deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1932 to 1946 and is the shortest-serving prime minister in Australia&#x27;s history.

Forde was born in Mitchell, Queensland, to Irish immigrant parents. He eventually settled in Rockhampton, and was a schoolteacher and telegraphist before entering politics. Having joined the ALP at a young age, Forde was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1917, aged 26. He transferred to the House of Representatives at the 1922 federal election, winning the Division of Capricornia. Forde was an assistant minister and minister in the Scullin government from 1929 to 1932, and was largely responsible for the government&#x27;s policy of tariff increases during the Great Depression. He entered the cabinet in 1931 as Minister for Trade and Customs.

After Labor&#x27;s landslide defeat at the 1931 election, Forde was elected deputy leader in place of Ted Theodore. He was expected to become party leader after Scullin&#x27;s retirement in 1935 but lost to John Curtin by one vote. He returned to cabinet in 1941 as Minister for the Army in the Curtin government, and as the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister was one of the government&#x27;s most prominent figures. When John Curtin died in office in 1945, Forde was appointed prime minister to serve while the Labor Party elected a new leader. He contested the leadership ballot against Ben Chifley and Norman Makin, but Chifley emerged victorious.

Forde continued on as deputy leader and army minister in the Chifley government, but lost his seat at the 1946 election. He then was High Commissioner to Canada from 1947 to 1953. Forde attempted to re-enter federal parliament in 1954, but was unsuccessful. He won a state by-election in Queensland the following year – the only former prime minister to enter state parliament – but served only a single term before again being defeated. Forde died at the age of 92, and was accorded a state funeral. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived Australian Prime Minister, a record surpassed by Gough Whitlam.

==Early life==

Forde was born on 18 July 1890 in Mitchell, Queensland. He was the second of six children born to Ellen (née Quirk) and John Forde. His parents were both Irish immigrants – his father was born in Ballinaglera, County Leitrim, while his mother was from County Tipperary. His father was working as a grazier at the time of his birth, and later worked as a railway supervisor.

Forde began his education at the local state school and later boarded at St Mary&#x27;s College, Toowoomba. He qualified as a schoolteacher via the monitorial system, but at the age of 20 joined Queensland Railways as a clerk in the telegraphy department. He later moved to Brisbane to work as a telegraphist for the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department, at the same time studying electrical engineering. In 1914, Forde was transferred to Rockhampton. He was involved with the Australian Natives&#x27; Association (ANA), the Australian Workers&#x27; Union, and the Rockhampton Workers&#x27; Political Organisation, and helped campaign for the &quot;No&quot; vote in the conscription referendums of 1916 and 1917. His role as president of the Rockhampton branch of the ANA &quot;marked the beginning of participation in community debates and public life&quot;.

==Early political involvement==

===State politics===
Forde joined the Labor Party in 1915, at the urging of state MP James Larcombe, who became his mentor. In 1917, aged 26, he won a by-election to the seat of Rockhampton in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. It had been vacated by John Adamson, who had resigned from the Labor Party in the wake of the 1916 party split and unsuccessfully sought Nationalist Party preselection for the Senate. Forde was re-elected to Rockhampton at the 1918 and 1920 state elections. He was a supporter of the Central Queensland Separation Movement, one of the many new state movements active around that time.

===Election to federal parliament===
In 1921, the state Labor government of Ted Theodore passed controversial legislation that allowed state MPs to run for federal parliament and automatically return to their seat in state parliament if they lost, without having to face a by-election. It was widely reported that Forde was intended to be the primary beneficiary of the new legislation. However, the federal Nationalist government responded by amending the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; to overrule the state law. In October 1922, Forde resigned from state parliament to run in the Division of Capricornia at the 1922 federal election. He was successful, defeating Nationalist incumbent and Labor defector William Higgs. Forde&#x27;s successful foray into federal politics triggered the 1923 Rockhampton by-election. The bitterly fought by-election was successfully contested by Labor&#x27;s George Farrell, who had worked on Forde&#x27;s federal campaign.

Forde took his seat in the House of Representatives at the age of 32, becoming one of the youngest members of the new parliament. He soon became known as a champion of the sugar and cotton industries. Despite the party&#x27;s dominance in state politics, he was the only Labor MP in Queensland to be re-elected at the 1925 federal election. He remained the only Queenslander in the ALP caucus until August 1928, when John MacDonald was appointed to a casual vacancy in the Senate. In 1927, Forde was appointed as his Labor Party&#x27;s representative to the Royal Commission on the Moving Picture Industry. He and the other commissioners travelled around Australia interviewing 250 witnesses. The royal commission recommended the establishment of a national film censorship board, with films able to be refused registration on morality grounds.

==Scullin government (1929–1932)==

The Labor Party won the 1929 election, with James Scullin becoming prime minister. Forde was elected to the Scullin Ministry as an assistant minister, and was also appointed to the Committee of Public Accounts. His superior minister was James Fenton, the Minister for Trade and Customs. Fenton was absent from the country or otherwise occupied for most of 1930, including as Acting Prime Minister for five months while Scullin attended the 1930 Imperial Conference in London. Forde oversaw the Department of Trade and Customs in Fenton&#x27;s absence, and also deputised for Parker Moloney, the Minister for Markets and Transport.

Forde remained loyal to the Scullin government during the ALP split of 1931, supporting the Premiers&#x27; Plan. When Fenton and Joseph Lyons resigned from cabinet in February 1931, Forde was elected to one of the vacancies and appointed Minister for Trade and Customs. At the 1931 election, the ALP suffered a landslide and returned only 14 MPs, the lowest total in its history. However, in Forde&#x27;s state of Queensland the party actually increased its representation, winning an additional two House seats and all three seats in the Senate.

===Tariff policy===

Forde was the &quot;principal architect&quot; of the Scullin government&#x27;s policy of high tariffs, which aimed to reduce the effect of the Great Depression on secondary industries. He introduced what &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; called a &quot;tariff extravaganza&quot;, and was known as a staunch protectionist. However, the government&#x27;s measures had little effect on the economy. Forde was a supporter of the emerging Australian motion picture industry. Despite his reputation as a protectionist, he agreed to reduce the tariff on imported sound equipment from 60 percent to just 10 percent, after vigorous lobbying from F. W. Thring. In June 1931, he was invited to officially open Efftee Studios, Thring&#x27;s production studio in Melbourne. He was &quot;shamelessly cultivated as a good friend of Efftee, with an open invitation to look in on shooting and mingle with the stars&quot;. One of Thring&#x27;s investors was Tom Holt, the father of another future Australian prime minister Harold Holt.

===Censorship===
As acting customs minister in 1930, Forde played a key role in the banning of Norman Lindsay&#x27;s novel &quot;Redheap&quot;, the first occasion on which the federal government had banned the importation of a book by an Australian author. Unusually, Forde sought advice on the matter not only from his departmental head Ernest Hall, but also from solicitor-general Robert Garran and private barrister J. V. Gould. As a &quot;pious Catholic&quot;, he was persuaded by Garran and Gould&#x27;s advice that &quot;Redheap&quot; was &quot;indecent and obscene [and] blasphemous as well&quot;. His decision to ban &quot;Redheap&quot; was controversial and came under attack from libertarian and anti-censorship elements within his party, particularly from Lindsay&#x27;s home state of Victoria. However, at the 1930 ALP Federal Conference, attempts to censure Forde failed, and a watered down resolution was passed supporting freedom of expression but allowing for censorship of &quot;licentious and pornographic literature&quot;. Forde later authorised the banning of Frederic Manning&#x27;s &quot;The Middle Parts of Fortune&quot;, overriding departmental advice, and refused an appeal from Jean Devanny to unban her novel &quot;The Butcher Shop&quot;.

==Opposition (1932–1941)==

One of the MPs defeated at the 1931 election was Treasurer Ted Theodore, the ALP&#x27;s deputy leader. A ballot for the party&#x27;s leadership positions was held on 16 February 1932, at which Scullin was re-elected unopposed as leader and Forde was elected as his deputy. He thus became Deputy Leader of the Opposition. With Scullin suffering frequent bouts of ill health, Forde was Acting Leader of the Opposition on a number occasions. Notably, after the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 he announced that the ALP would pursue a policy of non-participation, as &quot;the control of Abyssinia is not worth the loss of a single Australian life&quot;.

When Scullin retired in 1935, Forde contested the leadership ballot but was defeated by one vote by John Curtin, eleven votes to ten. &quot;The Age&quot; called it &quot;one of the greatest surprises in federal political circles during recent years&quot;. It has been suggested that some MPs viewed Forde as too closely linked with the activities of the Scullin government.

In 1940, Forde was one of three Labor MPs elected to the bipartisan Advisory War Council, along with Curtin and Norman Makin.

==Government (1941–1946)==
===Curtin government, 1941–1945===

Forde was a loyal deputy, and in 1941 when Labor returned to power he became Minister for the Army, a vital role in wartime. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister, but was disappointed not to be appointed Treasurer in the new government; that position was instead awarded to Ben Chifley. Forde chaired the War Cabinet and Advisory War Council when Curtin was ill or absent, and was Acting Prime Minister on a number of occasions. He strongly opposed the Brisbane Line proposal, which would have seen a strategic withdrawal of troops from northern Australia in the event of a Japanese invasion (and also included abandoning his own division of Capricornia to the Japanese).

As army minister, Forde held responsibility for internment of enemy aliens during World War II and administration of the prisoner-of-war camps. In February 1942, following mounting concerns over a possible Japanese invasion, he authorised a mass round-up of enemy aliens in Queensland – primarily Italians – and imposed a curfew on any enemy aliens in Queensland not interned. In the same month Forde delegated authority to the army&#x27;s Northern Command to detain all enemy aliens suspected of &quot;anti-British sentiment&quot;. His use of &quot;master warrants&quot; to detain enemy aliens brought him into conflict with attorney-general H. V. Evatt, a civil libertarian, who concluded some internments were &quot;unjustified or frivolous&quot;. Forde did begin to release enemy alien internees in 1944 on the grounds they were needed for food production, although many remained in detention until the end of the war. He supported the principle that detainees could become naturalised citizens after the war&#x27;s end, and also opposed suggestions that Japanese prisoners-of-war who died in Australia should not be buried in the same cemeteries as Australians.

In March 1942, Forde authorised the internment of twenty people connected with the Australia First Movement, including writer Percy Stephensen and suffragette Adela Pankhurst, announcing in parliament that the detainees intended to collaborate with the Japanese and had plans to carry out industrial sabotage and political assassinations. Only four of the Australia First detainees were charged with offences, with the others remaining detained without trial until the end of the war in spite of legal advice received by Evatt that they had not committed crimes or breached any regulations. A committee of inquiry appointed by the government concluded in 1945 that the detention of eight of the Australia First detainees was unjustified and recommended compensation payments be made.

===Caretaker prime minister, 1945===
In April 1945, Forde left Australia to attend the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco. Late that month, Curtin was admitted to hospital; in the absence of Forde and H. V. Evatt (the Minister for External Affairs), he designated Ben Chifley as acting prime minister. Forde did not return to Australia until 2 July, but then immediately took over from Chifley. The prime minister&#x27;s health had severely declined in the meantime, although he had been able to go home to The Lodge. Curtin died in his sleep in the early hours of 5 July, at the age of 60.

On the day that Curtin died, Forde issued a brief statement announcing the death, and then in the afternoon moved a condolence motion at a brief sitting of parliament. On the morning of the following day, 6 July, he led a procession of MPs past Curtin&#x27;s coffin at Parliament House, where his body was lying in state. In the afternoon, Forde attended a memorial service, and then went to Government House, where he was formally sworn in as prime minister by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the Governor-General. He was appointed as prime minister with the understanding that he would resign if the Labor Party elected someone other than him as leader at its next caucus meeting. Forde was the Labor Party&#x27;s sixth prime minister. He is the only Australian prime minister to have never led a political party. There was little precedent for his appointment, as only one previous prime minister (Joseph Lyons) had died in office, and Lyons had been succeeded by the leader of the smaller party in his governing coalition (Earle Page).

On 8 July, Forde accompanied Elsie Curtin to Perth to attend her husband&#x27;s funeral. Two days later, Ben Chifley told him that he would be contesting the leadership; that evening, they both issued statements announcing their candidacies. Norman Makin announced his intention to stand the following day. On the morning of 12 July, Les Haylen informed Forde that he did not have the numbers to win. In response, Forde said &quot;I must say a little prayer for Ben. It&#x27;s not an easy job&quot;. In the leadership ballot, Chifley received 45 votes to Forde&#x27;s 16, Makin&#x27;s seven, and Evatt&#x27;s two. Several MPs were absent (including Evatt), and Rowley James unsuccessfully proposed that the ballot be postponed. Forde resigned as prime minister on 13 July, after one week in office. He is Australia&#x27;s shortest-serving prime minister.

===Chifley government, 1945–1946===
After losing the leadership contest to Chifley, Forde was re-elected unopposed as deputy leader and remained as &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister. He remained Minister for the Army and Minister for Defence, having assumed the latter portfolio after Curtin&#x27;s death. As the Pacific War ended on 15 August, Forde&#x27;s primary responsibility was to oversee the demobilisation of the Australian military. At this time service men and women were spread around the country and across the Pacific. He handled the issue in a way that was unpopular with the general public, refusing appeals to release servicemen early but also making public statements about the rate of demobilisation that turned out to be inaccurate. At the 1946 election, Forde unexpectedly lost his seat to the Liberal candidate Charles Davidson, a returned soldier. He suffered a 10-point swing against him, compared with a nationwide 0.2-point swing against the Labor Party. As well as the concerns over demobilisation, he had been criticised for moving his family to Sydney during the war and his electorate was experiencing a severe drought.

==High Commissioner to Canada==
In November 1946, it was announced that Forde would become the new High Commissioner to Canada, cutting short the term of Alfred Stirling. His appointment was the &quot;first major executive act of the new Federal Cabinet&quot; after the election. Forde and his family left Australia on 7 December, and arrived in Ottawa on 18 January 1947. In October 1951, the Menzies Government announced a nine-month extension to his initial five-year term. From May 1952, he was the &quot;doyen&quot; (longest-serving head of mission) of the diplomatic corps in Canada. He returned to Australia in July 1953.

==Later life==
After returning to Australia, Forde was given a civic reception at Brisbane City Hall by Lord Mayor Frank Roberts. He was soon invited to re-enter federal politics by Arthur Calwell, on behalf of the party&#x27;s federal leader H. V. Evatt. In August 1953 he accepted an appointment as paid organiser for the ALP in Queensland.

In February 1954, Forde nominated for ALP preselection for the Division of Wide Bay, following the withdrawal of the previous endorsed candidate. He was defeated at the 1954 federal election, in a seat which the Country Party had held since 1928. In 1955, at a by-election, he returned to the Queensland Parliament as MP for Flinders. He is the only Prime Minister who later served in a State Parliament.

At the 1957 Queensland state election the Labor Party split resulted not only in Labor falling from power, but also in Forde being defeated in his own seat by Bill Longeran of the Country Party by one vote. Forde disputed the result and the election was declared void on 4 March 1958. However, at the by-election held on 17 May 1958, Longeran defeated Forde by over 400 votes. Had Forde been elected, he would probably have become Labor leader in Queensland, given that Premier Vince Gair and most of Gair&#x27;s followers had been expelled from the party.

In 1962, Forde was nominated for Labor preselection for the Senate vacancy caused by the death of Max Poulter. He received three out of 66 votes in the ballot, with his age probably a factor in his low tally.

Forde retired to Brisbane where he devoted himself to Catholic charity work. In his living room hung a large portrait of wartime US General Douglas MacArthur. On 11 April 1964, at the request of Prime Minister Robert Menzies, Forde represented Australia at MacArthur&#x27;s funeral in Norfolk, Virginia.
Forde died in 1983. He was accorded a state funeral which, on 3 February, proceeded from St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St Lucia to the Toowong Cemetery, the same day that Bob Hawke was elected ALP leader. Indeed, it was at Forde&#x27;s funeral that Senator John Button told then Labor leader Bill Hayden that he must step aside in favor of Hawke, which he did. Forde was the last surviving member of the Scullin, Curtin and his own Cabinet. Furthermore, he was the last surviving MP from when Stanley Bruce was prime minister.

Forde was the only deputy Labor leader who served under three leaders (Scullin, Curtin and Chifley) until Jenny Macklin (Crean, Latham and Beazley, 2001–2006). The electoral Division of Forde and the Canberra suburb of Forde are named after him.

==Personal life==
Forde married Veronica (Vera) Catherine O&#x27;Reilly in 1925 and they had four children:

* Mary Therese (1927–2016)
* Mercia (b. 1930)
* Clare (1932–2010)
* Francis Gerard Forde (1935–1966); his widow, Leneen Forde, became Governor of Queensland.

Forde was widowed in November 1967. During the years that he spent in Ottawa as High Commissioner to Canada two of his daughters (Mary and Mercia) became married to Canadians. Mary (m. William Robert Thompson) eventually settled with her husband in Kingston, Ontario, Canada while Mercia (m. Ian Ferrier) returned to Australia and settled with her husband in St. Lucia, Brisbane. Francis Gerald Forde (m. Leneen Forde) also settled in St. Lucia, while Clare (m. John Attridge) settled in Canberra. Between their four children, Frank and Vera Forde had 15 grandchildren.

<doc id="155383" wikidata="Q157236" url="?curid=155383" title="Liriodendron">
<text>Liriodendron () is a genus of two species of characteristically large trees, deciduous over most of their populations, in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae).

These trees are widely known by the common name tulip tree or tuliptree for their large flowers superficially resembling tulips. It is sometimes referred to as tulip poplar or yellow poplar, and the wood simply as &quot;poplar&quot;, although not closely related to the true poplars. Other common names include canoewood, saddle-leaf tree, and white wood.

The two extant species are &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;, native to eastern North America, and &quot;Liriodendron chinense&quot;, native to China and Vietnam. Both species often grow to great size; the North American species may reach as much as in height. The North American species is commonly used horticulturally, the Chinese species is increasing in cultivation, and hybrids have been produced between these two allopatrically distributed species.

Various extinct species of &quot;Liriodendron&quot; have been described from the fossil record.

== Description ==

&quot;Liriodendron&quot; trees are easily recognized by their leaves, which are distinctive, having four lobes in most cases and a cross-cut notched or straight apex. Leaf size varies from 8–22 cm long and 6–25 cm wide. They are deciduous in the vast majority of cases for both species; however, each species has a semi-deciduous variety at the southern limit of its range in Florida and Yunnan respectively. The tulip tree is often a large tree, 18–60 m high and 60–120 cm in diameter. The stoutest well-authenticated Tulip tree was the Liberty Tree in Maryland which was in circumference. It died in 1999. The tree is known to reach the height of , in groves where they compete for sunlight, somewhat less if growing in an open field. Its trunk is usually columnar, with a long, branch-free bole forming a compact, rather than open, conical crown of slender branches. It has deep roots that spread widely.

Leaves are slightly larger in &quot;L. chinense,&quot; compared to &quot;L. tulipifera&quot;, but with considerable overlap between the species; the petiole is 4–18 cm long. Leaves on young trees tend to be more deeply lobed and larger in size than those on mature trees. In autumn, the leaves turn yellow, or brown and yellow. Both species grow rapidly in rich, moist soils of temperate climates. They hybridize easily, producing &quot;L. x sinoamericanum&quot; cultivars.

Flowers are 3–10 cm in diameter and have nine tepals — three green outer sepals and six inner petals which are yellow-green, with an orange flare at the base in &quot;L. tulipifera&quot; and &quot;L. x sinoamericanum&quot;. They start forming after around 15 years and are superficially similar to a tulip in shape, hence the tree&#x27;s name. Flowers of &quot;L. tulipifera&quot; have a faint cucumber odor. The stamens and pistils are arranged spirally around a central spike or gynaecium; the stamens fall off, and the pistils become the samaras. The fruit is a cone-like aggregate of samaras 4–9 cm long, each of which has a roughly tetrahedral seed with one edge attached to the central conical spike and the other edge attached to the wing.


== Distribution ==
&quot;Liriodendron&quot; trees are also easily recognized by their general shape, with the higher branches sweeping together in one direction, and they are also recognizable by their height, as the taller ones usually protrude above the canopy of oaks, maples, and other trees—more markedly with the American species. Appalachian cove forests often contain several tulip trees of height and girth not seen in other species of eastern hardwoods.

In the Appalachian cove forests, trees 150 to 165 ft in height are common, and trees from 166 to nearly 180 ft are also found. More &quot;Liriodendron&quot; over 170 ft in height have been measured by the Eastern Native Tree Society than for any other eastern species. The current tallest tulip tree on record has reached 191.9 ft, the tallest native angiosperm tree known in North America. The tulip tree is rivaled in eastern forests only by white pine, loblolly pine, and eastern hemlock. Reports of tulip trees over 200 ft have been made, but none of the measurements has been confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society. Most reflect measurement errors attributable to not accurately locating the highest crown point relative to the base of the tree—a common error made by the users employing only clinometers/hypsometers when measuring height.

Maximum circumferences for the species are between 24 and 30 ft at breast height, although a few historical specimens may have been slightly larger. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park has the greatest population of tulip trees 20 ft and over in circumference. The largest-volume tulip tree known anywhere is the Sag Branch Giant, which has a trunk and limb volume approaching .

==Paleo history==
Liriodendrons have been reported as fossils from the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary of North America and central Asia. They are known widely as Tertiary-age fossils in Europe and well outside their present range in Asia and North America, showing a once- northern distribution. Like many &quot;Arcto-Tertiary&quot; genera, &quot;Liriodendron&quot; apparently became extinct in Europe due to the east-west orientation of its mountains that blocked southward migration during the large-scale glaciation and aridity of climate during glacial phases.

The genus name should not be confused with an extinct genus known only through fossils. That is &quot;Lepidodendron,&quot; which entails an important group of long-extinct pteridophytes in the phylum Lycopodiophyta that are well known Paleozoic coal-age fossils).

==Cultivation and use==
&quot;Liriodendron&quot; trees prefer a temperate climate, sun or part shade, and deep, fertile, well-drained and slightly acidic soil. Propagation is by seed or grafting. Plants grown from seed may take more than eight years to flower. Grafted plants flower depending on the age of the scion plant.

The wood of the North American species (called poplar or tulipwood) is fine grained and stable. It is easy to work and commonly used for cabinet and furniture framing, i.e. internal structural members and subsurfaces for veneering. Additionally, much inexpensive furniture, described for sales purposes simply as &quot;hardwood&quot;, is in fact primarily stained poplar. In the literature of American furniture manufacturers from the first half of the 20th century, it is often referred to as &quot;gum wood&quot;. The wood is only moderately rot-resistant and is not commonly used in shipbuilding, but has found some recent use in light-craft construction. The wood is readily available, and when air dried, has a density around .

The name canoewood probably refers to the tree&#x27;s use for construction of dugout canoes by eastern Native Americans, for which its fine grain and large trunk size is eminently suited.

Tulip tree leaves are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, for example the eastern tiger swallowtail (&quot;Papilio glaucus&quot;).

The film was first shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002, and was released in Japanese theaters in 2003.

The film is about two teenage girls, Kayako Kirishima and Masami Endō, who find their friendship turning into something more.

==Plot==
Kayako Kirishima, in her third year at a high school, feels a sense of isolation in school life and vague admiration and uneasiness about the future. One day she makes friends with Endō, who is isolated from her surroundings because she remained in the same class for another year. Kayako is strongly attracted by Endō, who shows her a world that she didn&#x27;t know.

==Cast==
* Mikako Ichikawa as Kayako Kirishima

<doc id="155390" wikidata="Q4788533" url="?curid=155390" title="Area 51 (1995 video game)">
<text>Area 51 is a light gun arcade game released by Time Warner Interactive in 1995. It takes its name from the military facility. The plot of the game involves the player taking part in a Strategic Tactical Advanced Alien Response (STAAR) military incursion to prevent aliens, known as the Kronn, and alien-created zombies from taking over the Area 51 military facility.

Produced as a last-ditch effort to reverse Atari&#x27;s struggling fortunes, &quot;Area 51&quot; largely underwhelmed critics, who compared it unfavorably to contemporary light gun shooters such as &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;, but was well-liked by players and became a major hit. The game was ported to the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and personal computers. Atari further capitalized on its success with &quot;Maximum Force&quot;, which used the same arcade board and similar graphics techniques and gameplay, and a direct sequel, &quot;Area 51: Site 4&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

This game takes the player through several sections of the facility, including a warehouse and tunnels. The player character is tasked, along with fellow Special Tactical Advanced Alien Response (STAAR) members Lieutenant Stephanie Grant and Sergeant Major Marcus Bradley, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must defeat genetically modified zombie soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members. If nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter mode is started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels.

There are five types of weaponry available. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player character is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol.

Grenades are hidden in crates and bonus rooms. When used, they destroy most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a maximum of nine grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with &quot;flammable&quot; warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies. By shooting certain objects in the correct sequence, players can unlock shooting exercises, weapon stashes, and bonus items that are not available in the main game plot. Other backdoors allow players to warp ahead to later levels instead of following the game&#x27;s otherwise linear path.

There are many types of aliens/alien zombies including ones that shoot, punch, fire rockets, and throw things like bricks, grenades, and barrels. Purple alien/alien zombies require more hits than other targets.

== Development ==

In 1994, Atari Games was in desperate need of a hit, having gone years without a single profitable game and losing most of their most talented developers to rival publisher Electronic Arts. As such, they directed Ed Logg to create a light gun shooter, which was one of the most popular game genres in arcades at the time. However, Logg also left to join Electronic Arts while the game, &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;, was still unfinished. At this point executives at Atari Games felt it would be safer to entrust development to an external team, and approached Mesa Logic head Robert Weatherby about his team (Hector Silva, James Mestemaker, Guy Fumagali and James Webb) taking over &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;. After playing &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; and finding it underwhelming, Weatherby asked for a few months to come up with and develop a pitch for his own gun game concept, to which Atari agreed.

Weatherby received the inspiration for the &quot;Area 51&quot; concept from an article in &quot;Popular Science&quot; called &quot;Searching for the Secrets of Groom Lake&quot;.

Originally the data from the game was to be streamed from a CD player using Cinepak for compression, but since this could only produce a letterboxed display, lead programmer Charlie Grisafi opted to instead run the game on a COJAG (a modified Atari Jaguar used in arcade games) interfaced with a hard disk drive and using Grisafi&#x27;s own custom compression software. Grisafi recalled: 

The game uses digitized video stored on the on-board hard disk, and gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, civilians, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.

While the STAAR members were rendered with motion capture, the assorted enemies were created with stop motion animation by Sneaky Pete Kleinow.

== Ports ==
In 1996, the game was ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC. The arcade game was released in 1995 under the Atari Games label by Time Warner Interactive, a short-lived merger between Time Warner Interactive Group, Atari Games, and the latter&#x27;s subsidiary Tengen. Atari Games was purchased by WMS Industries the following year; as a result, ports for PlayStation, Saturn, and Windows were released in 1996 by WMS&#x27;s Midway Home Entertainment subsidiary. It was re-released on the PlayStation in 2001 by Midway as part of their Midway Classics range. Tiger Electronics later released a handheld version of the game with an LCD screen and small light gun.

The PlayStation version supports fullscreen play, while the Saturn version has a border covering about 15% of the screen. The Saturn version supports all of the console&#x27;s light guns. The PlayStation version supports the Konami Justifier, but not the Namco GunCon.

Despite the arcade version running on a modified Atari Jaguar, it was never ported on to the system itself. According to Atari Games, by the time of &quot;Area 51&quot;″s release the company no longer saw the Jaguar as a viable platform.

== Reception ==

&quot;Area 51&quot; was a major hit in the arcades, selling over 20,000 cabinets. It was cited as the first step in a comeback for Atari Games which brought the company from the brink of financial collapse to being a major force in the arcade industry over just a little more than a year. Executive producer Mark Pierce recalled that the home versions had above average sales by the standards of console light gun games (which typically did not sell as well as other arcade ports, since players could not get the full experience without purchasing a light gun for the console).

&quot;Next Generation&quot;″s review of the arcade version stated that &quot;&quot;Area 51&quot; provides shooters with what they want&quot;, noting in particular the dark and varied levels, realistic and graduated scenery, intriguing story themes, and fun power-ups. Despite this, the reviewer concluded that the game &quot;stands up better against shooters of the past like &quot;Virtua Cop 1&quot; and &quot;Mad Dog McCree&quot;, and not the current crop.&quot; The game took the number one slot in the December 1995 &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; chart of &quot;RePlay Magazine&quot;.

The Saturn port received middling reviews. Critics typically commented that the game is good fun on its own terms but does not compare well to &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;, which was released for the Saturn at roughly the same time. The graphics received mixed remarks due to the graininess of the FMV and the presence of screen borders, and like most console light gun games it was criticized as having very low longevity.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; also found the game too easy, though they praised the retention of all the secret rooms from the arcade version. Lee Nutter summarized in &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;, &quot;As shoot &#x27;em ups go &quot;Area 51&quot; is not a bad effort, but outclassed by the [Virtua] Cop games in every conceivable way.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; gave &quot;Area 51&quot; one of its more positive reviews, praising its frenzied pace and concluding, &quot;&quot;Area 51&quot;″s sizzling action easily overcomes its sizable flaws. It&#x27;s a must for diehard shooters and a superb rental for everyone else.&quot;

Jeff Kitts of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;a topnotch shooter&quot;. Unlike other reviewers, he found the game&#x27;s challenge and multiple difficulty levels give it sufficient longevity, and deemed the graphics &quot;superb&quot;, citing the constant action and plot development playing out in the photorealistic backgrounds. In a 1998 review of the Saturn version, IGN, while remarking that the game lacks sufficient playtime or extras to last long and does not measure up to &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;, found it to be a well-designed and fun experience in both single player and two-player mode.

Steve Bauman of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; gave the PC version two stars out of five and wrote, &quot;This is a perfect example why you don&#x27;t convert some arcade games to the PC.&quot; Bauman called the game &quot;repetitive and boring&quot; because of its lack of the arcade version&#x27;s light gun.

The PlayStation version was largely ignored by contemporary reviewers. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer criticized the conversion, but mainly emphasized that &quot;Area 51&quot; as a 1997 console game lacked the excitement it had aroused as an arcade game in 1995. He did, however, praise the music and sound effects.

In a retrospective review of the arcade version, Brad Cook of AllGame wrote, &quot;Not only is this game fun, it&#x27;s not incredibly hard either. [...] The graphics are extremely well done, and it&#x27;s very fast-paced.&quot; He also praised the storyline, attract mode, and varied backgrounds. Anthony Baize of AllGame called the PlayStation version &quot;very exciting.&quot; Baize remarked that while the graphics are not as good as the arcade version, they are still solid, and the unlimited continues gives it an advantage over the arcade version. AllGame praised the Saturn version&#x27;s music and sound, and recommended that players use a light gun instead of a joypad. AllGame also wrote that the graphics were, &quot;Not as crisp as the PS and PC versions but good for the Saturn.&quot; In 2001, Stephen Fulljames of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version and wrote that it &quot;plays as if it&#x27;s on rails - the pre-rendered environments offering a totally predictable environment. We challenge anyone not to be bored within a week.&quot;

== Sequel and related games ==

In 1997, Atari Games and Mesa Logic released &quot;Maximum Force&quot;, a spiritual successor to &quot;Area 51&quot; with identical gameplay and aesthetic elements; both games were later re-released in 1998 as one machine called &quot;Area 51/Maximum Force Duo&quot;. Also in 1998, an arcade sequel titled &quot;Area 51: Site 4&quot; was released.

In 2005, a first-person shooter which shares the name and uses the original as an inspiration was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC by Midway Games. It features a more sophisticated storyline and the voices of David Duchovny, Marilyn Manson, and Powers Boothe, and was well-received; the original arcade game makes a brief appearance here as well. In 2007, Midway released &quot;&quot; to PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, which was received poorly.

<text>Pyrros Dimas (; ; born 13 October 1971) is a Greek politician and former weightlifter. He is currently the technical director for USA Weightlifting, having taken that position in June 2017. Dimas has also been involved in politics as a member of the Hellenic Parliament, representing the Panhellenic Socialist Movement from 2012 to 2015. 

Dimas is the most decorated Greek athlete in the Olympics and is widely considered one of the greatest weightlifters of all time, having been three times Olympic Gold Medalist (in his fourth Olympiad, a knee injury notwithstanding, he won the bronze medal), and three times World Champion. He was named the Greek Male Athlete of the Year, for the years 1992, 1993, 1995, and 1996.

==Early years ==

Dimas was born in 1971 in Himarë, southern Albania, to ethnic Greek parents. Dimas started the sport at 11 and competed at a junior&#x27;s level at 14. At 18, in 1989, he became triple Champion of Albania for the 82.5 kg category and in 1990 he repeated himself.

While in Albania, he was coached by Zef Kovaci. In 1990 he was also accorded the title &quot;Master of Sports&quot; by the Albanian government and the title &quot;European Master&quot; by the European Weightlifting Federation.

==Results representing Albania==

He was part of the Albanian weightlifting team to which he made important contributions: In 1989 in the 62nd World Championship of Weightlifting Dimas ranked 12th in the World and helped Albania rank 13th in the world.

In the 69th European Weightlifting Championship (held in Aalborg, Denmark May 1990), Dimas ranked 4th in Europe and Albania ranked 3rd (after 1st placed USSR and 2nd placed Bulgaria), and in the European Cup for nations (in Antalya, Turkey, December 1990) Dimas, Leonidas Sabanis and Fatmir Bushi helped Albania rank 2nd in Europe (after 1st placed Bulgaria).

==Results representing Greece==
During his stay in Aalborg he came in contact with representatives of the Greece national team: Giannis Sgouros and Christos Iakovou and he expressed great enthusiasm for a future cooperation. However, the political situation in Albania prohibited him from leaving the country. Dimas managed to cross the Greek-Albanian border at 7 February 1991, after a several hour exhaustive trip. He then stayed in Athens. He acquired Greek citizenship in 1992, and first competed under the Greek flag in the 1992 Summer Olympics, winning a gold medal in the 82.5 kg class.

During his third lift for the clean and jerk event, he shouted &quot;Για την Ελλάδα!&quot; (transliterated &quot;Gia tin Ellada!&quot;; meaning &quot;For Greece!&quot;), thus dedicating his victory to Greece. This is the catchphrase with which he is most associated in Greece.

At a time when Greece&#x27;s success in the Olympics was limited, he and Voula Patoulidou, the surprise gold medalist in the 100m hurdles, became instant national heroes. They were greeted as such on their return to Greece at a grand ceremony attended by 60,000 people in the Panathinaikon Stadium in Athens, with a further 30,000 outside the stadium. His birthplace gave rise to his nickname &quot;The Lion of Himara&quot;. His outstanding number of Olympic Gold Medals created another nickname &quot;Midas&quot;.

Characteristic of his self-confidence was his tendency to keep the weights lifted after the buzzer had sounded so that the crowd could take photographs.

With the 1993 and 1995 World titles under his belt, Dimas was the favorite to win Olympic Gold in the 83 kg class for the 1996 Summer Olympics, where he was the flag bearer of the Greece Olympic team. He won the event with two new World Records.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics, he won another gold medal, this time in the 85 kg class. This made him one of just three weightlifters at that time to have won three Olympic gold medals; the others being Naim Süleymanoğlu (Turkey, but born in Bulgaria) and Kakhi Kakhiashvili (Greece, but born in Georgia). Halil Mutlu (like Süleymanoğlu, a Bulgaria-born Turk) would become the fourth in 2004.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Dimas was chosen as Greece flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Dimas was recovering from knee surgery and a hurt wrist and was not expected to compete in these Olympics, but he came away with a bronze medal in the 85 kg class, becoming the fourth weightlifter in history to win a medal at four different Olympic Games, the third to win those four medals successively, and the only one whose four medals include 3 golds, thus cementing his status as a national hero in Greece and as an international weightlifting legend.

After earning the bronze medal he signalled his retirement by leaving his shoes on the platform, while the appreciative Greek crowd gave him a standing ovation.

In June 2008, Dimas became vice-president, and in October 2008 president of the Hellenic Weightlifting Federation.

==Political activities==
In 2012, Dimas entered politics as a member of PASOK, being elected as a member of Greek parliament in the May and June 2012 elections. He was soon polemical with Greece&#x27;s policies with Northern Epirus- his place of origin- claiming that the Greek government has &quot;forgotten&quot; it.

Dimas has campaigned for the rights of ethnic Greeks in Albania, drawing attention to alleged human rights abuses (in particular alleged land grabs against the Greek community of Himara), while calling on the Greek government to intervene. On 17 February 2014 Dimas participated in the ceremony of 100th anniversary of the declaration of Autonomy of the Republic of Northern Epirus. Dimas propagates against what he considers to be discrimination policies of the Albanian state against the Greek community of Himara, as well as of the rights of the Greek population of Northern Epirotes in general.

In an interview in 2016 he stated that &quot;we are referring to Pontus, Cyprus, but for the first time Northern Epirus was heard in the Greek parliament when they saw me&quot;. At December 2018 Dimas protested against the confiscation of properties that belong to the ethnic Greek community of Himara and called the Albanian government to avoid discrimination of this kind.

On May 15, 2023, Dimas protested against the arrest and imprisonment by the Albanian authorities of the representative of the Greek minority, Fredis Beleris, on charges of vote buying. The latter was elected mayor of Himara.

He was candidate for European Parliament in the 2024 elections with New Democracy but failed to get elected.

== Personal life ==
Dimas was married to Anastasia Sdougkou, a former Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation sports reporter. Together they had four children. His wife died of brain cancer on 14 June 2018.
