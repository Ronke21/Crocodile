<text>Charles Henry Christian (July 29, 1916 – March 2, 1942) was an American swing and jazz guitarist. He was among the first electric guitarists and was a key figure in the development of bebop and cool jazz. He gained national exposure as a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet and Orchestra from August 1939 to June 1941. His single-string technique, combined with amplification, helped bring the guitar out of the rhythm section and into the forefront as a solo instrument. For this, he is often credited with leading to the development of the lead guitar role in musical ensembles and bands.

==Early life==
Christian was born in Bonham, Texas. His family moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, when he was a small child. His parents were musicians. He had two brothers: Edward, born in 1906, and Clarence, born in 1911. Edward, Clarence, and Charlie were all taught music by their father, Clarence Henry Christian. Clarence Henry was struck blind by fever, and in order to support the family he and the boys worked as buskers, on what the Christians called &quot;busts.&quot; He would have them lead him into the better neighborhoods, where they would perform for cash or goods. When Charles was old enough to go along, he first entertained by dancing. Later he learned to play the guitar, inheriting his father&#x27;s instruments upon his death when Charles was 12.

He attended Douglass High School in Oklahoma City, where he was further encouraged in music by an instructor, Zelia N. Breaux. Charles wanted to play tenor saxophone in the school band, but Breaux insisted he play trumpet instead. As he believed playing the trumpet would disfigure his lip, he quit to pursue his interest in baseball, at which he excelled.

In a 1978 interview with biographer Craig McKinney, Clarence Christian said that in the 1920s and 1930s, Edward Christian led a band in Oklahoma City as a pianist and had a shaky relationship with the trumpeter James Simpson. Around 1931, Simpson instructed guitarist &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Ralph Hamilton to secretly school the younger Charles in jazz. Hamilton taught him to solo on three songs, &quot;Rose Room&quot;, &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;. When the time was right, he took Charles to one of the many after-hours jam sessions along &quot;Deep Deuce&quot; in Oklahoma City, where Edward&#x27;s band was performing, and after some encouragement, Edward allowed Charles to play. Edward was surprised that Charles knew the tunes, which were well received by the club.

Charles soon was performing locally and on the road throughout the Midwest, including states as far away as North Dakota and Minnesota. By 1936 he was playing electric guitar and had become a regional attraction. According to the record producer John Hammond, Christian jammed with many of the big-name performers traveling through Oklahoma City, including Teddy Wilson, Art Tatum, and Mary Lou Williams, the pianist for Andy Kirk and His Clouds of Joy.

== Career ==

=== National fame ===
In 1939, Christian auditioned for John Hammond, who recommended him to bandleader Benny Goodman, who was only the fourth white bandleader to feature Black musicians in his live band. Goodman had previously heard electric guitarists Leonard Ware and Floyd Smith, among others, and he unsuccessfully tried to buy Smith&#x27;s contract from bandleader Andy Kirk.

There are multiple accounts of Christian and Goodman&#x27;s first meeting. The former recalled in a 1940 article in &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine, &quot;I guess neither one of us liked what I played.&quot; Despite this, Christian claimed that Goodman invited him to a show that evening. According to another account, Hammond decided to install Christian as the band&#x27;s guitarist without consulting Goodman.

Goodman&#x27;s band, including Christian on guitar, played that night at Victor Hugo restaurant in Los Angeles. The bandleader called &quot;Rose Room&quot;, a tune he assumed Christian did not know. However, Christian knew the tune and took an unprecedented twenty choruses of improvisation; Goodman hired him as a member of the band as a result. In the course of a few days, Christian went from making $2.50 a night to $150 a week.

Christian joined the newly formed Goodman Sextet in September 1939, which included Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Artie Bernstein and Nick Fatool.

Amateur recordings made in September 1939 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by Jerry Newhouse, a Goodman aficionado, capture the newly hired Christian while on the road with Goodman and feature Goodman&#x27;s tenor sax player Jerry Jerome and then-local bassist Oscar Pettiford. Taking multiple solos, Christian shows much the same improvisational skills later captured on the Minton&#x27;s and Monroe&#x27;s recordings in 1941, suggesting that he had already matured as a musician. The Minneapolis recordings include &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Rhythm&quot;, the latter a favorite of bop composers and jammers.

By February 1940, Christian dominated the jazz and swing guitar polls and was elected to the Metronome All Stars. In the spring of 1940, Goodman laid off most of his band, but he retained Christian, and in the fall of that year Goodman led a sextet with Christian, Count Basie, longtime Duke Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams, former Artie Shaw tenor saxophonist Georgie Auld and later drummer Dave Tough. This all-star band dominated the jazz polls in 1941, including another election to the Metronome All Stars for Christian.

His work on the Goodman sextet sides &quot;Soft Winds&quot;, &quot;Till Tom Special&quot;, and &quot;A Smo-o-o-oth One&quot; show his use of few well-placed melodic notes. His work on the Sextet&#x27;s recordings of the ballads &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Memories of You&quot;, &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot;, &quot;I Surrender Dear&quot; and &quot;On the Alamo&quot; and his work on &quot;Profoundly Blue&quot; with the Edmond Hall Celeste Quartet (1941) show hints of what was later called cool jazz. Although credited for very few, Christian composed many of the original tunes recorded by the Benny Goodman Sextet.

=== Bebop and Minton&#x27;s Playhouse ===
Christian was an important contributor to the music that became known as bop, or bebop. Some of the participants in early after-hours affairs at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, an after-hours club located in the Hotel Cecil at 210 West 118th Street in Harlem where bebop was born, credit Christian with the name &quot;bebop&quot;, citing his humming of phrases as the onomatopoetic origin of the term.

Examples of Christian&#x27;s bebop playing can be heard in a series of recordings made at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse by Jerry Newman, a student at Columbia University, on a portable disk recorder in 1941, in which Christian was accompanied by Joe Guy on trumpet, Kenny Kersey on piano and Kenny Clarke on drums. Christian&#x27;s use of tension and release, a technique employed by Lester Young, Count Basie and later bop musicians, is also present on Newman&#x27;s recording of &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy.&quot; Further recordings were made in 1941, shortly before Christian&#x27;s illness and death, at Clark Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, another late-night jazz haunt in Harlem, with Oran &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Page. Other recordings include the tenor sax player Don Byas. Beboppers &quot;Dizzy&quot; Gillespie and Thelonious Monk were regulars at the jam sessions, with Monk a regular in the Minton&#x27;s house band.

Kenny Clarke claimed that &quot;Epistrophy&quot; and &quot;Rhythm-a-Ning&quot; were compositions by Christian, which Christian played with Clarke and Thelonious Monk at Minton&#x27;s jam sessions. The &quot;Rhythm-a-Ning&quot; line is heard on &quot;Down on Teddy&#x27;s Hill&quot; and behind the introduction on &quot;Guy&#x27;s Got to Go&quot; from the Newman recordings. It is also a line from Mary Lou Williams&#x27;s &quot;Walkin&#x27; and Swingin&#x27;&quot;. Clarke further commented that Christian first showed him the chords to &quot;Epistrophy&quot; on a ukulele.

The Minton&#x27;s and Uptown House recordings have been packaged under a number of different titles, including &quot;After Hours&quot; and &quot;The Immortal Charlie Christian&quot;. On the recordings, Christian can be heard taking multiple choruses on a single tune, playing long stretches of melodic ideas with ease.

==Personal life==
Charles fathered a daughter, Billie Jean Christian (December 23, 1932 – July 19, 2004) by Margretta Lorraine Downey of Oklahoma City.

In the late 1930s Christian contracted tuberculosis, and in early 1940 he was hospitalized for a short period in which the Goodman group was on hiatus because of Goodman&#x27;s back trouble. Goodman was hospitalized in the summer of 1940 after a brief stay at Santa Catalina Island, California, where the band stayed when they were on the West Coast.

Christian returned home to Oklahoma City in late July 1940 and returned to New York City in September 1940. In early 1941, Christian resumed his hectic lifestyle, heading to Harlem for late-night jam sessions after finishing gigs with the Goodman Sextet and Orchestra in New York City. In June 1941 he was admitted to Seaview Hospital, a tuberculosis sanatorium on Staten Island in New York City. He was reported to be making progress, and &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine reported in February 1942 that he and Cootie Williams were starting a band.

=== Death ===
After a visit to the hospital that same month by the tap dancer and drummer Marion Joseph &quot;Taps&quot; Miller, Christian declined in health. He died of tuberculosis on March 2, 1942, at the age of 25. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Bonham, Texas. A Texas State Historical Commission Marker and headstone were placed in Gates Hill Cemetery in 1994. The location of the historical marker and headstone was disputed, and in March 2013, Fannin County, Texas, recognized that the marker was in the wrong spot and that Christian is buried under the concrete slab.

==Style and influences==

Christian is widely regarded as one of the most influential pioneers of jazz guitar. His solos are frequently described as &quot;horn-like&quot;, and in that sense, he was more influenced by horn players such as Lester Young and Herschel Evans than by early arch-top guitarists like Eddie Lang and the jazz- and bluesman Lonnie Johnson, although they both had contributed to the expansion of the guitar&#x27;s role from the rhythm section to a solo instrument. Christian stated he wanted his guitar to sound like a tenor saxophone. The French gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt had little influence on him, but Christian was obviously familiar with some of his recordings. The guitarist Mary Osborne recalled hearing him play Django&#x27;s solo on &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; note for note, but then following it with his own ideas.

By 1939 there had already been electric guitar soloists—Leonard Ware; George Barnes; Eddie Durham, who had recorded with Count Basie; Floyd Smith, who recorded &quot;Floyd&#x27;s Guitar Blues&quot; with Andy Kirk and his Clouds of Joy in March 1939, using an amplified lap steel guitar; and the Western Swing pioneer Eldon Shamblin, who was playing with Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys.

Christian paved the way for the modern electric guitar sound that was followed by other pioneers, including T-Bone Walker, Eddie Cochran, Cliff Gallup, Scotty Moore, Franny Beecher, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix. For this reason Christian was inducted in 1990 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Christian&#x27;s exposure was so great in the brief period he played with Goodman that he influenced not only guitarists but other musicians as well. The influence he had on &quot;Dizzy&quot; Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and Don Byas can be heard on their early bop recordings &quot;Blue &#x27;n&#x27; Boogie&quot; and &quot;Salt Peanuts&quot;. Other musicians, such as the trumpeter Miles Davis, cited Christian as an early influence. Indeed, Christian&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; sound influenced jazz as a whole. He reigned supreme in the jazz guitar polls up to two years after his death. Black Sabbath&#x27;s first manager Jim Simpson describes the band&#x27;s first song, &quot;A Song for Jim&quot; as an “absolute Charlie Christian takeoff.”

The bar-style pickup used on the ES-150 and ES-250 became known as the &quot;Charlie Christian pickup.&quot;

== Legacy ==

John Hammond and George T. Simon called Christian the best improvisational talent of the swing era. In the liner notes to the album &quot;Solo Flight: The Genius of Charlie Christian&quot; (Columbia, 1972), Gene Lees wrote that &quot;Many critics and musicians consider that Christian was one of the founding fathers of bebop, or if not that, at least a precursor to it.&quot;

In 1966, 24 years after his death, Christian was inducted into the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame. In 1989 the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame created its first seven inductions, which included Christian.

In 1990, Christian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the &quot;Early Influence&quot; category. 

In a 1985 interview with &quot;Frets&quot; magazine, Jerry Garcia named Christian and Django Reinhardt as the two guitarists who most inspired his awe and emulation.

In 2006, Oklahoma City, where Christian was raised, renamed a street in its Bricktown entertainment district after the guitarist.

==Discography==
Christian never recorded as a leader. Compilations have been released of his sessions as a sideman in which he is a featured soloist, of practice and warm-up recordings for these sessions, and some lower-quality recordings of Christian&#x27;s own groups performing in nightclubs, by amateur technicians.

<doc id="155972" wikidata="Q206216" url="?curid=155972" title="Animals (Pink Floyd album)">
<text>Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 January 1977, by Harvest Records and Columbia Records. Pink Floyd produced it at their new studio, Britannia Row Studios, in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions of Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous works, such as &quot;Meddle&quot; (1971) and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975).

A lyrical departure from Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Animals&quot; is a concept album that focuses on the sociopolitical conditions of mid-1970s Britain. Tension during the recording culminated in the firing of the keyboardist, Richard Wright, two years after the album&#x27;s release. The cover, conceived by the bassist and lead songwriter, Roger Waters, and designed by their long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.

Pink Floyd released no singles from &quot;Animals&quot; but promoted it through the In the Flesh tour. Waters&#x27; agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next album, &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979). &quot;Animals&quot; reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered one of Pink Floyd&#x27;s best works.

==Recording==
By 1975, Pink Floyd&#x27;s deal with Harvest Records&#x27; parent company, EMI, for unlimited studio time in return for a reduced percentage of sales had expired. That year, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey block of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington, north London. They converted it into a recording studio and storage facility, which took up most of 1975. In April 1976, Pink Floyd started work on their tenth studio album, &quot;Animals&quot;, at the new facility. It was engineered by a previous Floyd collaborator, Brian Humphries. Recording took place at Britannia Row from April to until early 1977. 

With the exception of &quot;Dogs&quot; (co-written by the guitarist, David Gilmour), the tracks were written by the bassist, Roger Waters. Gilmour was distracted by the birth of his first child, and contributed little else towards the songwriting. The drummer, Nick Mason, and the keyboardist, Richard Wright, contributed less than on previous albums, and &quot;Animals&quot; was the first Pink Floyd album not to contain a composer&#x27;s credit for Wright.

&quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Crazy&quot;, songs previously performed live and considered for Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, reappeared as &quot;Sheep&quot; and &quot;Dogs&quot;. They were reworked to fit the new concept, and separated by &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot;. The only other new composition, &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; (split into two parts to start and end the album), references Waters&#x27; private life; his new romantic interest was Carolyne Anne Christie, who was married to Rock Scully, the manager of the Grateful Dead, when she met Waters.

The band had discussed employing another guitarist for future tours, and Snowy White was invited into the studio. When Waters and Mason inadvertently erased one of Gilmour&#x27;s guitar solos, White was asked to record a solo on &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot;. Although his performance was omitted from the vinyl release, it was included on the 8-track cartridge version. White performed on the &quot;Animals&quot; tour. Mason recalled enjoying working on &quot;Animals&quot; more than &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

==Concept==
Loosely based on George Orwell&#x27;s political fable &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, the album&#x27;s lyrics describe various classes in society as different kinds of animals: the predatory dogs, the despotic ruthless pigs, and the &quot;mindless and unquestioning” herd of sheep. Whereas the novella focuses on Stalinism, the album is a critique of capitalism and differs again in that the sheep eventually rise up to overpower the dogs. The album was developed from a collection of unrelated songs into a concept which, in the words of author Glenn Povey, &quot;described the apparent social and moral decay of society, likening the human condition to that of mere animals&quot;.

The album is also in part a response to the punk rock movement, which grew in popularity as a nihilistic statement against the prevailing social and political conditions, and in response to the complacency and nostalgia that appeared to surround rock music. Pink Floyd were a target for punk musicians, notably Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, who wore a Pink Floyd T-shirt on which the words &quot;I hate&quot; had been written in ink. Rotten since said this was a joke; he was a fan of several progressive rock bands, including Magma and Van Der Graaf Generator. Mason later said he welcomed the &quot;punk rock insurrection&quot; as a welcome return to the underground scene from which Pink Floyd originated. In 1977, Mason produced the Damned&#x27;s second album, &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot;, at Britannia Row, after they failed to entice the retired Syd Barrett to the role.
In his 2008 book &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, Mark Blake argues that &quot;Dogs&quot; contains some of Gilmour&#x27;s finest work; although he sings only one lead vocal, his performance is &quot;explosive&quot;. The song also contains notable contributions from Wright, which echo the synthesiser sounds used on &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

&quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; is similar to &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, with bluesy guitar fills and elaborate bass lines. Of the song&#x27;s three pigs, the only one directly identified is the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who is described as a &quot;house-proud town mouse&quot;.

&quot;Sheep&quot; contains a modified version of Psalm 23, which continues the traditional &quot;the Lord is my shepherd&quot; with words like &quot;he maketh me to hang on hooks in high places and converteth me to lamb cutlets&quot;. Towards the end of the song, the sheep rise up, kill the dogs and retire to their homes. Wright played the introduction unaccompanied on the electric piano, but did not receive a writing credit.

The album is bookended by each half of &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot;, a simple love song in which a glimmer of hope is offered despite the anger expressed in the other songs. Described by the author Andy Mabbett as &quot;in stark contrast to the heavyweight material between them&quot;, the halves were influenced by Waters&#x27; relationship with his then wife.

==Packaging==
Once the album was complete, work began on its cover. Hipgnosis, designer of the band&#x27;s previous album covers, offered three ideas, one of which was a small child entering his parents&#x27; bedroom to find them having sex: &quot;copulating, like animals!&quot; 

The final concept was, unusually, designed by Waters. At the time, he lived near Clapham Common, London, and regularly drove past Battersea Power Station, which was approaching the end of its useful life. A view of the building was chosen for the cover image, and the band commissioned the German company Ballon Fabrik (who had previously constructed Zeppelin airships) and the Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw to build a pig balloon (known as &quot;Algie&quot;). The balloon was inflated with helium and manoeuvred into position on 2 December 1976, with a marksman ready to fire if it escaped.

Inclement weather delayed work, and the band&#x27;s manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke neglected to book the marksman for a second day; the balloon broke free of its moorings and disappeared from view. The pig flew over Heathrow, resulting in panic and cancelled flights; pilots also spotted the pig in the air. It eventually landed in Kent and was recovered by a local farmer, who was apparently furious that it had scared his cows. The balloon was recovered and filming continued for a third day, but as the early photographs of the power station were considered better, the image of the pig was later superimposed onto one of those taken by professional photographer Howard Bartrop on location on a residential block of flats adjacent.

During the &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot; short film shot by Danny Boyle and shown as part of the Opening Ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the camera zooms down the length of the River Thames, from a small spring in the countryside all the way to the Olympic venue. During the fly-by, a pig can be seen floating above Battersea Power Station.

The album&#x27;s theme continues onto the record&#x27;s picture labels. Side one&#x27;s label shows a fisheye lens view of a dog and the English countryside, and side two features a pig and sheep, in the same setting. Mason&#x27;s handwriting is used as a typeface throughout the packaging. The gatefold features monochrome photographs of the dereliction around the power station.

==Release==
The album&#x27;s release followed Capital Radio&#x27;s broadcast two days earlier of &quot;The Pink Floyd Story&quot;, and an evening press conference held at the power station two days before that. The broadcast was originally to have been an exclusive for the DJ Nicky Horne, who since mid-December had been broadcasting &quot;The Pink Floyd Story&quot;, but a copy was given to John Peel, who played side one of the album in its entirety a day earlier.

&quot;Animals&quot; was released in the UK on 21 January 1977 on Harvest Records, and in the US on 12 February on Columbia Records. It reached number two in the UK and number three in the US. According to &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot;, Pink Floyd overtook ABBA for the most weeks on the UK Albums Chart in 1977, at 108 weeks. &quot;Animals&quot; was certified quadruple platinum in the US on 31 January 1995.

== Tour ==
&quot;Animals&quot; became the subject material for the band&#x27;s In the Flesh Tour, which began in Dortmund on the same day the album was released. The tour continued through continental Europe in February, the UK in March, the United States for three weeks in April and May, and another three weeks in the United States in June and July. &quot;Algie&quot; became the inspiration for a number of pig themes used throughout. An inflatable pig was floated over the audience, and during each performance was replaced with a cheaper, but explosive version. On one occasion the mild propane gas was replaced with an oxygen-acetylene mixture, producing a massive (and dangerous) explosion. German promoter Marcel Avram presented the band with a piglet in Munich, only for it to leave a trail of broken mirrors and excrement across its mirrored hotel room, leaving manager O&#x27;Rourke to deal with the resulting fallout.

The band was augmented by familiar figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000-person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O&#x27;Rourke were suspicious. They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who felt that Pink Floyd had achieved the success they had sought and that there was nothing they could look forward to.

In July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat at one of them, which he later said he immediately regretted. Gilmour also felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, and refused to join his bandmates for their third encore. Waters later spoke with the producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. The incident formed the concept for the next Pink Floyd album, &quot;The Wall&quot;.

== Reception ==

&quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Animals&quot; &quot;one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music to have been made available this side of the sun&quot;, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Karl Dallas described it as an &quot;uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Frank Rose was unimpressed, writing: &quot;The 1977 Floyd has turned bitter and morose. They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). They sound like they&#x27;ve just discovered this – their message has become pointless and tedious.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a &quot;B+&quot; rating and found the negative reaction overly cynical, reasoning that the album functions simply as &quot;a piece of well-constructed political program music ... lyrical, ugly, and rousing, all in the right places&quot;. Critic Mike Cormack said &quot;Shorn of the lush textures of &quot;Dark Side&quot; or &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, Pink Floyd here are forbidding, stripped-down and muscular. &quot;Animals&quot; is to all intents and purposes their punk album; it has, with all deference to the Sex Pistols, a huge amount of bollocks. But it is largely undigestible by radio or compilation albums, and so it remains the lost great album of the Pink Floyd canon.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In his 2004 autobiography &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Mason wrote that the album&#x27;s perceived harshness, compared to previous Floyd releases, might have been the result of a &quot;workman-like mood in the studio&quot;, and an unconscious reaction to accusations from some punk artists that bands like Pink Floyd represented &quot;dinosaur rock&quot;. 

Gilmour said on Westwood One&#x27;s Pink Floyd 25th Anniversary Special about the album: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t one of the more productive periods of our life I don&#x27;t think. We used those two tracks which went back to &#x27;74, changed the names, doctored them around and stuck them on the album. I love the album; it was exciting and noisy and fun. It really had some great bits and stuff of effects on there but it was not one of our creative high points really.&quot; Wright, on the BBC Omnibus Special in 1994, said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t really like a lot of the music on the album. I didn&#x27;t fight hard to put my stuff on the album and I didn&#x27;t have anything to put on. I played well but did not contribute to the writing and also Roger was not letting me write. This was the whole start of the whole ego thing in the band, &quot;Animals&quot;.&quot;

=== Reissues ===
&quot;Animals&quot; was issued on CD in the UK in 1985, and in the US in 1987. It was reissued as a digitally remastered CD with new artwork in 1994, and as a digitally remastered limited-edition vinyl album in 1997. An anniversary edition was released in the US in the same year, followed in 2000 by a reissue from Capitol Records. It was also included in the &quot;Shine On&quot; box set in 1992, in the 2007 &quot;Oh, By The Way&quot; box set and in the 2011 &quot;Why Pink Floyd...?&quot; re-release series both in the box set and as a standalone &#x27;Discovery&#x27; edition CD.

In an April 2020 interview, Waters said he had pushed for the release of a remixed and remastered vinyl of &quot;Animals&quot; by James Guthrie, but that it had been rejected by Gilmour and Mason. In June 2021, Waters released a statement announcing a new release with stereo and 5.1 surround mixes. Waters cited a dispute with Gilmour over a set of liner notes written by Mark Blake as the reason for the delay, and posted the rejected liner notes on his website. The remix was released on 16 September 2022, on vinyl, CD, &amp; Blu-ray; a limited edition deluxe gatefold package containing the vinyl, CD, Blu-ray, and DVD copies of the remix and a 32-page book was released on 7 October 2022. A hybrid multichannel SACD of the stereo and surround remixes was released exclusively through Acoustic Sounds on 16 September 2022. The band released the 2018 remix of &quot;Dogs&quot; as a digital single on 22 July 2022. The reissue reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (its highest position since March 1977).

<doc id="155973" wikidata="Q1372180" url="?curid=155973" title="Henry Wilcoxon">
<text>Henry Wilcoxon (born Harry Frederick Wilcoxon; 8 September 1905 – 6 March 1984) was a British-American actor and film producer, born in the British West Indies. He was known as an actor in many of director Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s films, also serving as DeMille&#x27;s associate producer on his later films.

==Early life==
Wilcoxon was born on 8 September 1905 in Roseau, Dominica (then administered as part of the British West Indies). His father was English-born Robert Stanley &#x27;Tan&#x27; Wilcoxon, manager of the Colonial Bank in Jamaica and his mother, Lurline Mignonette Nunes, was a Jamaican amateur theatre actress, descendant of a wealthy Spanish merchant family.

Henry was close with his older brother, Robert Owen Wilcoxon, known as &#x27;Owen&#x27;. Henry (known then by his born name, Harry) had a difficult childhood. His mother &quot;disappeared suddenly and mysteriously&quot; (presumably she died) when he was about a year old, and his father took him and Owen (aged four) to England with the intention that his own mother, Ann Wilcoxon, would care for them. But because the grandmother was too frail to care for the children, they were first sent to a bad foster home, where they became ill from malnutrition and neglect until this was discovered by the authorities, and they were moved to an orphanage. Harry suffered from rickets, and Owen developed a stutter and had epileptic fits. They were rescued from the orphanage to a new foster home run by the more caring Stewart family, at Springfield House in Acton, London. After several years Harry&#x27;s father &#x27;Tan&#x27;, with his new wife Rosamond took the children home with them to Bridgetown, Barbados, where they were educated. Harry was sent to Wolmer&#x27;s Boys School in Kingston, Jamaica and Harrison College, Barbados. Harry later claimed that at 14 he was &#x27;almost&#x27; the underwater swimming champion of Barbados and good enough to become a salvage diver.

Harry and his brother Owen were known as &#x27;Biff&#x27; and &#x27;Bang&#x27; to friends and family due to fighting skills gained in amateur boxing.

==Acting==
After completing his education, Wilcoxon was employed by Joseph Rank, the father of J. Arthur Rank, before working for Bond Street tailors Pope and Bradshaw. While working for the tailors, Wilcoxon applied for a visa to work as a chauffeur in the United States, but upon seeing his application refused, turned to boxing, and then to acting.

===Stage===
Harry Wilcoxon&#x27;s first stage performance was as a supporting actor in an adaptation of the novel &quot;The 100th Chance&quot;, by Ethel M. Dell, in November 1927 at Blackpool, before he joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre the next year and toured &quot;for several years&quot; playing &quot;all roles that came his way.&quot; Among these roles, he found critical success playing Captain Cook in a production of Rudolph Besier&#x27;s &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; at the London Queen&#x27;s Theatre alongside Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, Scott Sunderland and Cedric Hardwicke. In June 1932, at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, he played Donald Gage alongside Edith Evans as Irela in Sir Barry Jackson&#x27;s production of Beverley Nichols&#x27; novel &quot;Evensong&quot;.

===Early screen work===

In 1931, Wilcoxon made his screen debut as &quot;Larry Tindale&quot; in &quot;The Perfect Lady&quot;, followed by a role opposite Heather Angel in &quot;Self Made Lady&quot;, alongside Louis Hayward and others. In 1932, he appeared in a remake of the 1929 film &quot;The Flying Squad&quot; (based on the novel by Edgar Wallace), reprising the role originated by future-Hitchcock regular John Longden. Altogether he made eight films in Britain prior to 1934.

Also in 1933, &quot;while acting on stage in &quot;Eight Bells&quot;, a talent scout for Paramount Pictures reportedly arranged a screen test which came to the attention of producer-director Cecil B. DeMille in Hollywood.&quot; DeMille recalls in his autobiography:

So he was renamed by DeMille for the role of Marc Antony in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and from then on he was Henry Wilcoxon.

Wilcoxon was next given the lead role of Richard the Lionheart in DeMille&#x27;s big-budget film &quot;The Crusades&quot; (1935) opposite Loretta Young. That film, however, was a financial failure, &quot;losing more than $700,000&quot;. After the lack of success of &quot;The Crusades&quot;, Wilcoxon&#x27;s career stalled; although he featured—and starred—in a number of films, most were &quot;minor B&#x27;s like &quot;The President&#x27;s Mystery&quot; and &quot;Prison Nurse&quot; for Republic [Pictures].&quot; Wilcoxon himself deemed his worst acting job to be in &quot;Mysterious Mr. Moto&quot; (1938), in which year he played in &quot;If I Were King&quot; and featured in &quot;Five of a Kind&quot; with the Dionne quintuplets.

==The war years==
In 1941, Wilcoxon appeared as Captain Hardy, alongside Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, in Alexander Korda&#x27;s &quot;Lady Hamilton&quot;, during the filming of which:

a wad of flame fell from a torch directly on Olivier&#x27;s head, setting his wig afire. Wilcoxon, standing right beside him, tried to extinguish the blaze but was unsuccessful. Finally he had to wrench the wig from Olivier&#x27;s head, but both of his hands were badly burned while Olivier&#x27;s eyebrows were scorched.&quot;

When the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, Wilcoxon enlisted in the United States Coast Guard, supposedly &quot;leaving his home twenty minutes after the announcement that the U.S. had declared war and proceeding to enlist then and there.&quot; He served with the Coast Guard until 1946, gaining the rank of lieutenant commander.

During his period of service, three films in which he appeared were released in 1942, among them &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, which received considerable public acclaim, as well as six Academy Awards. Wilcoxon, in his role as the vicar, &quot;wrote and re-wrote&quot; the key sermon with director William Wyler &quot;the night before the sequence was to be shot.&quot; The speech &quot;made such an impact that it was used in essence by President Roosevelt as a morale builder and part of it was the basis for leaflets printed in various languages and dropped over enemy and occupied territory.&quot;

Upon his return from war service, Wilcoxon &quot;picked up his relationship with Cecil B. DeMille&quot; with &quot;Unconquered&quot;, and after starring as Sir Lancelot in the 1949 musical version of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (with Bing Crosby in the title role), he featured (with &quot;fifth starring billing&quot;) in DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949). To help pre-sell the film, &quot;DeMille arranged for Wilcoxon to tour the country giving a series of lectures on the film and its research in 41 key cities in the United States and Canada.&quot; However, &quot;after the fourteenth city,&quot; Wilcoxon collapsed &quot;from a mild bout of pneumonia,&quot; (actually tuberculosis), and the tour was continued by &quot;press-agent Richard Condon and Ringling Brothers public relations man Frank Braden&quot; (who also collapsed, in Minneapolis). Condon finished touring by the time of the film&#x27;s release in October 1949. Wilcoxon, meanwhile, had returned to England under contract to feature in &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; (1950), a sequel to the multi-Oscar-winning &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942) in which he reprised his role as the vicar.

==Later life as producer and TV actor==
In the late 1940s, &quot;several young actors and actresses came to Wilcoxon and wife Joan Woodbury and asked them to form a play-reading group&quot;, which began to take shape as the &#x27;Wilcoxon Players&#x27; in 1951, when the two &quot;transformed their living room into a stage.&quot; &#x27;Guest star&#x27; performers sometimes appeared in the plays produced by the group, among them Larry Parks and Corinne Calvet, and soon the &quot;Wilcoxon Group Players Annual Nativity Play&quot; was being performed &quot;at the Miles Playhouse in Santa Monica.&quot; The group was recognised by the American Cancer Society in 1956 with a Citation of Merit, awarded for donations received by attendees of the groups Easter productions.

Wilcoxon played a &quot;small but important part&quot; in DeMille&#x27;s 1952 production &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, on which film he also served as associate producer, helping steer the film towards its Academy Award for Best Picture, 1952. He also acted as associate producer on, and acted (as Pentaur, the pharaoh&#x27;s captain of the guards) in DeMille&#x27;s remake of his own &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). Wilcoxon was sole producer on the 1958 film &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;, a remake of DeMille&#x27;s 1938 effort, which DeMille only &quot;supervised&quot; (due to his declining health) while Anthony Quinn directed.

After DeMille died, Wilcoxon did &quot;considerable work... in pre-production&quot; on &quot;a film based on the life of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scout movement,&quot; which DeMille had left unrealised, and was also ultimately abandoned.

After a relatively inactive period &quot;for the next three or four years,&quot; Wilcoxon had a &quot;chance meeting with actor Charlton Heston and director Franklin Schaffner at Universal Studios,&quot; a meeting which saw him appear in &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965), for which he again &quot;went on tour... visiting 21 cities to publicize the picture.&quot;

He was credited as co-producer on a &quot;90-minute tribute to Cecil B. DeMille televised by NBC&quot; entitled &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Showman: The Legend of Cecil B. DeMille&quot; (1963), whose production was hampered by the absence of &quot;some of DeMille&#x27;s best-remembered films of the 30s and 40s&quot; when rights-holder MCA refused their use. At the opening of the DeMille Theatre in New York, he produced a &quot;two-reel short,&quot; that in the estimation of critic Don Miller &quot;was much better than this 90-minute tribute.&quot;

In the last two decades of his life, Wilcoxon worked sporadically and accepted minor acting roles in a number of television and film productions. He guest-starred in shows including &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; and &quot;Marcus Welby, M. D.&quot;, as well as in a smaller number of films. Wilcoxon is probably best known today for his small but memorable role as the golf-obsessed Bishop Pickering in the classic 1980 comedy &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. In one scene, he plays golf in the driving rain with groundskeeper Carl, played by actor Bill Murray. It took hours to film the scene, with both actors standing under artificial rain towers and wind machines. In an interview from 2010, Murray called Wilcoxon “a great pro” who “nailed everything he did.” Wilcoxon also told Murray that the book, &quot;The Art of Dramatic Writing&quot; was an influence in his career.

==Personal life==
Through loans from the assets he acquired from his early acting career, Wilcoxon assisted his brother Owen in establishing himself in 1931 as a partner in the Vale Motor Company in London. For a short time, Henry showed a personal interest in the development of their sports car, the Vale Special. At that time his female companion was a London-based American stage actress Carol Goodner.

English-born actress Heather Angel, whom he had previously acted with in &quot;Self Made Lady&quot; (1932) when they were both in England, had come to Hollywood a few months before Wilcoxon and met him again in 1934. They became lifetime friends. She taught him horse-riding, and acted in two more films with him: &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1936) and &quot;Lady Hamilton&quot; (1941). Heather Angel and her husband Ralph Forbes were both present at Wilcoxon&#x27;s wedding to Sheila Garrett.

Wilcoxon married a 19-year-old actress Sheila Garrett on 28 June 1936, but they divorced a year later. When they had first met, two years before they were married, she was introduced by her sister Lynn Browning as &quot;Bonnie&quot;, but when they got to know each other better he preferred the name Sheila Garrett.

On 17 December 1938, he married 23 year old actress Joan Woodbury. They had three daughters: Wendy Joan Robert Wilcoxon (1939–2020), Heather Ann Wilcoxon (1947) and Cecilia Dawn &quot;CiCi&quot; Wilcoxon (1950). His second daughter was named after Heather Angel. His youngest daughter was named after Cecil B. DeMille: DeMille said he wanted the child to be called Cecil if it was a boy, but when it turned out to be a girl, DeMille was still insistent, saying &quot;I think Cecilia is a beautiful name! My daughter is named Cecilia.&quot; They divorced in 1969.
Wilcoxon was an amateur painter and photographer, whose work was exhibited on at least one occasion in London. He was also &quot;an avid antique collector and accomplished flier.&quot;

At his home in Burbank in the summer of 1975 Wilcoxon first met his niece Valerie (1933–2017), the English daughter of his brother Owen with Dorothy Drew (sister of architect Jane Drew). Up until then he did not know that his brother, killed in 1940 during the Dunkirk evacuation, had any children.

== Death ==
Wilcoxon died on March 6, 1984 in Los Angeles, at the age of 78, after suffering from cancer for a number of years.

== Recognition ==
Wilcoxon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6256 Hollywood Blvd. west of Argyle St., in front of the W Hollywood Hotel &amp; Residences and the Metro B Line Hollywood/Vine station, and across from the Pantages Theater.

<text>William John Evans (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer who worked primarily as the leader of his trio. His use of impressionist harmony, block chords, innovative chord voicings, and trademark rhythmically independent &quot;singing&quot; melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today.

Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, United States, he studied classical music at Southeastern Louisiana College and the Mannes School of Music, in New York City, where he majored in composition and received an artist diploma. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In 1958, Evans joined Miles Davis&#x27;s sextet, which in 1959, then immersed in modal jazz, recorded &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, the best-selling jazz album of all time.

In late 1959, Evans left the Miles Davis band and began his career as a leader, forming a trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, a group now regarded as a seminal modern jazz trio. They recorded two studio albums, Portrait in Jazz and Explorations, and two albums recorded during a 1961 engagement at New York&#x27;s Village Vanguard jazz club: &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;. A complete set (on three CDs) of their Vanguard recordings was issued decades later. However, ten days after this booking ended, LaFaro died in a car crash. After months without public performances, Evans reemerged with a new trio, now featuring Chuck Israels on bass. In 1963, Evans recorded &quot;Conversations with Myself&quot;, a solo album produced with overdubbing technology. In 1966, he met bassist Eddie Gómez, with whom he worked for the next 11 years. In the mid-1970s, Evans collaborated with the singer Tony Bennett on two critically acclaimed albums: &quot;The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album&quot; (1975) and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1977).

Many of Evans&#x27;s compositions, such as &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot; and &quot;Time Remembered&quot;, have become standards, played and recorded by many artists. Evans received 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Evans grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, the son of Harry and Mary Evans (). His father was of Welsh descent and ran a golf course; his mother was of Rusyn ancestry and descended from a family of coal miners. The marriage was stormy because of his father&#x27;s heavy drinking, gambling, and abuse. Bill had a brother, Harry (Harold), two years his senior, with whom he was very close.

Given Harry Evans Sr.&#x27;s destructive character, Mary Evans often left home with her sons to go to nearby Somerville, to stay with her sister Justine and the Epps family. There, Harry began piano lessons somewhere between the ages of five and seven with local teacher Helen Leland. Bill was thought to be too young for lessons, but he began to play what he had heard during his brother&#x27;s instruction, and soon both were taking piano lessons.

Evans remembered Leland with affection for not insisting on a heavy technical approach, with scales and arpeggios. He quickly developed a fluent sight-reading ability, but Leland considered Harry a better pianist. At the age of seven, Bill began violin lessons, and soon also flute and piccolo. He soon dropped those instruments, but it is believed they later influenced his keyboard style. He later named Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert as composers whose work he often played. During high school, Evans came in contact with 20th-century music like Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, which he called a &quot;tremendous experience&quot;, and Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Suite provençale&quot;, whose bitonal language he believed &quot;opened him to new things.&quot; Around the same time came his first exposure to jazz, when 12 years old he heard Tommy Dorsey and Harry James&#x27;s bands on the radio. At the age of 13, Bill stood in for a sick pianist in Buddy Valentino&#x27;s rehearsal band, where Harry was already playing the trumpet. Soon he began to perform for dances and weddings throughout New Jersey, playing music like boogie-woogie and polkas for $1 per hour. Around this time, he met multi-instrumentalist Don Elliott, with whom he later recorded. Another important influence was bassist George Platt, who introduced Evans to the theory of harmony.

Evans also listened to Earl Hines, Art Tatum, Coleman Hawkins, Bud Powell, George Shearing, Stan Getz, and Nat King Cole among others. He particularly admired Cole. Evans attended North Plainfield High School, graduating in 1946.

=== College, army, sabbatical year ===
After high school, in September 1946, Evans attended Southeastern Louisiana College on a flute scholarship. He studied classical piano interpretation with Louis P. Kohnop, John Venettozzi, and Ronald Stetzel. A key figure in Evans&#x27;s development was Gretchen Magee, whose methods of teaching left a big imprint on his compositional style.

Around his third year in college, Evans composed his first known tune, &quot;Very Early&quot;. Around that time he also composed a piece called &quot;Peace Piece&quot;. Years later, when asked to play it, he said it was a spontaneous improvisation and didn&#x27;t know it. He was a founding member of SLU&#x27;s Delta Omega chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, played quarterback for the fraternity&#x27;s football team, and played in the college band. In 1950, he performed Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 on his senior recital, graduating with a Bachelor of Music in piano and a bachelor&#x27;s in music education. Evans regarded his last three years in college as the happiest of his life.
During college, Evans met guitarist Mundell Lowe, and after graduating, they formed a trio with bassist Red Mitchell. The three relocated to New York City, but their inability to attract bookings prompted them to leave for Calumet City, Illinois. In July 1950, Evans joined Herbie Fields&#x27;s band, based in Chicago. During the summer, the band did a three-month tour backing Billie Holiday, including East Coast appearances at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater and shows in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The band included trumpeter Jimmy Nottingham, trombonist Frank Rosolino and bassist Jim Aton. Upon its return to Chicago, Evans and Aton worked as a duo in clubs, often backing singer Lurlean Hunter. Shortly thereafter, Evans received his draft notice and entered the U.S. Army.

During his three-year (1951–54) period in the Army, Evans played flute, piccolo, and piano in the Fifth U.S. Army Band at Fort Sheridan. He hosted a jazz program on the camp radio station and occasionally performed in Chicago clubs, where he met singer Lucy Reed, with whom he became friends and later recorded. He met singer and bassist Bill Scott and Chicago jazz pianist Sam Distefano (his bunkmate in their platoon), both of whom became Evans&#x27;s close friends. Evans&#x27;s stay in the Army was traumatic, however, and he had nightmares for years. As people criticized his musical conceptions and playing, he lost confidence for the first time. Around 1953, Evans composed his best-known tune, &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;, for his young niece. During this period, he began using recreational drugs, occasionally smoking marijuana.

Evans was discharged from the Army in January 1954, and entered a period of seclusion triggered by the harsh criticism he had received. He took a sabbatical year and lived with his parents, where he set up a studio, acquired a grand piano and worked on his technique, believing he lacked the natural fluency of other musicians. He visited his brother, now in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, recently married and working as a conservatory teacher.

=== Return to New York City ===
In July 1955, Evans returned to New York City and enrolled in the Mannes College of Music for a three-semester postgraduate course in music composition. He also wrote classical settings of poems by William Blake. Along with his studies, Evans played in low-profile &quot;Tuxedo gigs&quot; at the Friendship Club and the Roseland Ballroom, as well as Jewish weddings, intermission spots, and over-40 dances. Better opportunities also arose, such as playing solo opposite the Modern Jazz Quartet at the Village Vanguard, where one day he saw Miles Davis listening to him. During this period, Evans also met Thelonious Monk.

Evans soon began to perform in Greenwich Village clubs with Don Elliott, Tony Scott, Mundell Lowe, and bandleader Jerry Wald. He may have played on some of Wald&#x27;s discs, but his first proven Wald recording is &quot;Listen to the Music of Jerry Wald&quot;, which also featured his future drummer Paul Motian.

In early 1955, singer Lucy Reed moved to New York City to play at the Village Vanguard and The Blue Angel, and in August she recorded &quot;The Singing Reed&quot; with a four-piece group that included Evans. During this period, he met two of Reed&#x27;s friends: manager Helen Keane, who became his agent seven years later, and George Russell, with whom he soon worked. That year, he recorded with guitarist Dick Garcia on &quot;A Message from Garcia&quot; for the Dawn label. In parallel, Evans kept up his work with Scott, playing in Preview&#x27;s Modern Jazz Club in Chicago during December 1956–January 1957, and recording &quot;The Complete Tony Scott&quot;. After the &quot;Complete&quot; sessions, Scott left for a long overseas tour.

=== Debut album &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot; ===
In September 1956, producer Orrin Keepnews was convinced to record the reluctant Evans by a demo tape Mundell Lowe played to him over the phone. The result was his debut album, &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot;, featuring the original versions of &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot; and &quot;Five&quot;. Eleven songs were recorded in the first session, including Evans&#x27; original composition &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;, which would prove to be his most recognized and recorded composition. The album began Evans&#x27;s relationship with Riverside Records, and also marked the formation of the first Bill Evans trio with Teddy Kotick (bass) and Paul Motian (drums). AllMusic critic Scott Yanow said about the album: &quot;Bill Evans&#x27; debut as a leader found the 27-year-old pianist already sounding much different than the usual Bud Powell-influenced keyboardists of the time... A strong start to a rather significant career.&quot; David Rickert of All About Jazz noted the influence of Bud Powell and wrote &quot;Even at this stage he had the chops to make this a good piano jazz album, but in the end it&#x27;s not a very good Bill Evans album... There are glimpses of the later trademarks of Evans&#x27; style...&quot; Although a critical success that gained positive reviews in &quot;DownBeat&quot; and &quot;Metronome&quot; magazines, &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot; was initially a financial failure, selling only 800 copies the first year. &quot;Five&quot; was for some time Evans&#x27;s trio farewell tune during performances. After the album&#x27;s release, Evans spent much time studying J. S. Bach&#x27;s music to improve his technique.

=== Work with George Russell ===

Evans met composer George Russell during his tenure with Lucy Reed. Russell&#x27;s first impression of Evans was negative (&quot;this is going to be like pulling teeth all day&quot;), but when he secretly heard Evans play, he completely changed his mind. Russell was then developing his magnum opus, the treatise &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot;, in which he argued that the Lydian mode was more compatible with tonality than the major scale used in most music. This was groundbreaking in jazz, and soon influenced musicians like Miles Davis. Evans, who was already acquainted with these ideas, began to work with Russell in 1956.

By this time, RCA Victor had begun a series of recordings called &quot;Jazz Workshop&quot;, and soon Russell, through the intervention of Hal McKusick and Jack Lewis, gained his own record date titled The Jazz Workshop and released in 1957. At that time, Russell assembled trumpeter Art Farmer, guitarist Barry Galbraith, bassist Milt Hinton and Bill Evans on piano for three recording dates, along with several rehearsal sessions. Initially, for these sessions, only the bassist was given a written part, while the rest were left, and, according to Farmer, &quot;took the parts at home and tried to come to terms with them&quot;. The album took a year to make, and was successful enough to enable Russell to escape his penurious lifestyle. Evans performed a significant solo in &quot;Concerto for Billy the Kid&quot;.
In 1957, Russell was one of six composers (three jazz, three classical) Brandeis University commissioned to write a piece for its Festival of the Creative Arts in the context of the first experiments in third stream jazz. Russell wrote a suite for orchestra, &quot;All About Rosie&quot;, that featured Evans, among other soloists. &quot;All About Rosie&quot; has been cited as one of the few convincing examples of composed polyphony in jazz. A week before the festival, the piece was previewed on TV, and Evans&#x27;s performance was deemed &quot;legendary&quot; in jazz circles. During the festival performance, on June 6, Evans became acquainted with Chuck Israels, who became his bassist years later. During the Brandeis Festival, guitarist Joe Puma invited Evans to play on the album &quot;Joe Puma/Jazz&quot;.
That year, Evans also met bassist Scott LaFaro while auditioning him for a place in an ensemble led by trumpeter Chet Baker, and was impressed. LaFaro joined his trio three years later.

Evans also performed on albums by Charles Mingus, Oliver Nelson, Tony Scott, Eddie Costa and Art Farmer.

=== Work with Miles Davis, &quot;Everybody Digs Bill Evans&quot;, and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; ===
In February 1958, at Miles Davis&#x27;s urging, Russell drove Evans over to the Colony Club in Brooklyn, to play with Davis&#x27; sextet. At this time, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones were the other members of Davis&#x27; group. Red Garland had recently been fired, and Evans knew he was not merely filling in for one night but auditioning to become the group&#x27;s regular pianist. By the end of the night, Davis told Evans that he would be playing their next engagement in Philadelphia. The band had been known for playing a mixture of jazz standards and bebop originals, but by the time Evans arrived, Davis had begun his venture into modal jazz, having just released his album &quot;Milestones&quot;.

Evans formally joined the Miles Davis group in April 1958. The band appeared in radio broadcasts on Saturday nights and, on May 3, the new formation made its first broadcast from Café Bohemia (its usual locale). The live radio appearance that was broadcast on May 17, 1958, and also released on the album titled &quot;Makin&#x27; Wax&quot;, is known as the earliest documented evidence of the collaboration between Bill Evans and Miles Davis. By mid-May, Jimmy Cobb replaced Philly Joe Jones, with whom Evans had developed a close friendship. On May 26, Evans made his first studio recordings with Davis, which were first issued as part of &quot;Jazz Track&quot;, and later reissued on &quot;1958 Miles&quot;.

A performance of the Ballets Africains from Guinea in 1958 sparked Davis&#x27; interest in modal music. This music stayed for long periods of time on a single chord, weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance. Another influence was George Russell&#x27;s treatise. Both influences coalesced in Davis&#x27; conception of modal jazz offering an alternative to chord changes and major/minor key relationships, relying instead on a series of modal scales. He realized that Evans, who had worked with Russell, could follow him into modal music. At the same time, Evans introduced Davis to twentieth-century classical composers such as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Maurice Ravel, and Aram Khachaturian.

The band&#x27;s mostly black followers did not react favourably to the replacement of Garland with a white musician. Davis used to tease him and Evans&#x27;s sensitivity perhaps let it get to him. However, the band began to find a new, smoother groove, as Adderley recalled: &quot;When he started to use Bill, Miles changed his style from very hard to a softer approach.&quot;

In July 1958, Evans appeared as a sideman on Adderley&#x27;s album &quot;Portrait of Cannonball&quot;, featuring the first performance of &quot;Nardis&quot;, specially written by Davis for the session. While Davis was not very satisfied with the performance, he said that from then on, Evans was the only one to play it in the way he wanted. The piece came to be associated with Evans&#x27;s future trios, which played it frequently.

By the end of the summer, Davis knew Evans was quickly approaching his full professional development; and that he would soon decide to leave Davis&#x27; group. This year, Evans won the &quot;DownBeat&quot; International Critics&#x27; Poll for his work with Davis and his album &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot;.

In September 1958, Evans recorded as a sideman in Art Farmer&#x27;s album &quot;Modern Art&quot;, also featuring Benny Golson. All three had won the &quot;DownBeat&quot; poll. Later, Evans deemed this record as one of his favorites. During this period, despite all the successes, Evans was visiting a psychiatrist, as he was unsure whether he wanted to continue as a pianist.

Evans left Davis&#x27; sextet in November 1958 and stayed with his parents in Florida and his brother in Louisiana. While he was burned out, one of the main reasons for leaving was his father&#x27;s illness. During this sojourn, the always self-critical Evans suddenly felt his playing had improved. &quot;While I was staying with my brother in Baton Rouge, I remember finding that somehow I had reached a new level of expression in my playing. It had come almost automatically, and I was very anxious about it, afraid I might lose it.&quot;

Shortly after, he moved back to New York, and in December Evans recorded the trio album &quot;Everybody Digs Bill Evans&quot; for Riverside Records with bassist Sam Jones and drummer Philly Joe Jones. This was Evans&#x27;s second album as a leader, the first since &quot;New Jazz Conceptions&quot;, recorded two years earlier. While producer Orrin Keepnews had many times tried to persuade Evans to make a second trio recording, the pianist felt he had nothing new to say ... until then. He had also been too busy traveling with Davis to make a record.
One of the pieces to appear on the album was Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Some Other Time&quot;. Evans started to play an introduction using an ostinato figure. However, according to Keepnews, who was present, the pianist spontaneously started to improvise over that harmonic frame, creating the recording that would be named &quot;Peace Piece&quot;. According to Evans: &quot;What happened was that I started to play the introduction, and it started to get so much of its own feeling and identity that I just figured, well, I&#x27;ll keep going.&quot; However, Gretchen Magee claims that the piece had been penned as an exercise during his college years, while Peri Cousins says that he would often play the piece at home.

Evans returned to the Davis sextet in early 1959, at the trumpeter&#x27;s request, to record &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, often considered the best-selling jazz album of all time.

As usual, during the sessions of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, Miles Davis called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. Davis had given the band only sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set about taping the sextet in studio.

During the creative process of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, Davis handed Evans a piece of paper with two chords—G minor and A augmented—and asked &quot;What would you do with that?&quot; Evans spent the next night writing what would become &quot;Blue in Green&quot;. However, when the album came out, the song was attributed exclusively to Davis. When Evans suggested he might deserve a share of the royalties, Davis offered him a check for $25. Evans also penned the liner notes for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, comparing jazz improvisation to Japanese visual art. By the fall of 1959, Evans had started his own trio with Jimmy Garrison and Kenny Dennis, but it was short-lived.

Sometime during the late 1950s, most probably before joining Miles Davis, Evans began using heroin. Philly Joe Jones has been cited as an especially bad influence in this aspect. Although Davis seems to have tried to help Evans kick his addiction, he did not succeed.

Evans&#x27;s first long-term romance was with a black woman named Peri Cousins (for whom &quot;Peri&#x27;s Scope&quot; was named), during the second half of the 1950s. The couple had problems booking in hotels during Evans&#x27;s gigs, since most of them did not allow inter-racial couples. By the turn of the decade, Evans had met a waitress named Ellaine Schultz, who would become his partner for twelve years.

=== Piano trios featured on commercially released recordings ===



==== Trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian ====
In mid-1959, Evans was performing at Basin Street East, and was visited by bassist Scott LaFaro, who was playing with singer and pianist Bobby Scott at a club around the corner. LaFaro expressed interest in forming a trio, and suggested Paul Motian, who had appeared on Evans&#x27;s album New Jazz Conceptions, as the drummer for the new group. The trio with LaFaro and Motian became one of the most celebrated piano trios in jazz. With this group Evans&#x27;s focus settled on traditional jazz standards and original compositions, with an added emphasis on interplay among band members. Evans and LaFaro would achieve a high level of musical empathy. In December 1959 the band recorded its first album, &quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; for Riverside Records.

In early 1960, the trio began a tour that brought them to Boston, San Francisco (at Jazz Workshop), and Chicago (at the Sutherland Lounge). After returning to New York in February, the band performed at Town Hall on a multi-artist bill, and then began a residency at Birdland. While the trio did not produce any studio records in 1960, two bootleg recordings from radio broadcasts from April and May were illegally released in the early 1970s, which infuriated Evans. Later, they would be posthumously issued as &quot;The 1960 Birdland Sessions&quot;.

In parallel with his trio work, Evans kept working as a backing musician for other bandleaders. In 1960, he performed on singer Frank Minion&#x27;s album &quot;The Soft Land of Make Believe&quot;, featuring versions of the &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; compositions &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; and &quot;So What&quot; with added lyrics. That year, he also recorded &quot;The Soul of Jazz Percussion&quot;, with Philly Joe Jones and Chambers.

In May 1960, the trio performed at one of the Jazz Profiles concerts, a series organized by Charles Schwartz. Around this time, Evans hired Monte Kay as his manager. During one of his concerts at the Jazz Gallery, Evans contracted hepatitis, and went to his parents&#x27; house in Florida to recuperate. During this time period, Evans also participated in the recordings &quot;The Great Kai &amp; J. J.&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Kai Winding Trombones&quot; for Impulse! Records. In May and August 1960, Evans appeared on George Russell&#x27;s album &quot;Jazz in the Space Age.&quot; In late 1960, he performed on &quot;Jazz Abstractions&quot;, an album recorded under the leadership of Gunther Schuller and John Lewis.

Evans&#x27; trio with Motian and LaFaro recorded &quot;Explorations&quot; in February 1961, the group&#x27;s second and final studio album. According to Orrin Keepnews, the atmosphere during the recording sessions was tense, Evans and LaFaro having had an argument over extra-musical matters. Additionally, Evans was suffering at the session from headaches, and LaFaro was playing with a loaned bass. The disc features the Evans&#x27; first trio version of &quot;Nardis&quot;, the Miles Davis piece Evans had recorded with Cannonball Adderley for Adderley&#x27;s Portrait of Cannonball album in 1958. Apart from &quot;Nardis&quot; and &quot;Elsa&quot;, the album consisted of jazz standards. After the recording sessions, Evans was initially unwilling to release the album, believing the trio had played badly. However, upon hearing the recording, he changed his mind, and later thought of it in very positive terms. In February 1961, shortly after the &quot;Explorations&quot; sessions, he appeared as a sideman in Oliver Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;.

In late June 1961, Riverside recorded Evans&#x27; trio live at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the albums &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot;, and &quot;Waltz for Debby.&quot; (Further recordings from this performance were issued in 1984 as &quot;More From The Vanguard.&quot;) Evans later showed special satisfaction with these recordings, seeing them as the culmination of the musical interplay of his trio.

=== After LaFaro&#x27;s death ===
The death of 25-year-old LaFaro in a car crash, ten days after the Vanguard performances, devastated Evans. He did not record or perform in public again for several months.

In October 1961, persuaded by his producer Orrin Keepnews, Evans returned to the musical scene on the Mark Murphy album &quot;Rah&quot;. With new bassist Chuck Israels, they recorded in December a session for &quot;Nirvana&quot;, with flautist Herbie Mann. In April and May 1962, Evans completed the duo album, &quot;Undercurrent&quot;, with guitarist Jim Hall.

When he re-formed his trio in 1962, two albums, &quot;Moon Beams&quot; and &quot;How My Heart Sings!&quot; resulted. In 1963, at the beginning of his association with Verve, he recorded &quot;Conversations with Myself&quot;, an album which featured overdubbing, layering up to three individual tracks of piano for each song. The album won him his first Grammy award.

Evans&#x27;s heroin addiction increased following LaFaro&#x27;s death. His girlfriend Ellaine Schultz was also an addict. Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down. Evans said: &quot;You don&#x27;t understand. It&#x27;s like death and transfiguration. Every day you wake in pain like death and then you go out and score, and that is transfiguration. Each day becomes all of life in microcosm.&quot;

Evans never allowed heroin to interfere with his musical discipline, according to a 2010 BBC record review article which contrasts Evans&#x27;s addiction with that of Chet Baker. On one occasion while injecting heroin, Evans hit a nerve and temporarily disabled it, performing a full week&#x27;s engagement at the Village Vanguard virtually one-handed. During this time, Helen Keane began having an important influence, as she gave significant assistance helping to maintain Evans&#x27;s career despite his self-destructive lifestyle, and the two developed a strong friendship.

In summer 1963, Evans and Schultz left their flat in New York and settled in his parents&#x27; home in Florida, where, it seems, they quit the habit for some time. Even though never legally married, Bill and Ellaine were, in all other respects, husband and wife. At that time, Schultz meant everything to Evans, and was the only person with whom he felt genuine comfort.

Although he recorded many albums for Verve, their artistic quality has typically been viewed as uneven. Despite Israels&#x27; fast development and the creativity of new drummer Larry Bunker, the album &quot;Bill Evans Trio with Symphony Orchestra&quot;, featuring Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Pavane&quot; and works of other classical composers arranged by Claus Ogerman, divided critical opinion. Some recordings in unusual contexts were made, such as a concert recording with a big-band recorded at Town Hall, New York that was never issued owing to Evans&#x27;s dissatisfaction with it (although the more successful jazz trio portion of the concert was released). Live recordings and bootleg radio broadcasts from this time period represent some of the trio&#x27;s better work.

In 1965, the trio with Chuck Israels and Larry Bunker went on a well-received European tour.

=== Bill Evans meets Eddie Gómez ===
In 1966, Bill Evans met Puerto-Rico born, Juilliard-graduated bassist Eddie Gómez. In what turned out to be an eleven-year stay, Gómez sparked new developments in Evans&#x27;s trio conception. One of the most significant releases during this period is &quot;Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival&quot; (1968), which won him his second Grammy award. It has remained a critical favorite, and is one of two albums Evans made with drummer Jack DeJohnette.

Other highlights from this period include &quot;Solo – In Memory of His Father&quot; from &quot;Bill Evans at Town Hall&quot; (1966), which also introduced &quot;Turn Out the Stars&quot;; a second pairing with guitarist Jim Hall, &quot;Intermodulation&quot; (1966); and the solo album &quot;Alone&quot; (1968, featuring a 14-minute version of &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;), that won his third Grammy award.

In 1968, drummer Marty Morell joined the trio and remained until 1975, when he retired to family life. This was Evans&#x27;s most stable, longest-lasting group. Evans had overcome his heroin habit and was entering a period of personal stability.

Between 1969 and 1970, Evans recorded &quot;From Left to Right&quot;, featuring his first use of electric piano.

Between May and June 1971, Evans recorded &quot;The Bill Evans Album&quot;, which won two Grammy awards. This all-originals album (four new), also featured alternation between acoustic and electric piano. One of these was &quot;Comrade Conrad&quot;, a tune that had originated as a Crest toothpaste jingle and had later been reelaborated and dedicated to Conrad Mendenhall, a friend who had died in a car crash.

Other albums included &quot;The Tokyo Concert&quot; (1973); &quot;Since We Met&quot; (1974); and &quot;But Beautiful&quot; (1974; released in 1996), featuring the trio plus saxophonist Stan Getz in live performances from the Netherlands and Belgium. Morell was an energetic, straight-ahead drummer, unlike many of the trio&#x27;s former percussionists, and many critics feel that this was a period of little growth for Evans. After Morell left, Evans and Gómez recorded two duo albums, &quot;Intuition&quot; and &quot;Montreux III&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Evans was caught at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport with a suitcase containing heroin. Although the police put him in jail for the night, he was not charged. However, both he and Ellaine had to begin methadone treatment.

In 1973, while working in Redondo Beach, California, Evans met and fell in love with Nenette Zazzara, despite his long-term relationship with Ellaine Schultz. When Evans broke the news to Schultz she pretended to understand but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train. Evans&#x27;s relatives believe that Schultz&#x27;s infertility, coupled with Bill&#x27;s desire to have a son, may have influenced those events. As a result, Evans went back on heroin for a while before resuming methadone treatment. In August 1973, Evans married Nenette, and, in 1975, they had a child, Evan. The new family, which also included Evans&#x27;s stepdaughter Maxine, lived in a large house in Closter, New Jersey. Both remained very close until his death. Nenette and Bill remained married until Evans&#x27;s death in 1980.

In 1974, Bill Evans recorded a multimovement jazz concerto written for him by Claus Ogerman entitled &quot;Symbiosis&quot;.

=== Collaboration with Tony Bennett ===
During the mid-1970s Bill Evans collaborated with the singer Tony Bennett on two critically acclaimed albums: &quot;The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album&quot; (1975) and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1977).
It was Tony Bennett who initiated the collaboration with Bill Evans. The two musicians had mutual respect for each other&#x27;s talent. Bennett and Evans performed together for about two years. Although Evans was using cocaine regularly during this period, he was reported sober when recording the albums with Bennett.

Both Bennett and Evans stated that it was not just a singer with accompanist affair, but rather a mutually stimulated creative effort to enhance some well known hits with a new twist on familiar melodies and harmonies. Harmonically sophisticated piano arrangements by Evans and his extended piano solos were encouraged by Bennett to emphasize equally valuable input from both musicians.
Bennett and Evans recorded the first album in four studio sessions in June 1975, and the second album in four studio sessions in September 1976. Between the two recordings, Bennett and Evans performed live as a duo, featuring songs from their recordings including &quot;But Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, &quot;Dream Dancing&quot;.

=== Last years ===
In 1975, Morell was replaced by drummer Eliot Zigmund. Several collaborations followed, and it was not until 1977 that the trio was able to record an album together. Both &quot;I Will Say Goodbye&quot; (Evans&#x27;s last album for Fantasy Records) and &quot;You Must Believe in Spring&quot; (for Warner Bros.) highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of Evans&#x27;s life. A greater emphasis was placed on group improvisation and interaction, and new harmonic experiments were attempted.
Gómez and Zigmund left Evans in 1978. Evans then asked Philly Joe Jones, the drummer he considered his &quot;all-time favorite drummer&quot;, to fill in. Several bassists were tried, with Michael Moore staying the longest. Evans finally settled on Marc Johnson on bass and Joe LaBarbera on drums. This trio would be Evans&#x27;s last.
In April 1979, Evans met Laurie Verchomin, a Canadian waitress (later, a writer) with whom he had a relationship until his death. Verchomin was 28 years younger.

At the beginning of a several-week tour of the trio through the Pacific Northwest in the spring of 1979, Evans learned that his brother, Harry, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had died by suicide at the age of
52. This news shocked him deeply, and some of the concerts had to be canceled. His friends and relatives believe that this event precipitated his own death the following year.

Marc Johnson recalled: &quot;This fateful trip marks ... the beginning of the end. Bill&#x27;s willingness to play and work decreased noticeably after the death of Harry, actually it was just the music itself that held him upright. He fulfilled his obligations because he needed money, but these were the few moments in his life when he felt comfortable—the times in between must have been depressing, and he barely showed a willingness to live.&quot;

In August 1979, Evans recorded his last studio album, &quot;We Will Meet Again&quot;, featuring a composition of the same name written for his brother. The album won a Grammy award posthumously in 1981, along with &quot;I Will Say Goodbye&quot;.

=== Drug addiction and death ===

During the late 1970s, Evans kicked his heroin habit, with the help of methadone, only to become addicted to cocaine. He started with one gram per weekend, but later started taking several grams daily. His brother Harry&#x27;s suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979. His sister-in-law Pat Evans has stated that she knew Bill would not last long after Harry&#x27;s death and she wondered if that is what prompted her to buy three plots in a Baton Rouge Cemetery, where Harry was interred. It has been documented that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis. Laurie Verchomin has said that Evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short time.

==Death==
On September 15, 1980, Evans, who had been in bed for several days with stomach pains at his home in Fort Lee, was accompanied by Joe LaBarbera and Verchomin to the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, where he died that afternoon. The cause of death was a combination of peptic ulcer, cirrhosis, bronchial pneumonia, and untreated hepatitis. Evans&#x27;s friend Gene Lees described Evans&#x27;s struggle with drugs as &quot;the longest suicide in history&quot;.

He was interred in Baton Rouge, next to his brother Harry. Services were held in Manhattan on Friday, September 19. A tribute, planned by producer Orrin Keepnews and Tom Bradshaw, was held on the following Monday, September 22, at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. Fellow musicians paid homage to the late pianist in the first days of the 1980 Monterey Jazz Festival, which had opened that very week: Dave Brubeck played his own &quot;In Your Own Sweet Way&quot; on the 19th, The Manhattan Transfer would follow on the 20th, while John Lewis dedicated &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot;. In 1981, Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays released the piece &quot;September Fifteenth (dedicated to Bill Evans)&quot; on their album &quot;As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls&quot;.

== Music and style ==
Bill Evans is credited with influencing the harmonic language of jazz piano. Evans&#x27;s harmony was itself influenced by impressionist composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel.
His versions of jazz standards, as well as his own compositions, often featured thorough reharmonisations. Musical features included added tone chords, modal inflections, unconventional substitutions, and modulations.
One of Evans&#x27;s distinctive harmonic traits is excluding the root in his chords, leaving this work to the bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. &quot;If I am going to be sitting here playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine.&quot; This idea had already been explored by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Red Garland. In Evans&#x27;s system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color. Most of Evans&#x27;s harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings. Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano. Lying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, and at the same time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.

Evans&#x27;s improvisations relied heavily on motivic development, either melodically or rhythmically. Motives may be broken and recombined to form melodies. Another characteristic of Evans&#x27;s style is rhythmic displacement. His melodic contours often describe arches. Other characteristics include sequenciation of melodies and transforming one motive into another. He plays with one hand in the time signature of 4/4 and the other momentarily in 3/4.

At the beginning of his career, Evans used block chords heavily. He later abandoned them in part.
During a 1978 interview, Marian McPartland asked:
: &quot;How do you think your playing has changed since you first started? Is it deliberate or is it just happening to change?&quot;

: Bill Evans: &quot;Well it&#x27;s deliberate, ahh but I stay along the same lines ... I try to get a little deeper into what I&#x27;m doing. As far as that kind of playing goes, [jazz playing rather than an earlier example where he played Waltz for Debbie without any improvisation or sense of swing], I think my left hand is a little more competent and uhh ... of course I worked a lot on inner things happening like inner voices I&#x27;ve worked on.&quot;
At least during his late years, Evans&#x27;s favorite keys to play in were A and E. Evans greatly valued Bach&#x27;s music, which influenced his playing style and which helped him gain good touch and finger independence. &quot;Bach changed my hand approach to playing the piano. I used to use a lot of finger technique when I was younger, and I changed over to a weight technique. Actually, if you play Bach and the voices sing at all, and sustain the way they should, you really can&#x27;t play it with the wrong approach.&quot; Evans valued Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and his &quot;Two- and Three-Part Inventions&quot; as excellent practice material.

In an interview with Len Lyons, Evans said, &quot;for me, technique is the ability to translate your ideas into sound through your instrument.&quot;

=== Influences ===

In an interview given in 1964, Evans described Bud Powell as his single greatest influence. Biographer Peter Pettinger notes that Evans &quot;assimilated &#x27;a thousand influences,&#x27;&quot; including pianists such as Dave Brubeck, George Shearing, Oscar Peterson, Al Haig, and Lou Levy as well as horn players such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Stan Getz. &quot;The biggest influence on Evans [in his early days], though, was the pianism of Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole,&quot; whom Evans called &quot;one of the tastiest and just swingin&#x27;est and beautifully melodic improvisers and jazz pianists that jazz has ever known, and he was one of the very first that really grabbed me hard.&quot; Pettinger also notes that the &quot;work of the pianist Lennie Tristano, with his cool approach to a line&quot; was an important influence on Evans, and Lyons observes that Tristano preceded Evans in his use of overdubbing piano tracks. In addition, Evans was heavily influenced by his in-depth studies of European classical music: &quot;The constructional knowledge of music that Evans later brought to jazz was firmly rooted in this European tradition, as was his thoroughly trained and exquisitely refined touch at the keyboard.&quot;

As a composer, Evans also assimilated and amalgamated jazz, popular, and classical influences in an &quot;utterly logical&quot; manner. His compositional style shows similarities to and influences from some of the composers whose works he often played, such as Earl Zindars and Michel Legrand. J. William Murray notes that &quot;Evans was very adept at drawing Western European compositional techniques into jazz and there are elements of Bach, Chopin, Debussy, and Ravel in his writing.&quot;

=== Views on contemporaneous music tendencies ===
Evans&#x27;s career began just before the rock explosion in the 1960s. During this decade, jazz was swept into a corner, and most new talents had few opportunities to gain recognition, especially in America. However, Evans believed he had been lucky to gain some exposure before this profound change in the music world, and never had problems gaining bookings and recording opportunities.

Evans never embraced new music movements; he kept his style intact. For example, he lamented watching Davis shift his style towards jazz fusion and blamed the change on considerations of commerce. Evans commented, &quot;I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master [Davis], but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days, that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music.&quot; However, Evans and Davis kept in touch throughout their lives.

While Evans considered himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album &quot;From Left to Right&quot; on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (such as Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up returning to the acoustic sound. &quot;I don&#x27;t think too much about the electronic thing, except that it&#x27;s kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. ... [It&#x27;s] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers a certain kind of sound that&#x27;s appropriate sometimes. I find that it&#x27;s a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don&#x27;t need it ... I don&#x27;t enjoy spending a lot of time with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, and I want to get back to the acoustic piano.&quot; He commented that electronic music: &quot;just doesn&#x27;t attract me. I&#x27;m of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege.&quot;

== Repertoire and compositions ==

Evans&#x27;s repertoire consisted of established jazz standards, songs by contemporaries (some of which he helped become standards), and original compositions (some of which have also gone on to become standards). Among the major American songwriters, he was particularly drawn to the work of Jimmy Van Heusen, recording what was reputedly his favorite song, &quot;But Beautiful,&quot; many times in various settings as well as many other tunes by Van Heusen. Contemporaries whose works he often played include Michel Legrand, Johnny Mandel, and Earl Zindars as well as, to a lesser extent, Burt Bacharach, John Lewis, Henry Mancini, Gary McFarland, Thelonious Monk, Claus Ogerman, Steve Swallow, and Denny Zeitlin. Other songs by his contemporaries and colleagues he recorded include &quot;In Your Own Sweet Way&quot; by Dave Brubeck, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Hear from Me&quot; by André Previn, &quot;The Peacocks&quot; by Jimmy Rowles, &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; by Herbie Hancock, and, atypically, &quot;I Do It for Your Love&quot; by Paul Simon, which nonetheless &quot;continued to inspire the pianist&#x27;s most complex thoughts&quot; in his final years. &quot;Nardis&quot; by Miles Davis was a special signature tune, often performed in highly extended versions by his final trio.

During a radio interview, Marian McPartland listened to Evans play &quot;Reflections in D&quot; by Duke Ellington and later noted, &quot;Sitting next to him, listening to the rise and fall of the melody, I realized that ... he chooses some of the most romantic, evocative tunes there are. The tune ended softly with a chord so perfect it took my breath away.&quot;

Evans composed more than 50 originals. Many were dedicated to people close to him. Some known examples include &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot; for his niece; &quot;For Nenette&quot; for his wife; &quot;Letter to Evan&quot; for his son; &quot;NYC&#x27;s No Lark&quot;, an anagram of Sonny Clark in memory of his friend the pianist; &quot;Re: Person I Knew&quot;, another anagram, of the name of his friend and producer Orrin Keepnews; &quot;We Will Meet Again&quot; for his brother; &quot;Peri&#x27;s Scope&quot; for girlfriend Peri Cousins; &quot;One for Helen&quot; and &quot;Song for Helen&quot; for his manager Helen Keane; &quot;B minor Waltz (For Ellaine)&quot; for girlfriend Ellaine Schultz; &quot;Laurie&quot; for girlfriend Laurie Verchomin; &quot;Yet Ne&#x27;er Broken&quot; an, anagram of the name of cocaine dealer Robert Kenney; &quot;Maxine&quot; for his stepdaughter; &quot;Tiffany&quot; for Joe LaBarbera&#x27;s daughter; and &quot;Knit For Mary F.&quot; for fan Mary Franksen from Omaha.

== Personal life ==
Bill Evans was an avid reader, in particular philosophy and humorous books. His shelves held works by Plato, Voltaire, Whitehead, Santayana, Freud, Margaret Mead, Sartre and Thomas Merton; and he had a special fondness for Thomas Hardy&#x27;s work. He was fascinated with Eastern religions and philosophies including Islam, Zen, and Buddhism. It was Evans who introduced John Coltrane to the Indian philosophy of Krishnamurti.

Evans liked to paint and draw. He was also a keen golfer, a hobby that began on his father&#x27;s golf course. Evans had a fondness for horse racing and frequently gambled hundreds of dollars, often winning. During his last years, he even owned a racehorse named &quot;Annie Hall&quot; with producer Jack Rollins.

In 1973, Evans broke up with his girlfriend of twelve years, Ellaine Schultz, to pursue Nenette Zazzara. Schultz then committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a subway train.

Evans married Zazzara in August 1973. They met while Bill&#x27;s trio was performing at Howard Rumsey&#x27;s club Concerts By The Sea in Redondo Beach, California, where Zazzara was a part-time waitress.

== Reception ==

Music critic Richard S. Ginell wrote: &quot;With the passage of time, Bill Evans has become an entire school unto himself for pianists and a singular mood unto himself for listeners. There is no more influential jazz-oriented pianist—only McCoy Tyner exerts nearly as much pull among younger players and journeymen.&quot;

During his short tenure with Davis in 1958, when the band left New York to go on the road, Evans sometimes received cold receptions from the mostly black audiences. Evans later acknowledged that some felt his presence threatened the black pride aspect of the famed Davis band&#x27;s success. Pettinger believed in a recording, for his solo on a tune named &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot;, Evans received noticeably less applause than the other soloists, and for that on &quot;All Of You&quot;, none at all. Davis and the other band members would respond &quot;he&#x27;s supposed to be there, Miles wants him there&quot; on the bandstand whenever audience members made comments. Davis noted in his autobiography that Evans was sensitive to the criticism and let it get to him. This might have been a contributing factor to Evans leaving the band after just seven months.

When Ken Burns&#x27; television miniseries &quot;Jazz&quot; was released in 2001, it was criticised for neglecting Evans&#x27;s work after his departure from the Miles Davis&#x27; sextet.

== Legacy and influence ==
Author and jazz pianist Len Lyons wrote: &quot;Evans was the most influential pianist of the 1960&#x27;s. The tone, touch, texture, and harmonic richness of his playing affected the majority of pianists who followed him.&quot; Evans has left his mark on such players as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Paul Bley, Keith Jarrett, Steve Kuhn, Warren Bernhardt, Michel Petrucciani, John Taylor, Vince Guaraldi, Stefano Bollani, Don Friedman, Marian McPartland, Denny Zeitlin, Bobo Stenson, Fred Hersch, Bill Charlap, Lyle Mays, Eliane Elias, Diana Krall, Ralph Towner, John McLaughlin, Lenny Breau, Rick Wright of Pink Floyd, Denis Matsuev, and many other musicians in jazz and other music genres. His recordings have been transcribed and arranged by Jed Distler and others and recorded by classical musicians such as the Kronos Quartet, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Roy Eaton, and Igor Levit.

Evans&#x27;s piano style has also influenced some contemporary classical composers. The noted Hungarian composer György Ligeti admired Evans and acknowledged his influence in an interview, adding, &quot;As far as touch is concerned, Bill Evans is a sort of Michelangeli of jazz&quot; (in reference to the great classical pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli). Ligeti&#x27;s Fifth Piano Étude, subtitled &quot;Arc-en-ciel&quot; (&quot;Rainbow&quot;), demonstrates this influence clearly, and Ligeti even hand-wrote in the margin of the score, &quot;Play it like Bill Evans.&quot; Likewise, American minimalist composer and keyboardist Terry Riley included Evans in &quot;the Pantheon of my teachers and heroes&quot; in the liner notes to his solo piano &quot;Lisbon Concert.&quot;

Many of Evans&#x27;s own compositions, such as &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;, &quot;Peace Piece&quot;, &quot;Blue in Green&quot;, &quot;Very Early&quot;, &quot;Time Remembered&quot;, &quot;Turn Out the Stars&quot;, &quot;We Will Meet Again&quot;, and &quot;Funkallero&quot;, have become often-recorded jazz standards. In addition, his early death inspired the composition of two widely covered tribute songs by others, Phil Woods&#x27; &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Evans&quot; and Don Sebesky&#x27;s &quot;I Remember Bill&quot;.

During his lifetime, Evans was honored with 31 Grammy nominations and seven Awards. In 1994, he was posthumously honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Bill Evans Jazz Festival at Southeastern Louisiana University began in 2002. A Bill Evans painting hangs in the Recital Hall lobby of the Department of Music and Performing Arts. The Center for Southeastern Louisiana Studies at the Simms Library holds the Bill Evans archives. He was named Outstanding Alumnus of the year in 1969 at Southeastern Louisiana University.

Evans influenced the character Seb&#x27;s wardrobe in the 2016 film &quot;La La Land&quot;.

<text>Pierre Laporte (; 25 February 1921 – 17 October 1970) was a Canadian lawyer, journalist and politician. He was deputy premier of the province of Quebec when he was kidnapped and murdered by members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) during the October Crisis.

==Life and career==

Pierre Laporte, grandson of the Liberal politician Alfred Leduc, was born in Montreal, Quebec, on 25 February 1921. He was a journalist with &quot;Le Devoir&quot; newspaper from 1945 to 1961, and was known for his crusading work against Quebec&#x27;s then-Premier Maurice Duplessis. In 1950, he graduated from the Law School at the Université de Montreal, and was hired by &quot;Le Devoir&quot; shortly afterwards.

During his years in journalism, he published a number of series targeting the management of the Duplessis government. At the same time that he criticized the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; government in public, he wrote campaign pamphlets for the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; during elections. In 1954, &quot;Le Devoir&quot; ran a six-part series on problems during the construction of the Bersimis-1 generating station. Laporte alleged that the government had taken kickbacks from construction companies building the dam. In a speech, Duplessis called Laporte &quot;a man without a heart, a pig, a snake and a slothy individual&quot; whose journalism &quot;pandered to the vilest instincts of yellow journalism and the most ignoble sentiments&quot;. Duplessis referred to Laporte as a writer for a &quot;Bolshevik journal&quot;. In 1954, Laporte published a column in the left-wing newspaper &quot;Vrai&quot; where he wrote: “The &quot;Union Nationale&quot; is rotten. Those who don’t have eyes to see clearly...at least have a nose to smell. It’s a rotten fruit, whose stink wafts all the way to the provincial borders.&quot; In 1958, he was part of a team of &quot;Le Devoir&quot; reporters exposing the natural gas scandal, leading to the formation of the Salvas Commission, soon after the election of 1960. Laporte&#x27;s biographer, Jean-Charles Panneton, stated:Pierre Laporte was very courageous. He was a pioneer of investigative journalism in an era when investigative journalism was not practiced, when the media were very docile toward the government of Maurice Duplessis.Laporte was very close to his wife, Françoise, whom he adored. One who knew him stated:Pierre was the type of guy who went fishing with his wife. When he went travelling, he would always think how he could take his wife. He wouldn&#x27;t go to a stag party. And he would introduce his wife with eyes that big-the way an young fellow would introduce his girl to relatives.Peter Edwards, the crime correspondent of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, wrote in 1990 that Laporte was a &quot;devoted family man&quot;.

After Duplessis&#x27;s death, Laporte successfully ran for the &quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot; for a seat in Chambly in the Quebec National Assembly and served in the government of Premier Jean Lesage. Laporte was a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, and considered to be a leading member of the party&#x27;s left wing. Laporte was elected in a by-election in 1961. Laporte served as minister of municipal affairs from 1962 to 1966. In 1962, he was involved in a scandal which it emerged that he lobbied successfully for the Quebec government to rent construction equipment from a firm he owned, leading to charges of conflict of interest violations. Several Québécois newspapers printed cartoons that mockingly showed Laporte leading hundreds of bulldozers and tractors into Quebec City for the government to rent. In 1962, Laporte was the leading force behind a bill passed in the National Assembly that disqualified from holding office, J. Aldéo Léo Rémillard, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; mayor of Ville Jacques-Cartier, on the account of his criminal record. Laporte also served as minister of cultural affairs from 1964 to 1966. In 1965, Laporte introduced the bill that led to the merger of several municipalities that created the city of Laval.

Laporte took a populist line, presenting himself as the defender of the &quot;little guy&quot;. In a speech, Laporte warned that the Liberals must look after the interests of the &quot;average men&quot; as he stated: &quot;Otherwise, the masses, like those of France in 1789 or Germany in 1933, will be swept away in an undoubtedly unacceptable excess, one that has been sown by our faults and our omissions&quot;. He was frequently accused of accepting kickbacks during his time in office with his nickname being &quot;&quot;Monsieur Dix Pour Cent&quot;. In the 1966 Quebec general election, the &quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot; government of Lesage was defeated by the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, and Laporte sat on the opposition benches for the next four years. The &quot;Union Nationale&quot; premier Daniel Johnson Sr. called Laporte &quot;le roi des patroneux&quot;&quot; (&quot;the all-time king of the porkbarrel&quot;). After Lesage announced in 1969 that he would step down as party leader, Laporte ran to succeed him, but lost the 1970 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election to fellow cabinet member Robert Bourassa.

Laporte was a frequent customer at the Victoria Club (which served as an illegal gambling house) owned by the gangster Frank D&#x27;Asti, a &quot;capo&quot; of the Cotroni family, and he was known as a good friend of D&#x27;Asti. Starting in the autumn of 1969, D&#x27;Asti was Laporte&#x27;s principal campaign contributor in his leadership bid. Likewise, D&#x27;Asti contributed heavily to Laporte campaign in the 1970 election. Laporte&#x27;s two principal aides, René Gagnon and Jacques Côté, met with D&#x27;Asti and another Cotroni family &quot;capo&quot;, Nicolo Di Iorio, to pick up briefcases full of cash during both Laporte&#x27;s 1969 leadership bid and again in the 1970 provincial election, which was won by the Liberals. On 16 April 1970, Laporte alongside Gagnon and Côté were observed by the police meeting with D&#x27;Asti and Di Iorio in an apartment in Montreal. The report from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police surveillance team, which observed the meeting, stated that Di Iorio, D&#x27;Asti and Côté entered together the apartment of Gagnon, who were joined at about &quot;1740 hours&quot; by Laporte who left at about &quot;1850 hours&quot;. Gagnon and Côté later stated the meeting was called by D&#x27;Asti and Di Iorio who wanted to warn Laporte about allegations of electoral fraud in the Montreal area. According to Gagnon, the meeting ended with Laporte asking the two Mafiosi to &quot;please keep Monsieur Côté informed of the developments in this affair&quot;.

On 3 May 1970, in a room that was wiretapped by the police, D&#x27;Asti talked with Di Iorio, Angelo Lanzo and Romeo Bucci about their hopes that Laporte would be appointed Attorney-General of Quebec. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police summary dated 17 September 1970 stated:They [D&#x27;Asti and di Iorio] foresaw that they would be able to get favors from Laporte...They were very hopeful that Laporte would be appointed justice minister. At that time, René Gagnon and Jacques Côté were working hard to assure them that prospects were good and this would come about. Their aim was to obtain financial contributions for the campaign...They were very disappointed when Laporte was named minister of labour and immigration instead of minister of justice. However, they have been assured since then, mainly by Côté, that they would have no problems with Justice Minister Jerôme Choquette.The situation with Laporte was considered highly sensitive by the authorities in Ottawa who made it clear that they did not want the Mounties investigating Laporte.

After the Quebec general election in 1970, Premier Bourassa advised the Lieutenant Governor to appoint Laporte as Deputy Premier, Parliamentary Leader, Minister of Immigration, and Minister of Labour and Manpower.

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 5 October 1970, James Cross, the British trade commissioner in Montreal, was kidnapped by the FLQ. Laporte called the Cross kidnapping &quot;a wind of madness temporarily blowing across Canada&quot;. On 10 October 1970, Laporte was kidnapped from his home on Robitaille Street in Saint-Lambert, Quebec, by the Chénier Cell of the FLQ. The kidnappers – Paul and Jacques Rose, Francis Simard, and Bernard Lortie – approached Laporte while he was playing football with his nephew Claude on his front lawn and forced him into their vehicle at gunpoint. Laporte was chosen partly because of his links to the Cotroni family (which would embarrass the Bourassa government) and partly because he had no bodyguards, which made him an easy man to kidnap. Laporte was heading towards the street to pick up the football when he was confronted with a masked man who had just gotten out of a car parked in front of his house who pointed a submachine gun at his face. The FLQ dubbed him the &quot;Minister of Unemployment and Assimilation,&quot; and held him hostage, demanding the release of 23 &quot;political prisoners&quot; in exchange for his freedom.

It was the intention of the FLQ to have Laporte write out a &quot;confession&quot; detailing his links to the Cotroni family which the FLQ hoped would be the &quot;Magna Carta of corruption&quot; in Quebec. Laporte was defiant, telling his captors: &quot;It&#x27;ll will all work out. I know it. Don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;ll will all work out perfectly&quot;. Laporte was held in a house at 5630 Armstrong (now Bachand) street in Longueuil. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked Canada&#x27;s &quot;War Measures Act&quot; which allowed mass raids and arrests to take place in order to find the group who had kidnapped Laporte and Cross. Trudeau said:
Laporte was handcuffed, chained to the floor and blindfolded. However, by feeling his way around his room and pressing his face across the wall, he was able to discover a window. On the afternoon of 16 October 1970, Laporte heard a police siren in the distance, and decided to escape by throwing himself through the window. He broke through the window, but his leg chains left him dangling in the air. The broken glass severed his arteries on his left wrist, right thumb and in his chest. As he dangled in the air, Laporte screamed &quot;Aider! Aider! Quelqu&#x27;un s&#x27;il vous plaît aidez-moi!&quot; (&quot;Help! Help! Somebody please help me!&quot;), but nobody other than his captors heard his cries. His captors pulled him back in. The police siren that Laporte heard was due to a report of a fire at a house further down Armstrong street. Over the course of the night, Laporte was bleeding badly from his severed arteries and it was soon apparent that he would die soon if he did not receive prompt medical attention. Simard described him as being like a &quot;zombie&quot;, saying:He didn&#x27;t move. No reaction, We took off his blindfold. He didn&#x27;t even look at us. It was like Laporte was already dead. He was like somebody stripped of all life. He looked totally empty. You could feel that he&#x27;d already received the death blow.As he was laid out on the floor, Laporte seemed resigned to his death as he grew weaker and he refused to speak. On the morning of 17 October, his captors decided to strangle him to death rather than release him to a hospital. Two men held him in place while a third wrapped the leg chain around his neck and after a few minutes, Laporte was dead.

On 17 October, seven days after he went missing, Laporte&#x27;s body was found in the trunk of a car at Montreal Saint-Hubert Longueuil Airport. On the same day, D&#x27;Asti and Di Iorio met with Gagnon with an offer of help as the duo stated that their boss, Vic Cotroni, had given orders for the Cotroni family to find Laporte. Gagnon later stated he was told by D&#x27;Asti and Di Iorio: &quot;René, we can find him. We know where he is&quot;. Just minutes after accepting the offer of help from the Cotroni family, Gagnon heard the news on the radio of Laporte&#x27;s murder. Laporte was buried in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges on 20 October 1970 in a funeral attended by the elites of both Ottawa and Quebec City in Montreal, Quebec.

The Chénier cell were all arrested by the &quot;Sûreté du Québec&quot; on 28 December 1970 at a farmhouse south of Montreal. The members of the Chénier Cell served terms ranging from 20 years to life, though they were all released on parole much earlier. On 4 January 1971, Simard while in police custody wrote up an unsigned statement that stated that he and the two Rose brothers were the three men who killed Laporte.

In 1977, a book, &quot;L&#x27;exécution de Pierre Laporte&quot; by the Quebec separatist journalist Pierre Vallières, was published. In his book, Valliėres advanced an elaborate conspiracy theory that the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cotroni family had conspired to have Laporte murdered and then blamed the killing on the FLQ as part of a plot to discredit Quebec separatism. Vallières&#x27;s theory was decisively debunked in 1982 when a book co-written jointly by Simard, the two Rose brothers, and Lortie, &quot;Pour en finir avec octobre&quot;, was published. The four authors of &quot;Pour en finir avec octobre&quot; stated quite explicitly that they were all collectively responsible for Laporte&#x27;s murder, though the authors refused to say who actually strangled Laporte to death with his leg chains. The four co-authors stated in &quot;Pour en finir avec octobre&quot; that:Pierre Laporte was murdered. His death was not accidental. Without entering into the details, we have always taken responsibility for the death of Pierre Laporte. From our arrest and the trials that followed, we confirmed our complete responsibility, without limitation.However, the four co-authors of &quot;Pour en finir avec octobre&quot; expressed no remorse for Laporte&#x27;s murder and made no apologies to his family. The members of the Chénier cell dismissed Vallières&#x27;s book as they wrote:For amateurs of mystery novels, there are idiocies, downright dishonest of the kind found in &quot;L&#x27;exécution de Pierre Laporte&quot; by Pierre Vallières. It is the theory of infiltration, of the enemy coming from the inside.A report into Laporte&#x27;s murder by Justice Duchaine in 1980 concluded that at very least Jacques Rose and Francis Simard were both present when Laporte was killed, though the report did not name the man who strangled Laporte.

In 2010, journalist Guy Gendron produced a documentary series for Radio-Canada, in which he asserted that the killing of Pierre Laporte was unintentional – &quot;Il a été étouffé dans un moment de panique&quot; (&quot;He was choked in a moment of panic&quot;). The journalist Dan MacPherson of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; described Gendron&#x27;s documentary—which depicted Laporte&#x27;s murder as more or less an accident—as part of a tendency by Quebec separatists to whitewash the FLQ.

==Monument to Laporte==
On the 40th anniversary of his death, 17 October 2010, a monument to Laporte was unveiled by then-Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest. It stands at the St. Lawrence Seaway Park, near Laporte&#x27;s home on Robitaille Street. On the monument is inscribed: &quot;Nul ne vit pour soi-même. Nul ne meurt pour soi-même&quot; (&quot;No one lives for oneself. No one dies for oneself&quot;).

A middle school in Toronto, Ontario is named after Laporte.

Two years later she played the title role in Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;La Passion Béatrice&quot; (1987) and was nominated for a César Award for Most Promising Actress. She used her money from the film to pay for her first trip to New York City.

Delpy became an international celebrity after starring in the 1990 film &quot;Europa Europa&quot; directed by Agnieszka Holland. In the film, she plays a young pro-Nazi who falls in love with the hero, Solomon Perel, not knowing he is Jewish. She did not speak German, so she performed her role in English and her dialogue was dubbed in.

Delpy subsequently appeared in several Hollywood and European films, including &quot;Voyager&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993). In 1993, she was cast by director Krzysztof Kieślowski for the female lead in &quot;Three Colours: White&quot;, the second film in Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colours&quot; trilogy. She also appeared briefly in the other two films - &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Red -&quot; in the same role. That year, she also appeared with Brendan Fraser and Donald Sutherland in the Percy Adlon feature &quot;Younger and Younger&quot;. In 1994, she starred with Eric Stoltz in Roger Avary&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;, a cult heist film capturing the Generation X zeitgeist.
She achieved wider recognition for her role opposite Ethan Hawke in director Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995). It received glowing reviews and was considered one of the most significant films of the &#x27;90s independent film movement. Its success led to Delpy&#x27;s casting in the 1997 American film &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;.

She reprised her &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; character, Céline, with a brief animated appearance in &quot;Waking Life&quot; (2001), and again in the sequels &quot;Before Sunset&quot; (2004) and &quot;Before Midnight&quot; (2013). The initial follow-up movie earned Delpy, who co-wrote the script, her first Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

In late 2001, she appeared alongside comedian Martin Short in the 30-minute short film &quot;CinéMagique&quot;, a theatre-show attraction presented several times daily at Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris. She attended the park&#x27;s March 2002 opening and the inauguration of the film-based attraction, where she starred as Marguerite - a female actress with whom Short&#x27;s character, George, falls in love as he stumbles through countless classic movies. &quot;CinéMagique&quot; won the 2002 Themed Entertainment Association award for Outstanding Themed Attraction.

In 2009, Delpy starred in &quot;The Countess&quot; as the title character Elizabeth Báthory. Her third film as a director, it also starred Daniel Brühl and William Hurt.

==Writing and directing==
Delpy began being interested in a film-directing career when still a child, and enrolled in a summer directing course at New York University. She wrote and directed the short film &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot; in 1995 which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2004, she co-wrote &quot;Before Sunset&quot;, a sequel to the 1995 movie &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, with director Richard Linklater and co-star Ethan Hawke. Describing the experience, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a feminist wearing overalls and hating the male gender. But I&#x27;m a definite feminist. I don&#x27;t want to make &quot;Before Sunset&quot; into a little male fantasy, ever.&quot; She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for her work on the film.

She made her feature length directorial debut in 2002 with &quot;Looking for Jimmy,&quot; which she also wrote and produced. In 2007 she directed, wrote, edited, and co-produced the original score for &quot;2 Days in Paris,&quot; co-starring Adam Goldberg. It also features Delpy&#x27;s real-life parents, Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy, as her character&#x27;s parents.

In 2011 she wrote and directed &quot;Le Skylab,&quot; which received a theatrical release in France but failed to find distribution in the U.S. In 2012 she released &quot;2 Days in New York&quot;, a sequel to her 2007 film &quot;2 Days in Paris,&quot; starring Delpy and actor Chris Rock in a role she said she wrote specifically for him. In 2013, she reunited with Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke to write &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Before Sunset&quot;. She again starred with Hawke, and the film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. It screened out of competition at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in May 2013. Delpy, Linklater and Hawke were later nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards. Responding to criticism of the film&#x27;s nudity, Delpy said in interview with &quot;GQ Magazine&quot;:

Some people were like, &#x27;It&#x27;s not feminist. You&#x27;re showing your tits and he&#x27;s not showing his ass.&#x27; [But] isn&#x27;t it the people who are hiding women behind layers of clothes who are the misogynists? I&#x27;m a real person, so it&#x27;s a statement to say, &#x27;Alright, I&#x27;m a forty year-old woman, and this is what you get with no plastic surgery.&#x27;

&quot;Lolo&quot; was Delpy&#x27;s second French-language feature film, and the first she&#x27;d directed since &quot;2 Days in New York&quot;. She was also slated to write and direct the HBO movie &quot;Cancer Vixen&quot;, starring Cate Blanchett as Marisa Acocella Marchetto, a cartoonist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; who is diagnosed with cancer. The project has yet to materialize as of 2020. In early 2014, Delpy announced her next writing-directing project would be &quot;A Dazzling Display of Splendor&quot; and focus on a family of vaudeville performers. It has also failed to enter production as of 2020.

Delpy courted controversy in 2016 when the Oscar nominations included no Black honorees. &quot;Two years ago, I said something about the Academy being very white male, which is the reality, and I was slashed to pieces by the media ... It&#x27;s funny—women can&#x27;t talk. I sometimes wish I were African-American because people don&#x27;t bash them afterward.&quot; She later apologized for the comment.

==Music==
Delpy is also a musical artist. Three tracks from her 2003 album &quot;Julie Delpy -&quot; &quot;A Waltz for a Night&quot;, &quot;An Ocean apart&quot;, and &quot;Je t&#x27;aime tant&quot; - were featured in &quot;Before Sunset&quot;. She composed the original score for &quot;2 Days in Paris&quot; in which she performed Marc Collin&#x27;s &quot;Lalala&quot; over the closing credits. She also wrote the music for her 2009 film &quot;The Countess&quot;.

==Personal life==
Delpy moved to New York in 1990, then to Los Angeles a few years later. She has been a naturalized US citizen since 2001 although she also retains her French citizenship. She divides her time between Paris and Los Angeles. From 2007 to 2012 she was in a relationship with German film composer Marc Streitenfeld. Their son was born in January 2009.

In 2015 she married Dimitris Birbilis.

Delpy has expressed her commitment to correcting inaccurate assumptions regarding feminism, telling IndieWire &quot;I&#x27;m very dedicated to feminism [but] even if I&#x27;m a feminist, I don&#x27;t think all women are perfect. If we&#x27;re equal to men, we are also imperfect like men ... [Some men] try to say [feminists] think that women are better than men, and I want to tell them, &#x27;no&#x27;&quot;. In a 2007 interview with Jan Lisa Huttner, she said, &quot;I was raised by a feminist, so I&#x27;m not a feminist. I don&#x27;t need to be. I’m equal to men. I have no issues with the idea that I&#x27;m the same as a man. I have my differences; I have breasts, and different plumbing, different stuff down there. But outside of this, my consciousness, my capacity at creating, my capacity at doing things is the same as a man&quot;. However, in a 2012 interview with Emily Greenhouse in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, she said, &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve been raised by feminists, and I&#x27;m such a feminist, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m not going to be feminist, because my core is so deeply feminist that I can even make sexist comments about women, and I feel still a feminist&quot;.

Delpy has said she has been plagued by health problems since childhood and had to wear callipers at age eight. She also occasionally experiences migraines and panic-attacks.

In 2022, Delpy was an honoree by the Carnegie Corporation of New York&#x27;s Great Immigrant Award.

<doc id="155982" wikidata="Q886986" url="?curid=155982" title="Kingdom of Lindsey">
<text>The Kingdom of Lindsey or Linnuis () was a lesser Anglo-Saxon kingdom, which was absorbed into Northumbria in the 7th century. The name Lindsey derives from the Old English toponym , meaning &quot;Isle of Lind&quot;. was the Roman name of the settlement which is now the City of Lincoln in Lincolnshire. ( was shortened in Old English to and then .) was a Latinised form of a native Brittonic name which has been reconstructed as *&quot;Lindon&quot; (; cf. modern Welsh &quot;&quot;).
==Geography==
Lindsey lay between the Humber estuary and the Wash, forming its inland boundaries from the courses of the Witham and Trent rivers, and the Foss Dyke between them. A marshy region south of the Humber known as the Isle of Axholme was also included. It is believed that Roman Lindum (Lincoln) was the capital of Lindsey: the continuity of the place name suggests continuity of settlement traditions: in 625, Bede recounts, the missionary Paulinus of York was received by the &quot;praefectus&quot; of Lindum. Place-name evidence is suggestive that the Anglian settlement known as Lindisfaras spread from the Humber coast.

Lindsey means the &#x27;island of Lincoln&#x27;: it was surrounded by water and very wet land. Lincoln was in the south-west part of the kingdom. During the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, from about 450, Lindsey was one of the lesser kingdoms. Although it has its own list of kings, at an early date it came under external influence. It was from time to time effectively part of Deira, of the Northumbrian kingdom and, particularly later, of Mercia. Lindsey lost its independence long before the arrival of the Danish settlers.
==History==
Toby Martin and Catherine Hills identify Lindsey as an area in which large-scale settlement by the Angles occurred. However, a continuing British presence in the region is indicated by the fact that major settlements such as Lincoln, and Lindsey itself, have partially Celtic names. Caitlin Green suggests that some communities may have continued to speak Brittonic until the eighth century.

Lindsey&#x27;s prominence was before the historical period. By the time of the first historical records of the kingdom, it had become a subjugated polity, under the alternating control of Northumbria and Mercia. Its subjugation may have occurred around AD 500. Its territories were absorbed into the historical English county of Lincolnshire, the northern part of which is called Lindsey. 

===Kings of Lindsey===
The Anglian collection of genealogies, which was created in the last years of the reign of Offa of Mercia, gives a pedigree for Aldfrið, presumed to have been ruler of Lindsey. It traces him to the Anglo-Saxon god, Woden, likewise made ancestor of the other Anglo-Saxon dynasties, and provides Woden&#x27;s ancestry for several further generations.

*Geot – Compare the Geats who are frequently mentioned in Beowulf&#x27;s story.
*Godulf
*Finn
*Frioðulf
*Frealaf
*Woden, the god. 
*Winta – Compare Winteringham (the homestead of Winta&#x27;s people) and Winterton, Lincolnshire (the farm/village of Winta&#x27;s people).
*Cretta
*Cuelgils
*Caedbaed
*Bubba
*Beda Bubbing
*Biscop Beding
*Eanferð
*Eatta
*Aldfrið

None of the individuals can be securely dated, though the name Biscop, Old English for &#x27;bishop&#x27;, suggests a time after conversion. Likewise, the practice of agnatic inheritance akin to blood tanistry in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms means that it cannot be determined which of the listed male-line ancestors of Aldfrið actually ruled the kingdom. Finally, it is uncertain at what point between Aldfrið and Woden the pedigree ceases to be historical, since this pedigree is the sole source for all of the individuals named, except perhaps Aldfrið. With regard to Aldfrið, Frank Stenton referred to the witness list for a charter which includes an &quot;Ealfrid rex&quot;, and dated its writing to some time between the years 787 and 796. Scholars now believe that the name on the witness list should read &quot;Ecgfrið Rex&quot;, and refers to Offa&#x27;s son. He was anointed King of the Mercians in 787, nine years before his succession in 796, and would have been correctly styled &quot;rex&quot;. Stenton suggested that the name &#x27;Biscop&#x27; came from the title &#x27;bishop&#x27; and must post-date Paulinus&#x27;s mission to Lindsey of 628 CE. But, as Sarah Foot has pointed out, Biscop does not need to have been derived from an external origin. The other genealogies in the Anglian collection close with historic personages whose dates are known, such as Edwin of Deira (616–33), Ethelred of Mercia (675–704) and Ethelbert II of Kent (725–62), but this wide range offers little help in dating Aldfrið.

<text>In jazz and blues, a blue note is a note that—for expressive purposes—is sung or played at a slightly different pitch from standard. Typically the alteration is between a quartertone and a semitone, but this varies depending on the musical context.

==Origins and meaning==
The blue notes are usually said to be the lowered third, lowered fifth, and lowered seventh scale degrees. The lowered fifth is also known as the raised fourth. Though the blues scale has &quot;an inherent minor tonality, it is commonly &#x27;forced&#x27; over major-key chord changes, resulting in a distinctively dissonant conflict of tonalities&quot;. A similar conflict occurs between the notes of the minor scale and the minor blues scale, as heard in songs such as &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Do Right?&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Sweet About Me&quot;.

In the case of the lowered third over the root (or the lowered seventh over the dominant), the resulting chord is a neutral mixed third chord.

Blue notes are used in many blues songs, in jazz, and in conventional popular songs with a &quot;blue&quot; feeling, such as Harold Arlen&#x27;s &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. Blue notes are also prevalent in English folk music. Bent or &quot;blue notes&quot;, called in Ireland &quot;long notes&quot;, play a vital part in Irish music.

== Theory and measurement ==
Music theorists have long speculated that blue notes are intervals of just intonation not derived from European 12-tone equal temperament tuning. Just intonation musical intervals derive directly from the harmonic series. Humans naturally learn the harmonic series as infants. This is essential for many auditory activities such as understanding speech (see formant) and perceiving tonal music. In the harmonic series, overtones of a fundamental tonic tone occur as integer multiples of the tonic frequency. It is therefore convenient to express musical intervals in this system as integer ratios (e.g. = octave, = perfect fifth, etc.). The relationship between just and equal temperament tuning is conveniently expressed using the 12-tone equal temperament cents system. Just intonation is common in music of other cultures such as the 17-tone Arabic scale and the 22-tone Indian classical music scale. In African cultures, just intonation scales are the norm rather than the exception. As the blues appears to have derived from &quot;a cappella&quot; field hollers of African slaves, it would be expected that its notes would be of just intonation origin closely related to the musical scales of western Africa.

The blue &quot;lowered third&quot; has been speculated to be from (267 cents) to 350 cents above the tonic tone. It has recently been found empirically to center at (316 cents, a minor third in just intonation, or a slightly sharp minor third in equal temperament) based on cluster analysis of a large number of blue notes from early blues recordings. This note is commonly slurred with a major third justly tuned at (386 cents) in what Temperley et al. refer to as a &quot;neutral third&quot;. This bending or glide between the two tones is an essential characteristic of the blues.

The blue &quot;lowered fifth&quot; has been found to be quite separate from the perfect fifth and clusters with the perfect fourth with which it is commonly slurred. This &quot;raised fourth&quot; is most commonly expressed at (583 cents). The eleventh harmonic (i.e. or 551 cents) as put forward by Kubik and Curry is also possible as it is in the middle of the slur between the perfect fourth at and .

The blue &quot;lowered seventh&quot; appears to have two common locations at (969 cents) and (1018 cents). Kubik and Curry proposed as it is commonly heard in the barbershop quartet harmonic seventh chord. The barbershop quartet idiom also appears to have arisen from African American origins. It was a surprising finding that was a much more common tonal location although both were used in the blues, sometimes within the same song.

It should not be surprising that blue notes are not represented accurately in the 12-tone equal temperament system, which is made up of a cycle of very slightly flattened perfect fifths (i.e. ). The just intonation blue note intervals identified above all involve prime numbers not equally divisible by 2 or 3. Prime-number harmonics greater than 3 are all perceptually different from 12-tone equal temperament notes.

The blues has likely evolved as a fusion of an African just intonation scale with European 12-tone musical instruments and harmony. The result has been a uniquely American music which is still widely practiced in its original form and is at the foundation of another genre, American jazz.

<text>John Daniel Singleton (January 6, 1968 April 28, 2019) was an American director, screenwriter, and producer. He made his feature film debut writing and directing &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, becoming, at age 24, the first African American and youngest nominee in the category.

Singleton went on to write and direct other films, such as the romantic drama &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (1993), the socially conscious college-based drama &quot;Higher Learning&quot; (1995), the historical drama &quot;Rosewood&quot; (1997), the crime film &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000), the coming-of-age drama &quot;Baby Boy&quot; (2001) and the action films &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003), and &quot;Four Brothers&quot; (2005). In television, he the television crime drama &quot;Snowfall&quot; and directed episodes of shows such as &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Rebel&quot; and the fifth episode of &quot;The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special for the latter.

One of the most successful and groundbreaking directors in African-American cinema, Singleton and his films represented the African-American urban experience, focusing on themes such as black masculinity, trauma, racism and identity. Singleton frequently cast rappers and musicians, such as Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, Janet Jackson, Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, Tyrese Gibson, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris and André 3000 in prominent roles.

== Early life ==
John Singleton was born on January 6, 1968, in Los Angeles, the son of Shelia Ward-Johnson (later Morgan), a pharmaceutical company sales executive, and Danny Singleton, a real estate agent, mortgage broker, and financial planner. In a 1993 DIRT magazine interview with Veronica Chambers, Singleton says of his childhood, &quot;When I was growing up, comic books, video games and movies were my buffer against all the drugs, the partying and shit [...] I never grew up with a whole lot of white people. I grew up in a black neighborhood.&quot; He attended Eisenhower High School, Blair High School, Pasadena City College and the USC School of Cinematic Arts.

Singleton was a spring 1987 initiate into the Beta Omega chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi and graduated from USC in 1990. Singleton considered pursuing computer science, but enrolled in USC&#x27;s Filmic Writing program under Margaret Mehring. The program was designed to take students directly into the Hollywood system as proficient writer/directors.

==Career==
===1990s: Early career and breakthrough===
In 1991, Singleton made his feature film debut with &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, a coming-of-age crime drama about three childhood friends growing up in the crime-ridden neighbourhood of South Central LA. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Angela Bassett, Regina King, and Laurence Fishburne, the film was both a critical and commercial success. It debuted at the Cannes Film Festival. For his efforts, Singleton received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. At age 24, he became the youngest person ever nominated for Best Director and the first African-American to be nominated for the award. In 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

In 1992, following the success of &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, Singleton went on to direct VFX-driven &quot;Remember the Time&quot; music video for Michael Jackson, which featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson. The song and the music video were well-received and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B Singles as well as the Mainstream Top 40 chart. It is certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, the song was a Top 10 hit in nine countries, peaking at No.1 in New Zealand, at No.2 in Spain and No.3 in the United Kingdom.

In 1993, Singleton wrote and directed his second film, &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, a romantic drama about a young African-American woman named Justice (played by Janet Jackson, in her film debut) who writes poetry to deal with the loss of her boyfriend to gun violence but soon encounters a postal worker (played by Tupac Shakur), who helps her overcome depression. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but earned Jackson Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Original Song for &quot;Again&quot;, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The film has developed a cult following, especially for the chemistry between Jackson and Shakur and is now considered as one of Singleton&#x27;s most enduring films.

In 1995, Singleton wrote and directed &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, a socially conscious drama about the intense racial and social tension in a university campus. Like &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, the film received mixed reviews. Of his work with some of the 1990s&#x27; most visible rappers, Singleton states, &quot;I come from the same place as rappers. It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s just another form of communication. I have the same sensibilities as rappers. I&#x27;m not bourgeois and everything, thinking I&#x27;m better than folks. I see myself as the first filmmaker from the hip-hop generation. I&#x27;ve grown up with hip-hop music. The films I make have a hip-hop aesthetic. It may not have rap in it, but there&#x27;s a whole culture and politics that go with the music. It&#x27;s young, black culture-that&#x27;s what I deal with in my films.&quot;

In 1997, following the mixed reception of &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; and &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, Singleton&#x27;s fourth film, &quot;Rosewood&quot;, a historical drama based on racial violence during the 1923 Rosewood massacre in Florida, received generally positive reviews and was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear.

===2000s: Continued success===
In 2000, Singelton co-wrote, co-produced and directed &quot;Shaft&quot;, a sequel-remake of the original 1971 film of the same name starring Richard Roundtree in the title role. Starring Samuel L. Jackson as Shaft&#x27;s relative, John Shaft Jr., the film received generally positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing over $107 million worldwide.

In 2001, ten years after the release of &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, Singleton wrote, produced, and directed &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, a coming-of-age comedy-drama about Jody Summers (played by Tyrese Gibson), a 20-year-old man who fathers two children by two different women- Yvette (played by Taraji P. Henson) and Peanut (played by Tamara LaSeon Bass) but still lives with his own mother (played by Adrienne-Joi Johnson) while he lives and learns in his everyday life in the hood of Los Angeles. The film received predominantly positive reviews, many of whom considered it to be a return to form for Singleton and one of his best films.

Singleton&#x27;s next film was &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003), the sequel to &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) and the second installment in the &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; series. The film was a box office success, grossing over $236 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the series at the time, as well as the highest-grossing film of Singleton&#x27;s career.

In 2005, Singleton teamed with writer-director Craig Brewer to finance and produce the independent film &quot;Hustle and Flow&quot;, once it was clear that most other major backers would not clear it for release. The film stars Terrence Howard as a Memphis hustler and pimp who faces his aspiration to become a rapper. Also starring Anthony Anderson and Taraji P. Henson in supporting roles, the film received positive reviews and earned two Academy Awards nominations for Best Actor and Best Original Song, winning the latter.

That same year, Singleton directed &quot;Four Brothers&quot;, a blaxploitation-inspired action film starring Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers who return to their hometown of Detroit, Michigan to avenge the murder of their adoptive mother. The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $92 million worldwide.

In 2003, Singleton received a star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

===2010s: Unrealized projects===
In 2011, Singleton was in talks with Ice Cube, who worked with Singleton on &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; and &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, to direct a biopic about Cube&#x27;s rap group N.W.A. before F. Gary Gray was hired in August 2012. The film was released in 2015 to positive reviews and box office success.

Two years later, in 2013, Singleton was attached as the writer-director of a biopic about the life, career and death of rapper Tupac Shakur. On April 3, 2015, Singleton reported that production was put on hold. Following creative differences with Morgan Creek Productions, Singleton had stepped down as director, and was replaced by Carl Franklin. Singleton also stated he was planning on making a competing film about Tupac.

The film was eventually released in 2017 as &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, which was negatively received by critics and audiences and Singleton himself, who intended to make his own biopic about Shakur as well as a biopic about the rap group Three 6 Mafia, who worked with Singleton on &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;, prior to his death in 2019.

===2017–2019: Transition to television and final years===
Following the release of the critically-panned action thriller film &quot;Abduction&quot; (2011), Singleton spent the final years of his career focusing on television.

After directing episodes of the critically acclaimed TV shows &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, in 2017, he served as an executive producer and director of the crime drama series &quot;Rebel&quot; for BET, which focuses on Oakland police officer Rebecca &quot;Rebel&quot; Knight, who after her brother was killed by police, began working as a private investigator.

That same year, &quot;Snowfall&quot;, a crime drama series co-created and executively produced by Singleton for FX, premiered on July 5, 2017. Singleton co-wrote the screenplays for the first two episodes with series creators Eric Amadio and Dave Andron and directed the finales for the first two seasons. The series stars Damson Idris as Franklin Saint, a budding young drug dealer from South Central L.A., and it depicts how the community is affected by the 1980s crack epidemic, and the CIA involvement in trafficking the drug. This was one of the last projects Singleton worked on before his death in 2019.

== Influences and themes==
Singleton cited filmmaker George Lucas and Lucas&#x27;s original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film as one of his strongest influences, as well as the works of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and playwright August Wilson. Singleton was also influenced by his friend and fellow filmmaker Spike Lee. The two met in 1986, at a screening of Lee&#x27;s film &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, two weeks before Singleton started attending the University of Southern California (USC).

== Personal life ==
Singleton was the father of seven children. With his wife, Tosha Lewis, he had his first son Justice Maya Singleton (born 1992), named after the lead character of the same name (played by Janet Jackson) in &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; and the poet Maya Angelou respectively.

Singleton has a son named Maasai Singleton (born April 3, 1996) and a daughter named Cleopatra &quot;Cleo&quot; Singleton (born September 6, 1998) with ex-girlfriend Vestria Barlow. On October 12, 1996, Singleton married Ghanaian actress Akosua Gyamama Busia, the daughter of Ghana&#x27;s second Prime Minister Kofi Abrefa Busia. The couple had a daughter named Hadar Busia-Singleton (born April 3, 1997), who appeared in &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; (2003) and other films. Singleton and Busia divorced in June 1997. He had one daughter in 2010 with Mitzi Andrews, an actress/model and teacher based in Toronto, Canada. He also had a son, Seven, with Rayvon Jones.
In 1999, Singleton pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges after attacking an ex-girlfriend during a dispute over child visitation. He was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to make a film on domestic violence.
On August 23, 2007, Singleton was involved in an automobile accident in which he struck a jaywalking pedestrian, Constance Russell, 57, of Los Angeles. Staying on the scene until the police arrived, Singleton was not under the influence of alcohol or other substances, and was released after being questioned. Russell died later in the hospital. The case was turned over to the District Attorney, but no charges were ever filed.

On March 19, 2014, Singleton criticized popular studios for &quot;refusing to let African-Americans direct black-themed films&quot;. Singleton told an audience of students at Loyola Marymount University &quot;They ain&#x27;t letting the black people tell the stories.&quot; He also added, &quot;They want black people [to be] what they want them to be. And nobody is man enough to go and say that. They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now—so-called black films now—they&#x27;re great. They&#x27;re great films. But they&#x27;re just products. They&#x27;re not moving the bar forward creatively. ...When you try to make it homogenized, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don&#x27;t have anything that&#x27;s special.&quot;

== Death ==
On April 17, 2019, Singleton suffered a stroke and was placed under intensive care. He reportedly began to experience weakness in his legs after returning to the United States from a trip to Costa Rica. On April 25, it was reported that he was in a coma, but his daughter stated otherwise. On April 28, Singleton was removed from life support and he died at the age of 51 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Dozens of actors and musicians paid tribute to him.

American rapper and actor Ice Cube, who worked with Singleton in &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; and &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, said: &quot;There are no words to express how sad I am to lose my brother, friend &amp; mentor. He loved to bring the black experience to the world.&quot;

A private funeral was held on May 6, 2019, in Los Angeles, and Singleton was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. The official cause of death was acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and hypertension.

<text>Birger Joseph Nordholm (June 25, 1897 – November 30, 1989), was a Swedish-American founding director of the Swedish National Tourist Office in New York City, and the first Chairman of the European Travel Commission.

== Biography ==
Birger Nordholm was born in 1897 in Stockholm, Sweden, and grew up in Östermalm where he studied at Östra Real.


Birger Nordholm devoted his career to the promotion of tourism and international relations between Sweden, the United States and Europe. During Nordholm&#x27;s lifetime, tourism in Sweden expanded into one of the nation&#x27;s main revenue source, and Nordholm was a keen promoter of its transatlantic development.

Nordholm initiated and headed the Swedish National Tourist Office 1921–1963, located in the Rockefeller Center in New York City, United States. He went on to serve as Managing Director for the Swedish State Railways Travel Information Agency as well as the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce in New York City, and was a lifelong member of the Scandinavian Travel Commission.

After World War II, as part of the Marshall Plan, Nordholm was appointed the initial Chairman (1949–1958) of the European Travel Commission by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, he was appointed President of the Conference of European Railroad Representatives.


Following the simplification of visa regulations, customs procedures, and other formalities, as expressed in a 1952 edition of the &quot;This Week&quot; magazine, Birger Nordholm together with Arthur Haulot foregrounded the &quot;purposeful&quot; and &quot;educational&quot; dimension of &quot;a new type of tourism&quot; that would be &quot;the foundation of lasting peace&quot;. This would eventually contribute to the development of the OECD Tourism Committee.

Nordholm&#x27;s residences in New York City and Weston, Connecticut, would become centers of international festivities, including annual Midsummer celebrations held at his country house &quot;Tuckaway&quot;, attended by ambassadors, consular heads, the press, Miss Sweden and other dignitaries, as well as friends and neighbours, and Nordholm became a well-known international speaker.

He died in 1989 in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, United States, with ashes buried at his country house &quot;Tuckaway&quot; in Connecticut.

== Charities ==

Birger Nordholm promoted philanthropy to various international charities, such as to the humanitarian aid organization Finnish Relief Fund with purpose to assist civilians of Finland during the Winter War of World War II. He assisted cultural institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History, and was a member of the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society, and the American Swedish Historical Foundation behind the American Swedish Historical Museum.

Nordholm was also a &quot;Founding Father&quot; and &quot;skålleage&quot; of the North American charter of the Skål International in New York City on 1 April 1938, with the objective to &quot;develop true friendship and common purpose among members of the tourist industry; through tourism, to promote mutual understanding and foster goodwill between the peoples of the world.&quot;

The &quot;Birger Nordholm Foundation&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Birger Nordholms stiftelse&quot;) was posthumously established at his former secondary school Östra Real in Östermalm, Stockholm. Maintained by the Alumni Association of the school of which Nordholm was a lifelong member, it awards students who have &quot;demonstrated a good and exemplary companionship or else by significant efforts have shown great interest in the school and its activities.&quot;

<doc id="155997" wikidata="Q896103" url="?curid=155997" title="Boyz n the Hood">
<text>Boyz n the Hood is a 1991 American coming-of-age hood crime drama film written and directed by John Singleton in his feature directorial debut. It stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube (in his film debut), Morris Chestnut, and Laurence Fishburne (credited as Larry Fishburne), with Nia Long, Tyra Ferrell, Regina King, and Angela Bassett in supporting roles. &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; follows Tre Styles (Gooding), who is sent to live with his father Furious Styles (Fishburne) in South Central Los Angeles, where he reunites with his childhood friends while surrounded by the neighborhood&#x27;s booming gang culture. The film&#x27;s title is a reference to the 1987 Eazy-E rap song of the same name, written by Ice Cube.

Singleton initially developed the film as a requirement for his application to film school in 1986 and sold the script to Columbia Pictures upon graduation in 1990. During writing, he drew inspiration from his own life and from the lives of people he knew and insisted he direct the project. Principal photography began in September 1990 and was filmed on location from October to November 1990. The film features breakout roles for Ice Cube, Gooding Jr., Chestnut, and Long.

&quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. It premiered in Los Angeles on July 2, 1991, and was theatrically released in the United States ten days later. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $57.5 million in North America and earning nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 64th Academy Awards. Singleton became the youngest person and the first African American to be nominated for Best Director. In 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
In 1984, ten-year-old Tre Styles lives with his single mother, Reva Devereaux, in South Central Los Angeles. After Tre gets into a fight at school, his teacher informs Reva that although intelligent, he lacks maturity and respect. Concerned about Tre&#x27;s future, Reva sends him to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Central with his father, Furious Styles, hoping Tre will learn life lessons from him. Furious is strict but also caring and attentive.

In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his childhood friends Darrin &quot;Doughboy&quot; Baker, Doughboy&#x27;s half-brother Ricky, and their friend Chris. One night, Furious calls the LAPD after shooting at a burglar. A civil and professional white police officer named Graham and a hostile and self-hating black police officer named Coffey arrive an hour later. The next day at Chris&#x27;s suggestion, Tre and his friends go to look at a dead body, after which a group of men harasses them. Later on, en route back from a fishing trip, Tre and Furious notice Doughboy and Chris being arrested for theft.

Seven years later, Doughboy, now a Rollin 60s Crips member and drug dealer, is released from prison. Attending his welcome-home party are Chris, now paraplegic due to a gunshot wound, and new friends and fellow Crip members Dooky and Monster. Ricky is now a star running back at Crenshaw High School who hopes to earn a university scholarship. He lives with his mother Brenda, his girlfriend Shanice, and their toddler son. A visiting University of Southern California recruiter informs Ricky that he must score at least a 700 on the SAT to qualify for a football scholarship. Meanwhile, Tre, now a mature and responsible teenager, hopes to attend college with his girlfriend Brandi.

During a nighttime street gathering on Crenshaw Boulevard, Ferris, a member of the rival Bloods, provokes Ricky. Everybody comes to Ricky&#x27;s defense, with Doughboy flashing a handgun. The gangs argue but cooler heads prevail, until Ferris fires an automatic MAC-10 into the air, causing everyone to flee. Tre and Ricky are soon pulled over by the police, and Officer Coffey, wrongly believing that Tre is a gangster, threateningly holds his revolver to Tre&#x27;s throat. A distraught Tre goes to Brandi&#x27;s house, where he breaks down. After she comforts him, they have sexual intercourse for the first time.

The next afternoon, Doughboy and his gang notice Ferris and two Bloods members driving through their neighborhood seeking retribution for the previous night&#x27;s confrontation. Brenda then asks Ricky to run an errand, but Ricky encounters and brawls with Doughboy beforehand, and Brenda takes Ricky&#x27;s side. Ricky&#x27;s test results are delivered as he and Tre depart. Later spotted by the Bloods, they cut through back alleys to avoid them before splitting up. However, the Bloods catch up to Ricky, and he is fatally shot. A distraught Doughboy helps Tre carry Ricky&#x27;s bloodied corpse home. Brenda and Shanice, both devastated by Ricky&#x27;s death, tearfully blame Doughboy for instigating the shooting.

Wanting vengeance, Tre takes Furious&#x27; gun and is about to leave to join Doughboy but is intercepted by his father, who seemingly convinces him to abandon his plans for revenge. Moments later, though, Furious and Brandi catch Tre sneaking out to join his friends. Later that night, as they drive around the city, Tre comes to his senses and returns home. Meanwhile, Brenda discovers that Ricky had scored a 710, barely enough to qualify for the scholarship. After Doughboy, Dooky and Monster unexpectedly encounter Ferris and the Bloods at a diner, Monster guns down the fleeing trio in a drive-by shooting. Doughboy then stops and exits his car to approach their bodies; seeing that Ferris and Ricky&#x27;s killer are still alive, he executes them both. Later that evening, when Tre arrives home, he and Furious stare at each other before entering their bedrooms for the night.

The next morning, Doughboy visits Tre, understanding his reasons for abandoning the gang. Knowing he will face retaliation for killing Ferris, and accepting the consequences of his own lifestyle, Doughboy questions why most people &quot;don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t show, or don&#x27;t care about what&#x27;s going on in the hood&quot; and laments his brother&#x27;s death. Tre embraces him as a surrogate brother.

As Doughboy leaves and Tre goes back into his house, a postscript reveals that Ricky was buried the next day and Doughboy was murdered two weeks later. Tre ultimately leaves in the fall to attend college with Brandi in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Production==
Singleton wrote the film based on his own life and that of people he knew. When applying for film school, one of the questions on the application form was to describe &quot;three ideas for films&quot;. One of the ideas Singleton composed was titled &quot;Summer of 84&quot;, which later evolved into &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. During writing, Singleton was influenced by the 1986 film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which inspired both an early scene where four young boys take a trip to see a dead body and the closing fade-out of main character Doughboy.

Upon completion, Singleton was protective of his script, insisting that he be the one to direct the project, later explaining at a retrospective screening of the film &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to have somebody from Idaho or Encino direct this movie.&quot; He sold the script to Columbia Pictures in 1990, who greenlit the film immediately out of interest in making a film similar to the comedy-drama film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989).

The role of Doughboy was written specially for Ice Cube, whom Singleton met while working as an intern at &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. Singleton also noted the studio was unaware of Ice Cube&#x27;s standing as a member of rap group N.W.A. Singleton claims Gooding and Chestnut were cast because they were the first ones who showed up to auditions, while Fishburne was cast after Singleton met him on the set of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, where Singleton worked as a production assistant and security guard.

Long grew up in the area the film depicts and has said, &quot;It was important as a young actor to me that this feels real because I knew what it was like go home from school and hear gunshots at night.&quot; Bassett referred to Singleton as her &quot;little brother&quot; on set. &quot;I&#x27;d been in LA for about three years and I was trying, trying, trying to do films,&quot; she said. &quot;We talked, I auditioned and he gave me a shot. I&#x27;ve been waiting to work with him ever since.&quot;

The film was shot in sequence, with Singleton later noting that as the film goes on, the camera work gets better as Singleton was finding his foothold as a director. He has a cameo in the film, appearing as a mailman handing over mail to Brenda as Doughboy and Ricky are having a scuffle in the front yard. Filming began on October 1, 1990, in South Central Los Angeles, with several gang members serving as consultants, on &quot;wardrobe, vocal emphasis and dialogue changes&quot; to ensure authenticity.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 96% based on 71 reviews and an average score of 8.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Well-acted and thematically rich, &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; observes urban America with far more depth and compassion than many of the like-minded films its success inspired.&quot; At Metacritic, the film received an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
&quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; launched the acting careers of Gooding, Cube, Chestnut, Long and King, who were given their first major leading roles in the film, as well as the first significant film role for Angela Bassett Along with &quot;Colors&quot; (1988) and &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989), &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; is credited as a notable pioneer of the hood film genre, with its success leading to American hood films such as &quot;New Jack City&quot; (also 1991), &quot;Juice&quot; (1992), &quot;Menace II Society&quot; (1993), &quot;Friday&quot; (1995), &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001), &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (both 2005), &quot;Dope&quot;, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (both 2015) and &quot;The Hate U Give&quot; (2018).

For his work, Singleton earned nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 64th Academy Awards, making him the youngest person and first African American to be nominated for Best Director. Since then, the only black nominees in the category have been Lee Daniels, Steve McQueen, Barry Jenkins, Jordan Peele and Spike Lee. In 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

<text>3 Doors Down is an American rock band from Escatawpa, Mississippi, formed in 1996. The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass guitar); Chris Henderson (rhythm guitar) later joined the band in 1998. The band rose to international fame with their 2000 debut single, &quot;Kryptonite&quot;, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led them to sign with Universal Records. The song preceded the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The Better Life&quot; (2000), which became the 11th-best-selling album of that year and received septuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.

Their second album, &quot;Away from the Sun&quot; (2002), was met with continued success and debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, also receiving multi-platinum certification by the RIAA and spawning the hit singles &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; and &quot;Here Without You&quot;. The band toured extensively for two years, performing at nearly 1,000 worldwide shows following its release. Their third and fourth studio albums, &quot;Seventeen Days&quot; (2005) and their self-titled fourth album (2008), both debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the former received platinum certification by the RIAA, while the latter was certified gold. Their fifth album, &quot;Time of My Life&quot; (2011), peaked at number three, and their sixth album, &quot;Us and the Night&quot; (2016), peaked at number 14 on the chart.

The band has been primarily described as post-grunge and alternative rock, while occasionally crossing into hard rock and southern rock. Their lyrics often explore themes of abandonment, angst, rebellion, and yearning. 3 Doors Down has sold 30 million albums worldwide.

Original guitarist Matt Roberts departed in 2012, owing to health issues, before dying in 2016. He was replaced by Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson&#x27;s guitar tech. Harrell was fired from the band in 2013, after being charged with vehicular homicide, and was replaced by bassist Justin Biltonen.

==History==

===Formative years: 1996–1998===
3 Doors Down initially consisted of Brad Arnold as the lead vocalist and drummer, Matt Roberts as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist, and Todd Harrell as the bass guitarist. The band began to perform outside Escatawpa, Mississippi, eventually coming up with their official name during a trip to Foley, Alabama. When the three were walking through the town, they saw a building where some letters had fallen off its sign, reading &quot;Doors Down&quot;. Since the band consisted of three people at the time, they added the &quot;3&quot; to create &quot;3 Doors Down&quot;. The cover of their 2011 album &quot;Time of My Life&quot; hints at the original number of band members (3) and current band members (5); the clock on the album cover reads 3:05.

The three-piece began to record demo material in 1997. The demo recording sessions took place at the Holly House Recording studio in Biloxi, Mississippi. The band&#x27;s demo songs were mixed and recorded by Clyde Holly, with the recordings being released on a self-titled CD in 1997. 1,000 copies of the demo CD were released initially, with 1,000 more copies being released two years later. When the band gave the CD to local radio station WCPR-FM, they started playing the demo recording of &quot;Kryptonite&quot; and it became the No. 1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks. The station&#x27;s program director sent the song to manager Phin Daly who in turn showed it to Bill McGathy, his employer at In De Goot Entertainment. 

Two years after the band formed, Todd Harrell asked rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson to join the band. Prior to joining 3 Doors Down in 1998 as the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist, Henderson was in a band named Burning Bridges. The band was booked in New York to perform a showcase at the CBGB music club. Daly told HitQuarters: &quot;Once they got on stage and started playing it was apparent the magic was in the music. So we moved to sign them.&quot;

===Mainstream success: 1999–2004===
3 Doors Down&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;The Better Life&quot;, was released on February 8, 2000, and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over four million copies. It has since been certified 7× platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles &quot;Kryptonite&quot;, &quot;Loser&quot;, and &quot;Duck and Run&quot;. A fourth single, &quot;Be Like That&quot; was re-recorded for the 2001 film &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, with alternate lyrics for the first three lines; this version is known as the &quot;&quot;American Pie 2&quot; Edit&quot;. Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum tracks. The band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of &quot;The Better Life&quot; so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2002.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Away from the Sun&quot;, was released on November 12, 2002, and went platinum within two months of release. The album also produced singles, including &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, &quot;Here Without You&quot;, and &quot;The Road I&#x27;m On&quot;. The album has sold four million copies worldwide, including well over three million in the U.S. Session drummer Josh Freese was hired to record drums for the album. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson produced and performed on three tracks for the record, &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;, &quot;Dead Love&quot;, and &quot;Wasted Me&quot;, but only &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian Daniel Adair to play drums for the &quot;Away From the Sun&quot; tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band&#x27;s next studio release, and was with the band aboard the USS &quot;George Washington&quot; (CVN-73) to film the music video &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;.

In 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled &quot;Another 700 Miles&quot; consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. &quot;Another 700 Miles&quot; has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down&#x27;s hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 Lynyrd Skynyrd song &quot;That Smell&quot;. The group toured with Nickelback in 2004.

In 2003, the band began hosting the annual &quot;3 Doors Down and Friends&quot; benefit concert, through the band&#x27;s own charity The Better Life Foundation. In 2006, this event was held at the Mobile Convention Center, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Katrina survivors. As residents of Escatawpa, the members of the band saw the effects of Katrina&#x27;s devastation.
===Continued success: 2005–2010===
By 2005, the band had sold 12 million albums. The band&#x27;s third studio album, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Seventeen Days&quot;, has been certified platinum. Of the singles from it, &quot;Let Me Go&quot; and &quot;Behind Those Eyes&quot; charted with the most success. &quot;Live for Today&quot;, &quot;Landing in London&quot; (on which Bob Seger sang the second verse and provided back-up vocals), and &quot;Here by Me&quot; were also released as singles. During the &quot;Seventeen Days&quot; tour, the band appeared alongside southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as headlining many shows of their own.

Later in 2005, the band released a live DVD entitled &quot;Away from the Sun: Live from Houston, Texas&quot;. The DVD was produced and directed by Academy Award-nominated Alex Gibney and Doug Biro. It features songs from both &quot;The Better Life&quot; and &quot;Away from the Sun&quot;, and even some early sketches of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Me&quot; and &quot;Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, which were both eventually released on &quot;Seventeen Days&quot;.

Greg Upchurch, formerly of Puddle of Mudd, replaced Daniel Adair in 2005, when Adair left to become drummer and contributing member of Nickelback.

3 Doors Down released their self-titled fourth album on May 20, 2008. It debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 154,000 copies in its first week. It is the band&#x27;s second consecutive No. 1 album on the chart after &quot;Seventeen Days&quot;, as well their fourth album to reach the Top Ten. The album contains the hit singles &quot;It&#x27;s Not My Time&quot;, &quot;Train&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be Myself&quot; and &quot;Citizen/Soldier&quot;, a song written as a tribute to the National Guard. In 2009, 3 Doors Down, along with The Soul Children of Chicago, released the song &quot;In the Presence of the Lord&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Oh Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration&quot;.

In 2009, the band recorded a Christmas song called &quot;Where My Christmas Lives&quot;, which was the first Christmas song Brad Arnold had written. It was digitally released along with seven acoustic songs on December 8. Six of these acoustic tracks were from the previous self-titled album, and one was an acoustic version of &quot;Where my Christmas Lives&quot;.

===Line-up changes: 2011–2013===
3 Doors Down released their fifth studio album, &quot;Time of My Life&quot;, on July 19, 2011. The band had earlier released &quot;When You&#x27;re Young&quot; as the first single from the album on January 10, 2011. The single reached a position of 81 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A second single from the album, &quot;Every Time You Go&quot; was released to digital outlets on May 23, 2011. The band embarked on a tour in July 2011 across the US, Europe, and the United Kingdom in support of the album. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, with 59,800 copies sold in its first week. Beginning in May 2012, the band embarked on a six-week-long &#x27;Gang of Outlaws Tour&#x27; with headliners ZZ Top and opener Gretchen Wilson.

On May 23, 2012, Matt Roberts announced he was leaving the band to focus on his health. He told fans in a statement that &quot;3 Doors Down will always have a special place in my heart and it saddens me to take this time off. But my health has to be my first priority&quot;. Guitarist Chris Henderson announced on Twitter that his old guitar tech Chet Roberts would be taking over from Matt Roberts on lead guitar.

After the &quot;Gang of Outlaws&quot; tour finished, the band said in an interview that they were entering the studio to record three or four new songs to put on their first Greatest Hits album, which was released on November 19, 2012. During the tail end of the Gang of Outlaws tour, they debuted a new song &quot;One Light&quot; which was included on the band&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;. Guitarist Chris Henderson announced on Twitter they would be back in the studio a few weeks after the tour had ended. In late 2012, the band appeared at several smaller shows including one in Huntington, NY. The band performed at Download Festival 2013 at the Zippo Encore Stage on the Friday of the three-day festival. From the tailend of 2012 through to March 2013, 3 Doors Down went on a joint headlining tour with US rock band Daughtry to promote Daughtry&#x27;s 3rd studio album release. The cover of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; was captured and uploaded to Daughtry&#x27;s official YouTube channel. The band also played the Dubai Jazz Festival in February 2013.

On April 20, 2013, bassist Todd Harrell was charged with vehicular homicide for his actions the night before in Nashville, Tennessee. He was reportedly driving on I-40 at high speed while under the influence of prescription medication when he caused an accident that killed 47-year-old Paul Howard Shoulders Jr. The judge in the case harshly criticized the musician&#x27;s doctor in the courtroom, accusing the physician of prescribing Harrell far too many pain pills. Harrell was also charged with bringing controlled substances into a correctional detention facility. Harrell&#x27;s court and trial dates have been repeatedly postponed by Harrell&#x27;s attorneys for various reasons, including a rehab stay. In December 2015, Harrell was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment followed by six years of probation.

3 Doors Down later announced that the four scheduled shows in the U.S. for April and May had been cancelled out of respect for Shoulders and his family. The European tour with Prime Circle and the summer tour dates with Daughtry, which had been announced the day after the incident in Nashville, remained intact. On May 24, a week before the start on the European tour, Justin Biltonen, formerly of The Campaign 1984, was announced as the band&#x27;s new bassist. The tour, starting in Moscow, Russia began on May 31, 2013. On July 20, 2013, they played live at the 2013 National Scout Jamboree at the Summit Bechtel Reserve.

===&quot;Us and the Night&quot; and death of Matt Roberts: 2014–2018===
In January 2014, Chris Henderson stated that their new album would be released sometime in the year. From the end of 2013 into 2014, the band embarked on an acoustic tour entitled &quot;Songs from the Basement&quot; and toured around the US. In February 2014, Todd Harrell was arrested in Mississippi once again for a DUI. Afterward, the band released a statement that Harrell was permanently out of the band, and that they would continue with Justin Biltonen as his replacement. In June, Henderson announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Us and the Night&quot;. It was originally set to be released between September and November 2015. In January 2016, the album&#x27;s release date was finally revealed to be March 11, 2016. The band then went on tour around North America and in festivals such as Fort rock and Carolina Rebellion. 3 Doors Down toured the UK and Europe with multiple sold-out shows.

Former guitarist Matt Roberts died on August 20, 2016, at the age of 38 from a prescription drug overdose.

3 Doors Down performed at the presidential inauguration concert of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Arnold told &quot;TMZ&quot; that he was &quot;proud&quot; to perform and that he thinks it would be a &quot;good experience&quot;. Fans of the band expressed mixed to negative feedback about it performing at the inauguration; the band received criticism and ridicule for playing at the event. 3 Doors Down&#x27;s business manager, Angus Vail, explained to &quot;Vice&quot; the reasons behind the band&#x27;s decision to perform by saying: &quot;Well, 3 Doors actually played George W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration. They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys — they come from conservative families. You know, they&#x27;re really good guys, but they have very different political beliefs. Because they played both Bush&#x27;s inaugurations, they&#x27;ve obviously been on the conservative radar.&quot; Vail continued that the band&#x27;s choice to perform had a lot to do with their &quot;God, guns, and country black-and-white sort of viewpoint&quot; and that &quot;they spend a lot of time going to Iraq, doing service, playing for the troops.&quot; In the week following the performance, the band&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album reentered the Billboard 200 at a new peak of No. 94; the album had debuted and peaked at No. 100 in 2012 and had been off the chart since April 2016. In February 2018, during an interview with Detroit Metro Times, rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson stated about the performance, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t a Trump thing. That&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t understand. It was the inauguration of a president of the United States of America.&quot; and &quot;this is history-making stuff. It&#x27;s a one-in-a-lifetime chance to do something for your country. So that&#x27;s why we did it.&quot;

In 2018, 3 Doors Down embarked on the Rock n&#x27; Roll Express tour with Collective Soul and opening act Soul Asylum. The tour had shows in 36 cities in the United States.

===Upcoming seventh studio album: 2018–present===
In July 2018, Brad Arnold stated that 3 Doors Down had been writing new material; &quot;Who knows when we&#x27;ll follow that one up. But we have been writing new songs. Maybe we&#x27;ll release a single or a couple of new songs. We just might not release an album for a while. We still love creating new material — there&#x27;s just not a market for it. But fans still like going out and seeing us.&quot; In August 2019, Arnold stated that the band would soon begin working on a follow-up to &quot;Us and the Night&quot;.

==Other appearances==
On February 9, 2010, the band released a song called &quot;Shine&quot;, through digital media such as iTunes, which was used as a promotion for the 2010 Winter Olympics and is available through digital outlets. Billboard listed 3 Doors Down as the No. 30 band in the decade from 2000 to 2010.

On January 30, 2011, 3 Doors Down played during the 1st period intermission of the 2011 NHL All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. They played two songs: &quot;When You&#x27;re Young&quot; followed by &quot;Kryptonite&quot;. The band also held a free concert as part of the weekend festivities on January 28, 2011, in downtown Raleigh.

On June 28–29, 2014, 3 Doors Down played both days of the Americafest celebration at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. They played all of their greatest hits and two new songs.

For a Mardi Gras celebration, the band performed at Universal Studios Florida on February 25, 2023.

==The Better Life Foundation==

3 Doors Down started The Better Life Foundation (TBLF) in 2003, with a goal in mind to give as many children as possible a better life. Since its inception TBLF has supported numerous charities across the US, including the Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse, and the Habitat for Humanity, as well as providing aid and assistance to the Gulf Coast region of Mississippi during Hurricane Katrina. In 2006, Brad Arnold stated that approximately $900,000 had been raised.

When the Mississippi town of Waveland took an especially hard hit from Hurricane Katrina, the charity was able to purchase three police cars and a fire truck to help with rescue efforts. Also, in connection with Wal-Mart, they were able to supply the town with three semi-trucks full of rescue supplies. There was also extensive support from TBLF in providing funding for rebuilding efforts in the town.

3 Doors Down and The Better Life Foundation host a yearly show to raise money for the charity. Beginning in 2010, the show is performed at Horseshoe Hotel and Casino, in Tunica, Mississippi. Prior to 2010, the show was performed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. In addition to a concert from 3 Doors Down and friends, there is also an auction, which includes numerous items from musical friends, sports icons, and other various supporters of the band and the charity. There is an average of 60 items auctioned off yearly, and proceeds are given to TBLF. As of 2016, The Better Life Foundation annual benefit concert has been held at Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Casino Resort in Cherokee, North Carolina.

Past performers at the show include Lynyrd Skynyrd, Shinedown, Alter Bridge, Staind, Hinder, Switchfoot, Tracy Lawrence, Sara Evans, and others. Past auction items include a Paul Stanley guitar played on the KISS Farewell Tour, a total of four Roger Bourget motorcycles, access to the Dale Jr. racing suite, NASCAR artwork by Brad Daley, numerous signed guitars, and sports memorabilia.

<text>Jacques Necker (; 30 September 1732 – 9 April 1804) was a Genevan banker and statesman who served as finance minister for Louis XVI. He was a reformer, but his innovations sometimes caused great discontent. Necker was a constitutional monarchist, a political economist, and a moralist, who wrote a severe critique of the new principle of equality before the law.

Necker initially held the finance post between July 1777 and 1781. In 1781, he earned widespread recognition for his unprecedented decision to publish the Compte rendu – thus making the country&#x27;s budget public – &quot;a novelty in an absolute monarchy where the state of finances had always been kept a secret.&quot; Necker was dismissed within a few months. By 1788, the inexorable compounding of interest on the national debt brought France to a fiscal crisis. Necker was recalled to royal service. His dismissal on 11 July 1789 was a factor in causing the Storming of the Bastille. Within two days, Necker was recalled by the king and the assembly. Necker entered France in triumph and tried to accelerate the tax reform process. Faced with the opposition of the Constituent Assembly, he resigned in September 1790 to a reaction of general indifference.

==Early life and career==

Necker was born on 30 September 1732 in Geneva to Karl Friedrich Necker and Jeanne-Marie Gautier. His father was a lawyer from Küstrin in Neumark, Prussia (now Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland). After publishing some works, Karl Friedrich was appointed professor of public law at the Academy of Geneva in 1725, and later served in the city&#x27;s Council of Two Hundred. After studying at the Academy of Geneva, Necker moved to Paris in 1748 and became a clerk in the bank of Isaac Vernet and Peter Thellusson. Soon after, he managed to learn Dutch and English. One day, he replaced the first clerk in charge of trading on the stock exchange, and through a sequence of trades, he made a quick profit of half a million French livres. In 1762, Vernet retired and Necker became a partner in the bank with Thellusson who managed the bank in London, while Necker served as his managing partner in Paris. In 1763, before the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, he successfully speculated in British debentures or bonds, wheat, and possibly some shares, which he sold at a good profit in the next few years. 


Necker had fallen in love with Madame de Verménou, the widow of a French officer. When she went to see Théodore Tronchin, she met Suzanne Curchod. In 1764, Madame de Verménou brought Curchod to Paris as a companion for Thelusson&#x27;s children. Suzanne was engaged to British historian Edward Gibbon, but he was forced to break the engagement. Necker transferred his love from the wealthy widow to the ambitious Swiss governess; they married that year. In 1766, they moved to Rue de Cléry and had a daughter, Anne Louise Germaine, who grew to become the famed author and &quot;salonnière&quot; Madame de Staël.

Madame Necker encouraged her husband to try to find himself a public position. He, accordingly, became a syndic, or director, of the French East India Company, around which a fierce political debate revolved in the 1760s between the company&#x27;s directors and shareholders and the royal ministry over its administration and the company&#x27;s autonomy. After showing his financial ability in its management, Necker defended the company&#x27;s autonomy in an able memoir against the attacks of Morellet in 1769. As the company never made any profit during its existence, the monopoly ended. The era of free trade had begun. Necker bought up the company&#x27;s ships and stock of unsold goods when it went bankrupt in 1769.

From 1768 to 1776, he made loans to the French government in the form of life annuities and by lottery operations. His wife made him give up his share in the bank, which he transferred to his brother Louis Necker and Jean Girardot in 1772. In 1773, Necker won the prize of the Académie Française for a defense of state corporatism framed as an eulogy in honor of Louis XIV&#x27;s minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Necker&#x27;s capital amounted to six or eight million livres, and he used Château de Madrid as a summer house. In 1775, in &quot;Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains&quot;, he attacked the physiocrats, like Ferdinando Galiani, and questioned the laissez-faire policies of Turgot, the Controller-General of Finances. Turgot had made too many enemies; in May 1776, he was dismissed. But his successor, Clugny de Nuis, died in October. Therefore, on 22 October 1776, on the recommendation of Maurepas, Necker was appointed &quot;Directeur du trésor royal&quot;. (As a Protestant, Necker could not serve as Controller.) 

==Finance Minister of France==
On 29 June 1777, according to his daughter in her &quot;Vie privée de Mr Necker&quot; he was made director-general of the royal treasury and not Controller-General of Finance which was impossible because of his Protestant faith. Necker refused a salary, but he was not admitted to the Royal Council. He gained popularity through regulating the government&#x27;s finances by attempting to divide the &quot;taille&quot; and the capitation tax more equally, abolishing a tax known as the &quot;vingtième d&#x27;industrie&quot;, (a value-added tax) and establishing &quot;monts de piété&quot; (pawnshop-like establishments for loaning money on security). Necker tried through careful reforms (abolition of pensions, mortmain, droit de suite and more fair taxation) to rehabilitate the disorganized state budget. He abolished over five hundred sinecures and superfluous posts. Together with his wife, he visited and improved life in hospitals and prisons. In April 1778 he remitted 2.4 million livres from his own fortune to the royal treasury. Unlike Turgot – in his &quot;Mémoire sur les municipalités&quot; – Necker tried to install provincial assemblies and hoped they could serve as an effective means of reforming the Ancien régime. Necker succeeded only in Berry and Haute-Guyenne, where he installed assemblies with an equal number of members from the Third Estate.

His greatest financial measures were his use of loans to help fund the French debt and his use of high interest rates rather than raising taxes. The collection of indirect taxes was restored to the farmers-general (1780), but Necker reduced their number by a third and subjected them to sharper scrutiny and control. In September 1780, Necker asked for his dismissal, but the King refused to let him go.

===Compte rendu au roi (Report to the King)===
By 1781, France was suffering financially, and, as director-general of the royal treasury, he was blamed for the rather high debt accrued from the American Revolution. A series of pamphlets appeared, criticizing Necker. Jacques-Mathieu Augeard attacked him on his foreign origin, his faith, and economic choices. The main reason behind this was the action of Necker &quot;cooking the books&quot; or falsifying the records. He brightened the picture by excluding military outlays and other &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; charges (Menus-Plaisirs du Roi) and ignoring the national debt. Both Necker and Calonne were deceived with the number of pensions and gratifications. The king spent much more on his brothers than on public health. After Necker had shown Louis XVI his annual report, the king tried to keep its contents secret. Necker met the challenge aggressively by asking the King to bring him into the royal council. In revenge, Necker made the &quot;Compte rendu au roi&quot; public; in no time between 200,000 copies were sold. It was rapidly translated into Dutch, German, Danish, Italian and English.

In his most influential work, which brought him instant fame, Necker summarized governmental income and expenditures to provide the first record of royal finances ever made public. The Account was meant to be an educational piece for the people, and in it, he expressed his desire to create a well-informed, interested populace. Before, the people had never considered governmental income and expenditure to be their concern, but the &quot;Compte rendu&quot; made them more proactive.

Maurepas became jealous, and Vergennes called him a revolutionist. Necker declared that he would resign unless given the full title and authority of a minister, with a seat on the Conseil du Roi. Both Maurepas and Vergennes replied that they would resign if this was done. When Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781, people of all stations flocked to his home at St. Ouen. In August 1781 Madame Necker went as far as Utrecht to buy the libels that appeared in the name of Turgot against her husband. She even tried to have the booksellers arrested. 

After his dismissal, Necker bought an estate in Coppet. His brother Louis purchased an estate in Cologny. Both estates were located near Lake Geneva. In retirement, Necker, believing in &quot;credible policy&quot;, occupied himself with law and economics, producing his famous &quot;Traité de l&#x27;administration des finances de la France&quot; (1784). Calonne tried to prevent the distribution of the book in Paris. Never had a work on such a serious subject obtained such general success; 80,000 copies were sold. 

=== Second term as Controller-General ===
The Necker family returned to the Paris region, supposing they were present at the wedding of their only daughter Germaine in January 1786. The impending national bankruptcy of France caused Calonne to convene an Assembly of notables under the elimination of parlements in order to enforce tax reforms. It had not met since 1626. One could not issue new loans without the Parlements&#x27; approval. In his speech, Calonne expressed doubts about Necker&#x27;s statistics in the &quot;Compte rendu&quot;. According to him, they were false and misleading, as the state revenues had been revised upwards. For Calonne, the French deficit was caused by Necker, who had not raised the taxes. However, Calonne got involved in several financial scandals regarding the &quot;Calonne Company&quot; and was dismissed by the king on 8 April 1787. On 11 April, Necker replied on the charges made by Calonne. Two days later Louis XVI banished Necker by a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; for his very public exchange of pamphlets.

After two months, Necker was allowed to return to Paris. Necker published his &quot;Nouveaux éclaircissement sur le compte rendu&quot;. Also Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and his secretary Charles-Louis Ducrest came up with proposals. The next minister of finance Loménie de Brienne resigned within fifteen months. On 24 August 1788; the king allowed him an enormous pension.

On 25 or 26 August, Necker was called back to office accompanied by fireworks. According to John Hardman, Marie-Antoinette helped to organise Necker&#x27;s return to power. This time he insisted on the title of Controller-General of Finances and access to the royal council.
Necker was appointed as Chief minister of France. He revoked the order of 16 August requiring bondholders to accept paper instead of money; government bonds rose 30% on the market.

On 7 September 1788, Paris was looking at famine, and Necker suspended the exportation of corn, purchased seventy million livres of wheat, and publicly reposted the decree of the King&#x27;s Council of 23 April 1789 allowing police to inspect granaries and private inventories of grain, but none of these efforts could solve the problem. In 1788, insurrections broke out in Brittany, and Necker was sacked again. In a letter to Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, Marie-Antoinette took personal credit for forcing the king&#x27;s hand on this matter. She believed that Necker would lessen the King&#x27;s authority and wrote &quot;the moment is pressing. It is very essential that Necker should accept.&quot;

===Impact of the American Revolution===
One of the most significant fiscal issues Necker faced was the American Revolutionary War and the resulting debt. The war was popular with almost every Frenchman, except Necker. For the first time, the king waged a war without raising the taxes. As France had financed its participation almost exclusively by municipal bonds, Necker warned of the consequences for the French national budget as the war continued. (The war had cost the state already ca. 1.5 billion livres.) The ministers of War and Navy were especially hostile towards him.

In 1781, Congress appointed Robert Morris as Superintendent of Finance after the US went bankrupt. In 1783, Morris cut off interest payments to France, its largest foreign creditor. This led Necker to seek funds from elsewhere. Nicolaas van Staphorst told Necker that the entire French debt might be redeemed without any loss through the Amsterdam capital markets. The Van Staphorsts made an offer for the American bonds. Necker warmed to the proposal but asked for collateral and the sanction of a large investment bank. Necker decided that without collateral or the sanction of a major investment bank, the proposal was not acceptable.

Thomas Jefferson, who had succeeded Franklin as American minister to France and John Adams as head of American finance in Europe in 1785, learned about the meeting between the Van Staphorsts’ representatives and the French Minister of Finance only in November 1786, when he received a redacted document describing the Dutch offer from Étienne Clavière, a Genevan banker and pro-America.

The Dutch bankers advanced the treasury sufficient funds to forestall a crisis over the next year. The winter of 1788–89 was one of the bitterest in history. By the summer of 1789, the population suffered from famine. Necker intervened personally and successfully at the Amsterdam bank Hope &amp; Co. to supply the &#x27;King of France&#x27; with grain. He used the 2.4 million livres in the royal treasury as a collateral.

==The one non-noble minister==
By the time of his second term in office, Necker desired a more limited monarchy and favored increased power for the Estates General. According to Peter Kropotkin, Necker &quot;helped to shake down the system which was already tottering to its fall, but he was powerless to prevent the fall from becoming a revolution: probably he did not even perceive that it was impending.&quot;

Necker succeeded in doubling the representation of the Third Estate to satisfy the nation&#x27;s people. The Third Estate had as many deputies as the other two orders together. His address at the Estates-General on 5 May 1789 about the fundamental problems as financial health, constitutional monarchy, and institutional and political reforms lasted three hours. Necker suffered from a cold and, after fifteen minutes, he asked the secretary of the Agricultural Society to read the remainder. He invited the representatives to leave aside their factional interests and take into consideration the general, long-term interests of the nation. Personal rivalries and radical claims had to give way to a pragmatic spirit of moderation and conciliation. He concluded: According to Simon Schama, he &quot;appeared to consider the Estates-General to be a facility designed to help the administration rather than to reform government&quot;. Two weeks later, Necker seems to have sought to persuade the king to adopt a constitution similar to that of Great Britain and advised him in the strongest possible terms to make the necessary concessions before it was too late. According to François Mignet, &quot;he hoped to reduce the number of orders, and bring about the adoption of the English form of government, by uniting the clergy and nobility in one chamber, and the third estate in another.&quot; Necker warned the king that unless the privileged orders yielded, the States-General would collapse, taxes would not be paid, and the government would be bankrupt.

On 17 June 1789, the first act of the new National Assembly declared all existing taxes illegal. Necker had legitimate reasons to be concerned about the implications of this unprecedented decision. On 23 June, the king proposed to the royal council the dissolution of the Assembly. On 11 July, the king advised Necker to leave the country immediately. According to Jean Luzac, Necker and his wife went for a walk in a park. They then got into their carriage to drive to their estate in Saint-Ouen at seven in the evening. When the news became known the next day, it enraged Camille Desmoulins. Wax heads of Necker and the Duc d&#x27;Orléans were taken through the streets to the Tuileries. The Royal Guard allegedly chose to open fire rather than salute the likenesses. The threat of a counter-revolution caused citizens to take up arms and storm the Bastille on 14 July. The king and the Assembly recalled the immensely popular Necker to a third ministry in a letter dated 16 July. Necker replied from Basle on the 23rd. He wrote to his brother that he was going back to the abyss. His successor, the 74-year-old Joseph Foullon de Doué, was hanged from a lamppost on the 22nd. His entry into Versailles on the 29th was a festival day. Necker demanded a pardon for Baron de Besenval, who was imprisoned after given command of the troops concentrated in and around Paris early July.

On 4 August 1789, the day when feudalism was abolished by the National Assembly, Necker is quoted as saying, &quot;The collectors of the taille are at their last shift.&quot;

===Assignats===
Necker proved to be powerless as tax revenue dropped quickly. Credit was wrecked, according to Talleyrand; for Mirabeau &quot;the deficit was the treasure of the nation&quot; as it had made many changes possible. By September, the treasury was empty. According to Marat, the whole famine was the work of one man, accusing Necker of buying up all the corn on every side, in order that Paris had none. Talleyrand proposed that &quot;national goods&quot; be given back to the nation. In November 1789, ecclesiastical possessions were confiscated by the state. Necker proposed to borrow from the Caisse d&#x27;Escompte, but his intention to change the private bank into a national bank similar to the Bank of England failed. A general bankruptcy seemed certain. Mirabeau proposed to Lafayette to overthrow Necker. On 21 December 1789, a first decree was voted through, ordering the issue (in April 1790) of 400 million &quot;assignats&quot;, certificates of indebtedness of 1,000 livres each, with an interest rate of 5%, secured and repayable based on the auctioning of the &quot;Biens nationaux&quot;. Once the assignats were paid, they had to be destroyed or burnt. 

In January 1790, Necker obtained an order of arrest against Jean-Paul Marat, for having &quot;had openly espoused the cause of the people, the poorest classes,&quot; according to Peter Kropotkin. Marat was forced to flee to London. On 10 March 1790, on the proposition of Pétion, the administration of the church property was transferred to the municipalities. At the same time, Étienne Clavière lobbied for large issues of assignats representing national wealth and operating as legal tender. For daily, life smaller denominations were needed and extended to the whole of France. On 17 April 1790, the new notes of 200 and 300 livres were declared legal tender but their interest was reduced to 3%. The assignats would compensate for the scarcity of coin and would revive industry and trade.

In May 1790, the feudal and ecclesiastical properties were sold against assignats. Constitutional monarchists such as Maury, Cazalès, Bergasse and d&#x27;Eprémesnil opposed it. The deputies in the Convention prepared a surety for future issues of paper money (on 19 June and 29 July). Half of the taxes over the preceding year were still not received. People who earned more than 400 livres were invited to go to their municipality and fulfill their duty. As it was not the final cure, Necker asked his friends, the Geneva &quot;banquiers&quot;, to pay the arrears the Assembly turned it down. The political scene came to be dominated by &quot;clamorous spectators, passionate judges, and ungovernable agitators&quot;. Necker was continuously attacked by Jean-Paul Marat in his pamphlets and by Jacques-René Hébert in his newspaper. Count Mirabeau, who played a decisive role in the Assembly, accused him of complete financial dictatorship. For Mirabeau, to express doubts in the assignats was to express doubts in the revolution.

At the end of August, the government was again in distress; four months after the first issue the money was spent. Montesquiou-Fézensac, the teacher of Mirabeau, presented a report in the Assembly. Assignats should be used not only for payment of church property.

Montesquiou had massively exaggerated the amount of the redeemable debt, probably to convince the Assembly. On 27 August 1790, the Assembly decided another issue of 1.9 billion assignats which would become legal tender before the end of the year. Necker endeavored to dissuade the Assembly from the proposed issue; suggesting that other means could be found for accomplishing the result, and he predicted terrible evils. Necker was not backed by Comte de Mirabeau, his strongest opponent who called for &quot;national money&quot; and won that day. A few crowds were sent to shout and threaten him. When all resources were exhausted, the Assembly created paper money, according to Necker. He handed in his resignation on 3 September. The massive and dangerous issue of 1.9 billion he succeeded to get down to 800 million, but the attacks influenced his resignation. Necker did not step down on the decision to make the assignat legal tender. Instead,the choice to issue the paper money along with political opposition proved to be his main motivators.

The Assembly decreed that it would itself direct the public Treasury. Necker foretold that the paper money, with which the dividends were about to be paid, would soon be of no value. Du Pont de Nemours feared the emission of assignats would double the price of bread. Since no one had truly the right to make assignats, everyone would soon begin to do so. Montesquiou-Fézensac, charged with the issue of assignats, feared stockjobbing and greed. A declaration (14 Oct) suspending all interest payments turned the assignats into fiat money.

Necker&#x27;s efforts to keep the financial situation afloat were ineffective. His popularity vanished and he resigned with a damaged reputation. Necker left leaving two million livres in the public treasury; he took 1/5 of the amount with him.

==Retirement==
Necker, suspected of reactionary tendencies, traveled east to Arcis-sur-Aube and Vesoul, where he was arrested, but on 11 September he was allowed to leave the country. At Coppet Castle, he occupied himself with political economy, and law. At the end of 1792, he published a brochure on the trial against Louis XVI. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French émigrés considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative. 

Initially living in Rolle, the Neckers moved to an apartment in Beaulieu Castle following the installation of a revolutionary government in Geneva. After being put on the list of Émigrés, Necker was not paid any interest on the money he had left in the treasury. His house in Rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin, his estate in Saint-Ouen sûr Seine, and the two million livres were confiscated by the French government. Mme Necker, who had always seen herself as ill, sank into mental illness. Since the birth of Germaine, she was correcting the most morbid clauses of her will and insisted to be embalmed by Samuel-Auguste Tissot, preserved and exhibited in a bedroom for four months. He continued to live under the care of his daughter. By 1794, France would be flooded by false assignats. But his time was past, and his books had except abroad no political influence. In 1795 Germaine moved to Paris with Benjamin Constant, but she came back, sometimes involuntary, and founded the Cercle de Coppet.

In March 1798, Bern was attacked during the French invasion of Switzerland. Necker was treated with respect when the army passed his mansion. In July 1798, he was removed from the list of Émigrés. His house in the 9th arrondissement of Paris was sold to (or occupied by?) the husband of Juliette Récamier. In early June 1800, Necker met with Napoleon on his way to Marengo. In confidence, Napoleon told him about his plans to reestablish a monarchy in France. The publication of Necker&#x27;s &quot;Last Views on Politics and Finance&quot; in 1802 upset the first consul. He threatened to exile Madame de Staël from Paris because of this book. Although Necker had never been a republican before, toward the end of his life, he engaged seriously with the project of creating and consolidating a republic &quot;one and indivisible&quot; in France. Necker then foretold the suppression of the Tribunat as it took place under the French Consulate. His claim of two million on the state treasury was not recognized by the Sénat conservateur.

Necker passed away in 1804. He was buried next to his wife in the garden of Coppet Castle. The mausoleum was sealed in 1817 following Germaine&#x27;s death. The Charter of 1814 signed by Louis XVIII at Saint-Ouen sûr Seine contained almost all the articles in support of liberty proposed by Necker before the Revolution of 14 July 1789. Therefore, George Armstrong Kelly called him the &quot;grandfather of Restoration Liberalism.&quot;

&quot;Posterity has not been fair to Necker,&quot; according to Aurelian Craiutu. On 11 August 1792, the day after the Storming of the Tuileries, all the busts were removed from the town hall, including the one of Necker by Jean-Antoine Houdon and smashed. Like Mirabeau, the Marquis De Lafayette, Barnave and Pétion, Necker was only temporarily supported by the people.

==Personal life==

In 1786 Necker&#x27;s daughter Germaine married Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein; she was to become a prominent figure in her own right and a leading opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte. On 22 March 1814, she was promised 21 years of interest on her father&#x27;s investment in the public treasury. After his death his daughter published &quot;Vie privée de Mr. Necker&quot;. His grandson Auguste de Staël (1790–1827) edited the Complete Oeuvres by Jacques Necker.

His nephew Jacques Necker (1757–1825), a botanist, married Albertine Necker de Saussure. They took care of their uncle after his wife had died in 1794. Their son was the geologist and crystallographer Louis Albert Necker de Saussure.

== Early life ==
Fishburne was born in Augusta, Georgia, the son of Hattie Bell (), a junior high school mathematics and science teacher, and Laurence John Fishburne, Jr., a juvenile corrections officer. After his parents divorced during his childhood, he moved with his mother to Brooklyn, New York, where he was raised. His father saw him once a month. Fishburne is a graduate of Lincoln Square Academy in New York, which closed in the 1980s.

== Career ==
=== 1972–1989: Early career and stage work ===
For most of his early career, he was credited as Larry Fishburne. In 1972, at the age of 11, Fishburne received positive reviews for his first acting role in the initial ABC Theater teleplay &quot;If You Give a Dance You Gotta Pay the Band&quot;. Soon after, Fishburne portrayed Joshua Hall on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. His most memorable childhood role was in &quot;Cornbread, Earl and Me&quot;, in which he played a young boy who witnessed the police shooting of a popular high school basketball star. He later earned a supporting role in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, in which he played Tyrone Miller, a cocky 17-year-old Gunner&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class from the Bronx, nicknamed Mr. Clean. When production began in March 1976, he was just 14 years old, having lied about his age to get the part. Filming took so long that he actually was 17 years old upon its completion.

Fishburne spent much of the 1980s in and out of television and periodically on stage. In the early 1980s, he worked as a bouncer at punk rock clubs, such as Cathay de Grande. He appeared in the early 1980s movies &quot;Band of the Hand&quot;, &quot;Death Wish 2&quot; and &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, and had a minor role in the critically acclaimed Steven Spielberg film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. Fishburne had a recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on Paul Reubens&#x27; CBS children&#x27;s television series &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

His stage work during the 1980s included &quot;Short Eyes&quot; (1984), and &quot;Loose Ends&quot; (1987), both produced at Second Stage Theatre in New York City. Also in 1987 he played a part in the third &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film as a hospital orderly. Fishburne featured in &quot;Red Heat&quot; (1988) beside Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. Fishburne also starred as &quot;Dap&quot; in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;School Daze&quot; (1988). Fishburne&#x27;s character was a depiction of an African American, culturally inclined college student at a historically black college.

He also starred in &quot;Deep Cover&quot; alongside Jeff Goldblum. In 1993, he received his first Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ike Turner in &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do With It&quot;. Fishburne won an Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture&quot; for his performance as West Indian Professor Maurice Phipps in the 1995 American drama ensemble film, &quot;Higher Learning&quot;. He played the title role in &quot;Othello&quot;, the second African-American actor, after Paul Robeson, to perform the role. In 1995, Fishburne wrote, directed, and starred in the play &quot;Riff-Raff&quot; at the now defunct Off-Broadway Circle Rep Theater. The cast included Titus Welliver and Heavy D, who performed a nine-minute live-rap on stage. In 1997, Fishburne starred in the science fiction horror &quot;Event Horizon&quot; alongside Sam Neill.

He reprised his role as Morpheus in the &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; in 2003. He briefly featured as a stretcher-bearer in one version of the video for The Spooks&#x27; song &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Seen&quot; (2000) and appeared with Tom Cruise as Theodore Brassell, IMF superior of Cruise&#x27;s character in &quot;&quot;. Fishburne has worked with actress Angela Bassett on four projects. He said that &quot;An electrifying thing happens when the two of us work together. I haven&#x27;t experienced it with anyone else. A freedom happens when we work together.&quot; In 2006, they appeared onstage in a Pasadena Playhouse production of August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fences&quot;.

<text>A prequel is a literary, dramatic or cinematic work whose story precedes that of a previous work, by focusing on events that occur before the original narrative. A prequel is a work that forms part of a backstory to the preceding work.

The term &quot;prequel&quot; is a 20th-century neologism from the prefix &quot;pre-&quot; (from Latin &quot;prae&quot;, &quot;before&quot;) and &quot;sequel&quot;.

Like sequels, prequels may or may not concern the same plot as the work from which they are derived. More often they explain the background that led to the events in the original, but sometimes the connections are not completely explicit. Sometimes prequels play on the audience&#x27;s knowledge of what will happen next, using deliberate references to create dramatic irony.

==History==
Though the word &quot;prequel&quot; is of recent origin, works fitting this concept existed long before. The &quot;Cypria&quot;, presupposing hearers&#x27; acquaintance with the events of the Homeric epic, confined itself to what preceded the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and thus formed a kind of introduction.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;prequel&quot; first appeared in print in 1958 in an article by Anthony Boucher in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, used to describe James Blish&#x27;s 1956 story &quot;They Shall Have Stars,&quot; which expanded on the story introduced in his earlier 1955 work, &quot;Earthman Come Home&quot;. However, Christopher Tolkien, writing about the history of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in 1977, claims that his father, J. R. R. Tolkien, &quot;coined the highly uncharacteristic word &#x27;prequel when badgered for a definition of the relationship between &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; sometime after 1955.

The term came into general usage in the 1970s and 1980s.

&quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot; (1979) may have introduced the term &quot;prequel&quot; into the mainstream. 

An example of a prequel would be C. S. Lewis&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, published in 1955, that explained the creation of Narnia - the subject of Lewis&#x27;s seven-book series &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which began with &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, published in 1950.

&quot;The Adventures of Ben Gunn&quot;, a 1956 novel by R. F. Delderfield, was written as a prequel to the novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

==Usage==
Rather than being a concept distinct from that of a &quot;sequel&quot;, a &quot;prequel&quot; still adheres to the general principle of serialization, defined only by its internal chronology and publication order. For example, &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) is a prequel to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy (1977–1983), but is only a &quot;predecessor&quot; of &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) because of the release order. Likewise, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; is a prequel to 1981&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; in that it is set in 1935, one year before the first film. In some cases, such as this one, there little impact by the relative placement over overarching plotlines. When an entire continuity is started over again, a so-called reboot, such as in the case of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; or &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, it is typically &quot;not&quot; thought of as a prequel, although it is set earlier in the common chronology of the characters and may give away plot points common to both timelines.

===Complications===
Sometimes &quot;prequel&quot; describes follow-ups where it is not always possible to apply a label defined solely in terms of intertextuality. In the case of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, the narrative combines elements of a prequel with those of a more generalized sequel by having two intercut narrative strands, one continuing from the first film (the mafia family story under the leadership of Michael Corleone), and one, completely separate, detailing events that precede it (the story of his father Vito Corleone in his youth, included). In this sense the film can be regarded as both a &quot;prequel and a sequel&quot; (i.e., both a prior and a continuing story), and is often referred to in this manner. &quot;&quot; begins after the events of the 2019 remake of the original film, where Rafiki tells the story of Mufasa to his granddaughter Kiara. The film then flashes back and spends most of its runtime chronicling that story, with some scenes in the present day included in between to add commentary, as well as at the end of the film.

Time-travel often results in a work being considered both a prequel and a sequel, or both a prequel and a &quot;soft&quot; reboot, depending on how drastically history is altered. Examples of arguable soft-reboot prequels include &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;The Flash&quot;, the latter of which completely erases the events of the DC Extended Universe film series to make way for the reboot series. Time-travel sequel-prequels can be found in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; series. Even though the latter three films depict world events chronologically prior to those of the first two films, the narrative itself is continuous for the main characters, as three apes from the first two films go back in time. The later installment &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; served as both a sequel and prequel to the first film. &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; begins in the dystopian future following the &quot;X-Men&quot; original trilogy, where Wolverine&#x27;s conscience is sent back in time to 1973, before the events of the trilogy and after the events of the prequel film &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, to prevent the future from happening. The film alternates between the two timelines, functioning as both a sequel-prequel to the original trilogy and a sequel to &quot;First Class&quot;.&quot;&quot; is an example of a TV series that uses time-travel to serve as both a sequel and prequel to another series (in this case, the original Transformers cartoon).

The term &quot;prequel&quot; has also been applied, sometimes incorrectly, to origin-story reboots, such as &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, and &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The creators of both &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; also stated their intent to dispense with the continuity of the previous films so they would exist as separate pieces of work, with Christopher Nolan—director of &quot;Batman Begins&quot;—explicitly stating he does not consider it a prequel. Here, &quot;prequel&quot; denotes status as a &quot;franchise-renewing original&quot; that depicts events earlier in the (internally inconsistent) narrative cycle than those of a previous installment. Most reviewers require that a prequel must lead up to the beginning of its original work, which is inconsistent with works that dispense with the narrative of previous work and are not significantly within the same continuity. At times, the term has been used to refer to a work that was released, as well as chronologically set, before any other work. However, that usage conflicts with the fact that a prequel is a type of sequel.

<doc id="156013" wikidata="Q304144" url="?curid=156013" title="Blues scale">
<text>The term [[blues]] scale refers to several different scales with differing numbers of pitches and related characteristics. A blues scale is often formed by the addition of an out-of-key &quot;blue note&quot; to an existing scale, notably the flat fifth addition to the minor pentatonic scale. However, the heptatonic blues scale can be considered a major scale with altered intervals.

==Types==
===Hexatonic===
The hexatonic, or six-note, blues scale consists of the minor pentatonic scale plus the 5th degree of the original heptatonic scale. This added note can be spelled as either a 5 or a 4. 

The first known published instance of this scale is Jamey Aebersold&#x27;s &quot;How to Play Jazz and Improvise Volume 1&quot; (1970 revision, p. 26), and Jerry Coker claims that David Baker may have been the first educator to organise this particular collection of notes pedagogically as a scale to be taught in helping beginners evoke the sound of the blues. 

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 6/4
 c4 es f fis g bes c2
&lt;/score&gt;
A major feature of the blues scale is the use of blue notes—notes that are played or sung microtonally, at a slightly higher or lower pitch than standard. However, since blue notes are considered alternative inflections, a blues scale may be considered to not fit the traditional definition of a scale. At its most basic, a single version of this blues scale is commonly used over all changes (or chords) in a twelve-bar blues progression. Likewise, in contemporary jazz theory, its use is commonly based upon the key rather than the individual chord.

Greenblatt defines two blues scales, the major and the minor. The major blues scale is 1, 2,3, 3, 5, 6 and the minor is 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7. The latter is the same as the hexatonic scale described above.

In the Movable do solfège, the hexatonic major blues scale is solmized as &quot;do-re-me-mi-sol-la&quot;; In the La-based minor movable do solfège, the hexatonic minor blues scale is solmized as &quot;la-do-re-me-mi-sol&quot;.

===Heptatonic===
One heptatonic, or seven-note, conception of the blues scale is as a diatonic scale (a major scale) with lowered third, fifth, and seventh degrees, which is equivalent to the dorian 5 scale, the second mode of the harmonic major scale. Blues practice is derived from the &quot;conjunction of &#x27;African scales&#x27; and the diatonic western scales&quot;.
: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4 d es f ges a bes c2
&lt;/score&gt;
Steven Smith argues that, &quot;to assign blue notes to a &#x27;blues scale&#x27; is a momentous mistake, then, after all, unless we alter the meaning of &#x27;scale&#x27;&quot;.

===Nonatonic===
An essentially nine-note blues scale is defined by Benward and Saker as a chromatic variation of the major scale featuring a flat third and seventh degrees (in effect substitutions from Dorian mode) which, &quot;alternating with the normal third and seventh scale degrees are used to create the blues inflection. These &#x27;blue notes&#x27; represent the influence of African scales on this music.&quot;
: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 9/4
 c4 d es( e) f g a bes( b) c2
&lt;/score&gt;
A different and non-formal way of playing the scale is by the use of quarter tones, added to the 3rd and 7th degrees of the minor blues scale. For example, the A minor blues scale with quarter tones is A–B–C–D–E–F–G, where is a half sharp. Also, the note D can be used as an additional note. Guitar players can raise a given note by a quarter tone through bending.

==Usage==

In jazz, the blues scale is used by improvising musicians in a variety of harmonic contexts. It can be played for the entire duration of a twelve bar blues progression constructed off the root of the first dominant seventh chord. For example, a C hexatonic blues scale could be used to improvise a solo over a C blues chord progression. The blues scale can also be used to improvise over a minor chord. Jazz educator Jamey Aebersold describes the sound and feel of the blues scale as &quot;funky,&quot; &quot;down-home,&quot; &quot;earthy,&quot; or &quot;bluesy.&quot;

<doc id="156018" wikidata="Q367196" url="?curid=156018" title="Ettore Majorana">
<text>Ettore Majorana (, ; born 5 August 1906 and disappeared 1938) was an Italian theoretical physicist who worked on neutrino masses. Majorana was a supporter of Italian Fascism and a member of the National Fascist Party. On 25 March 1938, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances after purchasing a ticket to travel by ship from Naples to Palermo.

The Majorana equation, Majorana fermions, and the first quantum chip designed to harness Majorana particles, Majorana 1, are named after him. In 2006, the Majorana Prize was established in his memory.

==Life and work==
In 1938, Enrico Fermi was quoted as saying about Majorana: &quot;There are several categories of scientists in the world; those of second or third rank do their best but never get very far. Then there is the first rank, those who make important discoveries, fundamental to scientific progress. But then there are the geniuses, like Galilei and Newton. Majorana was one of these.&quot;

Majorana was an enthusiastic and devout Catholic.

===Political and ideological affiliations===

Majorana was a member of the National Fascist Party (PNF), having joined on 31 July 1933, and his correspondence reveals strong alignment with the fascist and Nazi ideologies of the time. For instance, a month before disappearing, he wrote to his mother:
: &quot;Today they will give me a better room, on via Depretis, from which I will be able to see, three months from now, Hitler pass by!&quot;

In another letter from Copenhagen to a member of Enrico Fermi&#x27;s group Giovannino, he expressed support for Nazi policies and applauded Hitler’s sacking of civil servants from local administrations and his replacement of them with nationalist cadre (Recami 2008: pages 147 - 157): 
: &quot;Hitler seems to know what he is doing. Probably the fascist example is of great help to him.&quot; (Gentile 1988, page 148)

Majorana recommended to his mother, who wanted to learn German, a newspaper that &quot;became fascist overnight after Hitler imposed changes in the editorial board&quot; (quote of Majorana&#x27;s letter published in Recami 2008: page 163).

Majorana endorsed antisemitic views by suggesting that discrimination against Jews was justified as a means to &quot;repress a socially harmful mentality,&quot; implying that such measures were necessary to make room for a new generation. Majorana wrote: 
: &quot;In truth, not only the Jews, but even the communists and in general all adversaries of the regime are being eliminated from social life. In sum, what the government is doing comes in response to an historical necessity: that of making room for a new generation that risks being suffocated by economic stagnation.&quot; (Recami 2008: 170) 

Historian Joseph Francese (2010) contends that Leonardo Sciascia’s narrative regarding Majorana’s disappearance is primarily a literary construct designed to stimulate debate over the ethical responsibilities of scientists rather than an accurate historical account. According to several historians, the story of Majorana’s disappearance was a later dramatization by Sciascia that obscured the fact that Majorana was actively involved in the nationalist politics of the 1930s.

===Gifted in mathematics===
Majorana was born in Catania, Sicily. Majorana&#x27;s uncle Quirino Majorana was also a physicist. Mathematically gifted, Majorana began his university studies in engineering in 1923, but switched to physics in 1928 at the urging of Emilio Segrè. He was very young when he joined Enrico Fermi&#x27;s team in Rome as one of the &quot;Via Panisperna boys&quot;, who took their name from the street address of their laboratory. 

===First published academic papers===

Majorana&#x27;s first papers dealt with problems in atomic spectroscopy. His first paper, published in 1928, was written when he was an undergraduate and it was coauthored by Giovanni Gentile, Jr., a junior professor at the Institute of Physics in Rome. This work was an early quantitative application to atomic spectroscopy of Fermi&#x27;s statistical model of atomic structure (now known as the Thomas–Fermi model, due to its contemporaneous description by Llewellyn Thomas).

In this paper, Majorana and Gentile performed first-principles calculations within the context of this model that gave a good account of experimentally-observed core electron energies of gadolinium and uranium, and of the fine structure splitting of caesium lines observed in optical spectra. In 1931, Majorana published the first paper on the phenomenon of autoionization in atomic spectra, which he called &quot;spontaneous ionization&quot;; an independent paper in the same year, published by Allen Shenstone of Princeton University, called it &quot;auto-ionization&quot;, a name first used by Pierre Auger. This name, without the hyphen, has since become the conventional term for the phenomenon.

Majorana earned his Laurea in physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza in 1929. In 1932, he published a paper in the field of atomic spectroscopy concerning the behaviour of aligned atoms in time-varying magnetic fields. This problem, also studied by I. I. Rabi and others, led to development of an important sub-branch of atomic physics, that of radio-frequency spectroscopy. In the same year, Majorana published his paper on a relativistic theory of particles with arbitrary intrinsic momentum, in which he developed and applied infinite dimensional representations of the Lorentz group, and gave a theoretical basis for the mass spectrum of elementary particles. Like most of Majorana&#x27;s papers, written in Italian, it languished in relative obscurity for several decades.

Experiments in 1932 by Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot showed the existence of an unknown particle that they suggested was a gamma ray. Majorana was the first to interpret correctly the experiment as requiring a new particle that had a neutral charge and a mass about the same as the proton; this particle is the neutron. Fermi advised him to write an article on the topic, but Majorana did not. James Chadwick proved the existence of the neutron by experiment later that year, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.

Majorana was known for not seeking credit for his discoveries, considering his work to be trivial. He wrote only nine papers in his lifetime.

===Work with Heisenberg and Bohr===
&quot;At Fermi&#x27;s urging, Majorana left Italy early in 1933 on a grant from the National Research Council. In Leipzig, Germany, he met Werner Heisenberg. In letters he subsequently wrote to Heisenberg, Majorana revealed that he had found in him, not only a scientific colleague, but a warm personal friend.&quot; 

The Nazis had come to power in Germany as Majorana arrived there. He worked on a theory of the nucleus (published in German in 1933) which, in its treatment of exchange forces, represented a further development of Heisenberg&#x27;s theory of the nucleus. Majorana also travelled to Copenhagen that year, where he worked with Niels Bohr, another Nobel Prize winner, and a friend and mentor of Heisenberg.

===Illness and isolation===

&quot;In the fall of 1933, Majorana returned to Rome in poor health, having developed acute gastritis in Germany and apparently suffering from nervous exhaustion. Put on a strict diet, he grew reclusive and became harsh in his dealings with his family. To his mother, with whom he had previously shared a warm relationship, he had written from Germany that he would not accompany her on their customary summer vacation by the sea. Appearing at the institute less frequently, he soon was scarcely leaving his home; the promising young physicist had become a hermit. For nearly four years he shut himself off from friends and stopped publishing.&quot;

===Final work===
During these years, in which he published few articles, Majorana wrote many small works on geophysics, electrical engineering, mathematics, and relativity. These unpublished papers, preserved in Domus Galileiana in Pisa, have been edited by Erasmo Recami and Salvatore Esposito.

Majorana&#x27;s last-published paper, in 1937, was an elaboration of a symmetrical theory of electrons and positrons. He predicted that in the class of particles known as fermions, there should be particles that are their own antiparticles. 
Solution of the Majorana equation yields those particles, now referred to as Majorana fermions. There has been speculation that at least some part of the &quot;missing mass&quot; in the universe, which cannot be detected except by inference from its gravitational influence, may be composed of Majorana particles.

In 1938, at the age of 32, he became a full professor of theoretical physics at the University of Naples independently of the competition rules, without needing to take an examination because of his &quot;high fame of singular expertise reached in the field of theoretical physics&quot;.

===Work on neutrino masses===
Majorana did prescient theoretical work on neutrino masses, an active subject of research .

==Disappearance==
Reportedly, Majorana had withdrawn all of his money from his bank account prior to making a trip from Naples to Palermo. He may have traveled to Palermo hoping to visit his friend Emilio Segrè, a professor at the university there, but Segrè was in California at that time. 

In Palermo, Majorana purchased a ticket on 25 March 1938 for a boat trip to return to Naples. He disappeared in unknown circumstances. Despite several investigations, his body was not found and his fate is still uncertain. 

On the day of his disappearance, Majorana sent the following note from Palermo to Antonio Carrelli, director of the Naples Physics Institute:Dear Carrelli,I made a decision that has become unavoidable. There isn&#x27;t a bit of selfishness in it, but I realize what trouble my sudden disappearance will cause you and the students. For this as well, I beg your forgiveness, but especially for betraying the trust, the sincere friendship, and the sympathy you gave me over the past months.I ask you to remember me to all those I learned to know and appreciate in your Institute, especially Sciuti: I will keep a fond memory of them all at least until 11 pm tonight, possibly later too. — E. Majorana

This was followed rapidly by a telegram from Majorana cancelling earlier travel plans. Apparently, he then bought a ticket to travel by ship from Palermo to return to Naples. He was never seen again.

===Investigations and hypotheses===
Italian writer Leonardo Sciascia has summarized some of the results of investigations and hypotheses about the disappearance; however, some of Sciascia&#x27;s conclusions were refuted by some of Majorana&#x27;s former colleagues, including E. Amaldi and E. Segrè. Recami critically examines various hypotheses about Majorana&#x27;s disappearance, including those advanced by Sciascia, and presents suggestive evidence for the proposal that Majorana travelled to Argentina.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben published a book in 2016 that examines the case of Majorana&#x27;s disappearance.

===Proposed explanations===
Several proposed explanations for his disappearance include:
;Hypothesis of suicide: proposed by his colleagues Amaldi, Segrè, and others.

;Hypothesis of emigration to Argentina: proposed by Erasmo Recami and Carlo Artemi (who has developed a detailed hypothetical reconstruction of Majorana&#x27;s possible emigration to and life in Argentina)

;Hypothesis of emigration to Venezuela: Rai 3 talk show &quot;Chi l&#x27;ha Visto?&quot; published a statement stating that Majorana was alive between 1955 and 1959, living in Valencia, Venezuela under the surname of &quot;Bini&quot;.

;Hypothesis of retirement into a monastery: proposed by Sciascia (putatively the of Serra San Bruno). Sciascia ruled out suicide on the grounds that Majorana was a devout Catholic. Majorana&#x27;s family and his priest Monsignor Francesco Riccieri also rule out suicide, favouring the option of spiritual retreat. Sciascia believes that Majorana wanted to disappear because he foresaw that nuclear forces would lead to nuclear explosives and he wanted no part of it.

;Hypothesis of kidnapping or murder: by Bella, Bartocci, and others, to avoid his participation in the construction of an atomic weapon

;Hypothesis of choosing to become a beggar: by Bascone and Venturini (called the &quot;omu cani&quot; or &quot;dog man&quot; hypothesis)

===Case reopened in 2011 and closed===
In March 2011, Italian media reported that the Rome Attorney&#x27;s Office had announced an inquiry into the statement made by a witness about meeting with Majorana in Buenos Aires in the years after World War II. On 7 June 2011 Italian media reported that the Carabinieri&#x27;s Reparto Investigazioni Scientifiche (RIS) had analyzed a photograph of a man taken in Argentina in 1955, finding ten points of similarity with Majorana&#x27;s face.

On 4 February 2015, the Rome Attorney&#x27;s Office released a statement declaring that Majorana had been alive between 1955 and 1959, living in Valencia, Venezuela. Based upon new evidence, these last findings were the foundation for the office to declare the disappearance case officially closed, having found no criminal evidence related to his disappearance, determining that it probably was a personal choice, and a presumption that he had emigrated to Venezuela.

==Commemoration of centenary==
The year 2006 marked Majorana&#x27;s centenary.

An international conference on &quot;Ettore Majorana&#x27;s legacy and the Physics of the XXI century&quot; was held in commemoration of the centennial of Majorana&#x27;s birth in Catania, 5–6 October 2006. The conference proceedings with articles of highly ranked international scientists A. Bianconi, D. Brink, N. Cabibbo, R. Casalbuoni, G. Dragoni, S. Esposito, E. Fiorini, M. Inguscio, R. W. Jackiw, L. Maiani, R. Mantegna, E. Migneco, R. Petronzio, B. Preziosi, R. Pucci, E. Recami, and Antonino Zichichi have been published by &quot;POS Proceedings of Science of SISSA&quot;, edited by Andrea Rapisarda (chairman), Paolo Castorina, Francesco Catara, Salvatore Lo Nigro, Emilio Migneco, Francesco Porto, and Emanuele Rimini.

A commemorative book of his nine collected papers, with commentary and English translations, was published by the Italian Physical Society in 2006.

Also to commemorate the centenary, the &quot;Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics&quot; (EJTP) published a special issue of twenty articles dedicated to the modern development of Majorana&#x27;s legacy. The EJTP also established a prize in his memory to mark his centenary. The Majorana Medal or Majorana Prize is an annual prize for researchers who have shown peculiar creativity, critical sense, and mathematical rigour in theoretical physics—in its broadest sense. The recipients of the 2006 Majorana Prize were (University of Bergamo and INFN) and George Sudarshan (University of Texas); of the 2007 Majorana Prize: Lee Smolin (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Canada), (Centro Interdipartimentale di Scienze Cognitive, Università di Pavia and Dipartimento di Psicologia, Università di Pavia Piazza Botta, Italy) and (Dipartimento di Fisica, Università La Sapienza, Roma, Italy).

<doc id="156024" wikidata="Q221303" url="?curid=156024" title="Anne Robert Jacques Turgot">
<text>Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l&#x27;Aulne ( ; ; 10 May 172718 March 1781), commonly known as Turgot, was a French economist and statesman. Sometimes considered a physiocrat, he is today best remembered as an early advocate for economic liberalism. He is thought to have been the first political economist to have postulated something like the law of diminishing marginal returns in agriculture.

== Education ==
Born in Paris, Turgot was the youngest son of Michel-Étienne Turgot, &quot;provost of the merchants&quot; of Paris, and Madeleine Francoise Martineau de Brétignolles, and came from an old Norman family. As one of four children, he had a younger sister and two older brothers, one of whom, Étienne-François Turgot (1721–1789), was a naturalist, and served as administrator of Malta and governor of French Guiana. Anne Robert Jacques was educated for the Church, and at the Sorbonne, to which he was admitted in 1749 (being then styled &quot;abbé de Brucourt&quot;). He delivered two remarkable Latin dissertations, &quot;On the Benefits which the Christian Religion has conferred on Mankind&quot;, and &quot;On the Historical Progress of the Human Mind&quot;. In 1750 he decided not to take holy orders, giving as his reason that &quot;he could not bear to wear a mask all his life.&quot;

The first sign of Turgot&#x27;s interest in economics is a letter (1749) on paper money, written to his fellow-student the abbé de Cicé, refuting the abbé Jean Terrasson&#x27;s defence of John Law&#x27;s system. He was fond of verse-making, and tried to introduce into French verse the rules of Latin prosody, his translation of the fourth book of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; into classical hexameter verses being greeted by Voltaire as &quot;the only &quot;prose&quot; translation in which he had found any enthusiasm.&quot;

==Idea of progress==
The first complete statement of the Idea of Progress is that of Turgot, in his &quot;A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind&quot; (1750). For Turgot progress covers not simply the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture – manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society.

==Early appointments==
In 1752, he became &quot;substitut&quot;, and later &quot;conseiller&quot; in the parlement of Paris, and in 1753 &quot;maître des requêtes&quot;. In 1754 he was a member of the &quot;chambre royale&quot; which sat during an exile of the &quot;parlement&quot;. In Paris he frequented the salons, especially those of Mme de Graffigny – whose niece, Mlle de Ligniville (&quot;Minette&quot;), later Mme Helvétius, he is supposed at one time to have wished to marry; they remained lifelong friends – Mme Geoffrin, Mme du Deffand, Mlle de Lespinasse and the Duchesse d&#x27;Enville. It was during this period that he met the leaders of the &quot;physiocratic&quot; school, Quesnay and Vincent de Gournay, and with them Dupont de Nemours, the abbé Morellet and other economists.

In 1743 and 1756, he accompanied Gournay, the intendant of commerce, during Gournay&#x27;s tours of inspection in the provinces. (Gournay&#x27;s bye-word on the government&#x27;s proper involvement in the economy – &quot;laisser faire, laisser passer&quot; – would pass into the vocabulary of economics.) In 1760, while travelling in the east of France and Switzerland, he visited Voltaire, who became one of his chief friends and supporters. All this time he was studying various branches of science, and languages both ancient and modern. In 1753 he translated the &quot;Questions sur le commerce&quot; from the English of Josias Tucker, and in 1754 he wrote his &quot;Lettre sur la tolérance civile&quot;, and a pamphlet, &quot;Le Conciliateur&quot;, in support of religious tolerance. Between 1755 and 1756 he composed various articles for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, and between 1757 and 1760 an article on &quot;Valeurs des monnaies&quot;, probably for the &quot;Dictionnaire du commerce&quot; of the abbé Morellet. In 1759 appeared his work &quot;Eloge de Gournay&quot;.

==Intendant of Limoges, 1761–1774==

In August 1761, Turgot was appointed &quot;intendant&quot; (tax collector) of the &quot;genéralité&quot; of Limoges, which included some of the poorest and most over-taxed parts of France; here he remained for thirteen years. He was already deeply imbued with the theories of Quesnay and Gournay, and set to work to apply them as far as possible in his province. His first plan was to continue the work, already initiated by his predecessor Tourny, of making a fresh survey of the land (cadastre), in order to arrive at a more just assessment of the &quot;taille&quot;; he also obtained a large reduction in the contribution of the province. He published his &quot;Avis sur l&#x27;assiette et la repartition de la taille&quot; (1762–1770), and as president of the &quot;Société d&#x27;agriculture de Limoges&quot; offered prizes for essays on the principles of taxation. Quesnay and Mirabeau had advocated a proportional tax (&quot;impôt de quotité&quot;), but Turgot proposed a distributive tax (&quot;impôt de repartition&quot;). Another reform was the substitution for the &quot;corvée&quot; of a tax in money levied on the whole province, the construction of roads being handed over to contractors, by which means Turgot was able to leave his province with a good system of highways, while distributing more justly the expense of their construction.

In 1769, he wrote his &quot;Mémoire sur les prêts à intérêt&quot;, on the occasion of a scandalous financial crisis at Angoulême, the particular interest of which is that in it the question of lending money at interest was for the first time treated scientifically, and not merely from the ecclesiastical point of view. Turgot&#x27;s opinion was that a compromise had to be reached between both methods. Among other works written during Turgot&#x27;s intendancy were the &quot;Mémoire sur les mines et carrières&quot;, and the &quot;Mémoire sur la marque des fers&quot;, in which he protested against state regulation and interference and advocated free competition. At the same time he did much to encourage agriculture and local industries, among others establishing the manufacture of porcelain at Limoges. During the famine of 1770–1771 he enforced on landowners &quot;the obligation of relieving the poor&quot; and especially the &quot;métayers&quot; (sharecroppers) dependent upon them, and organized in every province &quot;ateliers&quot; and &quot;bureaux de charité&quot; for providing work for the able-bodied and relief for the infirm, while at the same time he condemned indiscriminate charity. Turgot always made the curés the agents of his charities and reforms when possible. It was in 1770 that he wrote his famous &quot;Lettres sur la liberté du commerce des grains&quot;, addressed to the controller-general, the abbé Terray. Three of these letters have disappeared, having been sent to Louis XVI by Turgot at a later date and never recovered, but those remaining argue that free trade in grain is in the interest of landowner, farmer and consumer alike, and in forcible terms demand the removal of all restrictions.

==&quot;Réflexions&quot;==
 Turgot&#x27;s best known work, &quot;Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth&quot;, was written early in the period of his intendancy, ostensibly for the benefit of two young Chinese scholars who had studied in Paris, Louis Ko (Gao Leisi, 1732–1790) and Étienne Yang (Yang Dewang, 1733–98), on the occasion of their return to China. Written in 1766, it appeared in 1769–1770 in Dupont&#x27;s journal, the &quot;Ephémérides du citoyen&quot;, and was published separately in 1776. Dupont, however, made various alterations in the text, in order to bring it more into accordance with Quesnay&#x27;s doctrines, which led to a coolness between him and Turgot.

In the &quot;Réflexions&quot;, after tracing the origin of commerce, Turgot develops Quesnay&#x27;s theory that land is the only source of wealth, and divides society into three classes, the productive or agricultural, the salaried (the &quot;classe stipendiée&quot;) or artisan class, and the land-owning class (&quot;classe disponible&quot;). He also proposes a notable theory of the interest rate. After discussing the evolution of the different systems of cultivation, the nature of exchange and barter, money, and the functions of capital, he sets forth the theory of the &quot;impôt unique&quot;, i.e. that only the net product (&quot;produit net&quot;) of the land should be taxed. In addition he demanded the complete freedom of commerce and industry.

==As minister, 1774–1776==

===Appointment===
Turgot was summoned to the ministry of Louis XVI two months after his accession, and was appointed a month later as Controller-General of Finance. The king even defended the middle-class economist against the reaction of the aristocracy. Turgot owed his appointment as minister of the navy in July 1774 to Maurepas, the &quot;Mentor&quot; of Louis XVI, to whom he was warmly recommended by the abbé Very, a mutual friend. His appointment met with general approval, and was hailed with enthusiasm by the &quot;philosophes&quot;. A month later (24 August) he was appointed Controller-General of Finances.

===On government spending===

His first act was to submit to the king a statement of his guiding principles: &quot;No bankruptcy, no increase of taxation, no borrowing.&quot; Turgot&#x27;s policy, in face of the desperate financial position, was to enforce the most rigid economy in all departments. All departmental expenses were to be submitted for the approval of the controller-general, a number of sinecures were suppressed, the holders of them being compensated, and the abuse of the &quot;acquits au comptant&quot; was attacked, while Turgot appealed personally to the king against the lavish giving of places and pensions. He also contemplated a thorough-going reform of the &quot;Ferme Générale&quot;, but contented himself, as a beginning, with imposing certain conditions on the leases as they were renewed – such as a more efficient personnel, and the abolition for the future of the abuse of the &quot;croupes&quot; (the name given to a class of pensions), a reform which Terray had shirked on finding how many persons in high places were interested in them, and annulling certain leases, such as those of the manufacture of gunpowder and the administration of the royal mails, the former of which was handed over to a company with the scientist Lavoisier as one of its advisers, and the latter superseded by a quicker and more comfortable service of &quot;diligences&quot; which were nicknamed &quot;turgotines&quot;.

Turgot also prepared a regular budget. His measures succeeded in considerably reducing the deficit, and raised the national credit to such an extent that in 1776, just before his fall, he was able to negotiate a loan with some Dutch bankers at 4%; but the deficit was still so large as to prevent him from attempting at once to realize his favourite scheme of substituting for indirect taxation a single tax on land. Turgot suppressed, however, a number of &quot;octrois&quot; and minor duties, and opposed, on grounds of economy, the involvement of France in the American Revolutionary War, though without success.

===On free trade===

Turgot at once set to work to establish free trade in grain, but his edict, which was signed on 13 September 1774, met with strong opposition even in the &quot;conseil du roi&quot;. A striking feature was the preamble, setting forth the doctrines on which the edict was based, which won the praise of the &quot;philosophes&quot; and the ridicule of the wits; this Turgot rewrote three times, it is said, in order to make it &quot;so clear that any village judge could explain it to the peasants.&quot; The opposition to the edict was strong. Turgot was hated by those who had been interested in the speculations in grain under the regime of the abbé Terray, among whom were included some of the princes of the blood. Moreover, the &quot;commerce des blés&quot; had been a favourite topic of the salons for some years past, and the witty Galiani, the opponent of the physiocrats, had a large following. The opposition was now continued by Linguet and by Necker, who in 1775 published his &quot;Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains&quot;.

===Suppression of Dijon bread riots===

Turgot&#x27;s biggest challenge was the poor harvest of 1774, which led to a noticeable rise in the price of bread in the winter and early spring of 1774–1775. In April and early May, when peasants begged the governor of Dijon for bread, he uttered those famous words that would later be recalled during the French Revolution: &quot;The grass has sprouted, go to the fields and browse on it.&quot; Houses of the wealthy were seized and occupied, flour-mills were destroyed, and furniture was smashed. Those extraordinary bread-riots are known as the &quot;guerre des farines&quot;, which ominously predicted the coming French Revolution. Turgot showed great firmness and decision in repressing the riots, but also some caution in using soldiers, as he had said that &quot;every levy of soldiers led to a riot.&quot; In this, he even had conflict with the royalty, as Louis XVI wanted to go out onto the balcony and meet the crowds, to say that there would be a reduction in the price of bread, but Turgot admonished him against this, and the bread remained at high prices. His position was strengthened by the entry of Malesherbes into the ministry (July 1775).

===On feudal obligations and protections===

All this time Turgot had been preparing his famous &quot;Six Edicts&quot;, which were finally presented to the &quot;conseil du roi&quot; (January 1776). Peter Kropotkin described these edicts as &quot;very modest proposals&quot; and summarized these as &quot;abolition of statute labor, abolition of trade-wardens and a timid attempt to make the two privileged classes – the nobility and clergy – pay some of the taxes.&quot; Of the six edicts four were of minor importance, but the two which met with violent opposition were, firstly, the edict suppressing the &quot;corvées&quot;, and secondly, that suppressing the &quot;jurandes&quot; and &quot;maîtrises&quot;, by which the craft guilds maintained their privileges. In the preamble to the former Turgot boldly announced as his object the abolition of privilege, and the subjection of all three Estates of the realm to taxation; the clergy were afterwards excepted, at the request of Maurepas.

In the preamble to the edict on the jurandes Turgot laid down as a principle the right of every man to work without restriction. He obtained the registration of the edicts by the &quot;lit de justice&quot; of 12 March, but by that time he had nearly everybody against him. His attacks on privilege had won him the hatred of the nobles and the &quot;parlements&quot;; his attempted reforms in the royal household, that of the court; his free trade legislation, that of the &quot;financiers&quot;; his views on tolerance and his agitation for the suppression of the phrase that was offensive to Protestants in the king&#x27;s coronation oath, that of the clergy; and his edict on the &quot;jurandes&quot;, that of the rich bourgeoisie of Paris and others, such as the prince de Conti, whose interests were involved. The queen disliked him for opposing the grant of favours to her protégés, and he had offended Mme. de Polignac in a similar manner. The queen played a key role in his disgrace later.

===Proposals for a representative government===

With the physiocrats, he believed in an enlightened political absolutism, and looked to the king to carry through all reforms. As to the parlements, he opposed all interference on their part in legislation, considering that they had no competency outside the sphere of justice. He recognized the danger of the recap of the old parlement, but was unable effectively to oppose it since he had been associated with the dismissal of Maupeou and Terray, and seems to have underestimated its power. He was opposed to the summoning of the states-general advocated by Malesherbes (6 May 1775), possibly on the ground that the two privileged orders would have too much power in them. His own plan is to be found in his &quot;Mémoire sur les municipalités&quot;, which was submitted informally to the king.

In Turgot&#x27;s proposed system, landed proprietors alone were to form the electorate, no distinction being made among the three orders; the members of the town and country municipalités were to elect representatives for the district municipalités, which in turn would elect to the provincial municipalités, and the latter to a grande municipalité, which should have no legislative powers, but should concern itself entirely with the administration of taxation. With this was to be combined a whole system of education, relief of the poor, and other activities. Louis XVI recoiled from this as being too great a leap in the dark, and such a fundamental difference of opinion between king and minister was bound to lead to a breach sooner or later. Turgot&#x27;s only choice, however, was between &quot;tinkering&quot; at the existing system in detail and a complete revolution, and his attack on privilege, which might have been carried through by a popular minister and a strong king, was bound to form part of any effective scheme of reform.

===American Revolution===

As minister of the navy from 1774 to 1776, Turgot opposed financial support for the American Revolution. He believed in the virtue and inevitable success of the revolution but warned that France could neither financially nor socially afford to overtly aid it. French intellectuals saw America as the hope of mankind and magnified American virtues to demonstrate the validity of their ideals along with seeing a chance to avenge their defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Turgot, however, emphasized what he believed were American inadequacies. He complained that the new American state constitutions failed to adopt the physiocratic principle of distinguishing for purposes of taxation between those who owned land and those who did not, the principle of direct taxation of property holders had not been followed, and a complicated legal and administrative structure had been created to regulate commerce. On the social level, Turgot and his progressive contemporaries suffered further disappointment: a religious oath was required of elected officials and slavery was not abolished. Turgot died in 1781 before the conclusion of the war. Although disappointed, Turgot never doubted revolutionary victory.

===Place in the Ministry===

All might yet have gone well if Turgot could have retained the confidence of the king, but the king could not fail to see that Turgot had not the support of the other ministers. Even his friend Malesherbes thought he was too rash, and was, moreover, himself discouraged and wished to resign. The alienation of Maurepas was also increasing. Whether through jealousy of the which Turgot had acquired over the king, or through the natural incompatibility of their characters, he was already inclined to take sides against Turgot, and the reconciliation between him and the queen, which took place about this time, meant that he was henceforth the tool of the Polignac clique and the Choiseul party. About this time, too, appeared a pamphlet, &quot;Le Songe de M. Maurepas&quot;, generally ascribed to the comte de Provence (Louis XVIII), containing a bitter caricature of Turgot.

==Fall==
The immediate cause of Turgot&#x27;s fall is uncertain. Some speak of a plot, of forged letters containing attacks on the queen shown to the king as Turgot&#x27;s, of a series of notes on Turgot&#x27;s budget prepared, it is said, by Necker, and shown to the king to prove his incapacity. Others attribute it to the queen, and there is no doubt that she hated Turgot for supporting Vergennes in demanding the recall of the comte de Guînes, the ambassador in London, whose cause she had ardently espoused at the prompting of the Choiseul clique. Others attribute it to an intrigue of Maurepas. On the resignation of Malesherbes (April 1776), whom Turgot wished to replace by the abbé Very, Maurepas proposed to the king as his successor a named Amelot.

Turgot, on hearing of this, wrote an indignant letter to the king, in which he reproached him for refusing to see him, pointed out in strong terms the dangers of a weak ministry and a weak king, and complained bitterly of Maurepas&#x27;s irresolution and subjection to court intrigues; this letter the king, though asked to treat it as confidential, is said to have shown to Maurepas, whose dislike for Turgot it still further embittered. With all these enemies, Turgot&#x27;s fall was certain, but he wished to stay in office long enough to finish his project for the reform of the royal household before resigning. To his dismay, he was not allowed to do that. On 12 May 1776 he was ordered to send in his resignation. He at once retired to La Roche-Guyon, the château of the Duchesse d&#x27;Enville, returning shortly to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life in scientific and literary studies, being made vice-president of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1777.

==Commentary on Turgot==
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition:
Andrew Dickson White wrote in &quot;Seven Great Statesmen in the Warfare of Humanity with Unreason&quot; (1915):
TURGOT...I present today one of the three greatest statesmen who fought unreason in France between the close of the Middle Ages and the outbreak of the French Revolution – Louis XI and Richelieu being the two other. And not only this: were you to count the greatest men of the modern world upon your fingers, he would be of the number – a great thinker, writer, administrator, philanthropist, statesman, and above all, a great character and a great man. And yet, judged by ordinary standards, a failure. For he was thrown out of his culminating position, as Comptroller-General of France, after serving but twenty months, and then lived only long enough to see every leading measure to which he had devoted his life deliberately and malignantly undone; the flagrant abuses which he had abolished restored, apparently forever; the highways to national prosperity, peace, and influence, which he had opened, destroyed; and his country put under full headway toward the greatest catastrophe the modern world has seen.

He now, in 1749, at the age of twenty two, wrote... a letter which has been an object of wonder among political thinkers ever since. Its subject was paper money. Discussing the ideas of John Law, and especially the essay of Terrasson which had supported them, he dissected them mercilessly, but in a way useful not only in those times but in these. ...As regards currency inflation ... It still remains one of the best presentations of this subject ever made; and what adds to our wonder is that it was not the result of a study of authorities, but was worked out wholly from his own observation and thought. Up to this time there were no authorities and no received doctrine on the subject; there were simply records of financial practice more or less vicious; it was reserved for this young student, in a letter not intended for publication, to lay down for the first time the great law in which the modern world, after all its puzzling and costly experiences, has found safety.

<text>Thorgaut or Turgot (c. 1050–1115) (sometimes, Thurgot) was Archdeacon and Prior of Durham, and Bishop of Saint Andrews.

==Biography==

===Early life and prior at Durham===
Turgot came from the Lindsey in Lincolnshire. After the Norman Conquest he was held as a hostage, but escaped to Norway, where he taught psalmody to King Olaf III. In about 1074 he returned to England and became a clerk at Jarrow monastery. He then became a monk at Wearmouth, and in 1087 he was appointed prior of the monastery at Durham, from 1093 combining this with the archdeaconry of Durham. He became close to the Scottish court and became in 1089 a close friend and spiritual adviser to Saint Margaret of Scotland, wife of King Malcom III and a profoundly religious person. After her death and between the years 1100 and 1107, Turgot wrote a vita of her life at the request of her daughter, Matilda, wife of King Henry I of England.
In 1093, he and Bishop William de St-Calais laid the foundation stone for what would later become Durham Cathedral.

===Bishop of St Andrews and death===
In 1107, the Prior was elected as bishop to the see of St Andrews which had been without a bishop since 1093. Consecration was delayed by ecclesiastical disputes between York and St Andrews, and did not take place until 1 August 1109. According to Symeon of Durham, he found that he could not exercise the office &quot;worthily&quot; as there was only a primitive reliquary church, no Benedictine monks to support him and conflicts between various factions he had to deal with, including the Scottish King Alexander, the Archbishop of York and the culdees, a local Scottish monastic community. Alexander asked Pope Paschal II to advice Turgot on these matters and the pope sent Turgot two letters as well as a book of excerpts of canon law to support him. Turgot, perhaps in response to these letters, proposed to go to Rome to speak directly with Pope Paschal II but Alexander prevented him from doing so.

Tugot became ill in June 1115 and was allowed to return to Durham where he had begun his clerical life, where he died on 31 August 1115. Turgot&#x27;s last words were from Psalm 76 &quot;His dwelling is in peace and his habitation in Sion&quot; and he was buried in the chapter house of Durham next to the graves of other bishops. His mortuary roll, which may have been prepared by Symeon of Durham himself, circulated as far as the French counties of Anjou, Blois, Touraine and Vermandois.

<text>The Battle of Poltava took place 8 July 1709, was the decisive and largest battle of the Great Northern War. The Russian army under the command of Tsar Peter I defeated the Swedish army under the command of Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld. The battle would lead to the Swedish Empire losing its status as a European great power and also marked the beginning of Russian supremacy in eastern Europe. 

During the course of six years in the initial stages of the war, King Charles XII and the Swedish Empire had defeated almost all participants in the anti-Swedish coalition, which initially consisted of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Denmark-Norway and the Tsardom of Russia. The latter, under , was the only one still fighting. Charles therefore chose to invade Russia in the autumn of 1707 and march towards Moscow with a large Swedish army. However, the campaign was complicated by harsh weather conditions and by Russian scorched earth tactics and surprise attacks, which forced Charles to interrupt his march on Moscow and instead march south to establish winter quarters with the help of Ivan Mazepa, hetman of the Cossack Hetmanate Zaporizhian Host.

After the extremely harsh Great Frost of 1708–1709, the weakened Swedish army resumed operations in the spring of 1709 and besieged the fortress of Poltava, an important trading center and military depot on the Vorskla. Meanwhile, a numerically superior Russian army of 75,000–80,000 men commanded by Peter, advanced to Poltava to relieve the siege. The two armies clashed, and the Swedes were defeated and fled the battlefield. Charles and Mazepa retreated with 1,500 men south to the river Dnieper, which they crossed, thus managing to escape the Russians and established themselves in the Ottoman Empire. The rest of the army was forced to surrender to the Russians at the village of Perevolochna on 11 July 1709.

The Battle of Poltava, as well as the subsequent capitulation, ended in a decisive victory for Peter I and became the greatest military catastrophe in Swedish history. It marked a turning point in the continuation of the war in favour of the anti-Swedish coalition, which as a result of the battle was revived and with renewed vigor attacked the weakened Swedish Empire on several fronts. Poltava thus marked the end of Sweden&#x27;s time as the dominant power in the Baltic region, a position which after the war was taken over by the Russian Empire. The battle is therefore of crucial importance in the history of Sweden as well as Russia and Ukraine.

== Background ==
Charles XII had led Swedish forces to early victories in North Zealand (Summer 1700) and in the Battle of Narva in November 1700. However, it took six years for him to defeat Augustus II of Saxony-Poland. withdrew from Poland in the spring of 1706, and offered to return the Baltic provinces of Sweden that Russia had occupied since 1703 - except for Ingria, where Peter had already started to build his intended new capital of St. Petersburg - but Charles refused. Peter subsequently adopted a scorched-earth policy in order to deprive the Swedish forces of supplies.

Charles ordered a final attack on the Russian heartland with a possible assault on Moscow from his campaign base in Poland. The Swedish army of almost 44,000 men left Saxony on 22 August 1707 and marched slowly eastwards. Charles took the field in November after waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Continuing east, he crossed the Vistula River on 25 December 1707, then continued through hostile Masuria and took Grodno on 26 January 1708 after Russian troops had abandoned the city. At the time the Russians were occupied with a large rebellion of Don Cossacks, known as the Bulavin Rebellion (1707–1708). This revolt was contained in part by the forces of the Cossack Hetmanate led by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The Swedes continued to the area around Smorgon and Minsk, where the army went into winter quarters. Charles left 8,000 dragoons under Major General Ernst Detlof von Krassow in western Poland.

Poor weather and road conditions kept the Swedish troops in winter quarters until June 1708. In July the Swedes defeated Marshal Boris Sheremetyev&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Holowczyn and advanced to the Dnieper River. During the spring General Lewenhaupt in Courland had been ordered to gather supplies and march his army of about 12,000 men to join Charles&#x27; forces. However, his departure from Mitau was delayed until late June and consequently he only joined Charles&#x27; forces on 11 October.

Rather than winter in Livonia or wait for Lewenhaupt, Charles decided to move southwards into Ukraine and join Mazepa, who had decided to rebel against Peter. Peter sent Boris Sheremetev to shadow the Swedish army. Lewenhaupt followed south and was attacked while crossing a river near a small village that gave its name to the Battle of Lesnaya, losing the supply train and half of his force. In need of resupply, Charles moved towards Baturyn, Mazepa&#x27;s headquarters, but Russian troops under Aleksandr Menshikov reached the city first. Anticipating the Swedish arrival, Menshikov ordered the merciless massacre of the population, razing the city and destroying or looting arms, ammunition and food.

== Prelude ==
By the spring of 1709, Charles&#x27; force had shrunk to half of its original size. After the coldest winter in Europe in over 500 years, Charles was left with 20,000 soldiers and 34 cannons. Short of supplies, he laid siege to the Russian fortress at Poltava on the Vorskla River on 2 May 1709. Peter&#x27;s force of 80,000 marched to relieve the siege. Upon his arrival, Peter built a fortified camp on the Vorskla, 4 km north of Poltava. While observing the Russian position on 20 June, Charles was struck in the foot by a stray bullet that wounded him so severely that he could not stand. In addition, Charles&#x27; last hope of reinforcement expired, as the Swedish forces under von Krassow had turned aside to deal with the anti-Swedish Sandomierz Confederation in Poland.

Between the Russian and Swedish forces the Yakovetski and Budyschenski woods formed a corridor, which the Russians defended by building six forts across the gap. Peter, in addition, ordered four more redoubts built so the entire system of ten forts would have a &quot;T&quot; shape, providing flanking fire to a Swedish advance. Two of the redoubts were still being constructed on the morning of the battle, but 4,000 Russians manned the remaining eight, with 10,000 cavalry under General Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov stationed behind them.

== Battle ==
===Swedish attack===

Because of his wound, Charles turned over operational command to Field Marshal Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld. Four columns of infantry and six columns of cavalry were to form during the night, 600 meters south of the redoubts, intending to attack before dawn in order to swiftly bypass the redoubt system and hit the Russian fort. The infantry was in place by 2:30 a.m. but the cavalry arrived late, having lost their way. Riding forward, Axel Gyllenkrok observed the Russians at work on the two nearest redoubts and rode back to inform Rehnskiöld. A reconnoitre by Major General Wolmar Anton von Schlippenbach was discovered by the Russians and the alarm was sounded by the firing of a pistol. Having lost the element of surprise, and without sufficient cannon to breach the fortifications, Rehnskiöld consulted with Charles, Carl Piper and Lewenhaupt on whether or not to proceed with the assault. By the time Rehnskiöld decided to proceed with the attack by quoting, &quot;In the name of God then, let us go forward&quot;, it was nearly 4:00 a.m. on 28 June (Swedish calendar) and dawn was already approaching. The Swedes in Carl Gustaf Roos&#x27; column quickly overran the first two redoubts, killing every Russian soldier inside them, but by 4:30 a.m. the attempts to take the third redoubt stalled.

Lewenhaupt&#x27;s ten battalions on the right bypassed the first four redoubts entirely, advancing to the back line and, with the aid of cavalry, took some redoubts while bypassing others. Two of Roos&#x27; rear battalions joined them, indicating that issued orders lacked clarity as to whether to avoid the redoubts or attack them in series. The cavalry on the left wing, commanded by Major General Hamilton and an infantry regiment, advanced by passing the redoubts on the left and charged the Russian cavalry, forcing them to retreat. It was 5:00 a.m. when the left and right wings of the Swedish army made it past the back line of redoubts, sending the Russian cavalry in retreat. However, Rehnskiöld ordered his cavalry to stop their pursuit and Lewenhaupt, already advancing towards the fort, to withdraw to the west. There they awaited Roos&#x27; battalions for two hours, while the Russian cavalry and Ivan Skoropadsky&#x27;s Cossacks waited to the north, with 13 Russian battalions deployed north of their camp and ten to the south, anticipating a Swedish advance.

===Russian advance===

General Roos and six battalions (one-third of the Swedish infantry) became isolated while attempting to take the third Russian redoubt. After suffering severe casualties from several assault attempts, Roos led the remaining 1,500 of his original 2,600 men into the Yakovetski woods to the east at 6:00 a.m. The Russians reoccupied the first two redoubts and launched a two-pronged attack by ten regiments around 7:00 a.m., forcing Roos to retreat towards Poltava and take refuge in an abandoned fort by 9:00 a.m. when he could not make it to the Swedish siege works. Roos was forced to surrender at 9:30 a.m. 

The Swedes continued to wait for Roos&#x27; troops to return, unaware of their surrender. Peter led the 42 battalions of Russian infantry—22,000 soldiers—into an advance out of the fortified camp, supported by 55 three-pounder cannons and 32 guns on the ramparts of the fort. Ten regiments of dragoons formed under Lieutenant General Adolf Fredrik Bauer on the Russian right and six regiments under Menshikov on the left. Just west of the camp the Russians were faced by 4,000 Swedish infantry, formed into ten battalions with four three-pounders, and the cavalry under Major General Carl Gustaf Creutz in the rear. The Russians slowly moved forward to engage. According to Charles and reports from other Swedish officers, the weather at that time was already very hot and humid, with the sun obscured by smoke from the Russian cannons in the fort.

===Turning point===

At 09:45, Rehnskiöld ordered Lewenhaupt and the Swedish line to move forward, advancing towards the Russian line, which started firing its cannons at 500 meters. When the Swedes were 50 meters from the Russian line, the Russians opened fire with their muskets from all four ranks. Advancing to within 30 meters of the Russian line, the Swedes fired a volley of their own and charged with their muskets and pikemen, and the Russian first line retreated towards their second line. The Swedes seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough and needed the cavalry under Creutz to break the Russian lines. Unfortunately for the Swedes, Creutz&#x27;s and the other cavalry units were unable to reform completely in time. With the Russian line longer than the Swedish line, the Swedish infantry on the left flank lagged behind the right and finally threw down their weapons and fled. As the Swedish right flank was still advancing, a gap began to open in the Swedish line which the Russians filled and the battle turned into a Cannae variation. Barely able to gather his cavalry squadrons, Creutz tried to advance on the right flank, but the Russian battalions were able to form into hollow squares, while Menshikov&#x27;s cavalry outflanked the Swedes and attacked them from the rear. At this point the Swedish assault had disintegrated and no longer had organized bodies of troops to oppose the Russian infantry or cavalry. Small groups of soldiers managed to break through and escape to the south through the Budyschenski woods, while many of the rest were overwhelmed, ridden down or captured.

===Swedish retreat===

Realizing they were the last Swedes on the battlefield, Charles ordered a retreat to the woods, gathering what remaining forces he could for protection, including the remnants of Creutz&#x27;s detachment. The Russians halted at the edge of the woods and their artillery fire stopped; only the Cossacks and Kalmyks roamed the plains south of the woods. Emerging from the woods at around noon, Charles—on horseback after his litter was destroyed, and protected by a square of a couple of thousand men—headed to Pushkaryovka and his baggage train 5 km to the south, reaching it after 1:00 p.m., by which time the battle was over.

Charles gathered the remainder of his troops and baggage train and retreated to the south later that same day—at about 7:00 p.m., abandoning the siege of Poltava. Lewenhaupt led the surviving Swedes and some of the Cossack forces to the Dnieper River, but was doggedly pursued by the Russian regular cavalry and 3,000 Kalmyk auxiliaries and forced to surrender three days later at Perevolochna on 11 July.

== Aftermath ==
High-ranking Swedes captured during the battle included Field Marshal Rehnskiöld, Major Generals Schlippenbach, Stackelberg, Hamilton and Prince Maximilian Emanuel, as well as Piper. Peter the Great held a celebratory banquet in two large tents erected on the battlefield. Voltaire assumed Peter&#x27;s reason for this, in raising a toast to the Swedish generals as war masters, was to send a message to his own generals about disloyalty. Two mass graves contained the Russian dead, 500 meters southwest of their camp. Previously when defeating Peter, Charles had gone so far as to pay the Russian troops. Peter instead took many Swedes, with great pride, and sent them to Siberia.

Charles and Mazepa escaped with about 1,500 men to Bendery, Moldavia, then controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Charles spent five years in exile there before he was able to return to Sweden in December 1715. During this time, even handicapped, he retained his magisterial calm demeanor under fire, fighting his way out of several situations. The high vizier of the Turks was eventually paid off, with much intrigue and espionage involved and plots within plots, at one point involving a ransom of the Russian crown jewels, according to Charles&#x27; prison translator.

Since 3 September 2009, the battlefield has been listed by Ukraine as a monument of national historical significance.

<text>M*A*S*H (an acronym for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) is an American war comedy drama television series that aired on CBS from September 17, 1972 to February 28, 1983. It was developed by Larry Gelbart as the first original spin-off series adapted from the 1970 film of the same name, which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;&quot;. The series, produced by 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the &quot;4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital&quot; in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War (1950–53).

The ensemble cast originally featured Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers as surgeons Benjamin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce and &quot;Trapper&quot; John McIntyre, respectively, as the protagonists of the show; joined by Larry Linville as surgeon Frank Burns, Loretta Swit as head nurse Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan, McLean Stevenson as company commander Henry Blake, Gary Burghoff as company clerk Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly, Jamie Farr as orderly Maxwell Klinger, and William Christopher as the chaplain, Father John Mulcahy. Over the run of the show, several members of the main cast were replaced: Wayne Rogers was replaced by Mike Farrell as B. J. Hunnicutt, McLean Stevenson was replaced by Harry Morgan as Sherman Potter, Larry Linville was replaced by David Ogden Stiers as Charles Emerson Winchester III, and, when Gary Burghoff left the show, the Maxwell Klinger character moved into the company clerk role. Longtime supporting cast members included Kellye Nakahara, Jeff Maxwell, Johnny Haymer, Allan Arbus, Edward Winter and G. W. Bailey.

The series varied in style and tone – including broad comedy and tragic drama – which can be attributed to fluctuating writing staff over the life of the show and the variety of sources contributing to the stories, such as actor Alan Alda and surgeons who served in the Korean War. The show&#x27;s title sequence features an instrumental version of &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot;, the original film&#x27;s theme song.

The show was created after an attempt to film the original book&#x27;s sequel, &quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot;, failed. The television series is the best-known of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; works and one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history and is regarded by many as one of the greatest television shows of all time. Its final episode, &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, was the most-watched television broadcast in the US from 1983–2010, and it remains both the most-watched finale of any television series and the most-watched episode of a scripted series.

== Premise ==
&quot;M*A*S*H&quot; aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour in length. The series is usually categorized as a situation comedy, though it has also been described as a &quot;dark comedy&quot; or a &quot;dramedy&quot; because of the often dramatic subject matter.

The show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a United States Army &quot;Mobile Army Surgical Hospital&quot; (MASH) in the Korean War (1950–53). The &quot;4077th MASH&quot; was one of several surgical units in Korea. The asterisks in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie.

Early seasons aired on network prime time while the Vietnam War was still ongoing; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. The show&#x27;s discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America&#x27;s role in the Cold War.

Episodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show&#x27;s characters as the contents of a letter home. The show&#x27;s tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the unwilling civilian draftees of 4077th – Captains Pierce, MacIntyre, and Hunnicutt, for example – and the &quot;regular Army&quot; characters, such as Major Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who enlisted voluntarily. Other characters, such as Lieutenant Colonel Blake, Major Winchester, and Corporal/Sergeant Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward Army life, while guest characters played by actors such as Eldon Quick, Herb Voland, Mary Wickes, and Tim O&#x27;Connor also help further the show&#x27;s discussion of America&#x27;s place as Cold War participant and peace maker.

==Characters==

===Main cast===

Through changes of personnel &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; maintained a relatively constant ensemble cast, with four characters – Hawkeye, Father Mulcahy, Margaret Houlihan, and Maxwell Klinger – on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names difficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on the seventh season were named after the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers.


====Main character timeline====
For the first three seasons, the show&#x27;s ensemble cast included Alan Alda as surgeon Captain Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce, Wayne Rogers as surgeon Captain Trapper John McIntyre, McLean Stevenson as company commander Lt. Colonel Henry Blake, Loretta Swit as head nurse Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan, Larry Linville as surgeon Major Frank Burns, Gary Burghoff as company clerk Corporal Walter Eugene &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly, Jamie Farr as combat medic Corporal Maxwell Klinger, and William Christopher as chaplain 1st Lieutenant Father John Patrick Francis Mulcahy. 

At the end of the third season, Rogers and Stevenson left the show, with their characters written out, and they were replaced by Mike Farrell as surgeon Captain B. J. Hunnicutt and Harry Morgan as surgeon Colonel Sherman T. Potter as the new commanding officer. 

After season five, Linville left to be replaced by David Ogden Stiers as surgeon Major Charles Emerson Winchester III. 

Early in season eight, Burghoff left the show; Klinger (Farr) was moved to company clerk to replace Radar, while G. W. Bailey joined the cast to play Staff Sergeant Luther Rizzo, the unit&#x27;s motor pool sergeant. Other long-serving actors on the show include Kellye Nakahara as Nurse Kellye, Jeff Maxwell as Private Igor Straminsky, Johnny Haymer as Sergeant Zelmo Zale, the supply sergeant, Allan Arbus as psychiatrist Major Sidney Freedman, and Edward Winter as intelligence officer Colonel Sam Flagg.
==Production==

===Writing===
As the series progressed, it made a significant shift from being primarily a comedy with dramatic undertones to a drama with comedic overtones. This was a result of changes in writing, production, and acting staff. Series co-creator and comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after Season 4. Executive Producer Gene Reynolds departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; being almost fully stripped of its original comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6.

Whereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; for the show&#x27;s first five seasons (1972–1977), Alan Alda and newly promoted Executive Producer Burt Metcalfe became the new dramatic voice of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; for Seasons 6–11. By the start of Season 8 (1979–1980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled.

Cast changes also contributed to the greater weighting of drama in later series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The departures of McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, and Gary Burghoff removed gifted performers of physical and verbal comedy. Wayne Rogers&#x27;s Trapper John had been Hawkeye&#x27;s partner in high jinks and womanizing, while his successor in Mike Farrell&#x27;s B.J. gave Hawkeye a more mature best friendship. A gentler characterization made Margaret a less pointed comedy foil, and after Klinger took over Radar&#x27;s responsibilities he discontinued cross-dressing and other attempts to get a Section 8 psychiatric discharge.

The end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character-driven. Several episodes experimented by going outside the sitcom format:
* &quot;Point of View&quot; – shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound
* &quot;Dreams&quot; – an idea of Alda&#x27;s, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams
* &quot;A War For All Seasons&quot; – features a story line that takes place over the course of 1951
* &quot;Life Time&quot; – utilizes a real time method of narration

Another change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as the McCarthy era, various sporting events, and the stardom of Marilyn Monroe were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series.

While the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt &quot;the cracks were starting to show&quot; by season 9 (1980–1981). Alda wished to make season 10 (1981–1982) &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;″s last, but was persuaded by CBS to produce a slightly shortened 11th season, coupled with a farewell movie finale, at the request of CBS. In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a -hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode produced was the penultimately aired episode &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. The series finale movie, titled &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, became the most-watched U.S. television broadcast in history at that time, with 106 million viewers.

===Set and filming===

The 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu (Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California) () was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same location used to shoot the movie, although the number of tents was reduced and there were changes made to the positions of several tents for the TV show. The indoor set, on Stage 09 at Fox Studios in Century City, was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the &quot;outdoor&quot; scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the helicopter pad required using the ranch).

Just as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot; as a forest fire caused by enemy incendiary bombs that forced the 4077th to move out.

The Malibu location is today known as Malibu Creek State Park. Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted Jeep and a Dodge ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.

On February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941) and the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; television series (1974) were filmed, among many other productions. Much of this location, including the signpost and markers, was thought to have been destroyed in the 2018 Woolsey Fire but subsequently was determined to have survived the fire.
The exhibit &quot;M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds&quot; was at the National Museum of American History from July 30, 1983, through February 3, 1985. The exhibit was extremely popular, drawing more than 17,000 in a single week, a record for any Smithsonian display.

On exhibit were The Swamp and Operating Room sets, one of the show&#x27;s 14 Emmy Awards, early drafts of the pilot script, costumes from the show and other memorabilia. Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic signpost, Hawkeye&#x27;s still and Major Winchester&#x27;s Webcor tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors to compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and the Vietnam Wars.
===Laugh track===
Series creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; broadcast without a laugh track. Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. &quot;We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,&quot; said Gelbart in 1998. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody&#x27;s guts being sewn up.&quot;

Seasons 1–5 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6–11 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (&quot;O.R.&quot;, &quot;The Bus&quot;, &quot;Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?&quot;, &quot;The Interview&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot;, and &quot;Dreams&quot; among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;. The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show. On one occasion during an airing on BBC2 in the UK, the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure; an apology from the network for the &quot;technical difficulty&quot; was later released, for during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it had been shown without the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating &quot;canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, it&#x27;s downright unbearable.&quot;

On all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track.

&quot;They&#x27;re a lie,&quot; said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. &quot;You&#x27;re telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,&quot; continued Gelbart. &quot;But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, &#x27;Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?&#x27;&quot; Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience&#x27;s enjoyment. &quot;So you know what they said?&quot; Gelbart said. Since there&#x27;s no difference, let&#x27;s leave it alone!&#x27; The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor.&quot; Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, &quot;I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner.&quot;

In his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking &quot;notes&quot; on a script, his writing partner and he changed the script to a &quot;cold show&quot; – one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared . Levine says, &quot;This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.&quot;

Jackie Cooper wrote that Alan Aldawhom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasonsconcealed what Cooper felt was a lot of hostility toward him, and the two barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper&#x27;s tenure on the show ended.

===Final episode: &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;===

&quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot; was the final episode of &quot;M*A*S*H.&quot; Special television sets were placed in PX parking lots, auditoriums and day rooms of the U.S. Army in Korea so that military personnel could watch that episode, in spite of 14 hours&#x27; time-zone difference with the East Coast of the US. The episode aired on February 28, 1983, and was 2 hours long. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 60.2 and 77 share and according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1983, the final episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; had 125 million viewers.

When the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; finale aired in 1983, more than 83.3 million homes in the U.S. had televisions, compared to almost 115 million in February 2010.

&quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot; broke the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a television series. Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Days of M*A*S*H&quot; include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the city&#x27;s history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77 percent of the people of New York City flushed their toilets. These stories have all since been identified as part of an urban legend dating back to the days of the&quot; Amos and Andy&quot; radio program in the 1930s.

==Reception==

===Ratings and recognition===
The series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a television film, titled &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in US television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), according to the &quot;New York Times.&quot; It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being canceled. In season two, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was placed in a better time slot by CBS (airing after the popular &quot;All in the Family&quot;, taking the place of &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;, which had been canceled after one season despite good ratings due to religious groups protesting the show&#x27;s premise of an inter-faith marriage between the title characters); the show then became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run. It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year war, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons. The Korean War lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.

The episodes &quot;Abyssinia, Henry&quot; and &quot;The Interview&quot; were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997. In 2002, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was ranked number 25 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In February 2008, the series was named the number-one smartest TV show of all time by Jim Werdell, chairman of Mensa International, who said that it &quot;had smart repartee and was so much more than a comedy&quot;. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever and &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as the 16th-greatest TV show. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; #24 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

==Home entertainment==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has released all 11 seasons of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; on DVD in Region 1 and Region 2.

In January 2015, it was announced that the first five seasons of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; would be available on Netflix&#x27;s instant streaming service beginning February 1, 2015. This marked the first time the series was made available on an internet platform. As of July 1, 2015, all 11 seasons were available; syndicated versions of hour-long episodes were utilized for streaming, splitting these shows into two parts. In contrast to the DVD sets, the Netflix streams did not have an option for disabling the laugh track on the soundtrack. On April 1, 2016, Netflix&#x27; contract to stream the series expired and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was removed from the platform.

In July 2017, it was announced that Hulu had acquired U.S. streaming rights for the entire run of &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; along with several other 20th Century Fox-owned TV programs. All 256 episodes were added to Hulu beginning June 29, 2018. All episodes were scanned in 1080 HD from the original 35mm negatives and are presented in 16:9 widescreen by cropping the top and bottom off the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Outside the U.S., the series is available on Disney+&#x27;s Star section and the Star+ service in Latin America.

== Games ==

Two board games were created based on the show. The first came out in 1975 and was published by Transogram, and the second was published in 1981 by Milton Bradley.

A M*A*S*H video game was produced by Fox Video Games in 1983. It was criticized for trivializing the war, lacking the nuance of the film and TV show.

Finally, there was a trivia game published by Golden in 1984. It was available in two variations, one with a full complement of paraphernalia including game-tray, die, and point value cards and another version that was just question cards.

== Merchandise ==

A trading card set was published in 1982 by Donruss. Also in 1982, Tri-Star International produced a set of MASH action figures, with vehicles and a play set.

==Spin-offs and reunion specials==

The two-season spin-off &quot;AfterMASH&quot; (1983–1985) inherited the parent show&#x27;s Monday night time slot and featured a few of its main characters reunited in a Midwestern hospital after the war. The more successful &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; (1979–1986) took place nearly three decades after the events of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and depicted Trapper John McIntyre as chief of surgery at a San Francisco hospital; its producers argued successfully in court that it was based on the earlier movie rather than the TV series. In an unpurchased television pilot, &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot; (1984), Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly joins the St. Louis police force after his farm fails following his return to the U.S.

&quot;Making M*A*S*H&quot;, a documentary special narrated by Mary Tyler Moore that takes viewers behind the production of the season 8 episodes &quot;Old Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Lend a Hand&quot;, was produced for PBS, and aired on January 21, 1981. The special was later included in the syndicated rerun package, with new narration by producer Michael Hirsch.

Three retrospective specials were produced to commemorate the show&#x27;s 20th, 30th and 50th anniversaries:
* &quot;Memories of M*A*S*H&quot;, hosted by Shelley Long and featuring clips from the series and interviews with cast members, was aired by CBS on November 25, 1991.
* &quot;M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion&quot;, in which the surviving cast members and producers gathered to reminisce, aired on Fox on May 17, 2002. The two-hour broadcast was hosted by Mike Farrell, who also got to interact with the actor he replaced, Wayne Rogers; previously filmed interviews with McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville (who had died in 1996 and 2000, respectively,) were also featured.
* &quot;M*A*S*H: When Television Changed Forever&quot;, a one-hour retrospective commemorating the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary, aired on Reelz on September 13, 2022. It featured new exclusive interviews with cast members Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell and Jeff Maxwell, as well as producers and writers, exploring the series&#x27; popularity and creative firsts.

&quot;Memories of M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H: 30th Anniversary Reunion&quot; are included as bonuses on the Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD of &quot;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen&quot;. Also included is &quot;M*A*S*H: Television&#x27;s Serious Sitcom,&quot; a 2002 episode of A&amp;E channel&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; program that detailed the show&#x27;s history.

In the late 1980s, the cast had a partial reunion in a series of commercials for IBM products, including personal computers and the AS/400 system. All of the front-billed regulars (with the exceptions of Farrell and Stevenson) appeared in the spots over time.

<text>Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes (, 6 December 1721 – 22 April 1794), often referred to as Malesherbes or Lamoignon-Malesherbes, was a French statesman and minister in the Ancien Régime, and later counsel for the defense of Louis XVI. He is known for his vigorous criticism of royal abuses as President of the and his role, as director of censorship, in helping with the publication of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. Despite his committed monarchism, his writings contributed to the development of liberalism during the French Age of Enlightenment.

==Biography==

===Family and early career===

Born in Paris to a famous legal family which belonged to the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;, Malesherbes was educated for the legal profession. The young lawyer&#x27;s career received a boost when his father, Guillaume de Lamoignon de Blancmesnil, was appointed Chancellor in 1750; he appointed his son Malesherbes as both President of the Cour des Aides and Director of the Librairie. This latter office entailed supervision of all French censorship, and in this capacity Malesherbes maintained communication with the literary leaders of Paris, including Diderot and Rousseau. In his view toward censorship, Malesherbes ordered that genuinely &quot;obscene&quot; books be confiscated, but that merely &quot;licentious&quot; ones should be ignored. This was done in the belief that without such a distinction, police might find themselves taking possession of the better part of many shopkeepers&#x27; inventories. He was instrumental in the publication of the Encyclopédie, to the consternation of the Church and particularly the Jesuits.

===Midlife===

In 1771, following the dismissal of Choiseul late the preceding year and at the instigation of Madame du Barry and the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, the Cour des Aides was dissolved for its opposition to a new method of administering justice devised by Maupeou, who planned to greatly diminish its powers and those of the &quot;parlements&quot; in general. Malesherbes, as President of the &quot;cour des aides&quot;, criticized the proposal for over-centralizing the justice system and abolishing the hereditary &quot;nobility of the robe,&quot; which he believed had been a defender of the people and a check on royal power due to its independence. He published a strong remonstrance against the new system, and was banished to his country seat at Malesherbes. For the next three years, Malesherbes dedicated himself primarily to travel and gardening. Indeed, he had always been an enthusiastic botanist; his avenue at Malesherbes was world-famous; he had written against Buffon and in favor of Carl Linnaeus&#x27; system of botanical classification; and he had been a member of the Académie des sciences since 1750.

===The 1775 &quot;Remontrances&quot;===

Malesherbes was recalled to Paris with the reconstituted &quot;cour des aides&quot; on the accession of Louis XVI; it was at this point that he spearheaded the famous 1775 &quot;Remontrances&quot; of the &quot;cour des aides&quot;, which detailed the problems facing the regime and envisioned a total overhaul of fiscal policy. Louis XVI was so impressed with the plan—and fearful for the future of his government—that Malesherbes was appointed minister of the &quot;maison du roi&quot; in 1775. During the same year, Malesherbes was also elected to the Académie française. He held office as a royal minister only nine months; the Court proved intransigent in its opposition to his proposals for fiscal restraint and other reforms, including curtailing the arbitrary issuance of &quot;lettres de cachet,&quot; and he soon found himself bereft of political support.
===Late career===

On retiring from the ministry with Turgot in 1776, he again spent some time at his country seat. But the state of pre-Revolutionary France made it impossible for Malesherbes to withdraw from political life. In 1787, he authored an essay on Protestant rights that did much to procure civil recognition for them in France; later that year, his &quot;Mémoire&quot; to the King detailed what he saw as the catastrophic state of affairs created by the monarchy, which was rapidly making &quot;future calamities&quot; inevitable.

===Retirement===

In 1788, rioting rocked France in Provence, Languedoc, Rousillon, Béarn, Flanders, Franche-Comté and Burgundy, most of the rioters motivated either by scarcity of bread, sympathy for representative government, or a combination. Due to the pressure, Lamoignon retired on 14 September 1788, and rioting erupted again. Crowds tried to burn down Lamoignon&#x27;s house, the troops were called out, and to quote the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, &quot;there was a horrible slaughter of poor folk who could not defend themselves.&quot;

===Trial of the King; execution===

In December 1792, with the King imprisoned and facing trial, Malesherbes volunteered to undertake his legal defense. He argued for the King&#x27;s life, together with François Tronchet and Raymond Desèze, before the Convention, and it was his painful task to break the news of his condemnation to the king. 

After this effort, Malesherbes returned once more to the country, but in December 1793 he was arrested with his daughter, his son-in-law M. de Rosanbo, and his grandchildren. He was brought back to Paris and imprisoned with his family for &quot;conspiracy with the emigrants&quot;. The family was imprisoned in the Prison Portes-Libres, and in April 1794 they were guillotined in Paris. His son-in-law, Louis Le Peletier de Rosanbo, was guillotined on 21 April 1794. On 22 April 1794, his daughter Antoinette, granddaughter Aline and her husband Jean-Baptiste de Chateaubriand, the deputés Isaac René Guy le Chapelier and Jacques Guillaume Thouret, four times elected president of the Constituent Assembly, were executed with him. As Malesherbes left prison to get into the sinister cart, his foot hit a stone and made him make a misstep. &quot;That,&quot; he said, smiling sadly, &quot;is a bad omen; in my place, a Roman would have returned.&quot;
On 10 May, his older sister Anne-Nicole, Countess of Sénozan, 76, was executed on the same day as Madame Elisabeth, the king&#x27;s sister. Malesherbes was the grand-father of François-René de Chateaubriand&#x27;s sister in law, Aline de Chateaubriand.

==Thought==
Although he remained a committed royalist until his death, Malesherbes was hardly untouched by the radical Enlightenment currents that transformed France. He was influenced by his reading of Fénelon and Montesquieu and his friendships with Rousseau and Turgot. On multiple occasions throughout his career, he recognized the grievances later cited by revolutionaries when he criticized the monarchy for its unfair and arbitrary taxation policies and profligate spending. Although he believed hierarchy was natural and desirable, he was concerned about its distortionary effects on administration and justice; indeed, he argued that the privileges of the nobility should be earned through service to France, not granted by birth. Malesherbes also stressed the importance of communication in governing, believing the King should be more engaged with public opinion and grievances.

Malesherbes&#x27; moderate and reformist tendencies were on full display during his tenure at the Librairie. When he retired from his post, Voltaire wrote that &quot;M. de Malesherbes tirelessly served the human spirit by giving to the press more liberty than it has ever had.&quot; Indeed, censorship at the time was not perceived as automatically inimical to the Enlightenment; several leading philosophes were employed as censors, including Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert. Although he believed that books attacking governmental authority and religion should be suppressed, Malesherbes also frequently overruled censors to permit the publication of philosophical works that had been flagged as dangerous. In one notable case, Malesherbes granted royal privilege, meaning official sanction and exclusive publication rights, to a radical work by Helvétius that caused a public scandal upon its release. The Court eventually revoked the royal privilege and the Parliament ordered the book to be burned. On another occasion, when he was impressed with Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot;, Malesherbes worked around his own agency to coordinate the clandestine publication of the book.

Malesherbes applied his broader criticisms of government inefficiency and privilege to the practice of censorship, as well. He defended his more permissive censorship regime by arguing that banning too many books would stifle the book trade and make enforcement unfeasible. Furthermore, he broke with Librairie tradition by refusing to grant favors to nobles who requested that a particular book be either published or blocked.

Decades after his retirement from the Librairie, in 1788, Malesherbes published his &quot;Mémoires sur la Liberté de la Presse&quot;, where he critiqued the system of censorship he had been charged with enforcing. On the eve of the French Revolution, he defended freedom of the press on the grounds of encouraging public debate: under a censorship regime, only the most extreme authors would take the risk of publishing on sensitive topics, and the public would be deprived of the views of the &quot;modest and reasonable Authors&quot; who &quot;would be the most useful to the public.&quot; Indeed, Malesherbes now adopted the Revolutionary language of the &quot;nation,&quot; and argued that the nation can only come to know the truth through free discussion, which is more effective than censorship at preventing the spread of &quot;error.&quot; He had not discarded the concept of censorship, however; instead, he envisaged a voluntary censorship scheme, which would guarantee authors immunity from subsequent judicial prosecution for their ideas if they obtained official approval before publishing.

== Reception and legacy ==
Starting only a few years after his death, biographers portrayed Malesherbes as a romantic figure, one of the innocent victims of the Terror. For example, the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; writes of him:More recently, the French scholar François Moureau has critiqued this &quot;hagiographic&quot; tradition, emphasizing instead the contradictions in Malesherbes&#x27; career: he was shaped both by an openness to new Enlightenment ideas and by his commitment to fulfilling his role as a public servant within the Ancien Régime. Other modern commentaries on Malesherbes have advanced similar arguments; George Kelly, for example, describes him as &quot;Janus-faced.&quot;

Malesherbes was also remembered with reverence by his great-grandson Alexis de Tocqueville; the historian Roger Williams has pointed to this connection as a &quot;legacy of liberalism.&quot;

<doc id="156062" wikidata="Q213663" url="?curid=156062" title="Louis XIV's East India Company">
<text>Louis XIV&#x27;s East India Company () was a joint-stock company founded in the Kingdom of France in August 1664 to engage in trade in India and other Asian lands, complementing the French West India Company () created three months before. It was one of several successive enterprises with similar names, a sequence started with Henry IV&#x27;s first French East Indies Company in 1604 and continued with Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s Compagnie d&#x27;Orient in 1642. Planned by Jean-Baptiste Colbert to compete with the English East India Company and Dutch East India Company, it was chartered by King Louis XIV for the purpose of trading in the Eastern Hemisphere. 

Louis XIV&#x27;s company became insolvent and was reorganized in 1685, and was again bankrupt in 1706. In 1719, what remained of it was acquired by John Law&#x27;s Company, which in 1723 became the French Indies Company active during much of the 18th century.

==Background==

The seventeenth century saw several French efforts to trade with the East Indies, starting with the first French East Indies Company (1604-1614). They were influenced by the successful business ventures of the Dutch East India Company. Between the 1630s and early 1660s, French efforts were smaller in scale, but they enjoyed some success. French merchant ships traversed the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and the northwestern coast of the Indian subcontinent. These accomplishments, however, paled in comparison with those of England and the Dutch Republic. France&#x27;s Atlantic ports competed with each other. The commercial and financial expertise concentrated around the coastal regions of Brittany and Normandy. 

==History==

At its foundation on , the new company absorbed the earlier operations of the Compagnie d&#x27;Orient as well as those of the Compagnie de Chine (est. 1660) and Compagnie de Madagascar (est. mid-1650s in Port-Louis, Morbihan). Its initial capital of the East India Company was 15 million livres, divided into shares of 1000 livres apiece. Louis XIV funded the first 3 million livres of investment, against which losses in the first 10 years were to be charged. Additional state support was provided in the form of subsidies indexed to trading volume, 20-percent subsidization of the investment expenditure to create overseas ports, and free military protection. The company was led by a central board of 12 directors () based in Paris, complemented by four in Bordeaux, Lyon, Nantes, and Rouen.

The company was granted a 50-year monopoly on French navigation and trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, a region stretching from the Cape of Good Hope eastward all the way to the Strait of Magellan. In 1666, it was granted a base in Lorient, where it permanently relocated its operations previously in Le Havre in 1670.

Louis granted the company a concession in perpetuity for the island of Madagascar, as well as any other territories it might conquer. The underlying intent was to establish a French entrepôt in Madagascar to rival the Dutch colony of Batavia, but that plan was never realistic and the company gave up on it in 1668. Another motivation that interfered with the company&#x27;s commercial activity was to promote the expansion of the Catholic faith, materialized in an early agreement made in 1665 by the company with the recently established Paris Foreign Missions Society by which the latter&#x27;s missionaries were granted free travel on the company&#x27;s ships.

After abandoning the Madagascar project, the company endeavored to establish a foothold in the Mughal Empire, which had long awarded facilities to the Portuguese Empire and other European ventures. Already on 4 September 1666, an embassy sent by Louis XIV had secured a mandate from Emperor Aurangzeb that granted the company rights to trade in the major Mughal port of Surat, withs similar customs privileges as the Dutch and English. In 1673, the company established an outpost in Pondicherry, then in 1688 in Chandernagor. 

The company&#x27;s operations were heavily hampered by its bureaucratic governance and political interference. It was never able to send more than five ships a year, against 10 to 25 ships sent annually by its Dutch competitor. By the 1680s, the company went insolvent and they had little choice but to rent out its monopoly to a group of merchants. On , a decree of Louis XIV allowed private merchants to trade in the East on board the company&#x27;s ships. In 1685, the company was drastically restructured, and its governance further nationalized as the directors were henceforth chosen by the king among the shareholders instead of being elected, and the regional chambers were abolished. Its activity further declined in the late 17th century, as Louis XIV&#x27;s wars drained the kingdom of resources for any long-term projects. During that period and after its renewed bankruptcy in 1706, French commerce in Asia was mostly undertaken by private entrepreneurs, many of them from Saint-Malo.

==Leadership==

The first Director General for the Company was François de La Faye de La Martinie, who was adjoined by two Directors belonging to the two most successful trading organizations at that time: François Caron, who had spent 30 years working for the Dutch East India Company including in Japan from 1619 to 1641, and Marcara Avanchintz, an Armenian trader from Isfahan, Persia.

<doc id="156068" wikidata="Q186652" url="?curid=156068" title="Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette">
<text>Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, Marquis de La Fayette (; 6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834), known in the United States as Lafayette ( ), was a French nobleman and military officer who volunteered to join the Continental Army, led by General George Washington, in the American Revolutionary War. Lafayette was ultimately permitted to command Continental Army troops in the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781, the Revolutionary War&#x27;s final major battle that secured American independence. After returning to France, Lafayette became a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830 and continues to be celebrated as a hero in both France and the United States.

Lafayette was born into a wealthy land-owning family in Chavaniac in the province of Auvergne in south-central France. He followed the family&#x27;s martial tradition and was commissioned an officer at age 13. He became convinced that the American revolutionary cause was noble, and he traveled to the New World seeking glory in it. He was made a major general at age 19 but was initially not given American troops to command. He fought with the Continental Army at the Battle of Brandywine near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, where he was wounded but managed to organize an orderly retreat, and he served with distinction in the Battle of Rhode Island. In the middle of the war, he returned home to France to lobby for an increase in French support for the American Revolution. He returned to America in 1780 and was given senior positions in the Continental Army. In 1781, troops under his command in Virginia blocked a British army led by Lord Cornwallis until other American and French forces could position themselves for the decisive siege of Yorktown.

Lafayette returned to France and was appointed to the Assembly of Notables in 1787, convened in response to the fiscal crisis. He was elected a member of the Estates General of 1789, where representatives met from the three traditional orders of French society: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. After the National Constituent Assembly was formed, he helped to write the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen with Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s assistance. This document was inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence, which was authored primarily by Jefferson, and invoked natural law to establish basic principles of the democratic nation-state. He also advocated the abolition of slavery, in keeping with the philosophy of natural rights. After the storming of the Bastille, he was appointed commander-in-chief of France&#x27;s National Guard and tried to steer a middle course through the years of revolution. In August 1792, radical factions ordered his arrest, and he fled to the Austrian Netherlands. He was captured by Austrian troops and spent more than five years in prison.

Lafayette returned to France after Napoleon Bonaparte secured his release in 1797, though he refused to participate in Napoleon&#x27;s government. After the Bourbon Restoration of 1814, he became a liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies, a position which he held for most of the remainder of his life. In 1824, President James Monroe invited him to the United States as the nation&#x27;s guest, where he visited all 24 states in the union and met a rapturous reception. During France&#x27;s July Revolution of 1830, he declined an offer to become the French dictator. Instead, he supported Louis-Philippe as king, but turned against him when the monarch became autocratic. He died on 20 May 1834 and is buried in Picpus Cemetery in Paris, under soil from Bunker Hill. He is sometimes known as &quot;The Hero of the Two Worlds&quot; for his accomplishments in the service of both France and the United States.

== Early life ==


Lafayette was born on 6 September 1757 to Michel Louis Christophe Roch Gilbert Paulette du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, colonel of grenadiers, and Marie Louise Jolie de La Rivière, at the Château de Chavaniac, in Chavaniac-Lafayette, near Le Puy-en-Velay, in the province of Auvergne (now Haute-Loire).

Lafayette&#x27;s lineage was likely one of the oldest and most distinguished in Auvergne and, perhaps, in all of France. Males of the Lafayette family enjoyed a reputation for courage and chivalry and were noted for their contempt for danger. One of Lafayette&#x27;s early ancestors, Gilbert de Lafayette III, a Marshal of France, had been a companion-at-arms of Joan of Arc&#x27;s army during the Siege of Orléans in 1429. According to legend, another ancestor acquired the crown of thorns during the Sixth Crusade.

His non-Lafayette ancestors are also notable; his great-grandfather (his mother&#x27;s maternal grandfather) was the Comte de La Rivière, until his death in 1770 commander of the Mousquetaires du Roi, or &quot;Black Musketeers&quot;, King Louis XV&#x27;s personal horse guard. Lafayette&#x27;s paternal uncle Jacques-Roch died on 18 January 1734 while fighting the Austrians at Milan in the War of the Polish Succession; upon his death, the title of marquis passed to his brother Michel.

Lafayette&#x27;s father likewise died on the battlefield. On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette was struck by a cannonball while fighting an Anglo-German army at the Battle of Minden in Westphalia. Lafayette became marquis and Lord of Chavaniac, but the estate went to his mother. Perhaps devastated by the loss of her husband, she went to live in Paris with her father and grandfather, leaving Lafayette to be raised in Chavaniac-Lafayette by his paternal grandmother, Mme de Chavaniac, who had brought the château into the family with her dowry.

In 1768, when Lafayette was 11, he was summoned to Paris to live with his mother and great-grandfather at the comte&#x27;s apartments in Luxembourg Palace. The boy was sent to school at the Collège du Plessis, part of the University of Paris, and it was decided that he would carry on the family martial tradition. The comte, the boy&#x27;s great-grandfather, enrolled the boy in a program to train future Musketeers. Lafayette&#x27;s mother and grandfather died, on 3 and 24 April 1770 respectively, leaving Lafayette an income of . Upon the death of an uncle, the 12-year-old Lafayette inherited a yearly income of .

In May 1771, aged less than 14, Lafayette was commissioned an officer in the Musketeers, with the rank of &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot;. His duties, which included marching in military parades and presenting himself to King Louis, were mostly ceremonial and he continued his studies as usual.

At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d&#x27;Ayen was looking to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Adrienne de La Fayette, and the duke spoke to the boy&#x27;s guardian (Lafayette&#x27;s uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by Henriette Anne Louise d&#x27;Aguesseau, the duke&#x27;s wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing not to mention the marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet from time to time in casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.

== Departure from France ==
=== Finding a cause ===

After the marriage contract was signed in 1773, Lafayette lived with his young wife in his father-in-law&#x27;s house in Versailles. He continued his education, both at the riding school of Versailles, where his fellow students included the future Charles X, and at the prestigious Académie de Versailles. He was given a commission as a lieutenant in the Noailles Dragoons in April 1773, the transfer from the royal regiment being done at the request of Lafayette&#x27;s father-in-law.

In 1775, Lafayette took part in his unit&#x27;s annual training in Metz, where he met Charles François de Broglie, Marquis of Ruffec, the Army of the East&#x27;s commander. At dinner, both men discussed the ongoing revolt against British rule in the Thirteen Colonies. Historian Marc Leepson argued that Lafayette, &quot;who had grown up loathing the British for killing his father&quot;, felt that an American victory in the conflict would diminish Britain&#x27;s stature internationally. Another historian noted that Lafayette had recently become a Freemason, and news of the revolt fired his chivalric – and now Masonic – imagination with descriptions of Americans as &quot;people fighting for liberty&quot;. A third historian, James R. Gaines, recalls Lafayette attending a dinner at this time with the Duke of Gloucester (brother of British King George III), who complained about the Americans who had objected to British rule and mocked their beliefs in equality the right of the people to rule themselves. Lafayette later recalled the dinner as a turning point in his thinking, and when he learned that Washington was seeking recruits for the Continental Army.

In September 1775, when Lafayette turned 18, he returned to Paris and received the captaincy in the Dragoons he had been promised as a wedding present. In December, his first child, Henriette, was born. During these months, Lafayette became convinced that the American Revolution reflected his own beliefs, saying &quot;My heart was dedicated&quot;. The year 1776 saw delicate negotiations between American agents, including Silas Deane, and Louis XVI and his foreign minister, Comte Charles de Vergennes. The king and his minister hoped that by supplying the Americans with arms and officers, they might restore French influence in North America, and exact revenge against Britain for France&#x27;s defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. When Lafayette heard that French officers were being sent to America, he demanded to be among them. He met Deane and gained inclusion despite his youth. On 7 December 1776, Deane enlisted Lafayette as a major general.

The plan to send French officers (as well as other forms of aid) to America came to nothing when the British heard of it and threatened war. Lafayette&#x27;s father-in-law, de Noailles, scolded the young man and told him to go to London and visit the Marquis de Noailles, the French ambassador to Britain and Lafayette&#x27;s uncle by marriage, which he did in February 1777. In the interim, he did not abandon his plans to go to America. Lafayette was presented to George III and spent three weeks in London. On his return to France, he went into hiding from his father-in-law (and superior officer), writing to him that he was planning to go to America. De Noailles was furious and convinced Louis to issue a decree forbidding French officers from serving in America, specifically naming Lafayette. Vergennes may have persuaded the king to order Lafayette&#x27;s arrest, though this is uncertain.

=== Departure for America ===

Lafayette learned that the Continental Congress lacked funds for his voyage, so he bought the sailing ship &quot;Victoire&quot; with his own money for 112,000 pounds. He journeyed to Bordeaux, where &quot;Victoire&quot; was being prepared for her trip, and he sent word asking for information on his family&#x27;s reaction. The response threw him into emotional turmoil, including letters from his wife and other relatives. Soon after departure, he ordered the ship turned around and returned to Bordeaux, to the frustration of the officers traveling with him. The army commander there ordered Lafayette to report to his father-in-law&#x27;s regiment in Marseille. De Broglie hoped to become a military and political leader in America, and he met Lafayette in Bordeaux and convinced him that the government actually wanted him to go. This was not true, though there was considerable public support for Lafayette in Paris, where the American cause was popular. Lafayette wanted to believe it and pretended to comply with the order to report to Marseilles, going only a few kilometres east before turning around and returning to his ship. &quot;Victoire&quot; set sail out of Pauillac on the shores of the Gironde on 25 March 1777. However, Lafayette was not on board in order to avoid being identified by British spies or the French Crown; the vessel moored in Pasaia on the Basque coast and was supplied with 5,000 rifles and ammunition from the factories in Gipuzkoa. He joined the &quot;Victoire&quot;, departing to America on 26 April 1777. The two-month journey to the New World was marked by seasickness and boredom. The ship&#x27;s captain Lebourcier intended to stop in the West Indies to sell cargo, but Lafayette was fearful of arrest, so he bought the cargo to avoid docking at the islands. He landed on North Island near Georgetown, South Carolina on 13 June 1777.

== American Revolution ==

Upon his arrival, Lafayette met Major Benjamin Huger, a wealthy landowner, and stayed with him for two weeks before departing for the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia. The Second Continental Congress, convened in Philadelphia, had been overwhelmed by French officers recruited by Deane, many of whom could not speak English or lacked military experience. Lafayette had learned some English en route and became fluent within a year of his arrival, and his Masonic membership opened many doors in Philadelphia. After Lafayette offered to serve without pay, Congress commissioned him a major general on 31 July 1777. Lafayette&#x27;s advocates included the recently arrived American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, who by letter urged Congress to accommodate the young Frenchman.

General George Washington, commander in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, &quot;the two men bonded almost immediately.&quot; Washington was impressed by the young man&#x27;s enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, &quot;I am here to learn, not to teach.&quot; He became a member of Washington&#x27;s staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as &quot;friend and father&quot;.

=== Brandywine, Valley Forge, and Albany ===


Lafayette first saw combat at the Battle of Brandywine near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on 11 September 1777. British commander Sir William Howe made plans to occupy Philadelphia by moving troops south by ship to Chesapeake Bay rather than approaching the city through the Delaware Bay, which there was a heavy Continental Army presence, and then bringing British troops over land to the city. After the British outflanked the Americans, Washington sent Lafayette to join General John Sullivan. Upon his arrival, Lafayette went with the Third Pennsylvania Brigade, under Brigadier Thomas Conway, and attempted to rally the unit to face the attack. British and Hessian troops continued to advance with their superior numbers, and Lafayette was shot in the leg. During the American retreat, Lafayette rallied the troops, allowing a more orderly pullback, before being treated for his wound. After the battle, Washington cited him for &quot;bravery and military ardour&quot; and recommended him for the command of a division in a letter to Congress, which was hastily evacuating, as the British occupied Philadelphia later that month.

Lafayette returned to the field in November after two months of recuperation in the Moravian settlement of Bethlehem, and received command of the division previously led by Major General Adam Stephen. He assisted General Nathanael Greene in reconnaissance of British positions in New Jersey; with 300 soldiers, he defeated a numerically superior Hessian force in Gloucester, on 24 November 1777.

Lafayette stayed at Washington&#x27;s encampment at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–1778, and shared the hardship of his troops. There, the Board of War, led by Horatio Gates, asked Lafayette to prepare an invasion of Quebec from Albany, New York. When Lafayette arrived in Albany, he found too few men to mount an invasion. He wrote to Washington of the situation, and made plans to return to Valley Forge. Before departing, he recruited the Oneida tribe to the American side. The Oneida referred to Lafayette as &quot;Kayewla&quot; (fearsome horseman). In Valley Forge, he criticized the board&#x27;s decision to attempt an invasion of Quebec in winter. The Continental Congress agreed, and Gates left the board. Meanwhile, treaties signed by America and France were made public in March 1778, and France formally recognized American independence.

=== Barren Hill, Monmouth, and Rhode Island ===

Faced with the prospect of French intervention, the British sought to concentrate their land and naval forces in New York City, and they began to evacuate Philadelphia in May 1778. Washington dispatched Lafayette with a 2200-man force on 18 May to reconnoiter near Barren Hill, Pennsylvania. The next day, the British heard that he had made camp nearby and sent 5000 men to capture him. General Howe led a further on 20 May and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To feign numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear from the woods on an outcropping (now Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania) and to fire upon the British periodically. His troops simultaneously escaped via a sunken road, and he was then able to cross Matson&#x27;s Ford with the remainder of his force.

The British then marched from Philadelphia toward New York. The Continental Army followed and finally attacked at Monmouth Courthouse in central New Jersey. Washington appointed General Charles Lee to lead the attacking force at the Battle of Monmouth, and Lee moved against the British flank on 28 June 1778. However, he gave conflicting orders soon after fighting began, causing chaos in the American ranks. Lafayette sent a message to Washington to urge him to the front; upon his arrival, he found Lee&#x27;s men in retreat. Washington relieved Lee, took command, and rallied the American force. After suffering significant casualties at Monmouth, the British withdrew in the night and successfully reached New York.

The French fleet arrived at Delaware Bay on 8 July 1778 under Admiral d&#x27;Estaing, with whom General Washington planned to attack Newport, Rhode Island, the other major British base in the north. Lafayette and General Greene were sent with a 3000-man force to participate in the attack. Lafayette wanted to control a joint Franco-American force but was rebuffed by the admiral. On 9 August, the American land force attacked the British without consulting d&#x27;Estaing. The Americans asked d&#x27;Estaing to place his ships in Narragansett Bay, but he refused and sought to defeat the British Royal Navy at sea. The fighting was inconclusive as a storm scattered and damaged both fleets.

D&#x27;Estaing moved his ships north to Boston for repairs, where it faced an angry demonstration from Bostonians who considered the French departure from Newport to be a desertion. John Hancock and Lafayette were dispatched to calm the situation, and Lafayette then returned to Rhode Island to prepare the retreat made necessary by d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s departure. For these actions, he was cited by the Continental Congress for &quot;gallantry, skill, and prudence&quot;. He wanted to expand the war to fight the British elsewhere in America and even in Europe under the French flag, but he found little interest in his proposals. In October 1778, he requested permission from Washington and Congress to go home on leave. They agreed, with Congress voting to give him a ceremonial sword to be presented to him in France. His departure was delayed by illness, and he sailed for France in January 1779.

=== Return to France ===
Lafayette reached Paris in February 1779 where he was placed under house arrest for eight days for disobeying the king by going to America. This was merely face-saving by Louis XVI; Lafayette was given a hero&#x27;s welcome and was soon invited to hunt with the king. The American envoy was ill, so Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s grandson William Temple Franklin presented Lafayette with the gold-encrusted sword commissioned by the Continental Congress.

Lafayette pushed for an invasion of Britain, with himself to have a major command in the French forces. Spain was now France&#x27;s ally against Britain and sent ships to the English Channel in support. The Spanish ships did not arrive until August 1779 and were met by a faster squadron of British ships that the combined French and Spanish fleet could not catch. In September, the invasion was abandoned, and Lafayette turned his hopes toward returning to America. In December 1779, Adrienne gave birth to Georges Washington Lafayette.

Lafayette worked with Benjamin Franklin to secure the promise of to be sent to America, commanded by General Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau. Lafayette would resume his position as a major general of American forces, serving as liaison between Rochambeau and Washington, who would be in command of both nations&#x27; forces. In March 1780, he departed from Rochefort for America aboard the frigate &quot;Hermione&quot;, arriving in Boston on 27 April 1780.

=== Second voyage to America ===
On his return, Lafayette found the American cause at a low ebb, rocked by several military defeats, especially in the south. Lafayette was greeted in Boston with enthusiasm, seen as &quot;a knight in shining armor from the chivalric past, come to save the nation&quot;. He journeyed southwest and on 10 May 1780 had a joyous reunion with Washington at Morristown, New Jersey. The general and his officers were delighted to hear that the large French force promised to Lafayette would be coming to their aid. Washington, aware of Lafayette&#x27;s popularity, had him write (with Alexander Hamilton to correct his spelling) to state officials to urge them to provide more troops and provisions to the Continental Army. This bore fruit in the coming months, as Lafayette awaited the arrival of the French fleet. However, when the fleet arrived, there were fewer men and supplies than expected, and Rochambeau decided to wait for reinforcements before seeking battle with the British. This was unsatisfactory to Lafayette, who proposed grandiose schemes for the taking of New York City and other areas, and Rochambeau briefly refused to receive Lafayette until the young man apologized. Washington counseled the marquis to be patient.

That summer Washington placed Lafayette in charge of a division of troops. The marquis spent lavishly on his command, which patrolled North Jersey and adjacent New York state. Lafayette saw no significant action, and in November, Washington disbanded the division, sending the soldiers back to their state regiments. The war continued badly for the Americans, with most battles in the south going against them, and General Benedict Arnold abandoning them for the British side.

Lafayette spent the first part of the winter of 1780–1781 in Philadelphia, where the American Philosophical Society elected him its first foreign member. Congress asked him to return to France to lobby for more men and supplies, but Lafayette refused, sending letters instead.

After the Continental victory at the Battle of Cowpens in the Province of South Carolina, in January 1781, Washington ordered Lafayette to re-form his force in Philadelphia and go south to the Colony of Virginia to link up with troops commanded by Baron von Steuben. The combined force was to try to trap British forces commanded by Benedict Arnold, with French ships preventing his escape by sea. If Lafayette was successful, Arnold was to be summarily hanged. British command of the seas prevented the plan, though Lafayette and a small part of his force was able to reach von Steuben in Yorktown, Virginia. Von Steuben sent a plan to Washington, proposing to use land forces and French ships to trap the main British force under Lord Cornwallis. When he received no new orders from Washington, Lafayette began to move his troops north toward Philadelphia, only to be ordered to Virginia to assume military command there. An outraged Lafayette assumed he was being abandoned in a backwater while decisive battles took place elsewhere, and objected to his orders in vain. He also sent letters to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, French ambassador in Philadelphia, describing how ill-supplied his troops were. As Lafayette hoped, la Luzerne sent his letter on to France with a recommendation of massive French aid, which, after being approved by the king, would play a crucial part in the battles to come. Washington, fearing a letter might be captured by the British, could not tell Lafayette that he planned to trap Cornwallis in a decisive campaign.

=== Virginia and Yorktown ===

Lafayette evaded Cornwallis&#x27; attempts to capture him in Richmond. In June 1781, Cornwallis received orders from London to proceed to the Chesapeake Bay and to oversee construction of a port, in preparation for an overland attack on Philadelphia. As the British column traveled, Lafayette sent small squads that would appear unexpectedly, attacking the rearguard or foraging parties, and giving the impression that his forces were larger than they were.

On 4 July, the British left Williamsburg and prepared to cross the James River. Cornwallis sent only an advance guard to the south side of the river, hiding many of his other troops in the forest on the north side, hoping to ambush Lafayette. On 6 July, Lafayette ordered General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne to strike British troops on the north side with roughly 800 soldiers. Wayne found himself vastly outnumbered, and, instead of retreating, led a bayonet charge. The charge bought time for the Americans, and the British did not pursue. The Battle of Green Spring was a victory for Cornwallis, but the American army was bolstered by the display of courage by the men.

By August, Cornwallis had established the British at Yorktown, and Lafayette took up position on Malvern Hill, stationing artillery surrounding the British, who were close to the York River, and who had orders to construct fortifications to protect the British ships in Hampton Roads. Lafayette&#x27;s containment trapped the British when the French fleet arrived and won the Battle of the Virginia Capes, depriving Cornwallis of naval protection. On 14 September 1781, Washington&#x27;s forces joined Lafayette&#x27;s. On 28 September, with the French fleet blockading the British, the combined forces laid siege to Yorktown. On 14 October, Lafayette&#x27;s on the American right took after Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s forces had charged in hand-to-hand combat. These two redoubts were key to breaking the British defenses. After a failed British counter-attack, Cornwallis surrendered on 19 October 1781.

== Hero of two worlds ==
Yorktown was the last major land battle of the American Revolution, but the British still held several major port cities. Lafayette wanted to lead expeditions to capture them, but Washington felt that he would be more useful seeking additional naval support from France. Congress appointed him its advisor to America&#x27;s envoys in Europe, Benjamin Franklin in Paris, John Jay in Madrid, and John Adams in The Hague, instructing them &quot;to communicate and agree on everything with him&quot;. Congress also sent Louis XVI an official letter of commendation on the Marquis&#x27;s behalf.

Lafayette left Boston for France on 18 December 1781 where he was welcomed as a hero, and he was received at the Palace of Versailles on 22 January 1782. He witnessed the birth of his daughter, whom he named Marie-Antoinette Virginie upon Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s recommendation. He was promoted to &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;, skipping numerous ranks, and he was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. He worked on a combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies in 1782, as no formal peace treaty had yet been signed. The Treaty of Paris was signed between Great Britain and the United States in 1783, which made the expedition unnecessary; Lafayette took part in those negotiations.

Lafayette worked with Jefferson to establish trade agreements between the United States and France which aimed to reduce America&#x27;s debt to France. He joined the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, a French abolitionist group which advocated for the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade and equal rights for free people of color. He urged the emancipation of American slaves and their establishment as tenant farmers in a 1783 letter to Washington, who was a slave owner. Washington declined to free his slaves, though he expressed interest in the young man&#x27;s ideas, and Lafayette purchased three slave plantations in Cayenne, French Guiana to house the project.

Lafayette visited America in 1784–1785 where he enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome, visiting all the states. The trip included a visit to Washington&#x27;s farm at Mount Vernon on 17 August. He addressed the Virginia House of Delegates where he called for &quot;liberty of all mankind&quot; and urged the abolition of slavery, and he urged the Pennsylvania Legislature to help form a federal union (the states were then bound by the Articles of Confederation). He visited the Mohawk Valley in New York to participate in peace negotiations with the Iroquois, some of whom he had met in 1778. He received an honorary degree from Harvard University, a portrait of Washington from the city of Boston, and a bust from the state of Virginia. Maryland&#x27;s legislature honored him by making him and his male heirs &quot;natural born Citizens&quot; of the state, which made him a natural-born citizen of the United States after the 1789 ratification of the Constitution.

Lafayette later boasted that he had become an American citizen before the concept of French citizenship existed. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Virginia also granted him citizenship.

Lafayette made the &quot;Hôtel de La Fayette&quot; in Paris&#x27;s &quot;rue de Bourbon&quot; an important meeting place for Americans there. Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met there every Monday and dined in company with Lafayette&#x27;s family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and Jefferson in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to correct the injustices that Huguenots in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.

== French Revolution ==
=== Assembly of Notables and Estates-General ===

On 29 December 1786, King Louis XVI called an Assembly of Notables, in response to France&#x27;s fiscal crisis. The king appointed Lafayette to the body, which convened on 22 February 1787. In speeches, Lafayette decried those with connections at court who had profited from advance knowledge of government land purchases; he advocated reform. He called for a &quot;truly national assembly&quot;, which represented the whole of France. Instead, the king chose to summon an Estates General, to convene in 1789. Lafayette was elected as a representative of the nobility (the Second Estate) from Riom. The Estates General, traditionally, cast one vote for each of the three Estates: clergy, nobility, and commons, meaning the much larger commons was generally outvoted.

The Estates General convened on 5 May 1789; debate began on whether the delegates should vote by head or by Estate. If by Estate, then the nobility and clergy would be able to outvote the commons; if by head, then the larger Third Estate could dominate. Before the meeting, as a member of the &quot;Committee of Thirty&quot;, Lafayette agitated for voting by head, rather than estate. He could not get a majority of his own Estate to agree, but the clergy was willing to join with the commons, and on 17 May, the group declared itself the National Assembly. The loyalist response was to lock out the group, including Lafayette, while those who had not supported the Assembly met inside. This action led to the Tennis Court Oath, where the excluded members swore not to separate until a constitution was established. The Assembly continued to meet, and on 11 July 1789, Lafayette presented a draft of the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; to the Assembly, written by himself in consultation with Jefferson. The next day, after the dismissal of Finance Minister Jacques Necker (who was seen as a reformer), lawyer Camille Desmoulins assembled between 700 and 1000 armed insurgents. The king had the royal army under the duc de Broglie surround Paris. On 14 July, the fortress known as the Bastille was stormed by the insurgents.

=== National Guard, Versailles, and Day of Daggers ===

On 15 July, Lafayette was acclaimed commander-in-chief of the Parisian National Guard, an armed force established to maintain order under the control of the Assembly military service as well as policing, traffic control, sanitization, lighting, among other matters of local administration. Lafayette proposed the name and the symbol of the group: a blue, white, and red cockade. This combined the red and blue colors of the city of Paris with the royal white, and originated the French tricolor. He faced a difficult task as head of the Guard; the king and many loyalists considered him and his supporters to be little better than revolutionaries, whereas many commoners felt that he was helping the king to keep power via this position.

The National Assembly approved the Declaration on 26 August, but the king rejected it on 2 October. Three days later, a Parisian crowd led by women fishmongers marched to Versailles in response to the scarcity of bread. Members of the National Guard followed the march, with Lafayette reluctantly leading them. At Versailles, the king accepted the Assembly&#x27;s votes on the Declaration, but refused requests to go to Paris, and the crowd broke into the palace at dawn. Lafayette took the royal family onto the palace balcony and attempted to restore order, but the crowd insisted that the king and his family move to Paris and the Tuileries Palace. The king came onto the balcony and the crowd started chanting &quot;Vive le Roi!&quot; Marie Antoinette then appeared with her children, but she was told to send the children back in. She returned alone and people shouted to shoot her, but she stood her ground and no one opened fire. Lafayette kissed her hand, leading to cheers from the crowd.

Lafayette would later initiate an investigation within the National Assembly on the now declared October Days, which led to the production of the Procédure Criminelle by Jean-Baptiste-Charles Chabroud, a 688-page document accumulating evidence and analysis on the exact events and procedures of the March on Versailles, hoping to condemn those inciting the mob (in his mind being Mirabeau and the Duc d&#x27;Orléans). However, the National Assembly thought condemning two significant revolutionaries would hurt the progress and public reception of the revolutionary administration.

As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette attempted to maintain order and steer a middle ground, even as the radicals gained increasing influence. He and Paris&#x27; mayor Jean Sylvain Bailly instituted a political club on 12 May 1790 called the Society of 1789 whose intention was to provide balance to the influence of the radical Jacobins.

Lafayette helped organize and lead the assembly at the Fête de la Fédération on 14 July 1790 where he, alongside the National Guard and the king, took the civic oath on the Champs de Mars on 14 July 1790 vowing to &quot;be ever faithful to the nation, to the law, and to the king; to support with our utmost power the constitution decreed by the National Assembly, and accepted by the king&quot;. In the eyes of the royalist factions, Lafayette took a large risk holding a largely undisciplined group at the Champs de Mars in fear for the safety of the king, whereas for Jacobins this solidified in their eyes Lafayette&#x27;s royalist tendencies and an encouragement of the common people&#x27;s support of the monarchy.

Lafayette continued to work for order in the coming months. He and part of the National Guard left the Tuileries on 28 February 1791 to handle a conflict in Vincennes, and hundreds of armed nobles arrived at the Tuileries to defend the king while he was gone. However, there were rumors that these nobles had come to take the king away and place him at the head of a counter-revolution. Lafayette quickly returned to the Tuileries and disarmed the nobles after a brief standoff. The event came to be known as the Day of Daggers, and it boosted Lafayette&#x27;s popularity with the French people for his quick actions to protect the king. Nonetheless, the royal family were increasingly prisoners in their palace. The National Guard disobeyed Lafayette on 18 April and prevented the king from leaving for Saint-Cloud where he planned to attend Mass.

=== Flight to Varennes ===
A plot known as the Flight to Varennes almost enabled the king to escape from France on 20 June 1791. The king and queen had escaped from the Tuileries Palace, essentially under the watch of Lafayette and the National Guard. Being notified of their escape, Lafayette sent the Guard out in a multitude of directions in order to retrieve the escapee monarchs. Five days later, Lafayette and the National Guard led the royal carriage back into Paris amidst a crowding mob calling for the heads of the monarchs as well as Lafayette. Lafayette had been responsible for the royal family&#x27;s custody as leader of the National Guard, and he was thus blamed by extremists such as Georges Danton, declaring in a speech directed towards Lafayette &quot;You swore that the king would not leave. Either you sold out your country or you are stupid for having made a promise for a person whom you could not trust… France can be free without you.&quot; He was further called a traitor to the people by Maximilien Robespierre. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaged his reputation in the eyes of the public, and strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals in opposition to him. He continued to urge the constitutional rule of law, but he was drowned out by the mob and its leaders.

=== Champs de Mars massacre ===
Lafayette&#x27;s public standing continued to decline through the latter half of 1791. The radical Cordeliers organized an event at the Champ de Mars on 17 July to gather signatures on a petition to the National Assembly that it either abolish the monarchy or allow its fate to be decided in a referendum. The assembled crowd was estimated to be anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 people. The protesters, finding two men hiding under an altar at the event, accused of being either spies or of potentially planting explosives, eventually hung the men from lampposts and placed their heads on the ends of pikes. Lafayette rode into the Champ de Mars at the head of his troops to restore order, but they were met with the throwing of stones from the crowd. Indeed, an assassination attempt was made on Lafayette, however the gunman&#x27;s pistol misfired at close range. The soldiers began to first fire above the crowd in order to intimidate and disperse them, which only led to retaliation and eventually the death of two volunteer chasseurs. The National Guard was ordered to fire on the crowd, wounding and killing an unknown number of people. Accounts from those close to Lafayette claim that around ten citizens were killed in the event, whereas other accounts propose fifty-four, and the sensational newspaper publisher Jean-Paul Marat claimed over four hundred bodies had been disposed of into the river later that night.

Martial law was declared, and the leaders of the mob fled and went into hiding, such as Danton and Marat. Lafayette&#x27;s reputation among many political clubs decreased dramatically, especially with articles in the press, such as the &quot;Révolutions de Paris&quot; describing the event at the Champ de Mars as &quot;Men, Women, and Children were massacred on the altar of the nation on the Field of the Federation&quot;. Immediately after the massacre, a crowd of rioters attacked Lafayette&#x27;s home and attempted to harm his wife. The Assembly finalized a constitution in September, and Lafayette resigned from the National Guard in early October, with a semblance of constitutional law restored.

=== Conflict and exile ===
Lafayette returned to his home province of Auvergne in October 1791. France declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792, and preparations to invade the Austrian Netherlands (today&#x27;s Belgium) began. Lafayette, who had been promoted to Lieutenant General on 30 June 1791, received command of one of the three armies, the Army of the Centre, based at Metz, on 14 December 1791. Lafayette did his best to mold inductees and National Guardsmen into a cohesive fighting force, but found that many of his troops were Jacobin sympathizers and hated their superior officers. On 23 April 1792, Robespierre demanded that Lafayette step down. This emotion was common in the army, as demonstrated after the Battle of Marquain, when the routed French troops dragged their commander Théobald Dillon to Lille, where he was torn to pieces by the mob. One of the army commanders, Rochambeau, resigned. Lafayette, along with the third commander, Nicolas Luckner, asked the Assembly to begin peace talks, concerned at what might happen if the troops saw another battle.

In June 1792, Lafayette criticized the growing influence of the radicals through a letter to the Assembly from his field post, and ended his letter by calling for their parties to be &quot;closed down by force&quot;. He misjudged his timing, for the radicals were in full control in Paris. Lafayette went there, and on 28 June delivered a fiery speech before the Assembly denouncing the Jacobins and other radical groups. He was instead accused of deserting his troops. Lafayette called for volunteers to counteract the Jacobins; when only a few people showed up, he understood the public mood and hastily left Paris. Robespierre called him a traitor and the mob burned him in effigy. He was transferred to command of the Army of the North on 12 July 1792.

The 25 July Brunswick Manifesto, which warned that Paris would be destroyed by the Austrians and Prussians if the king was harmed, led to the downfall of Lafayette, and of the royal family. A mob attacked the Tuileries on 10 August, and the king and queen were imprisoned at the Assembly, then taken to the Temple. The Assembly abolished the monarchy – the king and queen would be beheaded in the coming months. On 14 August, the minister of justice, Danton, put out a warrant for Lafayette&#x27;s arrest. Hoping to travel to the United States, Lafayette entered the Austrian Netherlands.

== Prisoner ==


Lafayette was taken prisoner by the Austrians near Rochefort when another former French officer, Jean-Xavier Bureau de Pusy, asked for rights of transit through Austrian territory on behalf of a group of French officers. This was initially granted, as it had been for others fleeing France, but was revoked when the famous Lafayette was recognized. Frederick William II of Prussia, Austria&#x27;s ally against France, had once received Lafayette, but that was before the French Revolution – the king now saw him as a dangerous fomenter of rebellion, to be interned to prevent him from overthrowing other monarchies.

Lafayette was held at Nivelles, then transferred to Luxembourg where a coalition military tribunal declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until a restored French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal&#x27;s order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party traveled to the Prussian fortress-city of Wesel, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the central citadel from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the Rhineland, King Frederick William II transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at Magdeburg, where they remained an entire year, from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.

Frederick William decided that he could gain little by continuing to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, and that there were easier pickings for his army in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).

Lafayette, when captured, had tried to use the American citizenship he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that his status as a French officer took precedence over any claim to American citizenship. Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through Congress and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayette&#x27;s privileges in their captivity.

A more direct means of aiding the former general was an escape attempt sponsored by Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s sister-in-law Angelica Schuyler Church and her husband John Barker Church, a British Member of Parliament who had served in the Continental Army. They hired as agent a young Hanoverian physician, Justus Erich Bollmann, who acquired an assistant, a South Carolinian medical student named Francis Kinloch Huger. This was the son of Benjamin Huger, whom Lafayette had stayed with upon his first arrival in America. With their help, Lafayette managed to escape from an escorted carriage drive in the countryside outside Olmütz, but he lost his way and was recaptured.

Once Adrienne was released from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.

Through diplomacy, the press, and personal appeals, Lafayette&#x27;s sympathizers on both sides of the Atlantic made their influence felt, most importantly on the post-Reign of Terror French government. A young, victorious general, Napoleon Bonaparte, negotiated the release of the state prisoners at Olmütz, as a result of the Treaty of Campo Formio. Lafayette&#x27;s captivity of over five years thus came to an end. The Lafayette family and their comrades in captivity left Olmütz under Austrian escort early on the morning of 19 September 1797, crossed the Bohemian-Saxon border north of Prague, and were officially turned over to the American consul in Hamburg on 4 October.

From Hamburg, Lafayette sent a note of thanks to General Bonaparte. The French government, the Directory, was unwilling to have Lafayette return unless he swore allegiance, which he was not willing to do, as he believed it had come to power by unconstitutional means. As revenge, it had his remaining properties sold, leaving him a pauper. The family, soon joined by Georges Washington, who had returned from America, recuperated on a property near Hamburg belonging to Adrienne&#x27;s aunt. Due to conflict between the United States and France, Lafayette could not go to America as he had hoped, making him a man without a country.

Adrienne was able to go to Paris, and attempted to secure her husband&#x27;s repatriation, flattering Bonaparte, who had returned to France after more victories. After Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Lafayette used the confusion caused by the change of regime to slip into France with a passport in the name of &quot;Motier&quot;. Bonaparte expressed rage, but Adrienne was convinced he was simply posing, and proposed to him that Lafayette would pledge his support, then would retire from public life to a property she had reclaimed, La Grange. France&#x27;s new ruler allowed Lafayette to remain, though originally without citizenship and subject to summary arrest if he engaged in politics, with the promise of eventual restoration of civil rights. Lafayette remained quietly at La Grange, and when Bonaparte held a memorial service in Paris for Washington, who had died in December 1799, Lafayette, though he had expected to be asked to deliver the eulogy, was not invited, nor was his name mentioned.

== Retreat from politics ==
Bonaparte restored Lafayette&#x27;s citizenship on 1 March 1800 and he was able to recover some of his properties. After Marengo, the First Consul offered him the post of French minister to the United States, but Lafayette declined, saying he was too attached to America to act in relation to it as a foreign envoy. In 1802, he was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. A seat in the Senate and the Legion of Honour were repeatedly offered by Bonaparte, but Lafayette again declined – though stating that he would gladly have accepted the honours from a democratic government.

In 1804, Bonaparte was crowned the Emperor Napoleon after a plebiscite in which Lafayette did not participate. The retired general remained relatively quiet, although he made Bastille Day addresses. After the Louisiana Purchase, President Jefferson asked him if he would be interested in the governorship, but Lafayette declined, citing personal problems and his desire to work for liberty in France.

During a trip to Auvergne in 1807, Adrienne became ill, suffering from complications stemming from her time in prison. She became delirious but recovered enough on Christmas Eve to gather the family around her bed and to say to Lafayette: &quot;Je suis toute à vous&quot; (&quot;I am all yours&quot;). She died the next day. In the years after her death, Lafayette mostly remained quietly at La Grange, as Napoleon&#x27;s power in Europe waxed and then waned. Many influential people and members of the public visited him, especially Americans. He wrote many letters, especially to Jefferson, and exchanged gifts as he had once done with Washington.

== Bourbon restoration ==
In 1814, the coalition that opposed Napoleon invaded France and restored the monarchy; the comte de Provence (brother of the executed Louis XVI) took the throne as Louis XVIII. Lafayette was received by the new king, but the staunch republican opposed the new, highly restrictive franchise for the Chamber of Deputies that granted the vote to only in a nation of 25 million. Lafayette did not stand for election in 1814, remaining at La Grange.

There was discontent in France among demobilized soldiers and others. Napoleon had been exiled only as far as Elba, an island in the Tuscan archipelago; seeing an opportunity, he landed at Cannes on March 1815 with a few hundred followers. Frenchmen flocked to his banner, and he took Paris later that month, causing Louis to flee to Ghent. Lafayette refused Napoleon&#x27;s call to serve in the new government, but accepted election to the new Chamber of Representatives under the Charter of 1815. There, after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, Lafayette called for his abdication. Responding to the emperor&#x27;s brother Lucien Bonaparte, Lafayette argued:

By what right do you dare accuse the nation of ... want of perseverance in the emperor&#x27;s interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia ... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, and in doing so we have to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.

On 22 June 1815, four days after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette arranged for the former emperor&#x27;s passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days on the island of Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.

Lafayette&#x27;s homes, both in Paris and at La Grange, were open to any Americans who wished to meet the hero of their Revolution, and to many other people besides. Among those whom Irish novelist Sydney, Lady Morgan met at table during her month-long stay at La Grange in 1818 were the Dutch painter Ary Scheffer and the historian Augustin Thierry, who sat alongside American tourists. Others who visited included philosopher Jeremy Bentham, American scholar George Ticknor, and writer Fanny Wright.

During the first decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was involved in the various Charbonnier plots, and agreed to go to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis&#x27; government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.

== Grand tour of the United States ==

President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette to visit the United States in 1824, in part to celebrate the nation&#x27;s upcoming 50th anniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but Lafayette felt that having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic and booked passage on the merchant packet . Louis XVIII did not approve of the trip and had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see him off.

Lafayette arrived at New York on 15 August 1824, accompanied by his son Georges Washington and his secretary Auguste Levasseur. He was greeted by a group of Revolutionary War veterans who had fought alongside him many years before. New York erupted for four continuous days and nights of celebration. He then departed for what he thought would be a restful trip to Boston but instead found the route lined by cheering citizens, with welcomes organized in every town along the way. According to Unger, &quot;It was a mystical experience they would relate to their heirs through generations to come. Lafayette had materialized from a distant age, the last leader and hero at the nation&#x27;s defining moment. They knew they and the world would never see his kind again.&quot;

New York, Boston, and Philadelphia did their best to outdo one another in the celebrations honoring Lafayette. Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall) which might otherwise have been torn down, because they needed a location for a reception for him. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette&#x27;s visit set off a wave of construction – usually with him laying the cornerstone himself, in his capacity as mason. The arts benefited by his visit, as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original 13 states during a four-month visit, but the stay stretched to 16 months as he visited all 24 states.

The towns and cities that he visited gave him enthusiastic welcomes, including Fayetteville, North Carolina, the first city named in his honor. He visited the capital in Washington City, and was surprised by the simple clothing worn by President Monroe and the lack of any guards around the White House. He went to Mount Vernon in Virginia as he had 40 years before, this time viewing Washington&#x27;s grave. He was at Yorktown on 19 October 1824 for the anniversary of Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender, then journeyed to Monticello to meet with his old friend Jefferson – and Jefferson&#x27;s successor James Madison, who arrived unexpectedly. He had also dined with 89-year-old John Adams, the other living former president, at Peacefield, his home near Boston.

With the roads becoming impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City for the winter of 1824–1825 and thus was there for the climax of the hotly contested 1824 election in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives. On 9 February 1825, the House selected Secretary of State John Quincy Adams as president; that evening, runner-up General Andrew Jackson shook hands with Adams at the White House as Lafayette looked on.

In March 1825, Lafayette began to tour the southern and western states. The general pattern of the trip was that he would be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with him. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.

Lafayette visited General Jackson at his home The Hermitage in Tennessee. He was traveling up the Ohio River by steamboat when the vessel sank beneath him, and he was put in a lifeboat by his son and secretary, then taken to the Kentucky shore and rescued by another steamboat that was going in the other direction. Its captain insisted on turning around, however, and taking Lafayette to Louisville, Kentucky. From there, he went generally northeast, viewing Niagara Falls and taking the Erie Canal to Albany, considered a modern marvel. He laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument in Massachusetts in June 1825 after hearing an oration by Daniel Webster. He also took some soil from Bunker Hill to be sprinkled on his grave.

After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting all of the states. He met again with John Adams, then went back to New York and then to Brooklyn, where he laid the cornerstone for its public library. He celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House and departed the next day. He took gifts with him, besides the soil to be placed on his grave. Congress had voted him $200,000 (equal to $ today) in gratitude for his services to the country at President Monroe&#x27;s request, along with a large tract of public lands in Florida. He returned to France aboard a ship that was originally called the &quot;Susquehanna&quot; but was renamed the USS &quot;Brandywine&quot; in honor of the battle where he shed his blood for the United States.

== Revolution of 1830 ==

When Lafayette arrived in France, Louis XVIII had been dead about a year and Charles X was on the throne. As king, Charles intended to restore the absolute rule of the monarch, and his decrees had already prompted protest by the time Lafayette arrived. Lafayette was the most prominent of those who opposed the king. In the elections of 1827, the 70-year-old Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies again. Unhappy at the outcome, Charles dissolved the Chamber, and ordered a new election: Lafayette again won his seat.

Lafayette remained outspoken against Charles&#x27; restrictions on civil liberties and the newly introduced censorship of the press. He made fiery speeches in the Chamber, denouncing the new decrees and advocating American-style representative government. He hosted dinners at La Grange, for Americans, Frenchmen, and others; all came to hear his speeches on politics, freedom, rights, and liberty. He was popular enough that Charles felt he could not be safely arrested, but Charles&#x27; spies were thorough: one government agent noted &quot;his [Lafayette&#x27;s] seditious toasts ... in honor of American liberty&quot;.

On 25 July 1830, the king signed the Ordinances of Saint-Cloud, removing the franchise from the middle class and dissolving the Chamber of Deputies. The decrees were published the following day. On 27 July, Parisians erected barricades throughout the city, and riots erupted. In defiance, the Chamber continued to meet. When Lafayette, who was at La Grange, heard what was going on, he raced into the city, and was acclaimed as a leader of the revolution. When his fellow deputies were indecisive, Lafayette went to the barricades, and soon the royalist troops were routed. Fearful that the excesses of the 1789 revolution were about to be repeated, deputies made Lafayette head of a restored National Guard, and charged him with keeping order. The Chamber was willing to proclaim him as ruler, but he refused a grant of power he deemed unconstitutional. He also refused to deal with Charles, who abdicated on 2 August. Many young revolutionaries sought a republic, but Lafayette felt this would lead to civil war, and chose to offer the throne to the duc d&#x27;Orleans, Louis-Philippe, who had lived in America and had far more of a common touch than did Charles. Lafayette secured the agreement of Louis-Philippe, who accepted the throne, to various reforms. The general remained as commander of the National Guard. This did not last long – the brief concord at the king&#x27;s accession soon faded, and the conservative majority in the Chamber voted to abolish Lafayette&#x27;s National Guard post on 24 December 1830. Lafayette went back into retirement, expressing his willingness to do so.

== Final years and death ==

Lafayette grew increasingly disillusioned with Louis-Phillippe, who backtracked on reforms and denied his promises to make them. The retired general angrily broke with his king, a breach which widened when the government used force to suppress a strike in Lyon. Lafayette used his seat in the Chamber to promote liberal proposals, and his neighbors elected him mayor of the village of La Grange and to the council of the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Marne in 1831. The following year, he served as a pallbearer and spoke at the funeral of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque, another opponent of Louis-Phillippe. He pleaded for calm, but there were riots in the streets and a barricade was erected at the Place de la Bastille. The king forcefully crushed this June Rebellion, to Lafayette&#x27;s outrage. He returned to La Grange until the Chamber met in November 1832, when he condemned Louis-Phillippe for introducing censorship, as Charles X had.

Lafayette spoke publicly for the last time in the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1834. The next month, he collapsed at a funeral from pneumonia. He recovered, but the following May was wet, and he became bedridden after being caught in a thunderstorm. He died at age 76 on 20 May 1834 at 6 rue d&#x27;Anjou-Saint-Honoré in Paris (now 8 rue d&#x27;Anjou in the 8th arrondissement of Paris). He was buried next to his wife at the Picpus Cemetery under soil from Bunker Hill, which his son Georges Washington sprinkled upon him. King Louis-Philippe ordered a military funeral in order to keep the public from attending, and crowds formed to protest their exclusion.

In the United States, President Jackson ordered that Lafayette receive the same memorial honors that had been bestowed on Washington at his death in December 1799. Both Houses of Congress were draped in black bunting for 30 days, and members wore mourning badges. Congress urged Americans to follow similar mourning practices. Later that year, former president John Quincy Adams gave a eulogy of Lafayette that lasted three hours, calling him &quot;high on the list of the pure and disinterested benefactors of mankind&quot;.

== Beliefs ==
Lafayette was a firm believer in a constitutional monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France always had. His close relationships to American Founding Fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson gave him an opportunity to witness the implementation of a democratic system. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins detested the idea of a monarchy in France, which led the National Assembly to vote against it. This idea contributed to his fall from favour, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.

Lafayette was the author of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 and a staunch opponent of slavery. His work never specifically mentioned slavery, but he made his position clear on the controversial topic through letters addressed to friends and colleagues such as Washington and Jefferson. He proposed that slaves not be owned but rather work as free tenants on the land of plantation owners, and he bought three slave plantations in Cayenne in 1785 and 1786 to put his ideas into practice, ordering that none of the 70 slaves on the plantations to be bought or sold. He never freed his slaves, and when the French authorities confiscated his properties in 1795, the 63 remaining slaves on the three plantations were sold by colonial officials in Cayenne. He spent his lifetime as an abolitionist, proposing that slaves be emancipated slowly as he recognized the crucial role that slavery played in many economies. Lafayette hoped that his ideas would be adopted by Washington to free slaves in the United States and spread from there. Washington eventually began implementing those practices on his own plantation in Mount Vernon, but he continued to own slaves until the day he died. In a letter to Matthew Clarkson, the mayor of Philadelphia, Lafayette wrote, &quot;I would never have drawn my sword in the cause of America, if I could have conceived that thereby I was founding a land of Slavery.&quot;

== Assessment ==

Throughout his life, Lafayette was an exponent of the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment, especially on human rights and civic nationalism, and his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others on both sides of the Atlantic. His image in the United States was derived from his &quot;disinterestedness&quot; in fighting without pay for the freedom of a country that was not his own. Samuel Adams praised him for &quot;foregoing the pleasures of Enjoyment of domestick Life and exposing himself to the Hardship and Dangers&quot; of war when he fought &quot;in the glorious cause of freedom&quot;. This view was shared by many contemporaries, establishing an image of Lafayette seeking to advance the freedom of all mankind rather than the interests of just one nation. During the French Revolution, Americans viewed him as an advocate for American ideals, seeking to transport them from New World to Old. This was reinforced by his position as surrogate son and disciple of George Washington, who was deemed the Father of His Country and the embodiment of American ideals. Novelist James Fenimore Cooper befriended Lafayette during his time in Paris in the 1820s. He admired his patrician liberalism and eulogized him as a man who &quot;dedicated youth, person, and fortune to the principles of liberty.&quot;

Lafayette became an American icon in part because he was not associated with any particular region of the country; he was of foreign birth, did not live in America, and had fought in New England, the mid-Atlantic states, and the South, making him a unifying figure. His role in the French Revolution enhanced this popularity, as Americans saw him steering a middle course. Americans were naturally sympathetic to a republican cause, but also remembered Louis XVI as an early friend of the United States. When Lafayette fell from power in 1792, Americans tended to blame factionalism for the ouster of a man who was above such things in their eyes.

In 1824, Lafayette returned to the United States at a time when Americans were questioning the success of the republic in view of the disastrous economic Panic of 1819 and the sectional conflict resulting in the Missouri Compromise. Lafayette&#x27;s hosts considered him a judge of how successful independence had become. According to cultural historian Lloyd Kramer, Lafayette &quot;provided foreign confirmations of the self-image that shaped America&#x27;s national identity in the early nineteenth century and that has remained a dominant theme in the national ideology ever since: the belief that America&#x27;s Founding Fathers, institutions, and freedom created the most democratic, egalitarian, and prosperous society in the world&quot;.

Historian Gilbert Chinard wrote in 1936: &quot;Lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol so early in his life, and successive generations have so willingly accepted the myth, that any attempt to deprive the young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious.&quot; That legend has been used politically; the name and image of Lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 to gain popular support for America&#x27;s entry into World War I, culminating with Charles E. Stanton&#x27;s famous statement &quot;Lafayette, we are here&quot;. This occurred at some cost to Lafayette&#x27;s image in America; veterans returned from the front singing &quot;We&#x27;ve paid our debt to Lafayette, who the hell do we owe now?&quot; According to Anne C. Loveland, &quot;Lafayette no longer served as a national hero-symbol&quot; by the end of the war. In 2002, however, Congress voted to grant him honorary citizenship.

Lafayette&#x27;s reputation in France is more problematic. Thomas Gaines notes that the response to Lafayette&#x27;s death was far more muted in France than in America, and suggested that this may have been because Lafayette was the last surviving hero of America&#x27;s only revolution, whereas the changes in the French government had been far more chaotic. Lafayette&#x27;s roles created a more nuanced picture of him in French historiography, especially in the French Revolution. Nineteenth-century historian Jules Michelet describes him as a &quot;mediocre idol&quot;, lifted by the mob far beyond what his talents deserved. Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard and Alfred Fierro note Napoleon&#x27;s deathbed comment about Lafayette in their &quot;Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française&quot;; he stated that &quot;the king would still be sitting on his throne&quot; if Napoleon had Lafayette&#x27;s place during the French Revolution. They deemed Lafayette &quot;an empty-headed political dwarf&quot; and &quot;one of the people most responsible for the destruction of the French monarchy&quot;. Gaines disagreed and noted that liberal and Marxist historians have also dissented from that view. Lloyd Kramer related 57% of the French deemed Lafayette the figure from the Revolution whom they most admired, in a survey taken just before the Revolution&#x27;s bicentennial in 1989. Lafayette &quot;clearly had more French supporters in the early 1990s than he could muster in the early 1790s&quot;.

In the late 16th century, during the Dutch Revolt, Borsbeek was pillaged and destroyed several times. In 1746, the village was nearly wiped out during the War of the Austrian Succession. Borsbeek used to be an agricultural community. In the mid 20th century, it became a centre of horticulture and a residential town.

On 28 January 2022, the mayors of Borsbeek and Antwerp announced their intent to merge. This has been approved by both local governments and the small, densely populated town of Borsbeek became the 10th district of the city of Antwerp on 1 January 2025.

<text>Brasschaat () is a municipality located in Flanders, one of the three regions of Belgium, and in the Flemish province of Antwerp. The municipality only comprises the town of Brasschaat proper. In November 2006, Brasschaat won the LivCom-Award 2006 for the most livable municipality in the world.

==History==

===Origins===
The history of Brasschaat started with Celtic settlements. The Gallic tribe of the Belgae displaced them and were in turn conquered by the Romans, who built a major road in the area. After the Germanic invasions in the 3rd and 4th century, the whole region was Christianized. In the Middle Ages the little river Laar, flowing through the woods of the municipality, served as a natural bordermark between the Bishopric of Liège and the Bishopric of Cambrai.

===Middle Ages===
The first mention of &quot;Breesgata&quot;, sometimes also spelt &quot;Brexgata&quot;, dates from 1269. In 1482, a convent of nuns was founded here, traces of which can still be seen today. The village of Brasschaat belonged geographically to the Campine region, but politically and ecclesiastically was part of the Bishopric of Liège until 1569. At that time, the village had about 4,500 inhabitants and 383 horses. The end of the 16th century was particularly hard on the population. In the span of 25 years, the wars between Catholics and Protestants greatly reduced the population to 420 people and 59 horses. At the end of the plague pandemic that struck the community in 1610, only 26 families were left. The guild of Sint-Antonius, currently still the oldest local association, was founded in 1667.

===Modern times===
In 1823, Brasschaat became theoretically a municipality of its own, separate from Ekeren. It named its own mayor and municipal council the following year. Its independence would, however, be recognized only in 1830.

Because of its strategic position in the defence of the port of Antwerp, Brasschaat became an important military outpost during World War I. The Brasschaat fort, still visible today, was built in 1912. Between 1937 and 1939 the fortifications were expanded with additional bunkers and a large antitank ditch. Many of these old military buildings nowadays host colonies of bats.

In 1945, a school in Brasschaat run by Averbode Abbey was hit by a V-1 flying bomb, killing a monk and three priests.

The ancient &quot;Brexgata&quot; name is found in the designation of an international university association seated in Strasbourg (France). The name was chosen in homage to the municipality of Brasschaat; the organisation&#x27;s historical research project was initiated in this town in 1999.

==Folklore==
*The yearly &quot;Dorpsdag&quot; (&quot;village day&quot;) takes place on the first Sunday in September and features a procession commemorating the consecration of the main chapel in 1753.

==Sights==
*Brasschaat is known as a park town (&quot;gemeente der parken&quot;). This includes various woods and former shooting ranges. One of the best-known nature preservations around Brasschaat is &quot;De Inslag&quot;, which includes 149 ha of woods and pastures as well as the antitank ditch mentioned above.
*The &quot;De Mik&quot; castle, complete with drawbridge, is surrounded by English gardens and an arboretum.
*The Brasschaat area also houses a petting farm and an artillery museum.
*Brasschaat is also known for the &quot;Peerdsbos&quot;. This is a nature and recreation area. 
*Brasschaat is renowned in Belgium for its long high street lined with various shops, cafes and bars. The highly affluent reputation of Brasschaat is reflected in the street&#x27;s selection of expensive jewellers, designer clothing stores and fashionable bars and cafes.

<text>Edegem (, first mentioned as &quot;Buizegem&quot; in 1173) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality only comprises the town of Edegem proper. In 2021, Edegem had a total population of 22,244. The total area is 8.65 km². The old Sint-Antoniuskerk (church of Saint Anthony) is no longer open to the public. It is not sure when it was first built (some sources go back as far as the 16th century).

The absence of heavy industry makes Edegem a typical commuter town. Despite its location next to the metropolis of the city of Antwerp, Edegem is not fully urbanized.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==

* Sint-Antoniuskerk (Church of Saint Anthony)
The &quot;Sint-Antoniuskerk&quot; is a gothic church that was built between the 16th and 17th century.

* The Basilica of Our Lady of Lourdes
In 1884 a cave was built, after the cave present at the site of Our Lady of Lourdes, as a pilgrimage site. It became a very popular place of worship when truckloads of Christians came to visit the site.

When the population of Edegem grew in the beginning of the 20th century the &quot;Sint-Antoniuskerk&quot; in the center of town became too small. Thus plans were made to build an expansion. But when World War I broke out in 1914, the expansion was delayed. Afterwards the city council and the local religious institutions decided to build a new place of worship near the site of the &quot;Cave of Our Lady of Lourdes&quot; due to the large number of pilgrims visiting the site. The church was designed by architect Louis De Vooght to be a neo-Byzantine basilique. Construction began in September 1931 and ended in the first half of 1933.

In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI gave the Basilica of Edegem the official status of basilica minor.

* Kasteel Hof Ter Linden
&quot;Kasteel Hof Ter Linden&quot; is a Neoclassical villa in Edegem. 
Its origins can be traced back to the early 15th century. In 1587–88 the estate was destroyed by Irish soldiers, reconstruction began in 1607. In 1725 it became a &quot;Hof van Plaisantie&quot; (Court of Pleasures) and in 1770–1773 the current Neoclassical facade was built. An impressive alley of Lindentrees, planted in 1756, connects the castle with the &quot;Sint-Anoniuskerk&quot;.

In the 20th century the castle was inhabited by &quot;Baron and Baroness de Roest d&#x27;Alkmade&quot;.

==Notable people==
* Marie Gevers, novelist, born at Edegem, on 30 December 1883.
* Leo Tindemans, former prime minister of Belgium, diplomat, professor and chairman of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).
* Willy Vandersteen, creator of comic books (Spike and Suzy, Willy and Wanda...), died 28 August 1990.
* François-Xavier de Donnea, former Belgian defence minister, mayor of the City of Brussels, born at Edegem, on 29 April 1941.
* Christine Van Broeckhoven, molecular biologist and professor in Molecular genetics.
* Ilse Heylen, judoka and bronze medal winner at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.
* Hendrik Vervliet, historian
* Boris Daenen (Netsky), drum and bass DJ
* Jean Bourgain (1954-2018), mathematician and Fields Medal winner.

==Recreation facilities==

* Fort 5 is a fort in the community of Edegem. It was built between 1859–1864.
It is a compound of the &quot;Brialmontgordel&quot; or the National Redoubt, a series of forts built around the city of Antwerp as a defence against foreign armies. During the Franco–Prussian war of 1870 it became clear that, due to innovations in the weapons industry, German artillery was able to bombard the city of Paris from a distance as close as 7 km. So only four years after the construction of Fort 5 it became almost useless in the plan for the defence of Antwerp. In the 19th century the Brialmontgordel functioned as a prototype for the defense of large European cities. Today Fort 5 is open to the public and it functions as a recreational domain. It also houses all sorts of local organisations.

* Het Meihof is a playground in the community of Edegem.

The local authorities have made a recreational playground. In the playground there is a forest, a large skatepark, a basketball court and three bowls areas. There is also a restaurant with a terrace where they serve simple meals, and a bar. The old building was completely restored. All the toys in the playground were renewed. Now there is also a water playground and an adventure playground.

<text>Kapellen (, old spelling: &quot;Cappellen&quot;) is a municipality in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality lies in the Campine in the northern part of the province.

Kapellen consists only of the town of Kapellen proper. In 2021, Kapellen had a total population of 27,157. The total area is 37.11 km2. Kapellen consists out of multiple neighbourhoods, Kapellen Center, the eastern part of Putte, Kapellenbos, Hoogboom and Zilverenhoek. A number of neighbourhoods in Kapellen have a residential character and are characterized by their villaparcs, exclusive country houses, and beautiful castles. Many who flee the always busy town enjoy Kapellen&#x27;s peaceful nature.

The town&#x27;s football club is R. Cappellen F.C. and has played at the national level for many years.

== History ==
The communities that are now part of Kapellen date back to the 13th century. Hoogboom can be found as Hobonia on documents from 1267. Hoghescote, the current center can be seen 10 years after Hoogboom in Ertbrand, which has now become Putte. The Zilverenhoek neighborhood, only a part of Kapellen since 1983, first appeared in 1844 on a cadastral plan.

Since its origin Kapellen has been a part of lordship Ekeren. Since the 13th century, parts of the territory have regularly changed ownership. Eventually, in 1714 the entire lordship Ekeren came under the ownership of one family, one of the lords Salm-Salm. During the French occupation, Kapellen became, in 1795, part of the municipality Stabroek until it, eventually, in 1800, became its own municipality. Since then they have slowly been adding neighborhoods of Ekeren, Hoevenen and Stabroek to the territory of Kapellen. The current municipal borders have been determined since 1983 when the neighborhoods Hoogboom and Zilverenhoek from Ekeren became part of Kapellen.

In comparison to its worldly power, its spiritual power has had a less complex history. The parish of Hoghescote became part of the St. Bernard&#x27;s Abbey of Hemiksem. Until then the parish depended on the Saint-Lambertus church of Ekeren.

The church of Kapellen is the oldest building in the municipality. Until the 14th century a chapel sufficed to help the people who lived there. The church has been built up and renovated further throughout the ages. The chancel for example dates back to the 14th century while the Transept was built in the 16th century. During the 19th century, the tower and the interior of the church were renovated in with a neogothic look.

The further history of Kapellen is characterized by periods of growth and poverty. During the Fall of Antwerp Kapellen suffered greatly. All important buildings and 90% of all houses were destroyed. During the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce there was a short resurgence of the municipality until 1623, when the plague raged. The real resurgence had to wait until 1674 when the church was rebuilt.

All this abruptly ended with the start of World War I. The forced service for the German army and the Spanish flu caused many deaths. After the war, there was a brief recovery period until 1930, when a crisis fell over the municipality. Recovery had to wait until after World War II. The municipality Kapellen was freed on 4 October 1944 by the Canadian battalion Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal.

== Transport ==

=== Past ===
In 1759 a cobblestone road was built between Merksem and Kapellen. These days this (no longer cobblestone) road is known as the Kapelsesteenweg (on the territory of Ekeren and Brasschaat) or the Antwerpsesteenweg (on the territory of Kapellen). In 1853 the railroad Antwerp-Rotterdam was built. Thanks to this railroad the first steam powered train could run through Kapellen railway station in 1854. Because of the railroad connection many rich people from Antwerp decided to build villas in the municipality. The local railways reached Kapellen on 31 July 1927 and the tram was extended to the border of Putte on 1 December 1928. The level crossing of the tram and the railroad was there for just short period of time. On 1 March 1934 the railway connection between Hoevenen and Kapellen is opened and from 1 February 1938 forward trams between Antwerp and Putte rode through Hoevenen. (Line 72, between 1 September 1936 and 1 February 1938 no passenger trams rode between Kapellen and Putte). Since 31 August 1936 the tram from Merksem was limited to just before the railroad crossing (line 65). On 26 May 1967 the last tram rode through Kapellen, as line 65.

<text>Alexander Mikhailovich Prokhorov (born Alexander Michael Prochoroff, ; 11 July 1916 – 8 January 2002) was a Russian physicist and researcher on lasers and masers in the former Soviet Union for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 with Charles Hard Townes and Nikolay Basov.

==Early life==
Alexander Michael Prochoroff was born on 11 July 1916 at Russell Road, Peeramon, Queensland, Australia (now 322 Gadaloff Road, Butchers Creek, situated about 30 km from Atherton), to Mikhail Ivanovich Prokhorov and Maria Ivanovna (née Mikhailova), Russian revolutionaries who had emigrated from Russia to escape repression by the tsarist regime. As a child he attended Butchers Creek State School.

In 1923, after the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the family returned to Russia. In 1934, Prokhorov entered the Saint Petersburg State University to study physics. He was a member of the Komsomol from 1930 to 1944. Prokhorov graduated with honors in 1939 and moved to Moscow to work at the Lebedev Physical Institute, in the oscillations laboratory headed by academician N. D. Papaleksi. His research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere. At the onset of World War II, in June 1941, he joined the Red Army. Prokhorov fought in the infantry, was wounded twice in battles, and was awarded three medals, including the Medal For Courage in 1946. He was demobilized in 1944 and returned to the Lebedev Institute where, in 1946, he defended his Ph.D. thesis on &quot;Theory of Stabilization of Frequency of a Tube Oscillator in the Theory of a Small Parameter&quot;.

==Research==

In 1947, Prokhorov started working on coherent radiation emitted by electrons orbiting in a cyclic particle accelerator called a synchrotron. He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the microwave spectral range. His results became the basis of his habilitation on &quot;Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator&quot;, defended in 1951. By 1950, Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory. Around that time, he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations, and later on quantum electronics. The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three (non-degenerate) moments of inertia. The research was conducted both on experiment and theory. In 1954, Prokhorov became head of the laboratory. Together with Nikolay Basov he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such a device based on ammonia. They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952, but not published until 1954–1955.

In 1955, Prokhorov started his research in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). He focused on relaxation times of ions of the iron group elements in a lattice of aluminium oxide, but also investigated other, &quot;non-optical&quot;, topics, such as magnetic phase transitions in DPPH. In 1957, while studying ruby, a chromium-doped variation of aluminium oxide, he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser. As a new type of laser resonator, he proposed, in 1958, an &quot;open type&quot; cavity design, which is widely used today. In 1963, together with A. S. Selivanenko, he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions. For his pioneering work on lasers and masers, in 1964, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics shared with Nikolay Basov and Charles Hard Townes.

==Posts and awards==

In 1959, Prokhorov became a professor at Moscow State University – the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union; the same year, he was awarded the Lenin Prize. In 1960, he became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and elected Academician in 1966. In 1967, he was awarded his first Order of Lenin (he received five of them during life, in 1967, 1969, 1975, 1981 and 1986). In 1968, he became vice-director of the Lebedev Institute and in 1971 took the position of Head of Laboratory of another prestigious Soviet institution, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In the same year, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1983 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Between 1982 and 1998, Prokhorov served as acting director of the General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and after 1998 as honorary director. After his death in 2002, the institute was renamed the of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Prokhorov was a Member and one of the Honorary Presidents of the International Academy of Science, Munich and supported 1993 the foundation and development of the Russian Section of International Academy of Science, Moscow.

In 1969, Prokhorov became a Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest degree of distinction in the Soviet Union for achievements in national economy and culture. He received the second such award in 1986. Starting in 1969, he was the chief editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. He was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal, the highest distinction of the Optical Society of America (OSA), in 2000 and became an Honorary OSA Member in 2001. The same year, he was awarded the Demidov Prize.

He died on 8 January 2002 at Moscow and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Politics==
Prokhorov became a member of the Communist Party in 1950. In 1983, together with three other academicians – Andrey Tychonoff, Anatoly Dorodnitsyn and Georgy Skryabin – he signed the famous open letter called &quot;when they lose honor and conscience&quot; (Когда теряют честь и совесть), denouncing Andrey Sakharov&#x27;s article in the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.

==Family==

Both of Prokhorov&#x27;s parents died during World War II. Prokhorov married geographer Galina Shelepina in 1941, and they had a son, Kiril, born in 1945. Following his father, Kiril Prokhorov became a physicist in the field of optics and is currently leading a laser-related laboratory at the A. M. Prokhorov General Physics Institute.

<doc id="156091" wikidata="Q808489" url="?curid=156091" title="Barney Ross">
<text>Barney Ross (born Dov-Ber &quot;Beryl&quot; David Rosofsky; December 23, 1909 – January 17, 1967) was an American professional boxer. Ross became a world champion in three weight divisions and was a decorated veteran of World War II. In his time, he was known as the Pride of the Ghetto.

==Early life==
Dov-Ber (or Beryl) Rosofsky was born in New York City to Isidore &quot;Itchik&quot; Rosofsky and Sarah Epstein Rosofsky. His father was a Talmudic scholar who had emigrated to America from his native Brest-Litovsk after barely surviving a pogrom. The family then moved from New York to Chicago. Isidore became a rabbi and owner of a small vegetable shop in Chicago&#x27;s Maxwell Street neighborhood, a vibrant Jewish ghetto akin to the New York&#x27;s Lower East Side of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. Dov-Ber was being raised to follow in his footsteps.

The young Rasofsky grew up on Chicago&#x27;s mean streets, ultimately ignoring his father&#x27;s desire for him to become a rabbi and his admonition that Jews do not resort to violence. Let the &quot;goyim&quot; be the fighters, Ross later recalled being told by his father. The trombeniks, the murderers—we are the scholars. Ross&#x27;s ambition in life was to become a Jewish teacher and a Talmudic scholar, but his life was changed forever when his father was shot dead resisting a robbery at his small grocery. Prostrate from grief, his mother Sarah suffered a nervous breakdown and his younger siblings—Ida, Sam and George—were placed in an orphanage or farmed out to other members of the extended family. Dov was left to his own devices at the age of 14.

As recounted in &quot;Barney Ross: The Life of a Jewish Fighter&quot;, by Ross biographer Douglas Century, in the wake of the tragedy, Dov became vindictive towards everything and turned his back on the orthodox religion of his father. He began running around with local toughs (including another wayward Jewish ghetto kid, the future Jack Ruby), developing into a street brawler, thief and money runner; he was even employed by Al Capone. Dov&#x27;s goal was to earn enough money to buy a home so that he could reunite his family. He saw boxing as that vehicle and began training with his friend Ruby.

==Boxing career==

After winning amateur bouts, Dov would pawn the awards—like watches—and set the money aside for his family. There is speculation that Capone bought up tickets to his early fights, knowing some of that money would be funneled to Dov. Plagued by his father&#x27;s death and feeling an obligation not to sully his name, Dov Rosofsky took the new name &quot;Barney Ross.&quot; The name change was also part of a larger trend by Jews to assimilate in the U.S. by taking American-sounding names. Strong, fast and possessed of a powerful will, Ross was soon an Intercity Golden Gloves and Chicago Golden Gloves champion in 1929 at the age of 19 and went on to dominate the lighter divisions as a pro.

At a time—the late 1920s and &#x27;30s—when rising Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was using propaganda to spread his virulently anti-Jewish philosophy, Ross was seen by American Jews as one of their greatest advocates. He represented the concept of Jews finally fighting back. Idolized and respected by all Americans, Ross showed that Jews could thrive in their new country. He made his stand against Hitler and Nazi Germany a public one. He knew that by winning boxing matches, he was displaying a new kind of strength for Jews. He also understood that Americans loved their sports heroes and if Jews wanted to be embraced in the U.S. they would have to assume such places in society. Though Ross had lost faith in religion, he openly embraced his role as a leader of his people.

Ross is unique in boxing as one of its few triple division champions—lightweight, light welterweight and welterweight. He was never knocked out in 81 fights and held his title against some of the best competition in the history of the sport. Ross defeated great Hall-of-Fame champions like Jimmy McLarnin and Tony Canzoneri in epic battles that drew crowds of more than 50,000.

His first paid fight was on September 1, 1929, when he beat Ramon Lugo by a decision in six rounds. After ten wins in a row, he lost for the first time, to Carlos García, on a decision in ten.

Over the next 35 bouts, his record was 32–1–2, including a win over former world champion Battling Battalino and one over Babe Ruth (not the baseball player). Another bout included former world champion Cameron Welter. On March 26, 1933, Ross had his first world title bout when he faced world lightweight and light welterweight champion and fellow three-division world champion Tony Canzoneri in Chicago. In one night, Ross became a two-division world champion when he beat Canzoneri by decision in ten rounds. Ross also campaigned heavily in the city of Chicago prior to the fight. After two more wins, including a knockout in six rounds over Johnny Farr, Ross and Canzoneri boxed again, with Ross winning again by decision, but this time in 15.

Ross was known as a smart fighter with great stamina. He retained his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933 and against Peter Nebo to begin 1934. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus Jimmy McLarnin. Ross vacated the light welterweight title to go after McLarnin&#x27;s welterweight title and won by a 15-round decision, his third world championship. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision and recovered the title. After that, Ross went back down to light welterweight and reclaimed his title with a 12-round decision over Bobby Pacho. After beating Klick and Henry Woods by decision to retain that title, he went back up in weight for his third and last fight with McLarnin; he recovered the welterweight title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, over that stretch were against Garcia and against Izzy Jannazzo, on points in 15 rounds.

In his last fight, Ross defended his title on May 31, 1938, against fellow three-division world champion Henry Armstrong, who beat him by a decision in 15. Although Armstrong pounded Ross inexorably and his trainers begged him to let them stop the fight, Ross refused to stop or go down. Barney Ross had never been knocked out in his career and was determined to leave the ring on his feet. Some boxing experts view Ross&#x27;s performance against Armstrong as one of the most courageous in history. Some believe that Ross&#x27;s will to survive every tough fight on his feet had to do with his understanding of his symbolic importance to Jews. That is, Jews would not only fight back, but they would not go down.

Ross retired with a record of 72 wins, 4 losses, 3 draws and two no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 2–0–0), with 22 wins by knockout. He was ranked #21 on &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;″s list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years.

==World War II==
In retirement in his early thirties, Ross enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in April 1942 to fight in World War II. The Marines wanted to keep him stateside and use his celebrity status to boost morale. Most of the athletes of the era, like heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, had ceremonial roles in the military, but Ross insisted on fighting for his country.

Before he was to go overseas, Ross physically assaulted a non-commissioned officer who had made an anti-Semitic remark. He was to be court martialed at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. The other board members wanted to throw the book at Ross, but Captain Berthol E. Davis, who was also Jewish and knew of Ross&#x27;s achievements, convinced the rest of the board to allow Ross to go overseas and avoid punishment. So, he was sent to the Pacific theater.

He served with B Company, 1st Battalion, 8th Marines during the Battle of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific. One night, he and three other comrades were trapped under enemy fire. All four were wounded; Ross was the only one able to fight. Ross gathered his comrades&#x27; rifles and grenades and single-handedly fought nearly two dozen Japanese soldiers over an entire night, killing them all by morning. Two of the Marines died, but he carried the third on his shoulders to safety; the other man weighed 230 lb (104 kg) compared to Ross&#x27; 140 lb (64 kg).

Ross was awarded America&#x27;s third highest military honor, the Silver Star, as well as a Presidential Citation. As one of America&#x27;s greatest &quot;celebrity&quot; war heroes, he was honored by President Roosevelt in a Rose Garden ceremony. He was also awarded the Edward J. Neil Trophy as &quot;the outstanding boxer of 1942&quot; by the Boxing Writers Association of New York.

During his time in Guadalcanal, Ross began a lifelong friendship with the Catholic priest Frederic Gehring, a wartime chaplain who wrote regular correspondences for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine. Gehring considered Ross a national treasure who defied logic when it came to bravery and the defense of principle. Ross was the only person on Guadacanal capable of playing the temperamental pipe organ kept there. On Christmas Eve, before he and his fellow Marines were to go into battle, Gehring asked Ross to learn &quot;Silent Night&quot; and other Christmas songs for the troops. After Ross had played them, Gehring asked him to play a Jewish song. Ross played &quot;My Yiddishe Momma,&quot; about a child&#x27;s love for his self-sacrificing mother. Many of the Marines knew the melody of the song from Ross&#x27;s boxing days, when it was played when he entered the ring. When the Marines heard Ross play the song, newspaper reports say, they were all in tears.

==Drug addiction and recovery==
During his recovery at the hospital from his wounds suffered at Guadalcanal, Ross developed a dependency on the morphine he was administered for pain. Back in the states, the morphine was replaced with street heroin. His drug habit became so severe that he would sometimes spend $500 a day on the drug. Ross went to a recovery center and overcame his addiction. He gave lectures to high school students about the dangers of drug addiction. His struggle against morphine addiction is the subject of the 1957 film &quot;Monkey on My Back&quot;.

==Final days==
Ross spent his last days using his celebrity status in promotional work for casinos and other businesses. He remained with his second wife, Cathy Howlett, although they never had children. He was happy he reached the two goals he had set: reunite his family and become a world champion in boxing. He wrote an autobiography titled &quot;No Man Stands Alone&quot;.

In Sport Life&#x27;s July 1951 edition, the author pointed out to readers to be aware of tricksters impersonating sport personalities to gain gifts and freebies. The magazine closed the article by highlighting how Ross had walked into a restaurant, where a faker was impersonating Jackie &quot;Kid&quot; Berg and was surrounded by admirers. &quot;So you&#x27;re Jackie Kid Berg?&quot; the inwardly boiling Ross inquired as he approached the 200 pounder. &quot;Sure&quot; the faker responded. Ross then threw a right hand punch and flattened the phony. &quot;If you were really Jackie Kid Berg, you could have easily taken that punch without going down!&quot;

He also remained loyal to his friend Jack Ruby and testified as a character witness on Ruby&#x27;s behalf at his trial for killing Lee Harvey Oswald, who was under arrest for the shooting death of Dallas patrolman, J.D. Tippit.

Ross died in his hometown Chicago of throat cancer at the age of 57.

His relatives include Yuri Rasovsky, Solomon Rosowsky and Baruch Leib Rosowsky.

==Honors==
Ross was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, the World Boxing Hall of Fame, the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. He was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in the Class of 2006.

The Aleph Zadik Aleph chapter located in Chicago&#x27;s south suburbs (primarily in Flossmoor, Homewood, and Olympia Fields), is named in his honor.

<doc id="156093" wikidata="Q193052" url="?curid=156093" title="Pau Gasol">
<text>Pau Gasol Sáez (, ; born July 6, 1980) is a Spanish former professional basketball player. He was a six-time NBA All-Star and a four-time All-NBA team selection, twice on the second team and twice on the third team. Gasol won two NBA championships, both with the Los Angeles Lakers back-to-back in 2009 and 2010. He was the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2002 with the Memphis Grizzlies, being the first non-American player to have won that award. He is regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time and is also considered as one of the greatest European players of all time. He is the older brother of former NBA player Marc Gasol.

Gasol was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the third overall pick in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft, but his rights were traded to the Vancouver Grizzlies. He holds the Grizzlies&#x27; franchise record for free throws made and attempted. Following more than six seasons with Memphis, Gasol played for the Los Angeles Lakers (2008–2014), the Chicago Bulls (2014–2016), the San Antonio Spurs (2016–2019), and the Milwaukee Bucks (2019).

Internationally, Gasol has won a FIBA World Cup title, three EuroBasket titles, two Olympic silver medals, and an Olympic bronze medal with the Spanish national basketball team. Gasol was named MVP of the 2006 FIBA World Cup, and MVP of the 2009 and 2015 FIBA EuroBasket. Pau Gasol shares (with Krešimir Ćosić) the record for most EuroBasket MVP awards, with two each. Gasol is also the all-time leading scorer in the EuroBasket.

In 2021, he became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In 2023, it was announced that Gasol would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Gasol was born in Barcelona. Both of his parents played basketball in organized leagues. His father Agustí, a nurse administrator, stood , and his mother Marisa, a medical doctor, was . When Gasol was born, his family was living in Cornellà, although he was born in Barcelona, at Sant Pau Hospital, where both of his parents worked. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to a city close to Barcelona, Sant Boi de Llobregat, where he spent the remainder of his childhood. Gasol was interested in football, but loved basketball. The first sport he played was actually rugby, before switching to basketball. He is described as &quot;a family boy and the perfect student, a tad shy, and a bit of a joker.&quot;

He originally did not want to make sports his career. On the day that Magic Johnson announced his HIV-positive status in 1991, the 11-year-old Gasol, who had heard the news in school, decided that he wanted to be a doctor and find a cure for AIDS. He enrolled in medical school at the University of Barcelona in 1998, but left after one year as his basketball career at FC Barcelona advanced.

==Professional career==

===Barcelona (1998–2001)===
Gasol began playing basketball as a center with his school team, Llor, and eventually signed with Cornellà. When he was sixteen, he began playing for FC Barcelona&#x27;s junior team. With Spain&#x27;s national under-18 team, he won both the 1998 Albert Schweitzer Tournament and the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. Gasol made his debut on January 17, 1999, with the senior team of FC Barcelona and played just 25 total minutes in the Spanish ACB League&#x27;s 1998–99 season, and averaged 13.7 minutes per game in the ACB the next year. However, in his final season in the ACB, Gasol averaged 12.4 points and 5.8 rebounds in 24.7 minutes per game. FC Barcelona was victorious in the Spanish National Cup&#x27;s 2001 Final&#x27;s championship game, and Gasol was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. After entering the NBA draft, Gasol was selected third overall in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, who traded his draft rights to the Vancouver Grizzlies in exchange for Shareef Abdur-Rahim and the Grizzlies&#x27; 27th pick in the draft Jamaal Tinsley.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2001–2008)===

==== 2001–2005: Rookie of the Year and first playoff appearances ====

In his first season with the Grizzlies, Gasol became the first foreign player to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. He averaged 17.6 points and 8.9 rebounds per game, and was also the only team member to play in all 82 games that season. Gasol led the team in scoring (19.0 points per game) in his second year with the Grizzlies, and for the second year in a row, played in all 82 games. Gasol missed the first game of his career, during his third year, with a foot injury on April 5, 2004, which snapped his string of 240 consecutive games played. He grabbed the 1,500th rebound of his career on November 12, 2003, against the Orlando Magic and scored his 3,000th career point on October 31, 2003, against the Boston Celtics. Despite having 22 points in Game 4 against the San Antonio Spurs, the highest by a Memphis players in the playoffs, his team was eliminated in the first round, not winning a single game against San Antonio. This was both the Grizzlies and Gasol&#x27;s first trip to the NBA Playoffs. He scored 31 points and blocked four shots on January 11, 2005, against the Indiana Pacers to earn 5,000 points and 500 blocks in his career, becoming the 10th fastest player to reach 5,000 points/500 blocks since 1973–74. He also helped his team make it to the playoffs for the second time in his career, but they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Phoenix Suns.

==== 2005–2008: First All-Star appearance and franchise records ====

In his fifth year with the Grizzlies, he became the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading rebounder on March 24 against the New York Knicks when he grabbed his 3,072nd rebound in a Grizzlies uniform. He made 29 consecutive free throw attempts from January 24 to 28, tying the second best mark in Grizzlies history, including two straight games going 12–12 from the line, tying the best single-game mark in franchise history. Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to the playoffs for the third time in his and his team&#x27;s history. Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.

On February 9, 2006, making his first appearance, Gasol was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve center for the Western Conference. At the time, he was one of four players ranked among Western Conference forwards in the top ten in points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots. He was the first Spanish basketball player as well as the first Grizzlies player to ever make it to the All-Star Game.

Gasol missed the first 23 games of the 2006–07 NBA season due to a broken foot suffered near the end of Spain&#x27;s semifinal win over Argentina in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. He would go on to be named Most Valuable Player of the tournament, which Spain won. He had a season-high 34 points (most by a Grizzly that season), and eight rebounds and tied a career-high and franchise record with eight blocks on January 29 against the Sacramento Kings, and surpassed Shareef Abdur-Rahim as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in free throw attempts on January 31 against the Dallas Mavericks. He became the all-time franchise leader in field goals made on February 6 against the Houston Rockets, and became the all-time franchise leader in minutes played on February 7 at Dallas. He surpassed Shareef Abdur-Rahim (7,801 points) as the Grizzlies&#x27; all-time leading scorer on March 7, 2007, against the Toronto Raptors (7,809 points at the time). On January 24, 2007, Gasol recorded his second career triple-double against the hosting Utah Jazz, garnering 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists. He also registered 2 blocks and one steal.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (2008–2014) ===

==== 2008–2011: Back-to-back championships and All-NBA appearances ====

On February 1, 2008, Memphis traded Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers along with a 2010 second round draft pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol (Pau&#x27;s younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first round draft picks. There has been some controversy surrounding the trade. Chris Wallace denied in an ESPN article that he had been ordered by owner Michael Heisley to make the Grizzlies more attractive to a potential buyer. Wallace said, &quot;No one put pressure on me to do this, and Michael Heisley has actually been reluctant to move Pau.&quot; He also said that they had been &quot;trolling&quot; the waters for a while and dealt with a number of teams. He selected the Lakers deal because &quot;it didn&#x27;t get any better than this.&quot; When Gasol departed the Grizzlies, he held twelve franchise records, including games played, minutes played, field goals made, free throws made and attempted, offensive, defensive, and total rebounds, blocked shots, turnovers, and points. Per game statistics, he leads Memphis in defensive and total rebounds along with blocked shots.

After being traded to the Lakers, Gasol lived in Redondo Beach, across the street from the shoreline. On February 5, Gasol made his first Lakers appearance in a game against the New Jersey Nets, during which he scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Nets. On March 14, Gasol sprained his ankle in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, stepping on the foot of teammate Vladimir Radmanović in the first quarter. Gasol was expected to miss the remaining three games of the Lakers&#x27; road trip after x-rays came up negative. Gasol returned to the starting lineup on April 2 against the Portland Trail Blazers and played nearly thirty-two minutes, registering 10 points, six rebounds and seven assists. He admitted to feeling limited with the swelling in his ankle still present. Gasol helped the Lakers finish the regular season with the best record in the Western Conference (57–25), with him in the starting lineup the Lakers went 22–5. Kobe Bryant has also stated that playing with Gasol clicked from the start.
In the Lakers&#x27; opening game of the playoffs, he contributed 36 points, 16 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 blocked shots. When the Lakers swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, it was Gasol&#x27;s first trip to the second round in four tries. His previous team, the Grizzlies, failed to reach the playoffs for the second year in a row. He contributed 17 points and 13 rebounds in Game 6 against the Utah Jazz to help the Lakers advance to the conference finals. On May 31, he recorded a career high 19 rebounds in a series-clinching win against the San Antonio Spurs, and he became the first Spaniard to reach the NBA Finals. Gasol scored 14.7 points per game on .532 shooting in the 2008 Finals against the Boston Celtics, which was below his scoring average of 18.9 during the regular season, However, he led the Lakers in rebounding with 10.2 per game throughout the championship series, up from his regular-season average of 8.4. Los Angeles lost in six games against Boston in the Finals, including a 131–92 loss in Game 6. In the Playoffs, Gasol was the second leading Laker in points (16.9), rebounds (9.3) and assists per game (4.0). He was the leader in blocks per game (1.90) and was tied with Lamar Odom with the most postseason double-doubles (10).

On January 2, 2009, in a win against the Utah Jazz, Gasol scored his 10,000th career point. Gasol earned his second All-Star appearance as a reserve for the Western Conference squad during the 2008–09 NBA season, his first as a Laker. He was also named Western Conference Player of the Month after helping the Lakers to an 11–2 record for the month of February that included road wins over Boston and Cleveland. He finished the regular season with averages of 18.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1 block per game. Gasol then won his first NBA championship ring when the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 Finals.

On December 24, 2009, Gasol signed a 3-year extension with the Lakers worth $64.7 million. Gasol earned his third All-Star appearance as a reserve for the Western Conference and finished the regular season with averages of 18.3 points, 11.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.7 blocks. In Game 6 of the first round, Gasol grabbed 18 rebounds and his last-second putback eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the conference semifinals against the Utah Jazz, he averaged 23.5 points and 14.5 rebounds, and finally in the conference finals against the Phoenix Suns, he averaged 19.7 points with 7.2 rebounds. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, Gasol scored 19 points, (6–16 FGM-A, 7–13 FTM-A) grabbed 18 rebounds and recorded two blocks as the Lakers repeated as champions. He averaged 18.6 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game in the series, on a 47.8% field goal percentage. In 2010, he was chosen as the 15th-smartest athlete in sports by &quot;Sporting News&quot;.

Challenged by Lakers&#x27; coach Phil Jackson to be more assertive while Bryant recovered from offseason knee surgery, Gasol started the season&#x27;s first week averaging 25.3 points on 52.5 percent shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and five assists per game as the Lakers started 3–0. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week. He earned his third straight All-Star selection and his season averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds were nearly identical to what he had put up as a Laker the previous three seasons. Pau&#x27;s play also merited him All-NBA second team honors for the first time in his career. In the playoffs, Gasol only averaged 13 points on 42% shooting over 10 games, and the Lakers were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Gasol had the worst post season performance of his career. Lakers Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Magic Johnson cited Gasol as a possible trade option for the Lakers to acquire Magic center Dwight Howard. Gasol ignored the false reports about his relationship status with his girlfriend as the cause of his poor performance and has accepted the criticism of his play as valid.

==== 2011–2014: Failed trade and final years with Lakers ====
During the 2011–12 NBA season, Gasol and teammate Lamar Odom were subjected to trade rumors involving former New Orleans Hornets guard Chris Paul. After the trade fell through, Gasol vowed that it would not affect the way he played. Odom, on the other hand, was angry at the Lakers and was traded to the 2010–11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks for a future first round pick. After Lakers co-captain Derek Fisher was traded in March 2012, Gasol joined Bryant as co-captains of the team. He won the 2011–12 seasonlong NBA Community Assist Award.
After a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season, the Lakers replaced head coach Mike Brown with Mike D&#x27;Antoni. Gasol was struggling after seven games under D&#x27;Antoni, averaging 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting 38.8 percent, and he was benched in the fourth quarter in multiple games. The team had difficulties getting Gasol involved in D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s offense, which historically had not had post players playing forward. Gasol ranked only 27th in the league in post-up points with 2.7 per game, down from prior seasons when he was fifth in 2010–11 and ninth in 2011–12. On November 18, 2012, in a win against the Houston Rockets, Gasol scored his 15,000th career point. Bothered by tendinitis in both knees since training camp, Gasol sat out eight games in December before returning to the starting lineup. Later, he was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, but continued playing. General manager Mitch Kupchak told Lakers season-ticket holders the team needed Gasol to be more involved. On January 7, 2013, Gasol received a blow to the face from Denver&#x27;s JaVale McGee in the fourth quarter of a 112–105 loss. He suffered a concussion, forcing him to miss the next five games. In his first game back, he came off the bench after having started his first 345 games with the Lakers. In the next game, he returned to the starting lineup and scored 25 points against Toronto, only his second 20-point game of the season. However, in the next game on January 21, D&#x27;Antoni moved Gasol to a reserve role and started Earl Clark, a change the coach considered permanent. On February 5 against the Brooklyn Nets, Gasol tore the plantar fascia of his right foot. Gasol had tweaked the fascia in the first half, but played through the soreness until he felt it pop when he tried to block a shot by Brook Lopez towards the end of the game. He returned over six weeks later on March 22 after missing 20 games, with D&#x27;Antoni returning him to the starting lineup over Clark. After a two-game adjustment period, Gasol&#x27;s play was solid, and Bryant insisted that Gasol receive the ball in the post. D&#x27;Antoni stated that Gasol had played well since January, and attributed the forward&#x27;s earlier struggles to injuries and the team&#x27;s evolving offensive system. &quot;I have a lot more confidence in him now, and he&#x27;s playing great&quot;, D&#x27;Antoni said. He finished the season with career lows in points (13.7) and field-goal percentage (.466), and his rebounds (8.6) were his lowest since his first season with Los Angeles. He was limited to a career-low 49 games. However, he had three triple-doubles in his last seven games including the playoffs.

Gasol was owed $19.3 million in 2013–14 in the final year of his contract, which cost the Lakers around $50 million including luxury taxes. He became a free agent after the season.

===Chicago Bulls (2014–2016)===

On July 18, 2014, Gasol signed with the Chicago Bulls. He said after he was introduced: &quot;It was a gut feeling. I thought Chicago was going to be the best fit for me. It&#x27;s a great challenge, but I&#x27;m driven by challenge. I look forward to it.&quot;

On January 1, 2015, Gasol recorded a career-high 9 blocks, along with 17 points and 9 rebounds, in the 106–101 win over the Denver Nuggets. Ten days later, he scored a career-high 46 points on 17-of-30 shooting in a 95–87 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On April 9, 2015, he recorded a league-best 51st double-double of the season with 16 points and 15 rebounds in an 89–78 win over the Miami Heat. He recorded his 54th double-double of the season in the regular season finale on April 15 against the Atlanta Hawks to finish as the league-leader in double-doubles in 2014–15.

On December 5, 2015, Gasol became the 116th player to reach 1,000 regular-season games. He had 13 points and 11 rebounds against the Charlotte Hornets for his ninth double-double of the season.

He finished the game with 19 points and 17 rebounds, as the Bulls were defeated by the Miami Heat 89–84. On February 9, Gasol was named as Jimmy Butler&#x27;s replacement on the 2016 Eastern Conference All-Star squad. On February 27, he recorded his eighth career triple-double and first as a Bull with 22 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists in a 103–95 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. At 35 years old, he became the oldest player to record a triple-double since Kobe Bryant did so at 36 years old in 2014. On March 7, he recorded his second triple-double of the season with 12 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists in a 100–90 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming just the fourth player 35 years or older with multiple triple-doubles in a season, joining Jason Kidd, Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce. On April 2, in a loss to the Detroit Pistons, he became the 38th NBA player to reach 10,000 career rebounds. He also became the 36th with 10,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.

===San Antonio Spurs (2016–2019)===
On July 14, 2016, Gasol signed with the San Antonio Spurs. On November 11, 2016, he had season highs with 21 points and six assists in a 96–86 win over the Detroit Pistons. On January 19, 2017, he was ruled out indefinitely after breaking his left ring finger during pregame warmups earlier that night. He underwent surgery the following day to repair a fracture of his left fourth metacarpal. On February 24, 2017, in a 105–97 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Gasol had 17 points and 11 rebounds off the bench in his return from a 15-game absence because of the finger injury. On April 12, 2017, Gasol scored 13 points to reach 20,000 career points in a 101–97 regular-season finale loss against the Utah Jazz, becoming the second European player to reach the mark after Dirk Nowitzki.

On July 24, 2017, Gasol re-signed with the Spurs. On December 20, 2017, he had 20 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 93–91 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 23, 2017, he recorded his 10th career triple-double with 14 points, 11 rebounds and a season-high 10 assists in a 108–99 win over the Sacramento Kings. On December 26, 2017, in a 109–97 win over the Brooklyn Nets, Gasol collected his 10,817th rebound, moving him past Jack Sikma for 30th in league history. On January 26, 2018, in a 97–78 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, Gasol became the 34th player in NBA history to play 40,000 career minutes. On March 25, 2018, he had 22 points on 10-of-15 shooting and grabbed 13 rebounds in a 106–103 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.

After appearing in the first nine games of the 2018–19 season, Gasol missed the next 26 games with a stress fracture in his right foot. On March 1, 2019, he was released by the Spurs in a buyout agreement.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2019)===
On March 3, 2019, Gasol signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. He played in three games for the Bucks. On March 23, it was reported that the Bucks expected Gasol to miss the next month due to a left ankle injury. Gasol&#x27;s injury ended his season. He was unable to play in the playoffs and had surgery on his injured foot on May 9, 2019.

=== Return to Barcelona (2021) ===
On July 25, 2019, Gasol signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On November 20, he was waived by the Trail Blazers without having played in a game for the team.

On February 23, 2021, Gasol returned to Spain to play in Liga ACB club FC Barcelona. He won the 2020–21 ACB championship with Barcelona and helped the team reach the final of the 2020–21 EuroLeague, where they lost to Anadolu Efes.

On October 5, 2021, Gasol announced his retirement from professional basketball.

==National team career==

Gasol&#x27;s first competition with the senior Spain national basketball team was the 2001 EuroBasket tournament, after having previously won the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship and 1999 FIBA Under-19 World Championship with the Spanish junior teams. Being considered, against his own will, the leader of the team, Gasol ended up with the bronze medal in the competition. Gasol was named the Spanish Sportsman of the Year, in 2001. After that, Gasol had a lot more success with the Spanish team, winning the 2006 FIBA World Championship and the 2009 and 2011 EuroBasket tournaments, being chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the first two; he also won silver medals at the 2003 and 2007 EuroBasket, and the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.

Gasol was also the highest-scoring player of the 2004 Summer Olympics, and Spain&#x27;s flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, replacing the injured Rafael Nadal. In 2014, Gasol was named to the All-tournament team of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. In the 2015 EuroBasket, Gasol was named the MVP of the competition, after some amazing performances, averaging 25.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game (he was the competition leader for points per game, and 4th in rebounds per game). During the knockout matches of the competition, Gasol inspired the Spanish side which was missing many of its stars like Ricky Rubio, Juan Carlos Navarro, Álex Abrines, and his brother Marc Gasol. Gasol scored 40 points in the semifinal against France, which was half of his team&#x27;s points. The 35-year-old player was also named the competition&#x27;s leader for blocked shots per game (2.3).

On September 7, 2017, in a game against Hungary, Gasol became FIBA EuroBasket&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, passing Tony Parker with 1,033 points. He ended up at 1,183 total points scored at the EuroBasket. He was named to the FIBA EuroBasket 2000–2020 Dream Team in 2020.

==Player profile==

Listed at , Gasol was athletic for his size, allowing him to play both the power forward and center positions, much like fellow European players Toni Kukoč and Dirk Nowitzki. He was a refined scorer in the post and midrange; his overall game was near-ambidextrous, making it difficult for opposing teams to defend. Gasol used a variety of midrange jumpers, hook shots, up-and-under moves, and shot fakes to score very efficiently. In addition, his foot speed relative to his size allowed him to run the fast break and finish effectively. He was also a skilled passer for a big man, earning 3.2 assists per game over his career. Defensively, he is an above-average shot blocker with a career average of 1.7 blocks per game. Kobe Bryant said of Gasol, &quot;You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a big [man] with his skill set in the history of the game.&quot;

Gasol recorded over 550 double-doubles in his NBA career. On April 2, 2016, he became the 36th player in NBA history to reach the 10,000-point/10,000-rebound mark. While Gasol became the 43rd player in NBA history to reach to the 20,000-point milestone, he is just the fourth with that many points, 10,000 rebounds, 3,500 assists and 1,500 blocks.

==Personal life==

Gasol remains strongly interested in medicine. He regularly visits Children&#x27;s Hospital of Los Angeles, a standard stop for athletes making charitable visits in the L.A. area, but does not limit his business to visiting young patients. On one visit, he asked a group of doctors well-informed questions about their treatment of children with scoliosis. In April 2010, Gasol was scheduled to sit in on a spinal surgery, wearing surgical scrubs, with Dr. David Skaggs, the hospital&#x27;s chief of orthopedic surgery. Skaggs has said, &quot;We talk to him now almost like he is a surgical colleague.&quot; Gasol canceled his original plans to observe a surgery when he came down with a low-grade fever the day before the operation, not wishing to risk infecting anyone at the hospital. He was able to reschedule his observation for June 2010, witnessing Skaggs lead a team operating on a 13-year-old girl from Colorado with scoliosis.

Gasol has a broad range of intellectual and cultural interests. He has taught himself Italian and French to go along with his childhood languages of Catalan and Spanish plus English. While with the Lakers, he and Kobe Bryant spoke to one another during games in Spanish to keep opponents from knowing their plans. Gasol also regularly reads historical novels, plays French classical music on his keyboard, and attends concerts and operas; he is a friend of Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo, and often visits him backstage after performances.

Gasol married Catherine McDonnell in July 2019. He posted a photo of his wedding on his Instagram account. The couple&#x27;s daughter Elisabet Gianna Gasol was born on September 13, 2020. Elisabet&#x27;s middle name is a tribute to Bryant&#x27;s late daughter and Bryant&#x27;s widow Vanessa is her godmother. In December 2022, the couple announced the arrival of a son, Max.

His younger brother Marc, who is tall and weighs , also played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Marc was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers, 48th overall, in the 2007 NBA draft and his rights were traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, as part of the deal that sent Gasol to the Lakers. Their youngest brother, Adrià, played for Lausanne&#x27;s basketball team; his coach at Lausanne said, &quot;He&#x27;s built like Pau, with a mean streak like Marc&quot;, although he was not at the time considered a major basketball prospect. After returning to Spain for his final two years of high school basketball, Adrià enrolled at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in August 2012 and joined the UCLA basketball team as a walk on.

His parents moved to the Memphis suburb of Germantown, Tennessee, after he signed with the Grizzlies, and enrolled his younger brothers Marc and Adrià in Lausanne Collegiate School in Memphis. They planned to move to the Los Angeles area when Pau was traded to the Lakers, with Agustí accepting a job with a health-care company in that area; although the Grizzlies obtained the rights to Marc&#x27;s services as part of the trade, he was expected to re-sign with his Spanish team Akasvayu Girona. However, when Marc decided to sign with the Grizzlies, their parents chose to stay in Germantown. Agustí now works from home for the same company, while Marisa now volunteers at St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

==Work and social commitment==
In 2003, he was named a UNICEF ambassador, and since then has repeatedly taken part in different campaigns, traveling on several occasions África to participate in its projects there. In recognition of his commitment to solidarity endeavors, he received the &quot;Corazón de Oro&quot; (Gold Heart) in 2004, awarded by the Spanish Heart Foundation, and the 2010 Charitable Athlete Prize, given by the Fundación SOS. Gasol has worked in support of infant survival and for the rights of children in other African countries as well as in campaigns against malnutrition in the Horn of Africa. In addition, since his arrival in Memphis, he has worked with the Saint Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, which he visits every time he in the city where he lived at the start of his career.

In 2009, Gasol, along with several other NBA players, joined the &quot;Hoops for St. Jude&quot; charity program benefitting the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

In 2010, UNICEF&#x27;s Pau Project commenced in Ethiopia, to aid in the fight against infant malnutrition, which each year claims the lives of more than 2 million children, and for the right to an education. In December 2010 he took part, along with other NBA stars, in We Are Bigger Than Aids, a campaign against the HIV virus.

In 2012, the Professional Basketball Writers Association (PBWA) stated that Pau &quot;personifies everything that is good about NBA players and their charity projects, not only in their own communities but all over the world, working to help children achieve their goals and have the opportunities that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get otherwise.&quot; Thus, in April 2015, they gave him their Magic Johnson Award.

In September 2018, after the publication of his book &quot;Bajo el aro&quot; (Under the Hoop) Gasol said that in spite of not being a doctor, he tries to use his public profile to help others. That same month, he joined the campaign of Spain&#x27;s Fundación Atresmedia to bring families into schools.

In July 2019, he was named Global Champion for Nutrition and Zero Childhood Obesity by UNICEF Global.

===Gasol Foundation===
In 2013, along with his brother Marc, he established the , to help to promote community health and healthy living habits, especially by preventing and fighting childhood obesity. In November 2015, after having been named Global Impact Player by the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), which represents the NBA players, he created a t-shirt to help the Foundation&#x27;s work. In March 2017 they decided to move the Foundation&#x27;s headquarters from Barcelona to Sant Boi, where he was born. Along with his brother Marc Gasol, he has received the Special Recognition Prize from Estrategia NAOS for the work of the Gasol Foundation for fighting childhood obesity.

In September 2019, the Gasol Foundation presented the Estudio Pasos, a pioneering work in studying obesity levels in kids between 8 and 18 years of age, and which also threw light on the levels of physical inactivity among children and adolescents. At the press conference to present the study, Pau Gasol called for concrete action from governments, families and the food industry to end this problem.

===Defending equality in sports===
In May 2018, he published an open letter in The Players Tribune defending the role of women as coaches and specifically in favor of the candidacy of Becky Hammon as an NBA coach. He noted that in its 72 years of history there has never been a woman coach and advocated adopting new social norms to meet this changing period of equality and diversity.

===Membership in sporting associations and clubs===
From 2017 to 2020, he was vice president of the NBPA (National Basketball Players Association, of the NBA). He was the first player to participate in the executive committee of this association without previously having been in the NCAA.

Since June 2019, Pau Gasol has been a member of the Advisory Council of Spanish Sport (CADE), which is part of the Association of Spanish Sport (ADESP). In addition, he is Strategic Advisor and Global Ambassador for Barça in the United States. From this position he defends the values of sports and the proposals toward healthy living advocated by his Foundation.

==Etymology==
The name Gulbarga means &#x27;(City of) Flower Gardens&#x27; ultimately from the Persian words gul &#x27;flower&#x27; and bāgh &#x27;garden&#x27;.

Gulbarga was renamed as Kalaburagi in 2014 which stands for &#x27;Stony Land&#x27; in Kannada.

==History==

The history of Kalaburagi dates to the sixth century. The Rashtrakutas gained control over the region, but the Chalukyas regained their domain within a short period and reigned supreme for over 200 years. The Kalyani Kalachuris who succeeded them ruled until the 12th century. Around the end of the 12th century, the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hoysalas of Dwarasamadra destroyed the supremacy of the Chalukyas and Kalachuris of Kalyani. Around the same period, the Kakatiya kings of Warangal came into prominence and the present Kalaburagi and Raichur districts formed part of their domain. The Kakatiya power was subdued in 1308 AD and the entire Deccan, including the district of Kalaburagi, passed under the control of the Delhi Sultanate.

The revolt of the officers appointed from Delhi resulted in the founding of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347 CE by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, who chose Kalaburagi (Hasanabad) to be the capital. When the Bahmani Sultanate came to an end in 1527, the kingdom broke up into five independent Deccan sultanates, Bijapur, Bidar, Berar, Ahmednagar, and Golconda. The present Kalaburagi district came partly under the sultanate of Bidar and partly under the sultanate of Bijapur. The last of these sultanates, Golconda, finally fell to Aurangzeb in 1687.

With the conquest of the Deccan by Aurangzeb in the 17th century, Kalaburagi passed under the Mughal Empire. In the early part of the 18th century, with the decline of the Mughal Empire, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, one of Aurangzeb&#x27;s generals, formed the kingdom of Hyderabad, in which a major part of the Kalaburagi area was also included. In 1948, Hyderabad State became a part of the Indian Union, and in 1956, excluding two talukas which were annexed to Andhra Pradesh, Kalaburagi district became part of the new Mysore State through the States Reorganisation Act in 1956.

==Culture/Cityscape==
=== Art and architecture ===
The largest collection of Islamic art is seen at the domed ceiling and walls are adorned with paintings containing calligraphy designs and floral, flower and plants and geometric patterns inside the 14th-century tomb of Sufi saint Syed Shah Qhabulullah Husayni with natural colours. By religious restrictions, the artist was prohibited from depicting living beings in the interior of tomb, and his imagination was therefore employed either in inventing new designs for religious texts or in adding further delicacy and subtleness to the geometric and floral devices by making the drawings more and more intricate. A small tomb beside the said Sufi&#x27;s has an excellent work of painted flower plants on the ceiling. Another vacant Shore Gumbad outside the city has delicate designs on its domed ceiling is superb.

The walls and ceiling of the tomb of Sultan Firuz Shah Bahmani can be appreciated which, although monotone, represents faithfully the creepers and floral patterns, the numerous geometric devices and calligraphic styles. The most notable building, however, of this period is the Jama Masjid of Kalaburagi fort, built by a Persian architect named Rafi in 1367 during the reign of Bahmani King Mohammed Shah I.

The glory of the towns in north Karnataka waned with the decline of the Bahmani dynasty, although Barid Shahi and Adil Shahi Kings kept up its beauty during their chequered rule. It suffers from pollution through nickel and lead.

Royal patronage played an important role in the making of Islamic art, as it has in the arts of other cultures. From the 14th century onwards, especially in eastern lands, the books of art provide the best documentation of courtly patronage.

<doc id="156098" wikidata="Q489671" url="?curid=156098" title="Alan Partridge">
<text>Alan Gordon Partridge is an English comedy character portrayed by Steve Coogan. A parody of British television personalities, Partridge is a tactless and inept broadcaster with an inflated sense of celebrity. Since his debut in 1991, he has appeared in media including radio and television series, books, podcasts and film.

Partridge was created by Coogan and Armando Iannucci for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;On the Hour&quot;, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting. In 1992, Partridge hosted a spin-off spoof chat show, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;. &quot;On the Hour&quot; transferred to television as &quot;The Day Today&quot; in 1994, followed by &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; later that year. In 1997, the BBC broadcast &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, a sitcom written by Coogan, Iannucci and Peter Baynham about Partridge&#x27;s life in a roadside hotel working for a Norwich radio station. It earned two BAFTAs and was followed by a second series in 2002.

After a hiatus, Partridge returned in 2010 with a series of shorts, &quot;Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge&quot;, written with Rob and Neil Gibbons, who have cowritten every Partridge project since. Over the following years, Partridge expanded into other media, including the spoof memoir &quot;I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan&quot; (2011) and the feature film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; (2013). In 2019, Partridge returned to the BBC with &quot;This Time with Alan Partridge&quot;, a spoof of magazine shows such as &quot;The One Show&quot;, followed by an Audible podcast in 2020 and a touring show in 2022.

Coogan said Partridge began as a &quot;one-note&quot; character, but slowly became more complex and empathetic. While the writers use Partridge to satirise bigotry and privilege, they also aim to create empathy. Critics have praised Partridge&#x27;s complexity, realism and pathos. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called him a British national treasure and &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades&quot;. Partridge is credited with influencing cringe comedies such as &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;, &quot;Nighty Night&quot; and &quot;Peep Show&quot;. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Partridge was voted seventh in their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

==History==
=== 1991: &quot;On The Hour&quot; ===
Alan Partridge was created for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;On the Hour&quot;, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show&#x27;s hapless sports presenter. Developing &quot;On the Hour&quot;, the producer, Armando Iannucci, asked Steve Coogan to voice a generic sports reporter, with elements of Elton Welsby, Jim Rosenthal and John Motson. Coogan had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station while at university. Iannucci said they developed a backstory for the character &quot;within minutes&quot;. The name was inspired by the former &quot;Newsbeat&quot; presenter Frank Partridge. Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Richard Herring and Stewart Lee wrote much of the early Partridge material; Herring credits the creation to Coogan and Iannucci.
=== 1992–1995: &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; and &quot;The Day Today&quot; ===
Marber felt Partridge had potential for other projects, and encouraged Coogan to develop his character. Coogan performed as Partridge and other characters at the 1992 Edinburgh Fringe. In December 1992, BBC Radio 4 began broadcasting a six-episode spoof chat show, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;. The series saw Partridge irritate and offend his guests, and coined his catchphrase, &quot;Aha!&quot;.

In 1994, &quot;On the Hour&quot; transferred to television on BBC Two as &quot;The Day Today&quot;, in which Partridge reprised his role as sports reporter. Later that year, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; transferred to television. The series ends with Partridge accidentally shooting a guest. It was nominated for the 1995 BAFTA for Light Entertainment Performance. A Christmas special, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing Yule&quot;, followed in December 1995, in which Partridge attacks a BBC commissioning editor, ending his television career.

=== 1997–2002: &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; ===
In 1997, BBC Two broadcast a sitcom, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, written by Coogan, Iannucci and Peter Baynham. It follows Partridge after he has been left by his wife and dropped from the BBC. He lives in a roadside hotel outside Norwich, presents a graveyard slot on local radio, and desperately pitches ideas for new television shows. Iannucci said the writers aimed to create &quot;a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; won the 1998 BAFTA awards for Comedy Performance and Comedy Programme or Series.

In 1999, Partridge appeared on the BBC telethon &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, performing a medley of Kate Bush songs. BBC Two broadcast a second series of &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; in 2002, following Partridge&#x27;s life in a static caravan with his new Ukrainian girlfriend after recovering from a mental breakdown. The writers found the second series difficult to make, feeling it had been too long since the first and that expectations for sitcoms had changed.

=== 2003–2009: Hiatus and smaller roles ===
After &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, Coogan tired of Partridge and limited him to smaller roles, feeling he had become an &quot;albatross&quot;. In March 2003, the BBC broadcast a mockumentary, &quot;Anglian Lives: Alan Partridge&quot;, about Partridge&#x27;s life and career. Coogan performed as Partridge at the Royal Albert Hall in support of the Teenage Cancer Trust in 2004. In 2008, he performed a tour, Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other Less Successful Characters, featuring Partridge as a life coach.

Coogan returned to Partridge after pursuing other projects, such as his work with the director Michael Winterbottom on films such as &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002)&quot;.&quot; He said he did not want to say goodbye to Partridge, and that &quot;as long as I can do my other things, that, to me, is the perfect balance&quot;. In 2020, Coogan said that though he had once tired of Partridge, he had now become &quot;a battered, comfortable old leather jacket&quot;.

=== 2010: &quot;Mid Morning Matters&quot; ===
Partridge returned in 2010 in a series of YouTube shorts, &quot;Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge&quot;, as the host of a digital radio show with a new character, Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). The series was later broadcast by Sky Atlantic. Coogan wrote it with the brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions. The Gibbons brothers have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan &quot;invited us in, our sensibilities chimed ... I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again.&quot;

Coogan said they chose the web format because &quot;it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank.&quot; In his 2015 autobiography, Coogan wrote that he felt &quot;Mid Morning Matters&quot; was &quot;the purest, most mature and funniest incarnation of Partridge&quot;, which he credited to the Gibbons brothers.

=== 2011–2012: &quot;I, Partridge&quot; and TV specials ===
In 2011, a spoof autobiography, &quot;I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan&quot;, written by Coogan, Iannucci and the Gibbons brothers, was published by HarperCollins. An audiobook version recorded by Coogan as Partridge was also released. In the book, Partridge recounts his childhood and career, attempts to settle scores with people he feels have wronged him, and dispenses wisdom such as his assertion that Wikipedia has made university education &quot;all but pointless&quot;. Coogan appeared as Partridge to promote &quot;I, Partridge&quot; on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot; and BBC Radio 5 Live. It received positive reviews and became a bestseller.

On 25 June 2012, Partridge presented a one-hour Sky Atlantic special, &quot;Alan Partridge: Welcome to the Places of My Life&quot;, taking the viewer on a tour of Partridge&#x27;s home county, Norfolk. The programme earned Coogan the 2013 BAFTA for Best Male Performance in a Comedy Programme. It was followed the next week by &quot;Open Books with Martin Bryce&quot;, a mock literary programme discussing Partridge&#x27;s autobiography.

=== 2013: &quot;Alpha Papa&quot; ===
On 7 August 2013, a feature film, &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot;, was released in the UK. It was directed by Declan Lowney and co-produced by StudioCanal and Baby Cow Productions, with support from BBC Films and the BFI Film Fund. The film sees Partridge enlisted as a crisis negotiator during a siege at his radio station.

Filming began with an incomplete script, and Coogan and the Gibbons brothers rewrote much of it on the set. The rushed production was difficult; Coogan and Iannucci disagreed on the script, morale was low, and there were problems with casting and funding. In his memoir, Coogan wrote that it was the hardest he had ever worked and the loneliest he had ever felt; however, he was proud of the finished film. &quot;Alpha Papa&quot; was acclaimed and opened at number one at the box office in the UK and Ireland.

=== 2015–2019: &quot;Scissored Isle&quot; and &quot;This Time&quot; ===
In 2015, Coogan co-presented a special Christmas episode of the Channel 4 chat show &quot;TFI Friday&quot; as Partridge. In February 2016, Sky Atlantic broadcast a second series of &quot;Mid Morning Matters&quot;. &quot;Alan Partridge&#x27;s Scissored Isle&quot;, a mockumentary in which Partridge examines the British class divide, followed in May also starring Ben Rufus Green. A second book, &quot;Alan Partridge: Nomad&quot;, a travelogue in which Partridge recounts a journey across the UK, was published on 20 October.

In July 2017, Partridge appeared in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Inheritance Tracks&quot;, in which guests choose music to pass to future generations; he selected &quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)&quot; by Barry Mann and the theme from &quot;Grandstand&quot;. Iannucci guest-edited an October 2017 issue of &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, featuring a debate on Brexit between Partridge and Malcolm Tucker, a character from &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, another sitcom created by Iannucci. On 27 December, BBC Two broadcast a documentary about the history of Partridge, &quot;Alan Partridge: Why, When, Where, How and Whom?&quot;

Partridge returned to the BBC in February 2019 with a six-part series, &quot;This Time with Alan Partridge&quot;, a spoof current affairs programme in the style of &quot;The One Show&quot;. In the series, Partridge stands in after the regular host falls ill. Coogan felt it was the right time for Partridge to return as he might represent the views of Brexit voters. Neil Gibbons said the world of live television had changed since Partridge&#x27;s creation: &quot;If someone fluffed a line or got someone&#x27;s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.&quot; A second series was broadcast in 2021. 

In August 2019, after he was caught speeding, Coogan escaped a driving ban after arguing that a planned Alan Partridge series could not be filmed on public transport, as driving is part of Partridge&#x27;s character. The magistrates determined that it would cause “exceptional hardship&quot; on the production staff if the series were cancelled.

=== 2020–present: &quot;From the Oasthouse&quot; and &quot;Strategem&quot; ===
In September 2020, Audible launched an Alan Partridge podcast, &quot;From the Oasthouse&quot;. It sees Partridge discussing topics such as relationships, family and the culture wars. Coogan said the podcast format was liberating, with more opportunity for nuance and less need to create punchlines to unite the audience. The podcast was carefully scripted rather than improvised. Further series were released in September 2022 and October 2023.

In April 2022, Coogan began a UK Alan Partridge tour, &quot;Stratagem&quot;, in which Partridge gave a motivational talk and addressed topics such as identity politics and culture wars. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Brian Logan gave the show four out of five, praising its &quot;rich comedy of physical awkwardness&quot; and writing that Partridge was now &quot;at the centre of his own thriving multi-platform metaverse&quot;. He noted that though Coogan had once tired of Partridge, he now &quot;clearly takes pleasure in the performance&quot;. The &quot;Independent&quot; critic Louis Chilton gave it two out of five, finding its jokes obvious and dated and that Partridge did not work in a live format. 

In August 2022, Partridge joined the rock band Coldplay to perform the 1985 Kate Bush song &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; at Wembley Stadium, London. A third Partridge memoir, &quot;Big Beacon&quot;, covering his return to television and his experience restoring a lighthouse, was published on 12 October 2023. &quot;The Times&quot; gave it a positive review, praising its &quot;skilfully terrible writing&quot;. In January 2025, Coogan confirmed that filming was complete for a new BBC series, &quot;How Are You?&quot;, which has Partridge exploring mental health issues following a year in Saudi Arabia.

== Character ==

Alan Partridge is an incompetent and tactless television and radio presenter, with an inflated sense of importance and celebrity. He is socially inept and often offends his guests. According to the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, Partridge is &quot;utterly convinced of his own superiority, and bewildered by the world&#x27;s inability to recognise it&quot;. His need for public attention drives him to deceit, treachery and shameless self-promotion. In the &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing Yule&quot; Christmas special, he assaults a BBC boss and a paralysed man. Marber said Partridge&#x27;s fundamental characteristic is desperation, and described him as part of a British tradition of &quot;sad little man&quot; characters such as Captain Mainwaring, Basil Fawlty and David Brent.

Coogan said Partridge was originally a &quot;one-note, sketchy character&quot; and &quot;freak show&quot;, but slowly became refined as a dysfunctional alter ego. Whereas Coogan has affection for Partridge, he said Iannucci sees him as &quot;basically an idiot&quot;. As he aged, Coogan become comfortable revealing unattractive and dysfunctional parts of himself in Partridge. In his memoir, he wrote that he finds it irritating when people observe that he is sometimes similar, and wrote: &quot;I reply, &#x27;Well, yes. Of course I am.&#x27; They can&#x27;t quite believe this admission. &#x27;But he&#x27;s an idiot! Are you saying he&#x27;s part of you?&#x27; As patiently as possible, I&#x27;ll say, &#x27;&quot;Yes, because part of me is an idiot!&#x27;&quot;

Coogan credited Neil and Rob Gibbons for giving Partridge a more rounded personality in later incarnations, and said: &quot;The 21st-century Alan is a nicer man. He is more empathetic and less about mocking the fool. More Malvolio and less Frank Spencer.&quot; The Gibbons brothers felt that by the time of &quot;Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge&quot;, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he is more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saves him from misery. Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings he was &quot;the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime—he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum&quot;.

Baynham said that although Partridge is unpleasant, the writers of &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; tried to build empathy: &quot;You&#x27;re watching a man suffer but also at some level identifying with his pain.&quot; For &quot;Alpha Papa&quot;, Coogan wanted Partridge to be heroic and for the audience to sympathise with him while laughing at him: &quot;You know he&#x27;s done the wrong thing, but at least he&#x27;s got some humanity. It&#x27;s impossible to sustain 90 minutes of good drama without investing in the character.&quot; Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge&#x27;s assistant, Lynn, felt he was vulnerable and loveable, and a good person &quot;deep down&quot;.

=== Politics ===

Partridge holds right-wing views. He is a reader of the right-wing newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and supported Brexit in line with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; position. Coogan, who is left-wing, described Partridge as a Little Englander, with a &quot;myopic, slightly philistine mentality&quot;. Coogan felt the humour came from Partridge&#x27;s misjudgement, rather than in a celebration of bigotry: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to add to the sum total of human misery. I want to point out things where we can improve our behaviour, myself included.&quot; He aimed to use humour to hold privileged and powerful people accountable.

Earlier versions of Partridge were more bigoted, but the writers found there was more humour in having him attempt to be progressive. For example, in &quot;I, Partridge&quot;, he stresses his friendship with the gay television presenter Dale Winton. Coogan said Partridge was aware of political correctness: &quot;In the same way that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; is a bit PC—it wouldn&#x27;t be openly homophobic now—Alan is the same. He tries to be modern.&quot; 

=== Lifestyle ===
Partridge lives in Norwich in the East of England. Iannucci said the writers chose it as it is &quot;geographically just that little bit annoyingly too far from London, and has this weird kind of isolated feel that seemed right for Alan&quot;. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Partridge has &quot;parochial bad taste&quot;, and Coogan described him as &quot;on the wrong side of cool&quot;. He is a fan of James Bond films and Lexus cars. His talk show catchphrase, &quot;Aha!&quot;, comes from Abba, and he named his son Fernando and his talk show &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; after Abba songs.

In earlier incarnations, Partridge&#x27;s wardrobe included a blazer, badge and tie, driving gloves and &quot;too-short&quot; shorts, styles he describes as &quot;sports casual&quot; and &quot;imperial leisure&quot;. According to Iannucci, by the time of &quot;Alpha Papa&quot;, Partridge had &quot;evolved to the &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter circa 2005 stage&quot;, with sports jackets and a foppish fringe. Coogan said that the rise of postmodernism had made it difficult to find clothes for Partridge, as &quot;everything we had once seen as square or distasteful was now being worn by hipsters ... The waters of what was uncool became so muddied that it was difficult to find anything looked bad and not just ironic. It even made me question if Alan was still relevant.&quot; As Coogan aged, the makeup he wore in earlier performances became unnecessary.

==Legacy==
&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described Alan Partridge as a national treasure and a cherished part of British comedy, alongside characters such as Basil Fawlty and Mr. Bean&quot;. According to &quot;Variety, &quot;in Britain &quot;Alan Partridge is a full-on phenomenon, a multiplatform fictional celebrity whose catchphrases, mangled metaphors and social ineptitude are the stuff of legend and good ratings&quot;. Though Partridge is less known outside Britain, Adam McKay, the director of the 2004 comedy &quot;&quot;, said he is well known among American comedians including Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Jack Black: &quot;Everyone watching those [Partridge] DVDs had the same reaction. How did I not know about this guy?&quot; &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote that &quot;before there was Ron Burgundy for the Yanks, there was Alan Partridge for the Brits&quot;.

Brian Logan wrote in the &quot;Guardian&quot; that though Partridge was created as a satire of the &quot;asinine fluency of broadcaster-speak&quot; of the time, his development as a character study gave him a timeless quality. Another &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist, John Crace, wrote: &quot;By rights, Alan Partridge should have been dead as a character years ago, the last drops of humour long since wrung out ... but Steve Coogan keeps finding ways to make him feel fresh.&quot; The &quot;Independent&quot; wrote that Partridge was a &quot;disarming creation&quot; whom the audience root for despite his flaws. 

In the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis wrote that audiences find Partridge funny partly because they recognise themselves in him, and Edmund Gordon called Partridge &quot;a magnificent comic creation: a monster of egotism and tastelessness&quot;. According to Gordon, Partridge allows progressive audiences to laugh at politically incorrect humour as &quot;every loathsome comment is sold to us not as a gag, but as a gaffe&quot;. Writing that Partridge &quot;channels the worst excesses of the privileged white man who considers himself nonetheless a victim&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; journalist Daniel Curtis saw Partridge as a precursor to post-truth politicians such as Nigel Farage and Donald Trump.

&quot;Mandatory&quot; wrote that Partridge was &quot;a fascinatingly layered and fully realised creation of years of storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick—he feels like a living, breathing person, but a living, breathing person that you want to strangle&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers.&quot;

In 2014, the &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as &quot;one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades&quot;. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Partridge was voted seventh in their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In a 2017 poll of over 100 comedians, Partridge was voted best TV comedy character and Coogan best male comedy actor, and a scene from &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; in which Partridge goes to the home of an obsessive fan was voted best comedy scene. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; the 52nd-greatest sitcom, writing that it had taken Partridge &quot;from a parody of celebrity-presenter smarm to one of the greatest Britcom characters ever&quot;. In 2022, the &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Michael Hogan selected Partridge as Coogan&#x27;s greatest TV role, writing that he had &quot;painstakingly fleshed him out from a catchphrase-spouting caricature to a layered creation of subtle pathos [and] one of our most enduring and beloved comic characters&quot;. In 2024, the &quot;Guardian&quot; named &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing Yule&quot; one of the greatest Christmas TV specials.

=== Influence ===
The &quot;Telegraph&quot; credited Partridge with influencing cringe comedies such as &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;, &quot;Nighty Night&quot; and &quot;Peep Show&quot;. According to &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, he has so influenced British culture that &quot;Partridgisms&quot; have become everyday vernacular. &quot;Monkey Tennis&quot;, one of his desperate television proposals, has become shorthand for absurd television concepts. Another, &quot;Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank&quot;, was used by the hostel booking site Hostelworld as the basis of a 2015 television advert with the boxer Chris Eubank. In 2020, Coogan said that many of Partridge&#x27;s inane ideas had since become real programmes, making satire more difficult. 

Partridge has become associated with the city of Norwich. An art exhibition inspired by Partridge opened in Norwich in July 2015. In September 2020, an unofficial statue of Partridge created by sculptors in the film industry was temporarily erected outside the Forum in Norwich; Partridge&#x27;s official Twitter account released a statement endorsing the statue. In October 2021, a fan convention at the Mercure Norwich Hotel was attended by more than 250 people. &quot;Accidental Partridge&quot;, an unofficial Twitter account which collects quotes reminiscent of Partridge&#x27;s speech from real media figures, had attracted 144,000 followers by May 2014. In August 2024, &quot;Lynn Faces&quot;, a play inspired by Partridge&#x27;s assistant, Lynn, opened at the New Diorama Theatre in London.

<doc id="156101" wikidata="Q727477" url="?curid=156101" title="S-Video">
<text>S-Video (also known as separate video, Y/C, and erroneously Super-Video) is an analog video signal format that carries standard-definition video, typically at 525 lines or 625 lines. It encodes video luma and chrominance on two separate channels, achieving higher image quality than composite video which encodes all video information on one channel. It also eliminates several types of visual defects such as dot crawl which commonly occur with composite video. Although it is improved over composite video, S-Video has lower color resolution than component video, which is encoded over three channels.

The Atari 800 was the first to introduce separate Chroma/Luma output in late 1979. However, S-Video was not widely adopted until JVC&#x27;s introduction of the S-VHS (Super-VHS) format in 1987, which is why it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;Super-Video&quot;. Before the shift towards digital video the S-video format was widely used by consumers, but it was rarely used in professional studios where YPbPr or component was generally preferred.

==Background==

Standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast, each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images.

The image is originally captured in RGB form and then processed into three signals known as YPbPr. The first of these signals is called Y, which is created from all three original signals based on a formula that produces an overall brightness of the image, or &quot;luma&quot;. This signal closely matches a traditional black and white television signal and the Y/C method of encoding was key to offering backward compatibility. Once the Y signal is produced, it is subtracted from the blue signal to produce Pb and from the red signal to produce Pr. To recover the original RGB information for display, the signals are mixed with the Y to produce the original blue and red, and then the sum of those is mixed with the Y to recover the green.

A signal with three components is no easier to broadcast than the original three-signal RGB, so additional processing is required. The first step is to combine the Pb and Pr to form the C signal, for chrominance. The phase and amplitude of the signal represent the two original signals. This signal is then bandwidth-limited to comply with requirements for broadcasting. The resulting Y and C signals are mixed together to produce composite video. To play back composite video, the Y and C signals must be separated, and this is difficult to do without adding artifacts.

Each of these steps is subject to deliberate or unavoidable loss of quality. To retain that quality in the final image, it is desirable to eliminate as many of the encoding/decoding steps as possible. S-Video is an approach to this problem. It eliminates the final mixing of C with Y and subsequent separation at playback time.

==Signal==
The S-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs, termed Y and C. Y is the &quot;luma&quot; signal, which carries the &quot;luminance&quot; – or black-and-white – of the picture, including synchronization pulses. Y also carries horizontal and vertical sync pulses in the same way as a composite video signal. C is the &quot;chroma&quot; signal, which carries the &quot;chrominance&quot; – or coloring-in – of the picture. This signal contains two color-difference components.

In composite video, the signals co-exist on different frequencies. To achieve this, the luminance signal must be low-pass filtered, dulling the image. As S-Video maintains the two as separate signals, such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary, although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video.

Carrying the color information as one signal means that the color has to be encoded in some way, typically in accord with NTSC, PAL, or SECAM, depending on the applicable local standard.

Compared with component video, which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into Cb/Pb and Cr/Pr, the color resolution of S-Video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of either (NTSC) or (PAL). This difference is meaningless on home videotape systems, as the chrominance is already severely constrained by both VHS and Betamax.

==Physical connectors==
===Atari 800===

The Atari 800 introduced separate Chroma/Luma output in late 1979. The signals were put on pin 1 and 5 of a 5-pin 180-degree DIN connector socket. Atari did not sell a monitor for its 8-bit computer line, however.

===Commodore 64===

The Commodore 64 released in 1982 (with the exception of the earliest revisions using a 5-pin video port) also offers separate chroma and luma signals using a different connector. Although Commodore Business Machines did not use the term &quot;S-Video&quot; as the standard did not formally exist until 1987, a simple adapter connects the computer&#x27;s LCA (luma-chroma-audio) 8-pin DIN socket to a S-Video display, or an S-Video device to the Commodore 1702 monitor&#x27;s LCA jacks.

===4-pin mini-DIN===

The four-pin mini-DIN connector is the most common of several S-Video connector types. The same mini-DIN connector is used in the Apple Desktop Bus for Macintosh computers. Apple Desktop Bus cables can be used for S-Video in a pinch. Other connector variants include seven-pin locking &quot;dub&quot; connectors used on many professional S-VHS machines, and dual Y and C BNC connectors, often used for S-Video patch panels. Early Y/C video monitors often used phono (RCA connector) that were switchable between Y/C and composite video input. Though the connectors are different, the Y/C signals for all types are compatible.

The mini-DIN pins, being weak, sometimes bend. This can result in the loss of color or other corruption (or loss) in the signal. A bent pin can be forced back into shape, but this carries the risk of the pin breaking off.

These plugs are usually made to be plug-compatible with S-video, and include optional features, such as component video using an adapter. They are not necessarily S-video, although they can be operated in that mode.

===7-pin mini-DIN===
Non-standard 7-pin mini-DIN connectors (termed &quot;7P&quot;) are used in some computer equipment (PCs and Macs). A 7P socket accepts, and is pin compatible with, a standard 4-pin S-Video plug. The three extra sockets may be used to supply composite (CVBS), an RGB or YPbPr video signal, or an I²C interface. The pinout usage varies among manufacturers. In some implementations, the remaining pin must be grounded to enable the composite output or disable the S-Video output.

Some Dell laptops have a digital audio output in a 7-pin socket.
===8-pin mini-DIN===
The 8-pin mini-DIN connector is used in some ATI Radeon video cards

===9-pin Video In/Video Out===


9-pin connectors are used in graphics systems that feature the ability to input video as well as output it. Again, there is no standardization between manufacturers as to which pin does what, and there are two known variants of the connector in use. As can be seen from the diagram above, although the S-Video signals are available on the corresponding pins, neither variant of the connector will accept an unmodified 4-pin S-Video plug, though they can be made to fit by removing the key from the plug. In the latter case, it becomes all too easy to misalign the plug when inserting it with consequent damage to the small pins.

==Comparison with SCART==

In many European countries, S-Video was less common because of the dominance of SCART connectors, which were present on televisions until the advent of HDMI. It is possible for a player to output S-Video over SCART, but televisions&#x27; SCART connectors are not always wired to accept it, and if not the display would show only a monochrome image. In this case it is sometimes possible to modify the SCART adapter cable to allow full S-Video compatibility.

<text>Lalaine Vergara-Paras (born June 3, 1987) is an American actress, singer-songwriter, and bassist. She is best known for her roles as Miranda Sanchez in &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, Abby Ramirez in &quot;You Wish!&quot;, and Kate in the 1999 remake of &quot;Annie&quot;.

After appearing in the roles of Young Cosette and Éponine in a Broadway musical production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; as a child, Lalaine pursued a career in music. She signed with Warner Bros. Records following the end of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and released one studio album and one extended play, both of which saw little commercial success.

== Early life ==

<text>Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport, formerly called Chinggis Khaan International Airport from 2005 to 2020 , is a semi-operational international airport serving Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, situated southwest of the capital. Largely replaced by a new airport, it currently functions as a backup airport for the former, with a view to being used for flight training as well as for special, charter, and government flights.

==History==

===Development===
The airport was first established as Buyant-Ukhaa Central Airport on 19 February 1957. In 1958, international flights began with flights to Irkutsk and Beijing using Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft. Regular flights from the airport started in 1961.

The terminal was upgraded to make it suitable for international traffic in 1986.

Following the Mongolian Revolution of 1990 and between 1994 and 1997 a further major upgrade of construction and air navigation was achieved with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, making the airport compliant with ICAO standards. The US$50 million construction project was carried out by the successful bidder: a German / English joint venture of Philipp Holzmann and Wimpey Asphalt.

The airport was renamed after Chinggis Khaan (Genghis Khan) to Chinggis Khaan International Airport to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the establishment of a Mongolian State on 21 December 2005. The airport achieved steady growth during the 2000s, with passenger numbers first reaching 1 million in 2012, and reaching a peak of 1.6 million in 2019, before collapsing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Replacement airport===
The airport was replaced by the opening of the new Ulaanbaatar International Airport in 2021. Buyant-Ukhaa is somewhat restricted, the single runway is used in one direction for arriving aircraft and in the opposite direction for departures. The new airport significantly expands capacity, and is located at the Khoshigt Valley, south of Ulaanbaatar city center. With the new airport named &quot;Chinggis Khaan International Airport&quot;, Buyant-Ukhaa reverted to its former name on July 1, 2020.

In May 2023, it hosted the Buyant-Ukhaa Airshow, the first airshow exhibited in the country.
