<text>Chester Castle is in the city of Chester, Cheshire, England. It is sited at the southwest extremity of the area bounded by the city walls. The castle stands on an eminence overlooking the River Dee. In the castle complex are the remaining parts of the medieval castle together with the neoclassical buildings designed by Thomas Harrison which were built between 1788 and 1813. Parts of the neoclassical buildings are used today by the Crown Court and as a military museum. The museum and the medieval remains are a tourist attraction.

==History==

The castle was built in 1070 by Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, the second Earl of Chester. It is possible that it was built on the site of an earlier Saxon fortification but this has not been confirmed. The original structure would have been a motte-and-bailey castle with a wooden tower. In the 12th century the wooden tower was replaced by a square stone tower, the Flag Tower. During the same century the stone gateway to the inner bailey was built. This is now known as the Agricola Tower and on its first floor is the chapel of St Mary de Castro. The chapel contains items of Norman architecture. In the 13th century, during the reign of Henry III, the walls of an outer bailey were built, the gateway in the Agricola Tower was blocked up and residential accommodation, including a Great Hall, was built along the south wall of the inner bailey. Later in the century, during the reign of Edward I, a new gateway to the outer bailey was built. This was flanked by two half-drum towers and had a drawbridge over a moat deep. Further additions to the castle at this time included individual chambers for the King and Queen, a new chapel and stables.

Prominent people held as prisoners in the crypt of the Agricola Tower were Richard II and Eleanor Cobham, wife of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Andrew de Moray, hero of the Battle of Stirling Bridge. During the Wars of the Roses, Yorkist John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu was captured and imprisoned at the castle by Lancastrians following the Battle of Blore Heath, near the town of Market Drayton, Shropshire, in 1459. He was released from captivity following the Yorkist victory at Northampton in 1460. Outside the outer bailey gate was an area known as the Gloverstone where criminals waiting for execution were handed over to the city authorities. The Great Hall was rebuilt in the late 1570s.

During the Civil War Chester was held by the Royalists. The castle was assaulted by Parliamentary forces in July 1643, and in January and April 1645. Together with the rest of the city, it was besieged between September 1645 and February 1646. Following the civil war the castle was used as a prison, a court and a tax office. In 1687 James II attended Mass in the chapel of St Mary de Castro. In 1696 Chester mint was established and was managed by Edmund Halley in a building adjacent to the Half Moon tower. During the 1745 Jacobite rising a gun emplacement was built on the wall overlooking the river.
By the later part of the 18th century much of the fabric of the castle had deteriorated and John Howard, the prison reformer, was particularly critical of the conditions in the prison. Thomas Harrison was commissioned to design a new prison. This was completed in 1792 and praised as one of the best constructed prisons in the country. Harrison then went on to rebuild the medieval Shire Hall in neoclassical style. He also built two new wings, one to act as barracks, the other as an armoury, and designed a massive new entrance to the castle site, styled the Propylaeum. The buildings, which were all in neoclassical style, were built between 1788 and 1822. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner comments that Harrison&#x27;s work constitutes &quot;one of the most powerful monuments of the Greek Revival in the whole of England&quot;.

In February 1867, Irish Fenian Michael Davitt led a group of IRB men from Haslingden on an abortive raid for arms on the castle.

The Army moved in to take hold of the castle and in 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the castle became the depot for the two battalions of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot. Under the Childers Reforms, the 22nd regiment evolved to become the Cheshire Regiment with its depot in the castle in 1881.

In 1925, after being used for 200 years as a warehouse and ammunition store, the crypt and chapel in the Agricola Tower were reconsecrated by the Bishop of Chester for the use of the Cheshire Regiment. In 1939 the chapel was refurnished. The castle remained the depot of the Cheshire Regiment until 1939, when the regiment moved out to Dale Barracks.

==Present day==

The complex is entered from Grosvenor Road through the Propylaeum, a Grade I listed building. This consists of a massive entablature supported on widely spaced (&quot;areostyle&quot;) Doric columns, flanked by temple-like lodges. Directly ahead is the former Shire Hall (also listed Grade I) which now houses the Crown Courts. Its façade has 19 bays, the central seven bays of which project forward and constitute a Doric portico. To the left is the former barracks block which is now the home of the Cheshire Military Museum and an army cadet detachment. To the right is the block which was originally an armoury and later an officers&#x27; mess. Both blocks are in neoclassical style and are listed Grade I.

Further to the right are the remains of the Norman castle. The Agricola Tower is a Grade I listed building. It is built in sandstone ashlar with a metal roof in three storeys. The ground floor has a blocked gateway and to the right of the gateway is a slightly projecting stair turret. Internally, the ground floor consists of a crypt, and the first floor contains the chapel of St Mary Castro. The Agricola Tower is also a scheduled monument. The chapel is still consecrated as the regimental chapel of the Cheshire Regiment. Its ceiling is covered with frescos dating from the early part of the 13th century which depict the Visitation and miracles performed by the Virgin Mary which were revealed during conservation work in the 1990s.

To the south and the west, the curtain walls, which include the Halfmoon Tower, the Flag Tower and the gun emplacement, are listed Grade I. Other walls within the castle complex are listed Grade II. These are the retaining walls and the railing of the forecourt designed by Thomas Harrison, and two other areas of the medieval curtain walls. In the castle courtyard is a statue of Queen Victoria dated 1903 by Pomeroy. The inner bailey is managed by Cheshire West and Chester Council on behalf of English Heritage.

<doc id="154163" wikidata="Q899616" url="?curid=154163" title="Curry's paradox">
<text>Curry&#x27;s paradox is a paradox in which an arbitrary claim &quot;F&quot; is proved from the mere existence of a sentence &quot;C&quot; that says of itself &quot;If &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;F&quot;&quot;. The paradox requires only a few apparently-innocuous logical deduction rules. Since &quot;F&quot; is arbitrary, any logic having these rules allows one to prove everything. The paradox may be expressed in natural language and in various logics, including certain forms of set theory, lambda calculus, and combinatory logic.

The paradox is named after the logician Haskell Curry, who wrote about it in 1942. It has also been called Löb&#x27;s paradox after Martin Hugo Löb, due to its relationship to Löb&#x27;s theorem.

==In natural language==

Claims of the form &quot;if &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; are called conditional claims. Curry&#x27;s paradox uses a particular kind of self-referential conditional sentence, as demonstrated in this example:

Even though Germany does not border China, the example sentence certainly is a natural-language sentence, and so the truth of that sentence can be analyzed. The paradox follows from this analysis. The analysis consists of two steps. First, common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true &quot;[steps 1–4 below]&quot;. Second, the truth of the sentence can be used to prove that Germany borders China &quot;[steps 5–6]&quot;:

# The sentence reads &quot;If this sentence is true, then Germany borders China&quot;   &quot;[repeat definition to get step numbering compatible to the formal proof]&quot;
# If the sentence is true, then it is true.   &quot;[obvious, i.e., a tautology]&quot;
# If the sentence is true, then: if the sentence is true, then Germany borders China.   &quot;[replace &quot;it is true&quot; by the sentence&#x27;s definition]&quot;
# If the sentence is true, then Germany borders China.   &quot;[contract repeated condition]&quot;
# But 4. is what the sentence says, so it is indeed true.
# The sentence is true &quot;[by 5.]&quot;, and &quot;[by 4.]&quot;: if it is true, then Germany borders China.&lt;BR&gt;So, Germany borders China.   &quot;[modus ponens]&quot;

Because Germany does not border China, this suggests that there has been an error in one of the proof steps. The claim &quot;Germany borders China&quot; could be replaced by any other claim, and the sentence would still be provable. Thus every sentence appears to be provable. Because the proof uses only well-accepted methods of deduction, and because none of these methods appears to be incorrect, this situation is paradoxical.

=== Informal proof===

The standard method for proving conditional sentences (sentences of the form &quot;if &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot;) is called &quot;conditional proof&quot;. In this method, in order to prove &quot;if &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot;, first &quot;A&quot; is assumed and then with that assumption &quot;B&quot; is shown to be true.

To produce Curry&#x27;s paradox, as described in the two steps above, apply this method to the sentence &quot;if this sentence is true, then Germany borders China&quot;. Here &quot;A&quot;, &quot;this sentence is true&quot;, refers to the overall sentence, while &quot;B&quot; is &quot;Germany borders China&quot;. So, assuming &quot;A&quot; is the same as assuming &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot;. Therefore, in assuming &quot;A&quot;, we have assumed both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot;. Therefore, &quot;B&quot; is true, by modus ponens, and we have proven &quot;If this sentence is true, then &#x27;Germany borders China&#x27; is true.&quot; in the usual way, by assuming the hypothesis and deriving the conclusion.

Now, because we have proved &quot;If this sentence is true, then &#x27;Germany borders China&#x27; is true&quot;, then we can again apply modus ponens, because we know that the claim &quot;this sentence is true&quot; is correct. In this way, we can deduce that Germany borders China.

== In formal logics ==
===Sentential logic===
The example in the previous section used unformalized, natural-language reasoning. Curry&#x27;s paradox also occurs in some varieties of formal logic. In this context, it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;), where &quot;X&quot; itself is equivalent to (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;), then we can prove &quot;Y&quot; with a formal proof. One example of such a formal proof is as follows. For an explanation of the logic notation used in this section, refer to the list of logic symbols.

# &quot;X&quot; := (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
# &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;&lt;br&gt;
# &quot;X&quot; → (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
# &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;&lt;br&gt;
# &quot;X&quot;&lt;br&gt;
# &quot;Y&quot;&lt;br&gt;

An alternative proof is via &quot;Peirce&#x27;s law&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; = &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, then (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;X&quot;. This together with Peirce&#x27;s law ((&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;X&quot;) → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;modus ponens&quot; implies &quot;X&quot; and subsequently &quot;Y&quot; (as in above proof).

The above derivation shows that, if &quot;Y&quot; is an unprovable statement in a formal system, then there is no statement &quot;X&quot; in that system such that &quot;X&quot; is equivalent to the implication (&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;). In other words, step 1 of the previous proof fails. By contrast, the previous section shows that in natural (unformalized) language, for every natural language statement &quot;Y&quot; there is a natural language statement &quot;Z&quot; such that &quot;Z&quot; is equivalent to (&quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;) in natural language. Namely, &quot;Z&quot; is &quot;If this sentence is true then &quot;Y&quot;&quot;.

=== Naive set theory ===

Even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences, certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to Curry&#x27;s paradox. In set theories that allow unrestricted comprehension, we can prove any logical statement &quot;Y&quot; by examining the set
formula_1One then shows easily that the statement formula_2 is equivalent to formula_3. From this, formula_4 may be deduced, similarly to the proofs shown above. (&quot;formula_2&quot; stands for &quot;this sentence&quot;.)

Therefore, in a consistent set theory, the set formula_6 does not exist for false &quot;Y&quot;. This can be seen as a variant on Russell&#x27;s paradox, but is not identical. Some proposals for set theory have attempted to deal with Russell&#x27;s paradox not by restricting the rule of comprehension, but by restricting the rules of logic so that it tolerates the contradictory nature of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The existence of proofs like the one above shows that such a task is not so simple, because at least one of the deduction rules used in the proof above must be omitted or restricted.

=== Lambda calculus with restricted minimal logic ===

Curry&#x27;s paradox may be expressed in untyped lambda calculus, enriched by implicational propositional calculus. To cope with the lambda calculus&#x27;s syntactic restrictions, formula_7 shall denote the implication function taking two parameters, that is, the lambda term formula_8 shall be equivalent to the usual infix notation formula_9.

An arbitrary formula formula_10 can be proved by defining a lambda function formula_11, and formula_12, where formula_13 denotes Curry&#x27;s fixed-point combinator. Then formula_14 by definition of formula_13 and formula_16, hence the above sentential logic proof can be duplicated in the calculus:

formula_17

In simply typed lambda calculus, fixed-point combinators cannot be typed and hence are not admitted.

=== Combinatory logic ===

Curry&#x27;s paradox may also be expressed in combinatory logic, which has equivalent expressive power to lambda calculus. Any lambda expression may be translated into combinatory logic, so a translation of the implementation of Curry&#x27;s paradox in lambda calculus would suffice.

The above term formula_18 translates to formula_19 in combinatory logic, where
formula_20
hence
formula_21

== Discussion ==

Curry&#x27;s paradox can be formulated in any language supporting basic logic operations that also allows a self-recursive function to be constructed as an expression. Two mechanisms that support the construction of the paradox are self-reference (the ability to refer to &quot;this sentence&quot; from within a sentence) and unrestricted comprehension in naive set theory. Natural languages nearly always contain many features that could be used to construct the paradox, as do many other languages. Usually, the addition of metaprogramming capabilities to a language will add the features needed. Mathematical logic generally does not allow explicit reference to its own sentences; however, the heart of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems is the observation that a different form of self-reference can be added—see Gödel number.

The rules used in the construction of the proof are the rule of assumption for conditional proof, the rule of contraction, and modus ponens. These are included in most common logical systems, such as first-order logic.

=== Consequences for some formal logic ===

In the 1930s, Curry&#x27;s paradox and the related Kleene–Rosser paradox, from which Curry&#x27;s paradox was developed, played a major role in showing that various formal logic systems allowing self-recursive expressions are inconsistent. 

The axiom of unrestricted comprehension is not supported by modern set theory, and Curry&#x27;s paradox is thus avoided.

<text>An athlete is most commonly a person who competes in one or more sports involving physical strength, speed, power, or endurance. Sometimes, the word &quot;athlete&quot; is used to refer specifically to sport of athletics competitors, i.e. including track and field and marathon runners but excluding e.g. swimmers, footballers or basketball players. However, in other contexts (mainly in the United States) it is used to refer to all athletics (physical culture) participants of any sport. For the latter definition, the word sportsperson or the gendered sportsman or sportswoman are also used. A third definition is also sometimes used, meaning anyone who is physically fit regardless of whether they compete in a sport.

Athletes may be professionals or amateurs. Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise, accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.

==Definitions==
The word &quot;athlete&quot; is a romanization of the , &quot;athlētēs&quot;, meaning one who participates in a contest; from ἄθλος, &quot;áthlos&quot; or ἄθλον, &quot;áthlon&quot;, meaning a contest or feat. The primary definition of &quot;sportsman&quot; according to Webster&#x27;s &quot;Third Unabridged Dictionary&quot; (1960) is, &quot;a person who is active in sports: as (a): one who engages in the sports of the field and especially in hunting or fishing.&quot;

==Physiology==

Athletes involved in isotonic exercises have an increased mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume and are less likely to be depressed. Due to their strenuous physical activities, athletes are far more likely than the general population to visit massage salons and pay for services from massotherapists and masseurs. Athletes whose sport requires endurance more than strength usually have a lower calorie intake than other athletes.

=== &quot;Athlete Genes&quot; ===
While athleticism is largely influenced by environmental factors, it has been theorized that genetic expression may play a moderate role in an athlete&#x27;s abilities as well. Exploring this claim, meta-analyses of studies regarding two specific genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and ACTN3, concluded that certain variations in expression may have a moderate effect on athletic performance; the former being more prevalent in endurance-based events and the latter in power-based events. Further studies on these and other genetic polymorphisms linked to athletic performance were recommended.

== Titles ==
===&quot;All-round athlete&quot;===
An &quot;all-round athlete&quot; is a person who competes in multiple sports at a professional level. Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include Jim Thorpe, Lionel Conacher, Deion Sanders, Danny Ainge, Babe Zaharias and Erin Phillips. Others include Ricky Williams, Bo Jackson and Damon Allen, each of whom was drafted both by Major League Baseball and by professional gridiron football leagues such as the NFL and the CFL. Another female example is Heather Moyse, a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in bobsled and member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame who also represented Canada internationally in track cycling and competed at university level in basketball and track and field. Japanese athletes such as Kazushi Sakuraba, Kazuyuki Fujita, Masakatsu Funaki and Naoya Ogawa have successfully performed in professional wrestling and competed in mixed martial arts. All these athletes are equally great at what they do. Whether it&#x27;s on the basketball court, the baseball field, the tennis court or whatever sport, each of these athletes left an impact in sports

===&quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot;===
The title of &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; traditionally belongs to the world&#x27;s top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful, including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance.

Although the title &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with Jim Thorpe. During the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the Decathlon (among others). Thorpe competed professionally in baseball, American football, and basketball; and competed collegiately in track and field, baseball, lacrosse, and did ballroom dancing. King Gustav V of Sweden, while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold, said: &quot;Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.&quot; This title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since.

<doc id="154170" wikidata="Q189222" url="?curid=154170" title="Intuition">
<text>Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge, without recourse to conscious reasoning or needing an explanation. Different fields use the word &quot;intuition&quot; in very different ways, including but not limited to: direct access to unconscious knowledge; unconscious cognition; gut feelings; inner sensing; inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition; and the ability to understand something instinctively, without any need for conscious reasoning. Intuitive knowledge tends to be approximate.

The word &quot;intuition&quot; comes from the Latin verb translated as &quot;consider&quot; or from the late middle English word , &quot;to contemplate&quot;. Use of intuition is sometimes referred to as responding to a &quot;gut feeling&quot; or &quot;trusting your gut&quot;.

==Psychology==
===Freud===
According to Sigmund Freud, knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations. He rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition. His findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.

===Jung===
In Carl Jung&#x27;s theory of the ego, described in 1916 in &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, intuition is an &quot;irrational function&quot;, opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the &quot;rational functions&quot; of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as &quot;perception via the unconscious&quot;: using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, or ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant—an &quot;intuitive type&quot;—acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extroverted intuitive type, &quot;the natural champion of all minorities with a future&quot;, orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the archetypes, seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extroverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit. Jung&#x27;s discerning between intuitive types and sensing types was later used in the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), used as polar opposites on the mind.

===Modern psychology===
In modern psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and the making of decisions. For example, the recognition-primed decision (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. Gary Klein found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. The RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The analysis is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.

Instinct is often misinterpreted as intuition. Its reliability is dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experience with children will tend to have better instincts about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying nonverbal communication, researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred. In , they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non-intuitive subjects.

According to the works of Daniel Kahneman, intuition is the ability to automatically generate solutions without long logical arguments or evidence. He mentions two different systems that we use when making decisions and judgements: the first is in charge of automatic or unconscious thoughts, the second in charge of more intentional thoughts. The first system is an example of intuition, and Kahneman believes people overestimate this system, using it as a source of confidence for knowledge they may not truly possess. These systems are connected with two versions of ourselves he calls the remembering self and experiencing self, relating to the creation of memories in &quot;System 1&quot;. Its automatic nature occasionally leads people to experience cognitive illusions, assumptions that our intuition gives us and are usually trusted without a second thought.

Gerd Gigerenzer described intuition as processes and thoughts that are devoid of typical logic. He described two primary characteristics to intuition: basic rules of thumb (that are heuristic in nature) and &quot;evolved capacities of the brain&quot;. The two work in tandem to give people thoughts and abilities that they do not actively think about as they are performed, and of which they cannot explain their formation or effectiveness. He does not believe that intuitions knowledge; he believes that having too much information makes individuals overthink, and that some intuitions will actively defy known information.

Intuition is also seen as a figurative launch pad for logical thinking. Intuition&#x27;s automatic nature tends to precede more thoughtful logic. Even when based on moral or subjective standpoints, intuition provides a base—one that people will usually start to back up with logical thinking as a defense or justification rather than starting with a less biased viewpoint. The confidence in are instantaneous feelings or judgments that we have surprising confidence in.

==Philosophy==
Both Eastern and Western philosophers have studied intuition. The discipline of epistemology deals with the concept.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with religion and spirituality, and various meanings exist in different religious texts.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism, various attempts have been made to interpret how the Vedic and other esoteric texts regard intuition.

For Sri Aurobindo, intuition comes under the realm of knowledge by identity. He describes the human psychological plane (often referred to as in Sanskrit) as having two natures: The first being its role in interpreting the external world (parsing sensory information), and the second being its role in generating consciousness. He terms this second nature &quot;knowledge by identity.&quot; Aurobindo finds that, as the result of evolution, the mind has accustomed itself to using certain physiological functions as its means of entering into relations with the material world; when people seek to know about the external world, they default to arriving at truths via their senses. Knowledge by identity, which currently only explains self-awareness, may extend beyond the mind and explain intuitive knowledge.

He says this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans (Vedic) and later was superseded by reason which currently organises our perception, thoughts, and actions and which resulted in a transition from Vedic thought to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. He finds that this process, is actually a circle of progress, as He says that when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one&#x27;s self and to the outer (other) self, this results in luminous self-manifesting identity; and the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.

Osho believed human consciousness is in a hierarchy from basic animal instincts to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity. He suggests that living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.

Advaita vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience Brahman.

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition to be a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge. Buddhism of conscious thinking, as conscious thought cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form. In Zen Buddhism various techniques have been developed to help develop one&#x27;s intuitive capability, such as koans – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment (satori). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one&#x27;s individual, discriminating mind.

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, but the topic features prominently in the works of many philosophers.

====Ancient philosophy====
Early mentions and definitions of intuition can be traced back to Plato. In his &quot;Republic&quot; he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human reason to comprehend the true nature of reality. In his works &quot;Meno&quot; and &quot;Phaedo&quot;, he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the &quot;soul of eternity&quot;, and as a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as anamnesis. The study was later continued by his intellectual successors, the Neoplatonists.

====Islam====
In Islam various scholars have varied interpretations of intuition (often termed as , Arabic: , &quot;hitting correctly on a mark&quot;), sometimes relating the ability to have intuitive knowledge to prophethood. 
Siháb al Din-al Suhrawardi, in his book &quot;Philosophy Of Illumination&quot; (), from following influences of Plato, finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature; he also suggests mystical contemplation () to bring about correct judgment. Also influenced by Platonic ideas, Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) finds the ability to have intuition is a &quot;prophetic capacity&quot; and he describes intuition as knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge is based on intellectual certitude.

====Early modern philosophy====
In his book &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, Descartes refers to an &quot;intuition&quot; (from the Latin verb , which means &quot;to see&quot;) as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition states that &quot;whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be true is true&quot;; this is commonly referred to as rational intuition It is a component of a potential logical mistake called the Cartesian circle. Intuition and deduction, says Descartes, are the unique possible sources of knowledge of the human intellect; the latter is a &quot;connected sequence of intuitions&quot;, each of which is &quot;a priori&quot; a self-evident, clear and distinct idea, before it is connected with the other ideas within a logical demonstration.

Hume has a more ambiguous interpretation of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation). He states that &quot;the resemblance&quot; (recognition of relations) &quot;will strike the eye&quot; (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, &quot;or rather in mind&quot;—attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of empiricism.

====Immanuel Kant====
Immanuel Kant’s notion of &quot;intuition&quot; differs considerably from the Cartesian notion. It consists of the basic sensory information provided by the cognitive faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called perception). Kant held that our mind casts all of our external intuitions in the form of space, and all of our internal intuitions (memory, thought) in the form of time.

====Contemporary philosophy====
Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims. There are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth. Philosophers such as George Bealer have tried to defend appeals to intuition against Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis.

A different challenge to appeals to intuition comes from experimental philosophers, who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.

The metaphilosophical assumption that philosophy ought to depend on intuitions has been challenged by experimental philosophers (e.g., Stephen Stich). One of the main problems adduced by experimental philosophers is that intuitions differ, for instance, from one culture to another, and so it seems problematic to cite them as evidence for a philosophical claim. Timothy Williamson responded to such objections against philosophical methodology by arguing that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general skepticism about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences, or mathematics. Others like Ernest Sosa seek to support intuition by arguing that the objections against intuition merely highlight .

=====Philosophy of mathematics and logic=====
Intuitionism is a position advanced by L. E. J. Brouwer in philosophy of mathematics derived from Kant&#x27;s claim that all mathematical knowledge is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition—that is, intuition that is not empirical.

Intuitionistic logic was devised by Arend Heyting to accommodate this position (it has also been adopted by other forms of constructivism). It is characterized by rejecting the law of excluded middle: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as double negation elimination and the use of to prove the existence of something.

== Artificial intelligence ==

Researchers in artificial intelligence are trying to add intuition to algorithms, as the &quot;fourth generation of AI&quot;; this can be applied to many industries, especially finance. One example of artificial intuition is AlphaGo Zero, which used neural networks and was trained with reinforcement learning from a blank slate. In another example, ThetaRay partnered with Google Cloud to use artificial intuition for anti-money laundering purposes.

==Business decision-making==
In a 2022 &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article, Melody Wilding explored &quot;how to stop overthinking and start trusting your gut&quot;, noting that &quot;intuition... is frequently dismissed as mystical or unreliable&quot;. She suggested that there is a scientific basis for using intuition and refers to &quot;surveys of top executives [which] show that a majority of leaders leverage feelings and experience when handling crises&quot;. However, an earlier &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article (&quot;Don&#x27;t Trust Your Gut&quot;) advises that, although &quot;trust in intuition is understandable... anyone who thinks that intuition is a substitute for reason is indulging in a risky delusion&quot;.

Intuition was assessed by a sample of 11 Australian business leaders as a gut feeling based on experience, which they considered useful for making judgments about people, culture, and strategy. Such an example likens intuition to &quot;gut feelings&quot;, which — — illustrate preconscious activity.

==Honours==
Intuition Peak in Antarctica is so named &quot;in appreciation of the role of scientific intuition for the advancement of human knowledge&quot;.

<text>Calypso is a style of Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the early to mid-19th century and spread to the rest of the Caribbean Antilles by the mid-20th century. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 18th century.

It is characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and was historically most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a &quot;chantuelle&quot; and eventually, &quot;calypsonian&quot;. As English replaced &quot;patois&quot; (Antillean) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression.

Calypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including benna in Antigua and Barbuda; mento, a style of Jamaican folk music that greatly influenced ska, the precursor to rocksteady, and reggae; spouge, a style of Barbadian popular music; Dominica cadence-lypso, which mixed calypso with the cadence of Haiti; and soca music, a style of kaiso/calypso, with influences from chutney, soul, funk, Latin and cadence-lypso.

== Etymology ==
It is thought that the name &quot;calypso&quot; was originally &quot;kaiso&quot; which is now believed to come from Efik &quot;ka isu&quot; (&quot;go on!&quot;) and Ibibio &quot;kaa iso&quot; (&quot;continue, go on&quot;), used in urging someone on or in backing a contestant. There is also a Trinidadian term &quot;cariso&quot; that means &quot;old-time&quot; calypsos. The term &quot;calypso&quot; is recorded from the 1930s onwards. Alternatively, the insert for &quot;The Rough Guide to Calypso and Soca&quot; (published by World Music Network) favours John Cowley&#x27;s arguments in &quot;Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making,&quot; that the word might be a corruption of the French &quot;carrouseaux&quot; and through the process of patois and Anglicization became &quot;caliso&quot; and then finally &quot;calypso&quot;; however, Cowley also notes that the first mention of the word &quot;calypso&quot; is given in a description of a dance in 1882 by Abbé Masse.

==History of Calypso==
Calypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African Kaiso and canboulay music brought by enslaved Africans brought to the Caribbean islands to work on sugar plantations. The Africans brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and were not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a &quot;chantuelle&quot; and eventually, &quot;calypsonian&quot;.

Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century as a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song &quot;lavway&quot;, French Creole &quot;belair&quot; and the calinda stick-fighting chantwell. Also early in its recording years were influences from Venezuelan paseos. Calypso&#x27;s early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including canboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought Carnival to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the abolition of slavery in 1834.

===Recordings===
The first identifiably calypso genre song was recorded in 1912, by Lovey&#x27;s String Band while visiting New York City. In 1914, the second calypso recordings—including the first sung in English—were done by chantwell Julian Whiterose, better known as the Iron Duke and famous calinda stick-fighter. Jules Sims would also record vocal calypsos. The majority of these calypsos of the World War I era were instrumentals by Lovey and Lionel Belasco. Perhaps due to the constraints of the wartime economy, no recordings of note were produced until the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the &quot;golden era&quot; of calypso would cement the style, form, and phrasing of the music.

Calypso evolved into a way of spreading news around Trinidad. Politicians, journalists and public figures often debated the content of each song, and many islanders considered these songs the most reliable news source. Calypsonians pushed the boundaries of free speech as their lyrics spread news of any topic relevant to island life, including speaking out against political corruption.

Even with this censorship, calypsos continued to push boundaries, with a variety of ways to slip songs past the scrutinizing eyes of the editor. Double entendre, or double-speak, was one way, as was the practice of denouncing countries such as Germany and its annexation of Poland, while making pointed references toward the colonial government&#x27;s policies in Trinidad. Sex, scandal, gossip, politics, local news, and insulting other calypsonians were the order of the day in classic calypso, just as it is today with classic hip-hop. And just as the hip-hop of today, the music sparked shock and outrage in moralistic sections of society.

Countless recordings were dumped at sea in the name of censorship, although in truth, rival US companies did this in the spirit of underhanded competition, claiming that the rivals&#x27; material was unfit for US consumption. Decca Records lost untold pressings in this manner, as did its rival, RCA&#x27;s Bluebird label.

An entrepreneur named Eduardo de Sá Gomes played a significant role in spreading calypso in its early days. Sá Gomes, a Portuguese immigrant who owned a local music and phonograph equipment shop in Port of Spain, promoted the genre and gave financial support to the local artists. In March 1934, he sent Roaring Lion and Attila the Hun to New York City to record; they became the first calypsonians to record abroad, bringing the genre out of the West Indies and into pop culture. Lord Invader was quick to follow, and stayed in New York City after a protracted legal case involving the theft of his song &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot;, a hit by the Andrews Sisters. He made his home there along with Wilmoth Houdini, and became one of the great calypsonians of the US.

Early forms of calypso were also similar to jazz (which came after) such as Sans Humanitae. In this extempo (extemporaneous) melody calypsonians lyricise impromptu, commenting socially or insulting each other, &quot;sans humanité&quot; or &quot;no mercy&quot; (which is again a reference to French influence).

== Popularity==
The first major stars of calypso started crossing over to new audiences worldwide in the late 1930s. Attila the Hun, Roaring Lion and Lord Invader were first, followed by Lord Kitchener, one of the longest-lasting calypso stars in history—he continued to release hit records until his death in 2000. 1944&#x27;s &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; by the Andrews Sisters, a cover version of a Lord Invader song, became an American hit despite the song being a very critical commentary on the explosion of prostitution, inflation and other negative influences accompanying the American military bases in Trinidad at the time. Perhaps the most straightforward way to describe the focus of calypso is that it articulated itself as a form of protest against the authoritarian colonial culture which existed at the time.

In 1956 Mighty Sparrow won Trinida&#x27;s Music contest. Calypso, especially a toned-down, commercial variant, became a worldwide craze with pop song &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, or &quot;Day-O&quot;, a traditional Jamaican folk song, was recorded by pop singer Harry Belafonte on his album &quot;Calypso&quot; (1956). &quot;Calypso&quot; was the first calypso record to sell more than a million copies. 1956 also saw the massive international hit &quot;Jean and Dinah&quot; by Mighty Sparrow. This song too was a sly commentary as a &quot;plan of action&quot; for the calypsonian on the widespread prostitution and the prostitutes&#x27; desperation after the closing of the U.S. naval base on Trinidad at Chaguaramas. In addition, the choral director Leonard De Paur recorded a calypso album in 1956 for Columbia Records featuring his choral arrangements of traditional Christmas music from Trinidad and Barbados, as well as the song Mary&#x27;s Little Boy Child by Jester Hairston (&quot;Calypso Christmas&quot;, CL 923 Mono LP, 1956).

In the Broadway-theatre musical &quot;Jamaica&quot; (1957), Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg cleverly parodied &quot;commercial&quot; Belafonte-style calypso. Several films jumped on the calypso craze in 1957 such as &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (20th Century Fox) that featured Belafonte and the low-budget films &quot;Calypso Joe&quot; (Allied Artists), &quot;Calypso Heat Wave&quot; (Columbia Pictures), and &quot;Bop Girl Goes Calypso&quot; (United Artists).
Robert Mitchum released an album, &quot;Calypso...Is Like So&quot; (1957), on Capitol Records, capturing the sound, spirit, and subtleties of the genre.
Dizzy Gillespie recorded a calypso album &quot;Jambo Caribe&quot; (1964) with James Moody and Kenny Barron.

Soul shouter Gary &quot;US&quot; Bonds released a calypso album &quot;Twist up Calypso&quot; (1962) on Legrand records, shortly after returning home from his military post in Port of Spain. Nithi Kanagaratnam from Sri Lanka sang calypso-styled songs in Tamil in 1968, which was a success and earned him the title &quot;Father of Tamil Popular Music&quot;. Since Baila rhythm was popular in Sri Lanka, most of his songs were classified as Tamil Baila.

In the mid-1970s, women entered the calypso men&#x27;s-oriented arena. Calypso Rose was the first woman to win the Trinidad Road March competition in 1977 with her song &quot;Gimme More Tempo&quot;. The following year with &quot;Come Leh We Jam&quot;, she won the &quot;Calypso King &quot; competition, the first time a woman had received the award. The competition&#x27;s title was changed to Calypso Monarch in her honor.
The French and pioneer electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre released an album in 1990 called &quot;Waiting for Cousteau&quot;. The album has four tracks: &quot;Calypso&quot;, &quot;Calypso part 2&quot;, &quot;Calypso part 3 Fin de Siècle&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Cousteau&quot;. It was dedicated to Jacques-Yves Cousteau on his 80th birthday. This album had a special participation of the Amocco Renegades (a traditional steel-drum band from Trinidad and Tobago). In the first track is possible to notice a strong style influence. Calypso had another short burst of commercial interest when Tim Burton&#x27;s horror/comedy film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) was released, and used Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Jump in the Line&quot; as the soundtrack&#x27;s headliner and also &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot; in the dinner-party scene. Disney&#x27;s song &quot;Under the Sea&quot;, a calypso theme from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1989 as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1991.

In the late-1970s a new style, dubbed Soca music, emerged from the blending of calypso with elements of East Indian music as well as African American soul, funk, and rock. The soca music of the 1980s featured fast tempos, electric guitars and synthesizers, prominent melodic bass lines, and lyrics celebrating sensuality and dance. Many influential calypso singers including Ras Shorty I, Mighty Sparrow, Lord Kitchener, Calypso Rose, Super Blue, and David Rudder embraced the new style. Brooklyn became an important site for the production of soca records from the late 1970s through the early 1990s.

Although Calypso&#x27;s native land is Trinidad, it is also very popular in a small &quot;windward&quot; island in the West Indies. This island is called Dominica, the nature island of the Caribbean. Dominicans, similar to Trinidadians also developed a keen interest in Caribbean genres such as Soca music, and Calypso in the late 1960&#x27;s. Called &quot;Kaiso&quot; in French creole, Calypso is illustrated as a unique form of music, especially during the Carnival season. Dominicans mainly use this genre to express their concerns and feedback on the everyday affairs and happenings of their country. Most of the music pieces composed normally have a negative stigma attached to them, expressing dissatisfaction with how their current government choose to conduct the affairs of the country. The first Calypso monarch in Dominica who was crowned in 1959 was called &quot;The Observer&quot; and the longest reigning Calypso monarch is King Dice. The Calypso tent is not just limited to adult participation. There is also a section called Junior monarch where young children under the age of 14 are able to prepare and compete with their personally made Calypso pieces.

Calypso competitions usually commence in January and culminate in the Calypso monarch competition that are usually held the Saturday before Carnival in February. The winner becomes the Calypso King of that year and joins Miss Dominica, the carnival pageant winner of that year, in the traditional costume parade on Carnival Monday.

== Sociopolitical influence ==
Calypso music has been used by Calypsonians to provide sociopolitical commentary. Prior to the independence of Trinidad and Tobago, calypsonians would use their music to express the daily struggles of living in Trinidad, critique racial and economic inequalities, express opinions on social order, and voice overall concerns for those living on the island. During the colonial era, the Black lower class used calypso music to protest their poor economic situation and the discrimination which they were subjected to. Calypso music frequently was used as a form of musical protest.

During the independence movements of Trinidad and Tobago through the early 1950s up until 1962 when the nation gained independence, calypso lyrics frequently critiqued British colonial rule. Lyrics were made to express feelings towards colonial rule as being immoral and oppressive to Caribbean people. In particular, during the movement to independence, calypso music would include common messages of a desire for independence, opposition to colonial rule and empowerment for people of African descent.

Neville Marcano, known as the Growling Tiger, became notorious for creating songs calling for independence of Trinidad and Tobago. In his song titled &quot;Abraham Lincoln Speech at Gettysburg&quot;, Tiger used inspirations from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s famous Gettysburg address to draw on values of liberty, equality and democracy. These three principles paralleled some of many ideas circulating during the nationalist movement in Trinidad and Tobago. His lyrics struck with those in support of an independent Trinidadian nation hoping to instill similar principles in their own free nation.

Lord Kitchener, a largely known Calypsonian, became noted for his politically critical lyrics in his music. Kitchener used calypso to shed light on the grievances of the windrush generation, a generation of Caribbean families migrating from the islands to England in response to increased labor demands after World War II. Kitchener&#x27;s 1948 song &quot;Windrush&quot; was written in two versions. The first version gained more global popularity as the lyrics expressed gratitude and appreciation for British colonial rule. However, second version found greater popularity amongst Caribbean people themselves as the lyrics conveyed a story of West Indian immigrants facing discrimination and cultural alienation while living in Britain. Although Kitchener&#x27;s alternate version of &quot;Windrush&quot; did not gain as much commercial popularity, the duality of the two versions exemplify how calypso music was used as an outlet for social commentary.

After Trinidad and Tobago gained independence in 1962, calypso music continued to be used as an outlet for political commentary. With Eric Williams serving as the first Prime Minister of an independent Trinidad and Tobago, calypsonian Mighty Sparrow released his song &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; where he praises Williams&#x27; victory and prides the island in its newfound independence. Sparrow sings:I am no politician, but I could understand if it wasn&#x27;t for Brother Willie and his ability, Trinidad wouldn&#x27;t go neither come. We used to vote for food and rum but nowadays we eating all the Indians and them. And in the ending, we voting PNM. Praise little Eric, rejoice and be glad. We have a better future here in Trinidad.Calypso music has also been used by politicians to promote political agendas through Calypso competitions. The origins of calypso competitions dates back to the early 19th century post emancipation where formerly enslaved communities would hold calypso wars showcasing their singing and dancing. Later in 1953 Calypso competitions held the same showcasing nature, but became politicized as the People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) took over as the main organizer of competitions. The PNM used the competitions to combat social and class divisions by attracting participants of varying social status to participate and attend the competitions. The idea was to claim a national cultural identity and promote national unity.

<text>A heritage railway or heritage railroad (U.S. usage) is a railway operated as living history to re-create or preserve railway scenes of the past. Heritage railways are often old railway lines preserved in a state depicting a period (or periods) in the history of rail transport.

== Definition ==
The British Office of Rail and Road defines heritage railways as follows:...&#x27;lines of local interest&#x27;, museum railways or tourist railways that have retained or assumed the character and appearance and operating practices of railways of former times. Several lines that operate in isolation provide genuine transport facilities, providing community links. Most lines constitute tourist or educational attractions in their own right. Much of the rolling stock and other equipment used on these systems is original and is of historic value in its own right. Many systems aim to replicate both the look and operating practices of historic former railways companies.

== Infrastructure ==

Heritage railway lines have historic rail infrastructure which has been substituted (or made obsolete) in modern rail systems. Historical installations, such as hand-operated points, water cranes, and rails fastened with hand-hammered rail spikes, are characteristic features of heritage lines. Unlike tourist railways, which primarily carry tourists and have modern installations and vehicles, heritage-line infrastructure creates views and soundscapes of the past in operation.

== Operation ==
Due to a lack of modern technology or the desire for historical accuracy, railway operations can be handled with traditional practices such as the use of tokens. Heritage infrastructure and operations often require the assignment of roles, based on historical occupations, to the railway staff. Some, or all, staff and volunteers, including Station masters and signalmen, sometimes wearing period-appropriate attire, can be seen on some heritage railways. Most heritage railways use heritage rolling stock, although modern rail vehicles can be used to showcase railway scenes with historical-line infrastructure.

=== Cost ===
While some heritage railways are profitable tourist attractions, many are not-for-profit entities; some of the latter depend on enthusiastic volunteers for upkeep and operations to supplement revenue from traffic and visitors. Still other heritage railways offer a viable public-transit option, and can maintain operations with revenue from regular riders or government subsidies.

== Development ==
=== Children&#x27;s railways ===

Children&#x27;s railways are extracurricular educational institutions where children and teenagers learn about railway work; they are often functional, passenger-carrying narrow-gauge rail lines. The railways developed in the USSR during the Soviet era. Many were called &quot;Pioneer railways&quot;, after the youth organisation of that name. The first children&#x27;s railway opened in Moscow in 1932 and, at the breakup of the USSR, 52 children&#x27;s railways existed in the country. Although the fall of communist governments has led to the closure of some, preserved children&#x27;s railways are still functioning in post-Soviet states and Eastern European countries.

Many children&#x27;s railways were built on parkland in urban areas. Unlike many industrial areas typically served by a narrow-gauge railway, parks were free of redevelopment. Child volunteers and socialist fiscal policy enabled the existence of many of these railways. Children&#x27;s railways which still carry traffic have often retained their original infrastructure and rolling stock, including vintage steam locomotives; some have acquired heritage vehicles from other railways.

Examples of children&#x27;s railways with steam locomotives include the Dresden Park Railway in Germany; the Gyermekvasút in Budapest; the Park Railway Maltanka in Poznań; the Košice Children&#x27;s Railway in Slovakia, and the gauge steam railway on the grounds of St Nicholas&#x27; School in Merstham, Surrey, which the children help operate with assistance from the East Surrey 16mm Group and other volunteers.

=== Mountain railways ===

Creating passages for trains up steep hills and through mountain regions offers many obstacles which call for technical solutions. Steep grade railway technologies and extensive tunneling may be employed. The use of narrow gauge allows tighter curves in the track, and offers a smaller structure gauge and tunnel size. At high altitudes, construction and logistical difficulties, limited urban development and demand for transport and special rolling-stock requirements have left many mountain railways unmodernized. The engineering feats of past railway builders and views of pristine mountain scenes have made many railways in mountainous areas profitable tourist attractions.

=== Pit railways ===
Pit railways have been in operation in underground mines all over the world. Small rail vehicles transport ore, waste rock, and workers through narrow tunnels. Sometimes trains were the sole mode of transport in the passages between the work sites and the mine entrance. The railway&#x27;s loading gauge often dictated the cross-section of passages to be dug. At many mining sites, pit railways have been abandoned due to mine closure or adoption of new transportation equipment. Some show mines have a vintage pit railway and offer mantrip rides into the mine.

=== Underground railways ===
The Metro 1 (officially the Millennium Underground Railway or M1), built from 1894 to 1896, is the oldest line of the Budapest Metro system and the second-oldest underground railway in the world. The M1 underwent major reconstruction during the 1980s and 1990s, and Line 1 now serves eight original stations whose original appearance has been preserved. In 2002, the line was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Deák Ferenc Square concourse&#x27;s Millennium Underground Museum, many other artifacts of the metro&#x27;s early history may be seen.

=== Heritage tramways ===
== By country ==

The first heritage railway to be rescued and run entirely by volunteers was the Talyllyn Railway in Wales. This narrow-gauge line, taken over by a group of enthusiasts in 1950, was the beginning of the preservation movement worldwide.

=== Argentina ===

La Trochita (officially Viejo Expreso Patagónico, the Old Patagonian Express) was declared a National Historic Monument by the Government of Argentina in 1999. Trains on the Patagonian narrow-gauge railway use steam locomotives. The railway runs through the foothills of the Andes between Esquel and El Maitén in Chubut Province and Ingeniero Jacobacci in Río Negro Province.

In southern Argentina, the Train of the End of the World to the Tierra del Fuego National Park is considered the world&#x27;s southernmost functioning railway. Heritage railway operations started in 1994, after restoration of the old (narrow-gauge) steam railway.

In Salta Province in northeastern Argentina, the Tren a las Nubes (Train to the Clouds) runs along of track in what is one of the highest railways in the world. The line has 29 bridges, 21 tunnels, 13 viaducts, two spirals and two zigzags, and its highest point is above sea level.

In the Misiones Province, more precisely in the Iguazú National Park, is the Ecological Train of the Forest. With a speed below 20 km per hour to avoid interfering with wildlife and the formations are propelled to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a non-polluting fuel.

The Villa Elisa Historic Train (operated by Ferroclub Central Entrerriano) runs steam trains between the cities of Villa Elisa and Caseros in Entre Ríos Province, covering in 120 minutes.

=== Australia ===
The world&#x27;s second preserved railway, and the first outside the United Kingdom, was Australia&#x27;s Puffing Billy Railway. This railway operates on of track, with much of its original rolling stock built as early as 1898. Just about over half of Australia&#x27;s heritage lines are operated by narrow gauge tank engines, much like the narrow gauge lines of the United Kingdom.

=== Austria ===
The Höllental Railway is a , narrow-gauge (Bosnian gauge) railway, operating in Lower Austria. It runs on summer weekends, connecting Reichenau an der Rax to the nearby Höllental.

=== Belgium ===
Flanders, Belgium&#x27;s northern Dutch-speaking region, has the Dendermonde–Puurs Steam Railway; whereas Wallonia, with its strong history of 19th century heavy industries, has the Chemin de fer à vapeur des Trois Vallées and PFT operates the Chemin de Fer du Bocq.

=== Canada ===

=== Finland ===

On the Finnish state-owned rail network, the section between Olli and Porvoo is a dedicated museum line. In southern Finland, it is the only line with many structural details abandoned by the rest of the network which regularly carries passenger traffic. Wooden sleepers, gravel ballast and low rail weight with no overhead catenary make it uniquely historical. Along the line, the Hinthaara railway station and the Porvoo railway station area are included in the National Board of Antiquities&#x27; inventory of cultural environments of national significance in Finland. Also on the list is scenery in the Porvoonjoki Valley, through which the line passes.

The Jokioinen Museum Railway is a stretch of preserved narrow-gauge railway between Humppila and Jokioinen. Nykarleby Järnväg is a stretch of rebuilt narrow-gauge railway on the bank of the old Kovjoki–Nykarleby line.

=== Germany ===

The is a spur line of the Prussian Eastern Railway, located in the Märkische Schweiz Nature Park in Brandenburg. It was originally constructed in 1897 as a narrow-gauge railway, with a gauge of , connecting Buckow to the Müncheberg (Mark) station. This line was electrified and changed to standard gauge in 1930. It has operated as a heritage railway since 2002.

=== India ===
The Mountain railways of India are the railway lines that were built in the mountainous regions of India. The term mainly includes the narrow-gauge and metre-gauge railways in these regions but may also include some broad-gauge railways.

Of the Mountain railways of India, the Darjeeling Himalayan, Nilgiri Mountain and Kalka–Shimla Railways have been collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To meet World Heritage criteria, the sites must retain some of their traditional infrastructure and culture.

The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is also the only rack and pinion railway in India. The Matheran Hill Railway, along with the Kangra Valley Railway are preserved narrow gauge railways under consideration for UNESCO status. Some scenic routes have been preserved as heritage railways. Here normal services have stopped, only tourist heritage trains are operated. Examples of these are the Patalpani–Kalakund Heritage Train and the Rajasthan Valley Queen Heritage train which runs from Marwar Junction to Khamlighat.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia there are several historic train lines and steam trains that are still operated today, including Ambarawa Railway Museum, Sawahlunto Railway Museum, Cepu Forest Railway, Jaladara excursion train in Surakarta, and several narrow gauge lines in the Sugar Factory area.

===Italy===


In Italy the heritage railway institute is recognized and protected by law no. 128 of 9 August 2017, which has as its objective the protection and valorisation of disused, suspended or abolished railway lines, of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, including both railway routes and stations and the related works of art and appurtenances, on which, upon proposal of the regions to which they belong, tourism-type traffic management is applied (art. 2, paragraph 1). At the same time, the law identified a first list of 18 tourist railways, considered to be of particular value (art. 2, paragraph 2).

The list is periodically updated by decree of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Culture, also taking into account the reports in the State-Regions Conference, a list which in 2022 reached 26 railway lines. According to article 1, law 128/2017 has as its purpose: &quot;the protection and valorisation of railway sections of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, which include railway routes, stations and related works of art and appurtenances, and of the historic and tourist rolling stock authorized to travel along them, as well as the regulation of the use of ferrocycles&quot;.

Below is the list of railway lines recognized as tourist railways by Italian legislation.

a) pursuant to art. 2 paragraph 2 law 128/2017:
# Sulmona-Castel di Sangro section of the 
# 
# 
# Castel di Sangro-Carpinone section of the Sulmona-Isernia railway
# Ceva–Ormea railway
# 
# Sassari–Tempio-Palau railway
# 
# Castelvetrano-Porto Palo section of the 
# Agrigento Bassa-Porto Empedocle section of the Castelvetrano-Porto Empedocle railway
# Asciano–Monte Antico railway
#

The Bernina railway line is a single-track railway line forming part of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). It links the spa resort of St. Moritz, in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, with the town of Tirano, in the Province of Sondrio, Italy, via the Bernina Pass. Reaching a height of above sea level, it is the third highest railway crossing in Europe. It also ranks as the highest adhesion railway of the continent, andwith inclines of up to 7%as one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. The elevation difference on the section between the Bernina Pass and Tirano is , allowing passengers to view glaciers along the line. On 7 July 2008, the Bernina line and the Albula railway line, which also forms part of the RhB, were recorded in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the name &quot;Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes&quot;. The whole site is a cross-border joint Swiss-Italian heritage area. Trains operating on the Bernina line include the Bernina Express.

In July 2023, Ferrovie dello Stato established a new company, the &quot;FS Treni Turistici Italiani&quot; (English: FS Italian Tourist Trains), with the mission &quot;to propose an offer of railway services expressly designed and calibrated for quality, sustainable tourism and attentive to rediscovering the riches of the Italian territory. Tourism that can experience the train journey as an integral moment of the holiday, an element of quality in the overall tourist experience&quot;. There are three service areas proposed: 
* &quot;Luxury trains&quot;, which includes the circulation of the &quot;Orient Express - La Dolce Vita&quot; from 2024, and Venice Simplon Orient Express, already operating on European routes;
* &quot;Express and historic trains&quot;, with the express trains of the 1980s and 1990s which being redeveloped and modernized in the railway workshops of Rimini, while the historic trains are used for journeys that include stops with guided tours and tastings; 
* &quot;Regional trains&quot;, also with trips that include experiential tourist stops, which pass through places rich in history, with villages and areas of landscape, naturalistic, food and wine and agri-food interest.

===New Zealand===
Rail transport played a major role in the history of New Zealand and several rail enthusiast societies and heritage railways have been formed to preserve New Zealand&#x27;s rich rail history.

=== Slovakia ===
The Čierny Hron Railway is a narrow-gauge railway in central Slovakia, established in the first decade of the 20th century and operating primarily as a freight railway for the local logging industry. From the late 1920s to the early 1960s, it also offered passenger transport between the villages of Hronec and Čierny Balog. The railway became Czechoslovakia&#x27;s most extensive forest railway network. After its closure in 1982, it received heritage status and was restored during the following decade. Since 1992, it has been one of Slovakia&#x27;s official heritage railways and is a key regional tourist attraction. The Historical Logging Switchback Railway in Vychylovka is a heritage railway in north-central Slovakia, originally built to serve the logging industry in the Orava and Kysuce regions. Despite a closure and dissasembly of most of its original network during the early 1970s, its surviving lines and branches have been (or are being) restored. The railway is owned and operated by the Museum of Kysuce, with a line open to tourists for sightseeing.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has a very dense rail network, both standard and narrow gauge. The overwhelming majority of railways, built between the mid-19th and early 20th century, are still in regular operation today and electrified, a major exception being the Furka Steam Railway, the longest unelectrified line in the country and one of the highest rail crossings in Europe. Many railway companies, especially mountain railways, provide services with well-preserved historic trains for tourists, for instance the Rigi Railways, the oldest rack railway in Europe, and the Pilatus Railway, the steepest in the world. Two railways, the Albula Railway and the Bernina Railway, have been designated as a World Heritage Site, although they are essentially operated with modern rolling stock. Due to the availability of hydroelectric resources in the Alps, the Swiss network was electrified earlier than in the rest of Europe. Some of the most emblematic pre-World War II electric locomotives and trains are the Crocodile, notably used on the Gotthard Railway, and the Red Arrow. Both are occasionally operated by SBB Historic. Switzerland also comprehends a large number of funiculars, several still working with the original carriages, such as the Giessbachbahn.

===United Kingdom ===
In Britain, heritage railways are often railway lines which were run as commercial railways but were no longer needed (or closed down) and were taken over or re-opened by volunteers or non-profit organisations. The large number of heritage railways in the UK is due in part to the closure of many minor lines during the 1960s&#x27; Beeching cuts, and they were relatively easy to revive. There are between 100 and 150 heritage railways in the United Kingdom.

A typical British heritage railway will use steam locomotives and original rolling stock to create a period atmosphere, although some are concentrating on diesel and electric traction to re-create the post-steam era. Many run seasonally on partial routes, unconnected to a larger network (or railway), and charge high fares in comparison with transit services; as a result, they focus on the tourist and leisure markets. During the 1990s and 2000s, however, some heritage railways aimed to provide local transportation and extend their running seasons to carry commercial passenger traffic.
The first standard-gauge line to be preserved (not a victim of Beeching) was the Middleton Railway; the second, and the first to carry passengers, was the Bluebell Railway.

Not-for-profit heritage railways differ in their quantity of service and some lines see traffic only on summer weekends. The more successful, such as the Severn Valley Railway and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, may have up to five or six steam locomotives and operate a four-train service daily; smaller railways may run daily throughout the summer with only one steam locomotive. The Great Central Railway, the only preserved British main line with a double track, can operate over 50 trains on a busy timetable day.

After the privatisation of main-line railways, the line between not-for-profit heritage railways and for-profit branch lines may be blurred. The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway is an example of a commercial line run as a heritage operation and to provide local transportation, and the Severn Valley Railway has operated a few goods trains commercially. A number of heritage railway lines are regularly used by commercial freight operators.

Since the Bluebell Railway reopened to traffic in 1960, the definition of private standard gauge railways in the United Kingdom as preserved railways has evolved as the number of projects and their length, operating days and function have changed. The situation is further muddied by large variations in ownership-company structure, rolling stock and other assets. Unlike community railways, tourist railways in the UK are vertically integrated (although those operating mainly as charities separate their charitable and non-charitable activities for accounting purposes).

=== United States ===
==== Railroads ====

Heritage railways are known in the United States as tourist, historic, or scenic railroads. Most are remnants of original railroads, and some are reconstructed after having been scrapped. Some heritage railways preserve entire railroads in their original state using original structures, track, and motive power.
Examples of heritage railroads in the US by preservation type:

;Original
*East Broad Top Railroad and Coal Company (Pennsylvania)
*Nevada Northern Railway (Nevada)
*California Western Railroad (California)
*Stewartstown Railroad (Pennsylvania)
*Arcade and Attica Railroad (New York)

;Remnant
*Durango and Silverton Railroad (Colorado)
*Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad (Colorado and New Mexico)
*Hocking Valley Scenic Railway (Ohio)
*Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum (Tennessee)
*Strasburg Rail Road (Pennsylvania)
*Fox River Trolley Museum (Illinois)

;Reconstructed
*Sumpter Valley Railway (Oregon)
*Tweetsie Railroad (North Carolina)
*Virginia and Truckee Railroad (Nevada)
*Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington Railway (Maine)
*Fort Collins Municipal Railway (Colorado)
*Georgetown Loop Railroad (Colorado)

;National Park Related Lines
*Steamtown National Historic Site (Pennsylvania)
*Grand Canyon Railway (Arizona)
*Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad (Ohio)
*Golden Spike National Historical Park (Utah)

Other operations, such as the Valley Railroad or Hocking Valley Scenic Railway operate on historic track and utilize historic equipment, but are not reflective of the operations carried out by the original railroad they operate on. Hence, they do not fit into the Heritage Railway category, but rather Tourist Railway/Amusement.

==== Tramways ====

Heritage streetcar lines are operating in over 20 U.S. cities, and are in planning or construction stages in others. Several new heritage streetcar lines have been opened since the 1970s; some are stand-alone lines while others make use of a section of a modern light rail system.

Heritage streetcar systems operating in Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Dallas, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Boston, Massachusetts (MBTA Mattapan Trolley) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (SEPTA route 15); and Tampa, Florida, are among the larger examples. A heritage line operates in Charlotte, North Carolina, and will become a part of the city&#x27;s new transit system. Another such line, called The Silver Line, operates in San Diego.
The San Francisco Municipal Railway, or Muni, runs exclusively historic trolleys on its heavily used F Market &amp; Wharves line. The line serves Market Street and the tourist areas along the Embarcadero, including Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf.

Boston&#x27;s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority runs exclusively PCC streetcars on its Mattapan Line, part of that authority&#x27;s Red Line. The historic rolling stock is retained because doing so cost less than would a full rebuild of the line to accommodate either a heavy rail line (like the rest of the Red Line or the Blue or Orange Lines) or a modern light rail line (like the Green Line). It is also unique in that it used almost exclusively by commuters and is not particularly popular with tourists (and thus may not really be a true heritage system, despite the historic rolling stock).

Dallas has the M-Line Trolley. Denver has the Platte Valley Trolley, a heritage line recalling the open-sided streetcars of the early 20th century. Old Pueblo Trolley is a volunteer-run heritage line in Tucson, Arizona; its popularity inspired, in large part, a modern streetcar system for Tucson currently in the final planning stages, which would incorporate the heritage line. The VTA in San Jose, California, also maintains a heritage trolley fleet, for occasional use on the downtown portion of a new light rail system opened in 1988. Other cities with heritage streetcar lines include Galveston, Texas; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and San Pedro, California (home of the port of Los Angeles). The National Park Service operates a system in Lowell, Massachusetts.

Most heritage streetcar lines use overhead trolley wires to power the cars, as was the case with the vast majority of original streetcar lines. However, on the Galveston Island Trolley heritage line, which opened in 1988, using modern-day replicas of vintage trolleys, the cars were powered by an on-board diesel engine, as local authorities were concerned that overhead wires would be too susceptible to damage from hurricanes. In spite of that precaution, damage in 2008 from Hurricane Ike was heavy enough to put the line out of service indefinitely, and as of 2021 it has yet to reopen, but three streetcars are being repaired and reopening is planned.

Another heritage line lacking trolley wires was Savannah&#x27;s River Street Streetcar line, which opened in February 2009 and operated until around 2015. It was the first line to use a diesel/electric streetcar whose built-in electricity generator is powered by biodiesel. In El Reno, Oklahoma, the &quot;Heritage Express Trolley&quot; connects Heritage Park with downtown, using a single streetcar that has been equipped with a propane-powered on-board generator. The car formerly operated on SEPTA&#x27;s Norristown High Speed Line, where third-rail current collection is used. The El Reno line is single-track and long.

In Portland, Oregon, replica-vintage cars provided a heritage streetcar service, named Portland Vintage Trolley, along a section of that city&#x27;s 1986-operated light rail line from 1991 to 2014. Elsewhere in Portland, the Willamette Shore Trolley is a seasonal, volunteer-operated excursion service on a former freight railroad line, to Lake Oswego, Oregon. This operation uses a diesel-powered generator on a trailer towed or pushed by the streetcar, as the line lacks trolley wires. Similarly, the Astoria Riverfront Trolley in Astoria, Oregon, is a seasonal heritage-trolley service along a section of former freight railroad and using a diesel-powered generator on a trailer to provide electricity to the streetcar.

Other seasonal or weekends-only heritage streetcar lines operate in Yakima, Washington (Yakima Electric Railway Museum); Fort Collins, Colorado; and Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Fort Collins and Fort Smith lines are both operated by an original (as opposed to replica) Birney-type streetcar, and in both cases the individual car in use is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In Philadelphia, the Penn&#x27;s Landing Trolley operated seasonal and weekend service as a volunteer operation with former P&amp;W equipment between September 1982 and December 17, 1995, on the Philadelphia Belt Line track on Columbus Boulevard in the historic Penn&#x27;s Landing district.

Over 50 years later, the revival of extended streetcar operations in New Orleans is credited by many to the worldwide fame gained by its streetcars built by the Perley A. Thomas Car Works in 1922–23. These cars were operating on the system&#x27;s Desire route made famous by Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Some Perley Thomas cars were maintained in continuous service on the St. Charles Streetcar Line until Hurricane Katrina caused major damage to the right-of-way in 2005. The historic streetcars suffered only minor damage and several were transferred to serve on the, then recently rebuilt, Canal Street line while the St. Charles line was being repaired. By June 22, 2008, service was restored to the entire length of the St. Charles Streetcar line. The New Orleans&#x27; St. Charles streetcar line is a National Historic Landmark. Pre-Katrina, New Orleans had plans to reconstruct the Desire line along its original route down St. Claude Avenue. Instead, the Loyola-UPT line was extended by building a spur down North Rampart Street to Elysian Fields Avenue.

In San Francisco, parts of the cable car and Muni streetcar system (specifically the above-mentioned F Market &amp; Wharves line) are heritage lines, although they are also functioning parts of the city&#x27;s transit system. The cable cars are a National Historic Landmark and are rare examples of vehicles with this distinction. Located east of San Francisco is one of several museums in the U.S. that restore and operate vintage streetcars and interurbans, the Western Railway Museum.

==In popular culture==
The preservation of the Talyllyn Railway was the inspiration for the 1953 Ealing Studios comedy &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;. The film is centred on the preservation of a fictional Somerset branch line from Titfield to Mallingford. Filmed on the Camerton branch in the summer of 1952, the branch was lifted after production had finished.

Many preserved railways also served as a filming location for several production companies; for example, the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway served as a filming location for the 1970 adaptation of &quot;The Railway Children&quot;.

Series three of &quot;Survivors&quot; uses heritage railways to help reestablish transportation, communication and trade in post-apocalyptic England.

<doc id="154178" wikidata="Q17112768" url="?curid=154178" title="United States v. Klein">
<text>United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1871), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case stemming from the American Civil War (1861–1865) where Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase held that a Congressional statute &quot;impairing the effect of a pardon, and thus infringing the constitutional power of the Executive&quot; and was unconstitutional.

== Background ==
On December 8, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation offering a pardon to any person who had supported or fought for the Confederate Army, with full restoration of property rights, subject only to taking an oath of allegiance. The United States Congress had passed an act in 1863 that permitted an owner of property confiscated during the war to receive the proceeds from the sale of the confiscated property.

Based on the statute and the President&#x27;s proclamation, V.F. Wilson took the oath of allegiance and honored it until his death on July 22, 1865. John A. Klein, administrator of Wilson&#x27;s estate, then applied properly to the Court of Claims to recover the proceeds of the sale of property seized from Mr. Wilson.

Congress repealed the statute in 1867. The Court of Claims in 1869 decided that Wilson&#x27;s estate was entitled to the proceeds from the sale of his property. In 1870, Congress passed a law that prohibited the use of a presidential pardon as the basis for claiming sale proceeds and further said that the acceptance of such a pardon was evidence that the person pardoned had provided support to the South and was ineligible to recover sale proceeds. The statute contained a jurisdiction stripping provision: &quot;the Supreme Court, on appeal, shall have no further jurisdiction of the cause, and shall dismiss the same for want of jurisdiction&quot;.

The United States appealed to the Supreme Court based on the 1870 statute, which provided that since Wilson had accepted a presidential pardon, his estate was not entitled to the sale proceeds.

== Decision ==
In 1871, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1870 statute was unconstitutional and that Congress had exceeded its power by invading the province of the judicial branch by prescribing the rule of decision in a particular cause. The Court also ruled that Congress had impermissibly infringed the power of the executive branch by limiting the effect of a Presidential pardon.

Broadly speaking, &quot;Klein&quot; stands for the proposition that the legislative branch cannot impair the exclusive powers of another branch. Put another way, &quot;Klein&quot; recognizes and supports the fundamental value of separation of powers defined by the Constitution. Specifically, &quot;Klein&quot; means that Congress may not direct the outcome of a case by prescribing the rule of decision, nor may Congress impair the power and effect of a Presidential pardon. Read more broadly, &quot;Klein&quot; suggests, but does not state, that Congress may not use the Exceptions Clause to cripple the Court&#x27;s ability to be the final arbiter of what the Constitution means; this conclusion is strengthened by the Court&#x27;s holdings in &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot;, 521 U.S. 507, and especially &quot;Dickerson v. United States&quot;, 530 U.S. 428.

The essence of the argument is one of separation of powers: that the Constitution vests the judicial power in the judicial branch, and that neither the legislative nor the executive branch may interfere with the functioning of the judiciary. When Congress passed a law that had the effect of prescribing the rule of decision in a particular cause, Congress &quot;inadvertently passed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.&quot; Klein, 80 U.S. at 147. As the Court says: &quot;It is the intention of the Constitution that each of the great co-ordinate departments of the government — the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judicial — shall be, in its sphere, independent of the others.&quot; Id.

Justice Samuel F. Miller dissented, but only because he believed the respondent was not entitled to the property under the acts passed by Congress and the President&#x27;s pardons. He wrote specifically (and since his opinion was joined by Justice Joseph P. Bradley, the decision of the Court in this respect was unanimous) that he agreed that &quot;the act is unconstitutional, so far as it attempts to prescribe to the judiciary the effect to be given to an act of pardon or amnesty by the President. This power of pardon is confided to the President by the Constitution, and ... the legislative branch of the government cannot impair its force or effect in a judicial proceeding.&quot; Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) at 148.

==Subsequent case law==
In &quot;Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society&quot;, 503 U.S. 429 (1992), environmental groups filed separate lawsuits against the United States Forest Service and alleged that harvesting timber in forests home to an endangered owl violated several federal statutes. While litigation was pending, Congress had passed compromise legislation that prevented harvesting in certain areas, but it also stated, &quot;Congress hereby determines and directs that management [of the forests] according to subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5)... is adequate consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the basis for [the two cases,]&quot; which were identified by name and caption number. The Court of Appeals held that to be an unconstitutional intrusion on the judiciary&#x27;s authority, based on &quot;Klein&quot; because it directed a particular result in both cases. The Supreme Court reversed and upheld the statutes because it found that they had amended the applicable law.

In &quot;Bank Markazi v. Peterson&quot;, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), the Supreme Court upheld a law that abrogated all defenses of a party (Bank Markazi) in a single case, which was identified by docket number, and directed that if certain criteria relating to ownership of a bank account were met, the money in the account would be used to pay compensation previous awarded by the courts against the bank. The bank argued that the court should rely on &quot;Klein&quot; to find that Congress had unconstitutionally directed the outcome of the case. The majority opinion found that more recent case law, particularly &quot;Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society&quot;, has reduced the precedent value of &quot;Klein&quot;, but the Court clarified the role that &quot;Klein&quot; still has in American jurisprudence:

In Patchak v. Zinke, 138 S. Ct. 897 (2018), the Supreme Court upheld a statute that stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction over claims related to a particular governmental decision to take particular piece of land into trust for the benefit of a Native American Tribe. The result of the statute was to terminate a particular, pending case in favor of the government. There was no majority opinion, but Justice Thomas, for a plurality, opined that Klein did not apply because Congress changed the law, requiring the court to apply the new law to the pending case. The plurality read Congress&#x27;s power under the Exceptions Clause of the Constitution broadly, suggesting that Congress has nearly unlimited power to strip jurisdiction from the federal courts, even if the result is to terminate a pending case in favor of an identifiable party. In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts opined that not every statutory change &quot;changes the law&quot; within the meaning of Klein and that the Exceptions Clause does not permit Congress to withdraw jurisdiction to intervene in a particular pending case in a way that cuts out the role of the judiciary.

<text>Hubert Fauntleroy Julian (21 September 1897 – 19 February 1983) was a Trinidad-born American aviation pioneer. He was nicknamed &quot;[[List of military figures by nickname|the Black Eagle]]&quot;.

==Early years==
Hubert Fauntleroy Julian was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in 1897. His father, Henry, was a cocoa plantation manager in Toco. Julian caught his first glimpse of an airplane on 3 January 1913, when Frank Boland performed an exhibition flight, ultimately crashing and dying. The shock of the crash stayed with Julian who, after World War I, left his island home for Canada. There, in November 1920, he flew for the first time during a joyride with Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop. Shortly after this he designed and patented what was labeled an &quot;Aeroplane Safety Appliance.&quot;

==1920s==
In 1921, Julian left Montreal for good and moved to Harlem. Once there he came under the influence of the charismatic Marcus Garvey and joined the Universal Negro Improvement Association. This new &quot;Garveyvite&quot; soon adopted a new persona, rechristening himself &quot;Lieutenant Hubert Julian&quot; of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Julian had a tailor fashion for him a fake military uniform in order to push his new narrative. On 3 September 1922, Julian performed his first parachute jump at Curtiss Field on Long Island; the event was headlined with a flight by Bessie Coleman. Julian would make one more jump that year before teaming up with aviator Clarence Chamberlin who, in addition to teaching his new business partner how to truly handle an airplane, flew him up above Harlem where the Trinidadian parachuted several times, the most famous moment coming when he wore a crimson jumpsuit while playing &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; on a saxophone. This would be the stunt which caused H. Allen Smith to dub Julian &quot;the Black Eagle of Harlem&quot;. Julian also parachuted over Harlem while playing a gold-plated saxophone in October 1923.

In 1924, Julian, along with Chamberlin, began toying with the idea of performing a transatlantic flight, with stops in Florida, the West Indies, Central America, Brazil, and Saint Paul&#x27;s Rock (in the mid-Atlantic), from New York City to Liberia. An old seaplane was purchased and refitted for the proposed flight; Julian dubbed it the &quot;Ethiopia&quot;. On 4 July, with a crowd of thousands gathered at the banks of the Harlem River to witness his takeoff, Julian boarded his plane, after having UNIA members help raise some last-minute funds to pay off his investors, and soared into the sky. A few minutes would pass before Julian realized that one of his plane&#x27;s pontoons had filled up with water, throwing the aircraft&#x27;s weight off balance. Unable to regain control, Julian crashed into Flushing Bay.

Julian would try twice more to pilot a transatlantic flight before the 1920s came to end. The first of these two attempts ended when his plane&#x27;s wings were vandalized by unknown assailants while they were being stored in Happyland Park. The second, and final, attempt saw New York State Senator A. Spencer Feld take the helm of the endeavor, but after Amelia Earhart crossed the Atlantic Ocean, Julian felt dismayed at the prospect of performing something that had now been done by more than a handful of others and canceled the project.

==1930s==
During the first half of the 1930s, Julian made three trips to the Ethiopian Empire. It was during his second visit when he crashed Haile Selassie&#x27;s favorite plane, causing the emperor to ask Julian to leave his kingdom. But the Black Eagle would return on the eve of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, gaining a military commission to help defend the African kingdom. It was during this third trip when he would come to blows with John C. Robinson, the Brown Condor of Chicago, over jabs in the press which Julian attributed to Robinson. Once it became clear that the forces of Fascist Italy would prevail, Julian left the country. Julian returned to Ethiopia as a volunteer in the East African Campaign of 1940–41.

In December 1937, Julian in the position of equerry to Princess Almeria Ali of Egypt was left in charge of escorting the body of the princess&#x27; father Prince Hadji Ali of Egypt, who died November 5, from Paris to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for scientific study. Julian was entrusted with administering the prince&#x27;s $800,000 estate as well as returning the body to Egypt for interment in the family mausoleum. The prince, a vaudeville artist, was rumored to have a double stomach capable of allowing him to drink gasoline and water, bifurcated to each stomach. He would then squirt out the gasoline to ignite it followed by the water to extinguish the flames. The Amsterdam News claimed this venture by Julian was a fake, but later recanted with an apology. 

As a result of abdicating his British citizenship to accept Ethiopian citizenship and failing to apply for a re-entry permit to the U.S., in 1938, he experienced passport challenges that delayed his re-entry, subsequently compromising a $200,000 business deal potentially connected to a proposed non-stop flight from New York to Karachi, India. 

Julian spent his time stateside traveling with William Powell&#x27;s Five Blackbirds, an all black flying troupe who performed in the Midwest and California as well as performing piloting services for paying customers like Father Divine. December 1939, Julian attempted to settle a lawsuit between Father Divine and one of his fallen Angels, Mrs. Verinda Brown. New York Supreme Court Justice Benedict E. Dineen and both parties eventually agreed to the $12,000 in warehouse receipts for whiskey presented by Julian with the intention of covering Divine&#x27;s $6500 to $17,000 in claims. Julian purported to own more than $800,000 worth of 25-year old whiskey. Upwards of twenty-five defrauded Angels came forward as a result insisting on being repaid, forcing Julian to quickly withdraw his offer on the grounds of fairness to all and an inability to pay them all. He also embarked on a short-lived career as a film producer with the director Oscar Micheaux, helping to fund the distribution for two of Micheaux&#x27;s films: &quot;Lying Lips&quot; and &quot;The Notorious Eleanor Lee&quot;.

==1940s==

During the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Julian, along with many other American volunteers, left for Finland in order to help provide assistance. He was there for several months without seeing action, before departing back for the United States.

When Julian learned, from Giuseppe Bellanca, what Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring had been saying about peoples of color, the Black Eagle issued a challenge to the latter, offering the Nazi leader the chance to duel him in an aerial battle above the English Channel. Göring never gave an official response to the challenge, but Julian gained widespread praise for his bold verbal attacks.

Once the attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the United States into World War II, Julian, now in his 40s, enlisted into the military. He would serve less than a year, becoming an American citizen in the process, and earning an honorable discharge with the final rank of private first class.

==1950s and 1960s==
After the end of World War II Julian become a licensed arms dealer. His first contract was with the Arbenz government of Guatemala. He defied the FBI when, after being asked to cease his dealings, Julian continued selling. His second contract was with the Batista government of Cuba as it tried, and ultimately failed, to combat Fidel Castro&#x27;s revolutionaries. His third, and final, contract was with Moise Tshombe, leader of Katanga during the Congo Secession Crisis of the early 1960s. Julian was detained by United Nations forces for questioning and was in the end jailed for four months before being released. He retired upon his return to the United States.

==Later years and death==
Julian spent his retirement meeting the likes of Muhammad Ali and appearing on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. He died in 1983 and was buried at Calverton National Cemetery in Suffolk County, New York.

==Personal life==
Hubert Julian was married three times. His first marriage, which lasted only a few years, was to Edna Powell. His second marriage, his longest, was to Essie Gittens, whom he had known while growing up in Trinidad. They raised a young orphaned cousin of Essie&#x27;s, a girl named Olga, as their own. His third marriage, after Essie died, was to a woman named Doreen, who gave birth to Julian&#x27;s only biological child, Mark Anthony Bernard Julian, in July 1971.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;The Black Eagle of Harlem&quot; is a documentary by independent filmmaker Billy Tooma. It covers Julian&#x27;s life from his birth in Trinidad to his adventures in Harlem, Ethiopia, and everywhere between. It saw its world premiere on 24 June 2017, at the Aviation Hall of Fame &amp; Museum of New Jersey.
* Julian is the central character of Chasing the Black Eagle, an historical novel by Canadian author Bruce Geddes, published by Dundurn Press in 2023.

<text>Harry Belafonte ( ; born Harold George Bellanfanti Jr.; March 1, 1927 – April 25, 2023) was an American singer, actor, and civil rights activist who popularized calypso music with international audiences in the 1950s and 1960s. Belafonte&#x27;s career breakthrough album &quot;Calypso&quot; (1956) was the first million-selling LP by a single artist.

Belafonte was best known for his recordings of &quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&quot;, &quot;Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot;, and &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot;. He recorded and performed in many genres, including blues, folk, gospel, show tunes, and American standards. He also starred in films such as &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954), &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957), &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959), &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; (1972), and &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974). He made his final feature film appearance in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; (2018).

Belafonte considered the actor, singer, and activist Paul Robeson to be a mentor. Belafonte was also a close confidant of Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and acted as the American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador for juvenile justice issues. He was also a vocal critic of the policies of the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations. 

Belafonte won three Grammy Awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, an Emmy Award, and a Tony Award. In 1989, he received the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994. In 2014, he received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the academy&#x27;s 6th Annual Governors Awards and in 2022 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Early Influence category. He is one of the few performers to have received an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT), although he won the Oscar in a non-competitive category.

==Early life==
Belafonte was born Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. on March 1, 1927, at Lying-in Hospital in Harlem, New York, the son of Jamaican-born parents Harold George Bellanfanti Sr. (1900–1990), who worked as a chef, and Melvine Love (1906–1988), a housekeeper. There are disputed claims of his father&#x27;s place of birth, which is also stated as Martinique.

His mother was the child of a Scottish Jamaican mother and an Afro-Jamaican father, and his father was the child of an Afro-Jamaican mother and a Dutch-Jewish father of Sephardic Jewish descent. Harry Jr. was raised Catholic and attended parochial school at St. Charles Borromeo.

From 1932 to 1940, Belafonte lived with one of his grandmothers in her native country of Jamaica, where he attended Wolmer&#x27;s Schools. Upon returning to New York City, he dropped out of George Washington High School, after which he joined the U.S. Navy and served during World War II. In the 1940s, he worked as a janitor&#x27;s assistant, during which a tenant gave him, as a gratuity, two tickets to see the American Negro Theater. He fell in love with the art form and befriended Sidney Poitier, who was also financially struggling. They regularly purchased a single seat to local plays, trading places in between acts, after informing the other about the progression of the play.

At the end of the 1940s, Belafonte took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York City with the influential German director Erwin Piscator alongside Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Walter Matthau, Bea Arthur, and Poitier, while performing with the American Negro Theater. He subsequently received a Tony Award for his participation in the Broadway revue &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot; (1954). 
He also starred in the 1955 Broadway revue &quot;3 for Tonight&quot; with Gower Champion.

==Musical career==
=== Early years (1949–1955) ===
Belafonte started his career in music as a club singer in New York to pay for his acting classes. The first time he appeared in front of an audience, he was backed by the Charlie Parker band, which included Charlie Parker, Max Roach, and Miles Davis, among others. He launched his recording career as a pop singer on the Roost label in 1949, but quickly developed a keen interest in folk music, learning material through the Library of Congress&#x27; American folk songs archives. Along with guitarist and friend Millard Thomas, Belafonte soon made his debut at the legendary jazz club The Village Vanguard. He signed a contract with RCA Victor in 1953, recording regularly for the label until 1974. Belafonte also performed during the Rat Pack era in Las Vegas. Belafonte&#x27;s first widely released single, which went on to become his &quot;signature&quot; audience participation song in virtually all his live performances, was &quot;Matilda&quot;, recorded April 27, 1953. Between 1953 and 1954, he was a cast member of the Broadway musical revue and sketch comedy show John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac where he sang &quot;Mark Twain&quot;, of which he was also the songwriter. 
=== Rise to fame (1956–1958) ===

Following his success in the film &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954), Belafonte had his breakthrough album with &quot;Calypso&quot; (1956), which became the first LP in the world to sell more than one million copies in a year. He stated that it was the first million-selling album ever in England. The album is number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Album&quot; list for having spent 31 weeks at number 1, 58 weeks in the top ten, and 99 weeks on the U.S. chart. The album introduced American audiences to calypso music, which had originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 19th century, and Belafonte was dubbed the &quot;King of Calypso&quot;, a title he wore with reservations since he had no claims to any Calypso Monarch titles.

One of the songs included in the album is the now famous &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, listed as &quot;Day-O&quot; on the &quot;Calypso&quot; LP, which reached number five on the pop chart and featured its signature lyric &quot;Day-O&quot;.

Many of the compositions recorded for &quot;Calypso&quot;, including &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot; and &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot;, gave songwriting credit to Irving Burgie.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot; was released in March 1957 and spent ten weeks in the top 10 of the UK singles chart, reaching a peak of number two, and in August, &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; reached number three, spending 14 weeks in the top 10. In November, &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot; reached number one in the UK, where it spent seven weeks.

=== Middle career (1959–1970) ===

While primarily known for calypso, Belafonte recorded in many different genres, including blues, folk, gospel, show tunes, and American standards. His second-most popular hit, which came immediately after &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot;, was the comedic tune &quot;Mama Look at Bubu&quot;, also known as &quot;Mama Look a Boo-Boo&quot;, originally recorded by Lord Melody in 1955, in which he sings humorously about misbehaving and disrespectful children. It reached number 11 on the pop chart.

In 1959, Belafonte starred in &quot;Tonight With Belafonte&quot;, a nationally televised special that featured Odetta, who sang &quot;Water Boy&quot; and performed a duet with Belafonte of &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in My Bucket&quot; that hit the national charts in 1961. Belafonte was the first Jamaican American to win an Emmy, for &quot;Revlon Revue: Tonight with Belafonte&quot; (1959). Two live albums, both recorded at Carnegie Hall in 1959 and 1960, enjoyed critical and commercial success. From his 1959 album, &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; became part of his regular routine and one of his signature songs. He was one of many entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the inaugural gala of President John F. Kennedy in 1961, which included Ella Fitzgerald and Mahalia Jackson, among others. Later that year, RCA Victor released another calypso album, &quot;Jump Up Calypso&quot;, which went on to become another million seller. During the 1960s he introduced several artists to U.S. audiences, most notably South African singer Miriam Makeba and Greek singer Nana Mouskouri. His album &quot;Midnight Special&quot; (1962) included Bob Dylan as harmonica player.

As the Beatles and other stars from Britain began to dominate the U.S. pop charts, Belafonte&#x27;s commercial success diminished; 1964&#x27;s &quot;Belafonte at The Greek Theatre&quot; was his last album to appear in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 40. His last hit single, &quot;A Strange Song&quot;, was released in 1967 and peaked at number 5 on the adult contemporary music charts. Belafonte received Grammy Awards for the albums &quot;Swing Dat Hammer&quot; (1960) and &quot;An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba&quot; (1965), the latter of which dealt with the political plight of black South Africans under apartheid. He earned six Gold Records.

During the 1960s, Belafonte appeared on TV specials alongside artists such as Julie Andrews, Petula Clark, Lena Horne, and Nana Mouskouri. In 1967, Belafonte was the first non-classical artist to perform at the prestigious Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) in Upstate New York, soon to be followed by concerts there by the Doors, the 5th Dimension, the Who, and Janis Joplin.

From February 5 to 9, 1968, Belafonte guest hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; substituting for Johnny Carson. Among his interview guests were Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

=== Later recordings and subsequent activities (1971–2017) ===
Belafonte&#x27;s fifth and final calypso album, &quot;Calypso Carnival&quot;, was issued by RCA in 1971. Belafonte&#x27;s recording activity slowed down after releasing his final album for RCA in 1974. From the mid-1970s to early 1980s, Belafonte spent most of his time on tour, which included concerts in Japan, Europe, and Cuba. In 1977, Columbia Records released the album &quot;Turn the World Around&quot;, with a strong focus on world music.

In 1978, he appeared as a guest star on an episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, on which he performed his signature song &quot;Day-O&quot;. However, the episode is best known for Belafonte&#x27;s rendition of the spiritual song &quot;Turn the World Around&quot;, from the album of the same name, which he performed with specially made Muppets that resembled African tribal masks. It became one of the series&#x27; most famous performances and was reportedly Jim Henson&#x27;s favorite episode. After Henson&#x27;s death in May 1990, Belafonte was asked to perform the song at Henson&#x27;s memorial service. &quot;Turn the World Around&quot; was also included in the 2005 official hymnal supplement of the Unitarian Universalist Association, &quot;Singing the Journey&quot;.

From 1979 to 1989, Belafonte served on the Royal Winnipeg Ballet&#x27;s board of directors. 

In December 1984, soon after Band Aid, a group of popular British and Irish artists, released Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas? Belafonte decided to create an American benefit single for African famine relief. With fundraiser Ken Kragen, he enlisted Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson, The song they produced and recorded, &quot;We Are the World&quot;, brought together some of the era&#x27;s best-known American musicians and is the eighth-best-selling single of all time with physical sales in excess of 20 million copies. In 1986 the American Music Awards named &quot;We Are the World&quot; &quot;Song of the Year&quot;, and honored Belafonte with the Award of Appreciation. 
Belafonte released his first album of original material in over a decade, &quot;Paradise in Gazankulu&quot;, in 1988, which contained ten protest songs against the South African former Apartheid policy, and was his last studio album. In the same year Belafonte, as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, attended a symposium in Harare, Zimbabwe, to focus attention on child survival and development in Southern African countries. As part of the symposium, he performed a concert for UNICEF. A Kodak video crew filmed the concert, which was released as a 60-minute concert video titled &quot;Global Carnival&quot;.

Following a lengthy recording hiatus, &quot;An Evening with Harry Belafonte and Friends&quot;, a soundtrack and video of a televised concert, were released in 1997 by Island Records. &quot;The Long Road to Freedom: An Anthology of Black Music&quot;, a huge multi-artist project recorded by RCA during the 1960s and 1970s, was finally released by the label in 2001. Belafonte went on the &quot;Today Show&quot; to promote the album on September 11, 2001, and was interviewed by Katie Couric just minutes before the first plane hit the World Trade Center. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package, for Best Album Notes, and for Best Historical Album.
Belafonte received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1989. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994 and he won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. He performed sold-out concerts globally through the 1950s to the 2000s. His last concert was a benefit concert for the Atlanta Opera on October 25, 2003. In a 2007 interview, he stated that he had since retired from performing.

On January 29, 2013, Belafonte was the keynote speaker and 2013 honoree for the MLK Celebration Series at the Rhode Island School of Design. Belafonte used his career and experiences with Dr. King to speak on the role of artists as activists.

Belafonte was inducted as an honorary member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity on January 11, 2014.

In March 2014, Belafonte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in Boston.

In 2017, Belafonte released &quot;When Colors Come Together&quot;, an anthology of some of his earlier recordings, produced by his son David, who wrote lyrics for an updated version of &quot;Island In The Sun&quot;, arranged by longtime Belafonte musical director Richard Cummings, and featuring Harry Belafonte&#x27;s grandchildren Sarafina and Amadeus and a children&#x27;s choir.

==Film career==
=== Early film career (1953–1956) ===

Belafonte starred in numerous films. His first film role was in &quot;Bright Road&quot; (1953), in which he supported female lead Dorothy Dandridge. The two subsequently starred in Otto Preminger&#x27;s hit musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954). Ironically, Belafonte&#x27;s singing in the film was dubbed by an opera singer, as was Dandridge&#x27;s, both voices being deemed unsuitable for their roles.

=== Rise as an actor (1957–1959) ===
Realizing his own star power, Belafonte was subsequently able to land several (then) controversial film roles. In &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957), there are hints of an affair between Belafonte&#x27;s character and the character played by Joan Fontaine; the film also starred James Mason, Dandridge, Joan Collins, Michael Rennie, and John Justin. In 1959, Belafonte starred in and produced (through his company HarBel Productions) Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot;, in which Belafonte plays a bank robber uncomfortably teamed with a racist partner (Robert Ryan). Belafonte also co-starred with Inger Stevens in &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot;. Belafonte was offered the role of Porgy in Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, where he would have once again starred opposite Dandridge, but refused the role because he objected to its racial stereotyping; Sidney Poitier played the role instead.

=== Later film and theatre involvement (1972–2018) ===

Dissatisfied with most of the film roles offered to him during the 1960s, Belafonte concentrated on music. In the early 1970s, Belafonte appeared in more films, among which are two with Poitier: &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; (1972) and &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974). In 1984, Belafonte produced and scored the musical film &quot;Beat Street&quot;, dealing with the rise of hip-hop culture. Together with Arthur Baker, he produced the gold-certified soundtrack of the same name. Four of his songs appeared in the 1988 film &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; including &quot;Day-O&quot; and &quot;Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)&quot;. 

Belafonte next starred in a major film in the mid-1990s, appearing with John Travolta in the race-reverse drama &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; (1995); and in Robert Altman&#x27;s jazz age drama &quot;Kansas City&quot; (1996), the latter of which garnered him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in the TV drama &quot;Swing Vote&quot; (1999). In 2006, Belafonte appeared in &quot;Bobby&quot;, Emilio Estevez&#x27;s ensemble drama about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy; he played Nelson, a friend of an employee of the Ambassador Hotel (Anthony Hopkins). 

His final film appearance was in Spike Lee&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; (2018) as an elderly civil rights pioneer.

==Political activism==

Belafonte is said to have married politics and pop culture. Belafonte&#x27;s political beliefs were greatly inspired by the singer, actor, and civil rights activist Paul Robeson, who mentored him. Robeson opposed not only racial prejudice in the United States but also western colonialism in Africa. Belafonte refused to perform in the American South from 1954 until 1961.

Belafonte gave the keynote address at the ACLU of Northern California&#x27;s annual Bill of Rights Day Celebration In December 2007 and was awarded the Chief Justice Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award. The 2011 Sundance Film Festival featured the documentary film &quot;Sing Your Song&quot;, a biographical film focusing on Belafonte&#x27;s contribution to and his leadership in the civil rights movement in America and his endeavors to promote social justice globally. In 2011, Belafonte&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Song&quot; was published by Knopf Books.

===Involvement in the civil rights movement===

Belafonte supported the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s and was one of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s confidants. After King had been arrested for his involvement in the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, he began traveling to Northern cities to spread awareness and acquire donations for those struggling with social segregation and oppression in the South. The two met at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York, in March of the following year. This interaction led to years of joint political activism and friendship. Belafonte joined King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, during the 1958 Washington D.C. Youth March for Integrated Schools, and in 1963, he backed King in conversations with Robert F. Kennedy, helping to organize the 1963 March on Washington—the site of King&#x27;s famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; Speech. He provided for King&#x27;s family since King earned only $8,000 ($80,000 in today&#x27;s money) a year as a preacher. As with many other civil rights activists, Belafonte was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. During the 1963 Birmingham campaign, Belafonte bailed King out of the Birmingham, Alabama jail and raised $50,000 to release other civil rights protesters. He contributed to the 1961 Freedom Rides, and supported voter registration drives He later recalled, &quot;Paul Robeson had been my first great formative influence; you might say he gave me my backbone. Martin King was the second; he nourished my soul.&quot; Throughout his career, Belafonte was an advocate for political and humanitarian causes, such as the Anti-Apartheid Movement and USA for Africa. From 1987 until his death, he was a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

During the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964, Belafonte bankrolled the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, flying to Mississippi that August with Sidney Poitier and $60,000 in cash and entertaining crowds in Greenwood. In 1968, Belafonte appeared on a Petula Clark primetime television special on NBC. In the middle of a duet of &quot;On the Path of Glory&quot;, Clark smiled and briefly touched Belafonte&#x27;s arm, which prompted complaints from Doyle Lott, the advertising manager of the show&#x27;s sponsor, Plymouth Motors. Lott wanted to retape the segment, but Clark, who had ownership of the special, told NBC that the performance would be shown intact or she would not allow it to be aired at all. Newspapers reported the controversy, Lott was relieved of his responsibilities, and when the special aired, it attracted high ratings.

Belafonte taped an appearance on an episode of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; to be aired on September 29, 1968, performing a controversial Mardi Gras number intercut with footage from the 1968 Democratic National Convention riots. CBS censors deleted the segment. The full unedited content was broadcast in 1993 as part of a complete &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; syndication package.

=== Involvement in the Kennedy campaign ===
In the 1960 election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, notable Black athlete Jackie Robinson advocated his support for the Nixon campaign. His reasoning for doing so was his perception of Kennedy&#x27;s championing of the Civil Rights movement as disingenuous. Because of Robinson&#x27;s social impact on Black Americans, the Democratic Party was determined to find a comparable Black endorser for Kennedy&#x27;s campaign. Fresh off of his win as the first Black man to receive an Emmy Award for his work on &quot;Tonight with Belafonte&quot;, Belafonte was Kennedy&#x27;s pick to fill the endorsement position.

The two met in Belafonte&#x27;s apartment, where Kennedy had hoped to convince Belafonte to mobilize support for his campaign. He thought to accomplish this by having Belafonte mobilize his influence amongst other Black entertainers of the era, persuading them to rally for Kennedy&#x27;s presidential nomination. Unexpectedly, Belafonte was not so impressed by the candidate, sharing the same sentiments as Robinson about Kennedy&#x27;s role (or lack thereof) in maintaining civil rights as an essential part of his campaign. To improve his engagement with Black America, Belafonte suggested to Kennedy that he contact Martin Luther King, making a connection to a viable source of leadership within the movement. Kennedy, though, was hesitant with this suggestion, questioning the social impact the preacher could make on the campaign. After much convincing–as Kennedy and King would later meet in June 1960–the two men negotiated a deal that if Nixon became the nominee for the Republican party, Belafonte would support Kennedy&#x27;s presidential pursuits. Belafonte&#x27;s endorsement of the campaign was further substantiated after both Kennedy brothers had worked to bail King out of jail in Atlanta after a sit-in, engaging with a Georgia judge.

Joining the Hollywood for Kennedy committee, Belafonte appeared in a 1960 campaign commercial for Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Unfortunately, the commercial was shown on television for one broadcasting. Belafonte also attended and performed at Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural ball. Kennedy later named Belafonte cultural advisor to the Peace Corps. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Belafonte supported Lyndon B. Johnson for the 1964 United States presidential election.

=== The Baldwin-Kennedy Meeting ===
Renowned author James Baldwin contacted Belafonte three years after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s election. The purpose of the call was to invite Belafonte to a meeting to speak with Attorney General Robert Kennedy about the continued plight of the Black people in America. This event was known as the Baldwin-Kennedy Meeting. Belafonte met with fifteen others, including Kennedy and Baldwin, in Kennedy&#x27;s Central Park South apartment on May 24, 1963.

The other members included were Thais Aubrey, David Baldwin, Edwin Berry, Kenneth Clark, Eddie Fales, Lorraine Hansberry, Lena Horne, Clarence Jones, Burke Marshall, Henry Morgenthau III, June Shagaloff, Jerome Smith, and Rip Torn.

The guests engaged in cordial political and social conversation. Later, the talk led to an investigation of the position of Black people in the Vietnam War. Offended by Kennedy&#x27;s implication that Black men should serve in the war, Jerome Smith scolded the young Attorney General. Smith, a Black man and Civil Rights advocate had been severely beaten while fighting for the movement&#x27;s cause, which enforced his strong resistance to Kennedy&#x27;s assertion, frustrated that he should fight for a country that did not seem to want to fight for him.

A short time after the confrontation, Belafonte spoke with Kennedy. Belafonte then told him that even with the meeting&#x27;s tension, he needed to be in the presence of a man like Smith to understand Black people&#x27;s frustration with patriotism that Kennedy and other leaders could not understand.

===Obama administration===
In the 1950s, Belafonte was a supporter of the African American Students Foundation, which gave a grant to Barack Obama Sr., the late father of 44th U.S. president Barack Obama, to study at the University of Hawaii in 1959.

In 2011, Belafonte commented on the Obama administration and the role that popular opinion played in shaping its policies. &quot;I think [Obama] plays the game that he plays because he sees no threat from evidencing concerns for the poor.&quot;

On December 9, 2012, in an interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Belafonte expressed dismay that many political leaders in the United States continue to oppose Obama&#x27;s policies even after his reelection: &quot;The only thing left for Barack Obama to do is to work like a third-world dictator and just put all of these guys in jail. You&#x27;re violating the American desire.&quot;

On February 1, 2013, Belafonte received the NAACP&#x27;s Spingarn Medal, and in the televised ceremony, he counted Constance L. Rice among those previous recipients of the award whom he regarded highly for speaking up &quot;to remedy the ills of the nation.&quot;

In November 2014, Belafonte attended “Revolution and Religion,” a dialogue between Bob Avakian and Cornel West at Riverside Church in New York City.

===Support for Bernie Sanders===
In 2016, Belafonte endorsed Vermont U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, saying: &quot;I think he represents opportunity, I think he represents a moral imperative, I think he represents a certain kind of truth that&#x27;s not often evidenced in the course of politics.&quot;

Belafonte was an honorary cochairman of the Women&#x27;s March on Washington, which took place on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.

=== The Sanders Institute ===
Belafonte was a fellow at The Sanders Institute.

== Humanitarian activism ==
===HIV/AIDS crisis===

In 1985, Belafonte helped organize the Grammy Award-winning song &quot;We Are the World&quot;, a multi-artist effort to raise funds for Africa. He performed in the Live Aid concert that same year. In 1987, he received an appointment to UNICEF as a goodwill ambassador. Following his appointment, Belafonte traveled to Dakar, Senegal, where he served as chairman of the International Symposium of Artists and Intellectuals for African Children. He also helped to raise funds—along with more than 20 other artists—in the largest concert ever held in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1994, he embarked on a mission to Rwanda and launched a media campaign to raise awareness of the needs of Rwandan children.

In 2001, Belafonte visited South Africa to support the campaign against HIV/AIDS. In 2002, Africare awarded him the Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award for his efforts. In 2004, Belafonte traveled to Kenya to stress the importance of educating children in the region.

===Prostate Cancer awareness===
Belafonte had been involved in prostate cancer advocacy since 1996, when he was diagnosed and successfully treated for the disease. On June 27, 2006, Belafonte received the BET Humanitarian Award at the 2006 BET Awards. He was named one of nine 2006 Impact Award recipients by &quot;&quot;.

===Work with UNICEF===
On October 19, 2007, Belafonte represented UNICEF on Norwegian television to support the annual telethon (TV Aksjonen) and helped raise a world record of $10 per Norwegian citizen.

===Various Activist work===
Belafonte was also an ambassador for the Bahamas. He sat on the board of directors of the Advancement Project. He also served on the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation.

=== New York City Pride Parade ===
In 2013, Belafonte was named a grand marshal of the New York City Pride Parade alongside Edie Windsor and Earl Fowlkes.

== Belafonte and foreign policy ==
Belafonte was a longtime critic of U.S. foreign policy. He began making controversial political statements on the subject in the early 1980s. At various times, he made statements opposing the U.S. embargo on Cuba; praising Soviet peace initiatives; attacking the U.S. invasion of Grenada; praising the Abraham Lincoln Brigade; honoring Ethel and Julius Rosenberg; and praising Fidel Castro. Belafonte is also known for his visit to Cuba that helped ensure hip-hop&#x27;s place in Cuban society. According to Geoffrey Baker&#x27;s article &quot;Hip hop, Revolucion! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba&quot;, in 1999, Belafonte met with representatives of the rap community immediately before meeting with Castro. This meeting resulted in Castro&#x27;s personal approval of, and hence the government&#x27;s involvement in, the incorporation of rap into his country&#x27;s culture. In a 2003 interview, Belafonte reflected upon this meeting&#x27;s influence:
&quot;When I went back to Havana a couple years later, the people in the hip-hop community came to see me and we hung out for a bit. They thanked me profusely and I said, &#x27;Why?&#x27; and they said, &#x27;Because your little conversation with Fidel and the Minister of Culture on hip-hop led to there being a special division within the ministry and we&#x27;ve got our own studio.&#x27;.&quot;

Belafonte was active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement. In 1987, he was the master of ceremonies at a reception honoring African National Congress President Oliver Tambo at Roosevelt House, Hunter College, in New York City. The reception was held by the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and The Africa Fund. He was a board member of the TransAfrica Forum and the Institute for Policy Studies.

===Opposition to the George W. Bush administration===
Belafonte achieved widespread attention for his political views in 2002 when he began making a series of comments about President George W. Bush, his administration and the Iraq War. During an interview with Ted Leitner for San Diego&#x27;s 760 KFMB, on October 10, 2002, Belafonte referred to Malcolm X. Belafonte said:

Belafonte used the quotation to characterize former United States Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Powell and Rice both responded, with Powell calling the remarks &quot;unfortunate&quot; and Rice saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t need Harry Belafonte to tell me what it means to be black.&quot;

The comment resurfaced in an interview with Amy Goodman for &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; in 2006. In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez: &quot;No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we&#x27;re here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution.&quot; Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte&#x27;s presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: &quot;AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable.&quot;

During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to the hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: &quot;What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?&quot; In response to criticism about his remarks, Belafonte asked: &quot;What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? ... By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist.&quot; When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: &quot;Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy.&quot;

In another interview, Belafonte remarked that while his comments may have been &quot;hasty&quot;, he felt that the Bush administration suffered from &quot;arrogance wedded to ignorance&quot; and its policies around the world were &quot;morally bankrupt.&quot; In a January 2006 speech to the annual meeting of the Arts Presenters Members Conference, Belafonte referred to &quot;the new Gestapo of Homeland Security&quot;, saying: &quot;You can be arrested and have no right to counsel!&quot; During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in January 2006, Belafonte said that if he could choose his epitaph, it would read &quot;Harry Belafonte, Patriot.&quot;

In 2004, he was awarded the Domestic Human Rights Award in San Francisco by Global Exchange.

==Business career==
Belafonte liked and often visited the Caribbean island of Bonaire. He and Maurice Neme of Oranjestad, Aruba, formed a joint venture to create a luxurious private community on Bonaire named Belnem, a portmanteau of the two men&#x27;s names. Construction began on June 3, 1966. The neighborhood is managed by the Bel-Nem Caribbean Development Corporation. Belafonte and Neme served as its first directors. In 2017, Belnem was home to 717 people.

==Personal life, health and death==
Belafonte and Marguerite Byrd were married from 1948 to 1957. They had two daughters: Adrienne and Shari. They separated when Byrd was pregnant with Shari. Adrienne and her daughter Rachel Blue founded the Anir Foundation/Experience, focused on humanitarian work in southern Africa.

In 1953, Belafonte was financially able to move from Washington Heights, Manhattan, &quot;into a white neighborhood in East Elmhurst, Queens.&quot;

Belafonte had an affair with actress Joan Collins during the filming of &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;.

On March 8, 1957, Belafonte married his second wife Julie Robinson (1928–2024), a dancer with the Katherine Dunham Company who was of Jewish descent. They had two children: Gina and David. After 47 years of marriage, Belafonte and Robinson divorced in 2004.

In Fall 1958, Belafonte was looking for an apartment to rent on the Upper West Side. After he had been turned away from other apartment buildings due to being black, he had his white publicist rent an apartment at 300 West End Avenue for him. When he moved in, and the owner realized that he was an African American, he was asked to leave. Belafonte not only refused, but he also used three dummy real estate companies to buy the building and converted it into a co-op, inviting his friends, both white and black, to buy apartments. He lived in the 21-room, 6-bedroom apartment for 48 years. In April 2008, he married Pamela Frank, a photographer.
Belafonte had five grandchildren: Rachel and Brian through his children with Marguerite Byrd, and Maria, Sarafina and Amadeus through his children with Robinson. He had two great-grandchildren by his oldest grandson Brian. In October 1998, Belafonte contributed a letter to Liv Ullmann&#x27;s book &quot;Letter to My Grandchild&quot;.

In 1996, Belafonte was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was treated for the disease. He suffered a stroke in 2004, which took away his inner-ear balance. From 2019, Belafonte&#x27;s health began to decline, but he remained an active and prominent figure in the civil rights movement.

Belafonte died from congestive heart failure at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, on April 25, 2023, at the age of 96.

<text>Raymond Quevedo (24 March 1892 – 22 February 1962), better known as Atilla the Hun, was a calypsonian from Trinidad. He began singing in 1911 and was at his most prominent in the 1930s and 1940s. He was one of the pioneers in spreading awareness of calypso beyond its birthplace in Trinidad and Tobago. Together with the Roaring Lion (Rafael de Leon) he brought calypso to the United States for the first time in 1934. One of his popular calypsos was &quot;FDR in Trinidad&quot;, commemorating U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s 1936 trip to Trinidad.

Atilla competed in the first Calypso King contest in 1939, and won the title in both 1946 and 1947.

Known as a defender of the poor, Atilla was able to transition to a political career. When several of his records were censored he composed &quot;The Banning of Records&quot;, which was itself banned.

Atilla was the first calypsonian to hold elected public office; he was elected to the Port of Spain City Council in 1946 and was elected to the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago in 1950 representing the St. George County East. (See: &quot;Elections in Trinidad and Tobago&quot;). He also authored &quot;Atilla&#x27;s Kaiso: A Short History of Trinidad Calypso&quot; with John La Rose, published posthumously in 1983.

<doc id="154189" wikidata="Q1140155" url="?curid=154189" title="Great Train Robbery (1963)">
<text>The Great Train Robbery was the robbery of £2.61 million (worth about £ million GBP, equivalent to approximately $3.284 million USD, in 2023) from a Royal Mail train travelling from Glasgow to London on the West Coast Main Line in the early hours of 8 August 1963 at Bridego Railway Bridge, Ledburn, near Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, England.

After tampering with the lineside signals to bring the train to a halt, a gang of 15, led by Bruce Reynolds, attacked the train. Other gang members included Gordon Goody, Buster Edwards, Charlie Wilson, Roy James, John Daly, Jimmy White, Ronnie Biggs, Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Bob Welch and Roger Cordrey, as well as three men known only as numbers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;; two were later identified as Harry Smith and Danny Pembroke. A 16th man, an unnamed retired train driver, was also present.

With careful planning based on inside information from an individual known as &quot;The Ulsterman&quot;, whose real identity has never been established, the robbers escaped with over £2.61 million. The bulk of the stolen money has never been recovered. The gang did not use any firearms, though Jack Mills, the train driver, was beaten over the head with a metal bar and suffered serious head injuries. After his partial recovery, Mills returned to work doing light duties. He retired in 1967 and died in 1970 due to an unrelated illness. Mills never overcame the trauma of the robbery. After the robbery, the gang hid at Leatherslade Farm. The police found this hideout, and incriminating evidence, a Monopoly board with fingerprints, led to the eventual arrest and conviction of most of the gang. The ringleaders were sentenced to 30 years in prison.

==Robbery==
===Planning===
The plan to intercept and rob the overnight Glasgow to London mail train was based on information from an unnamed senior security officer within the Royal Mail who had detailed knowledge of the amounts of money carried; he was introduced to two of the criminals who would carry out the raid—Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards—by a London solicitor&#x27;s clerk, Brian Field.

The raid was devised over several months by a core team: Goody and Edwards along with Bruce Reynolds, and Charlie Wilson, with Reynolds assuming the role of &quot;mastermind&quot;. This gang, although very successful in the criminal underworld, had virtually no experience in stopping and robbing trains, so it was agreed to enlist the help of another London gang called The South Coast Raiders. This group included Tommy Wisbey, Bob Welch, and Jim Hussey, who were already &quot;accomplished&quot; train robbers. This group also included Roger Cordrey, a man who was a specialist in rigging the track-side signals to stop the train.

Other associates (including Ronnie Biggs, a man Reynolds had previously met in jail) were added as the organisation evolved. The final gang who took part in the raid was composed of sixteen men.

===Royal Mail train===
At 18:50 on Wednesday 7 August 1963, the travelling post office (TPO) &quot;Up Special&quot; train set off from Glasgow Central station en route to Euston Station in London. It was scheduled to arrive at Euston at 04:00 the following morning. The train was hauled by English Electric Type 4 (later Class 40) diesel-electric locomotive D326 (later 40 126). The train consisted of 12 carriages and carried 72 Post Office staff who sorted mail during the journey.

Mail was loaded onto the train at Glasgow, during additional station stops en route, and from line-side collection points where local post office staff would hang mail sacks on elevated track-side hooks that were caught by nets deployed by the on-board staff. Sorted mail on the train could be dropped off at the same time. This process of exchange allowed mail to be distributed locally without delaying the train with unnecessary stops. One of the carriages involved in the robbery is preserved at the Nene Valley Railway.

The second carriage behind the engine was known as the HVP (high-value packages) coach, which carried large amounts of money and registered mail for sorting. Usually, the value of the shipment was in the region of £300,000, but because the previous weekend had been a UK Bank Holiday weekend, the total on the day of the robbery was to be between £2.5 and £3 million.

In 1960, the Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) recommended the fitting of alarms to all TPOs with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve. By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over the windows and bolts and catches on the doors, but at the time of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used. The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented. This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and post office officials to deter any souvenir hunters.

===Stopping the train===
The robbers tampered with a signal light on the West Coast Main Line at Sears Crossing, Ledburn, between Leighton Buzzard and Cheddington, covering the green light with a glove and using a battery to power the red light. Just after 03:00 on 8 August, the driver, 58-year-old Jack Mills from Crewe, duly stopped the train at the signal. As a signal stop was unexpected at this time and place, the locomotive&#x27;s second crew member, known as the second man, 26-year-old David Whitby, also from Crewe, climbed down from the cab to call the signalman from a line-side telephone, only to find the cables had been cut. As he returned to the train he was overpowered by one of the robbers. Meanwhile, gang members entered the engine cabin from both sides. As Mills grappled with one robber he was struck from behind by another with a cosh and rendered semi-conscious.

The robbers now had to move the train to Bridego Bridge (now known as Mentmore Bridge), approximately half a mile (800 m) further along the track, where they planned to unload the money.
One of the robbers had spent months befriending railway staff and familiarising himself with the layout and operation of trains and carriages. Ultimately though, it was decided that it would be better to use an experienced train driver to move the locomotive and the first two carriages from the signals to the bridge after uncoupling the carriages containing the rest of the sorters and the ordinary mail.

On that night, the gang&#x27;s hired train driver (an acquaintance of Ronnie Biggs, later referred to as &quot;Stan Agate&quot; or &quot;Peter&quot;) was unable to operate this newer type of locomotive; having driven trains for many years, he was by then retired and was experienced only on shunting locomotives on the Southern Region. With no alternative available to them, it was quickly decided that Mills would have to move the train to the stopping point near the bridge, which was indicated by a white sheet stretched between poles on the track. Biggs&#x27;s only task was to supervise Agate&#x27;s participation in the robbery, and when it became obvious that Agate was not able to drive the train, he and Biggs were sent to the waiting truck to help load the mail bags.

===Removing the money===
The train was stopped at Bridego Bridge, and the robbers&#x27; &quot;assault force&quot; attacked the HVP carriage. Frank Dewhurst was in charge of the three other postal workers (Leslie Penn, Joseph Ware and John O&#x27;Connor) in the HVP carriage. Thomas Kett, assistant inspector in charge of the train from Carlisle to Euston, was also in the carriage. Dewhurst and Kett were hit with coshes when they made a vain attempt to prevent the robbers from storming the carriage. Once the robbers had entered the carriage, the staff could put up no effective resistance and there was no police officer or security guard on board to assist them. The staff were made to lie face down on the floor in a corner of the carriage. Mills and Whitby were then brought into the carriage, handcuffed together, and put down beside the staff.

The robbers removed all but eight of the 128 sacks from the HVP carriage, which they transferred in about 15–20 minutes to the waiting truck by forming a human chain. The gang departed in their Austin Loadstar truck some 30 minutes after the robbery had begun and, in an effort to mislead any potential witnesses, they used two Land Rover vehicles, both of which bore the registration plates BMG 757A.
===Getaway and planned clean-up===
The gang then headed along minor roads, listening for police broadcasts on a VHF radio, the journey taking somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour, and arrived back at Leatherslade Farm at around 04:30, at around the same time as the first reports of the crime were being made. Leatherslade was a run-down farm from the crime scene, between Oakley and Brill. It had been bought two months earlier as their hideout.

At the farm they counted the proceeds and divided it into 16 full shares and several &#x27;drinks&#x27; (smaller sums of money intended for associates of the gang). The precise amounts of the split differ according to the source, but the full shares came to approximately £150,000 each.

From listening to their police-tuned radio, the gang learned that the police had calculated they had gone to ground within a radius of the crime scene rather than dispersing with their haul. This declaration was based on the information given by a witness at the crime scene who stated that a gang member had told the post office workers &quot;not to move for half an hour&quot;. The press interpreted this information as a radius—a half-hour drive in a fast car.

The gang realised the police were using a &quot;dragnet tactic&quot;, and with help from the public, would probably discover the farm much sooner than had been originally anticipated. As a result, the plan for leaving the farm was brought forward to Friday from Sunday (the crime was committed on Thursday). The vehicles they had driven to the farm could no longer be used because they had been seen by the train staff. Brian Field came to the farm on Thursday to pick up his share of the loot and to take Roy James to London to find an extra vehicle. Bruce Reynolds and John Daly picked up cars, one for Jimmy White and the other for Reynolds, Daly, Biggs and the replacement train driver. Field, his wife Karin and his associate &quot;Mark&quot; brought the vans and drove the remainder of the gang to the Fields&#x27; home to recover.

Field had arranged with &quot;Mark&quot; to carry out a comprehensive clean-up and set fire to the farm after the robbers had left, even though the robbers had already spent much time wiping the place down to be free of prints. According to Buster Edwards, he &#x27;nicked&#x27; £10,000 in ten-shilling notes to help pay &quot;Mark&#x27;s&quot; drink. However, on Monday, when Charlie Wilson rang Brian Field to check whether the farm had been cleaned, he did not believe Field&#x27;s assurances. He called a meeting with Edwards, Reynolds, Daly and James and they agreed that they needed to be sure. They called Field to a meeting on Tuesday, where he was forced to admit that he had failed to &quot;torch&quot; the farm. In the IVS 2012 documentary film &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, Nick Reynolds (son of Bruce Reynolds) said &quot;...the guy who was paid to basically go back to the farm and burn it down did a runner.&quot; Wilson would have killed Field there and then but was restrained by the others. By the time they were ready to go back to the farm, however, they learned that police had found the hideout.
===The money===
There is some uncertainty regarding the exact cash stolen from the train. £2,631,784 is a figure quoted in the press, although the police investigation states the theft as £2,595,997 10s 0d, in 636 packages, contained in 120 mailbags—the bulk of the haul in £1 and £5 notes (both the older white note and the newer blue note, which was half its size). There were also ten-shilling notes and Irish and Scottish money. Because a 30-minute time limit had been set by Reynolds, eight out of 128 bags were not stolen and were left behind. Statistically, this could have amounted to £131,000 or 4.7% of the total. It is alleged that the total weight of the bags removed was 2.5 tons, according to former Buckinghamshire police officer John Woolley.

The gang had used the money in a game of &quot;Monopoly&quot; while holed up at the farm house.

===Raising the alarm===
The robbers had cut all the telephone lines in the vicinity, but one of the rail-men left on the train at Sears Crossing caught a passing goods train to Cheddington, where he raised the alarm at around 04:20. The first reports of the robbery were broadcast on the VHF police radio within a few minutes and this is where the gang heard the line &quot;A robbery has been committed and you&#x27;ll never believe it – they&#x27;ve stolen the train!&quot;

==Robbers and accomplices==

The gang consisted of 17 full members who were to receive an equal share, including the men who were at the robbery and two key informants.

The gang that carried out the robbery consisted of 15 criminals predominantly from south London: Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Buster Edwards, Bruce Reynolds, Roy James, John Daly, Roger Cordrey, Jimmy White, Bob Welch, Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Harry Smith and Danny Pembroke, who were never charged due to the lack of evidence against them, and one still unknown, plus the train driver they nicknamed &quot;Pop&quot;. The best-known member of the gang, Biggs, had only a minor role—to recruit the train driver.

===The robbers===
===Bruce Reynolds===
Bruce Richard Reynolds was born on 7 September 1931 at Charing Cross Hospital, Strand, London, to Thomas Richard and Dorothy Margaret (née Keen). His mother died in 1935, and he had trouble living with his father and stepmother, so he often stayed with one or other of his grandmothers. Reynolds was jailed for three years on several counts of breaking and entering, and upon his release quickly started re-offending. He soon joined a gang with best friend John Daly (future brother-in-law). They were mentored by South Western gang leaders Ernie Watts and Terry Hogan (a.k.a. Harry Booth). Also, he did some work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at Charlie Richardson&#x27;s club. Richardson in turn introduced him to Gordon Goody.

After the train heist, Reynolds escaped to Mexico with his wife, Angela, and young son, Nick Reynolds (who later became a member of the band Alabama 3, whose song &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; was the opening theme of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;) and lived lavishly with his share of the take, approximately £150,000. When that money ran out, Reynolds moved his family to Canada and then France under false identities, in search of work, before returning to the United Kingdom to pursue opportunities promised by his old criminal contacts. He was arrested in 1968 in Torquay and sentenced to 25 years in jail. He was released a decade later.

Reynolds was sent back to prison in the mid-1980s for dealing amphetamines. He produced occasional journalism pieces, was a consultant on movie and book projects about the train heist, and published a well-regarded crime memoir, &quot;Crossing the Line: The Autobiography of a Thief&quot; (1995). In a 2003 interview, Reynolds recalled: &quot;from an early age I always wanted a life of adventure.&quot; He was rejected by the Royal Navy because of poor eyesight, and then tried to become a foreign correspondent, but his highest achievement in that vein was to become a clerk at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. While his life in crime did provide excitement, Reynolds said in 2003, &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that I can&#x27;t escape my past. And in many ways, I feel that it is like a line from the &#x27;Ancient Mariner&#x27; and that the notoriety was like an albatross around my neck.&quot; Reynolds died aged 81 on 28 February 2013 after a brief illness. He was survived by his son Nick.

===Douglas Gordon Goody===
Authorities regarded Douglas Gordon Goody as the mastermind of the operation. He first made contact with &#x27;The Ulsterman&#x27; in a meeting set up by Brian Field in Finsbury Park. Of Northern Irish descent, Goody was born in Putney, London in March 1930 and was still living there in his mother&#x27;s flat at the time of the robbery. In the early 1960s, he joined Buster Edwards&#x27; gang and helped rob various easy targets. In August 1963, he was arrested in connection with the Great Train Robbery and taken to the Leicester City Police Headquarters for questioning by Detective Chief Inspector Peter Vibart of the Flying Squad. Sentenced to 30 years for his role in the crime, he was released from prison in 1975. Goody then moved to the white-washed town of Mojácar in Almería, Spain, where he ran a beachfront bar. 

In a September 2014 interview, Goody claimed the identity of &#x27;The Ulsterman&#x27; was one Patrick McKenna, a postal employee. The interview was shown in a documentary marking the 50th anniversary of the robbery, called &quot;The Great Train Robbery: A Tale of Two Thieves&quot;. The documentary makers employed social worker Ariel Bruce, who finds missing family members, to trace McKenna. Discovered after obtaining records through the Freedom of Information Act, McKenna had died some years previously. However, Bruce made contact with McKenna&#x27;s family and obtained copies of photographs, which Goody confirmed to be the same person he had met 50 years earlier. The documentary was shown in cinemas and on-demand in October 2014. It suggests that McKenna never benefitted from the money, but instead gave it to the Catholic Church. It suggests McKenna was motivated by the failure of the post office to provide better security for the night train staff, and he had hoped the robbery would be a wake up call. Goody died of emphysema on 29 January 2016 at the age of 85.

===Charles Frederick (Charlie) Wilson===
The most dangerous of the Great Train Robbers was &#x27;the Silent Man&#x27; Charlie Wilson. He was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in Battersea. His friends from childhood were Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, Bruce Reynolds and Gordon Goody. Later on, he met Ronald &#x27;Buster&#x27; Edwards and the young driving enthusiasts Mickey Ball and Roy James, who had taken up car theft. From 1948 to 1950 he was called up for national service, and in 1955 he married Patricia (Pat) Osbourne, with whom he had three children. He turned to crime early in life and spurned his father&#x27;s legitimate but low-income wage. While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws&#x27; grocer&#x27;s shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises. He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences. In 1960, he began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league.

===Ronald &quot;Buster&quot; Edwards===
Ronald Christopher Edwards was born on 27 January 1932 at Lambeth, London, the son of a barman. After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market. During his national service in the RAF he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to South London, he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal. He married June Rose in 1952. They had a daughter, Nicky. In his final years he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London.

===Brian Field===
Brian Arthur Field was born on 15 December 1934 and was immediately put up for adoption. He served two years in the Royal Army Service Corps, seeing service during the Korean War. Although soldiers in the Service Corps were considered combat personnel, they were primarily associated with transport and logistics. When he was discharged from the military, it was with &quot;a very good character&quot;.

Field later became a solicitor&#x27;s managing clerk for John Wheater &amp; Co. Although he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already apparently more prosperous than his boss, John Wheater. Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house, &quot;Kabri&quot; (an amalgam of Karin and Brian [Field]), with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a run-down neighbourhood. Part of the reason for Field&#x27;s prosperity was that he was not averse to giving Goody and Edwards information about what his clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny.

Prior to the robbery Field had represented Buster Edwards and Gordon Goody. He had arranged Edwards&#x27; defence when he had been caught with a stolen car and had met Goody at a nightclub in Soho. Field was called upon to assist in Goody&#x27;s defence in the aftermath of the &quot;Airport Job&quot;, which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at BOAC Comet House, Hatton Cross, London Airport. This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done before the Great Train Robbery. Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.

===&quot;The Ulsterman&quot;===
In 2014, Douglas Goody claimed to journalists that &quot;The Ulsterman&quot; was Patrick McKenna, at the time of the robbery a 43-year-old postal worker living in Salford, Lancashire.
McKenna, who was originally from Belfast, met Goody four times in 1963. Goody alleged that he found out McKenna&#x27;s name only when he saw it written inside his spectacles case.

It is not known what became of the share McKenna allegedly received, but his children were &quot;flabbergasted&quot; on hearing the claim of their father&#x27;s involvement. It was surmised that McKenna either donated his share to the Catholic church over the years or had had the money stolen from him.

This alleged identification of McKenna as &quot;The Ulsterman&quot; has been disputed; not least because McKenna appears to have had no criminal record or associations and died poor. It has been suggested that a known associate of the convicted robbers, Sammy Osterman, was part of the gang, and his &quot;Ulsterman&quot; soubriquet was simply the result of mishearing his surname.

===Accomplices===
William Gerald Boal (22 October 1913 – 26 June 1970), an accomplice after the fact of Roger Cordrey, was convicted as being one of the robbers, despite playing a role no different from the many other accomplices of the various train robbers. Boal died in jail.

Leonard &quot;Lennie&quot; Denis Field (born 1931, date of death unknown) helped with the purchase of the Leatherslade Farm hideout, paying the deposit of £5,000 in return for a &#x27;drink&#x27; of £12,000. Lennie Field was allowed to think that the plan was to hijack a lorry load of cigarettes. Despite not being in on the robbery, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years (20 years for conspiracy to rob and five years for obstructing justice), which was later reduced to five. He was released from jail in 1967 and went to live in north London.

John Denby Wheater (born 17 December 1921, died 18 July 1985) was the employer of Brian Field. He was convicted and sentenced to three years. He died in Harrogate, near Leeds, aged 63.

==Aylesbury investigation==
At 05:00, Chief Superintendent Malcolm Fewtrell, head of the Buckinghamshire Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID), located at Aylesbury, arrived at the crime scene, where he supervised evidence-gathering. He then went to Cheddington railway station, where the train had been taken, and where statements were taken from the driver and postal workers. A member of the gang had told the postal staff not to move for half an hour and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than away. It appeared, from interviews with the witnesses, that about 15 hooded men dressed in blue boiler suits had been involved, but little more could be gleaned.

By lunchtime of the following day, it became obvious to Fewtrell that extra resources were needed to cope with the scale of the investigation and the Buckinghamshire Chief Constable referred the case to Scotland Yard. George Hatherill, Commander of the C Department and Detective Chief Superintendent Earnest (Ernie) Millen, Head of the Flying Squad were initially in charge of the London side of the investigation. They sent Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur and Detective Sergeant John Pritchard to assist the Buckinghamshire Police.

The police then undertook a major search, fanning out from the crime scene after having failed to find any forensic evidence there. A watch was put on the seaports. The Postmaster General Reginald Bevins offered a £10,000 reward to &quot;the first person giving information leading to the apprehension and conviction of the persons responsible for the robbery&quot;.

===Discovery of Leatherslade Farm===
Following a tip-off from a herdsman who used a field adjacent to Leatherslade Farm, a police sergeant and constable called there on 13 August 1963, five days after the robbery. The farm was deserted but they found the truck used by the robbers, which had been hastily painted yellow, as well as the Land Rovers. They also found a large quantity of food, bedding, sleeping bags, post-office sacks, registered mail packages, banknote wrappers and a Monopoly board game.

It was determined that although the farm had been cleaned for fingerprints, some finger and palm prints (presumably of the robbers) had been overlooked, including those on a ketchup bottle and on the Monopoly set (which had been used after the robbery for a game, but with real money).

==London investigation==
Despite the big breakthrough of the discovery of Leatherslade Farm, the investigation was not going well. The London side of the investigation then continued under Detective Chief Superintendent Tommy Butler, who replaced Millen as head of the Flying Squad shortly after Millen was promoted to Deputy Commander under George Hatherill. On Monday 12 August 1963, Butler was appointed to head the police investigation of the London connection and quickly formed a six-man Train Robbery Squad. With Leatherslade Farm finally found on 13 August 1963, the day after Tommy Butler was appointed to head the London investigation, the Train Robbery Squad descended on the farm.

The breakthrough came when Detective Chief Superintendent Millen met a distinguished barrister in a smoking room of an exclusive West End club who told him that someone was willing to inform on the gang. The process of talking to the informer was handled by Hatherill and Millen and they never divulged the identity of the informer to the detectives in their command. The informant had been jailed in a provincial prison just before the train robbery and was hoping to get parole and other favours from talking. He clearly did not know all the names perfectly, and a second informant (a woman) was able to fill in the gaps. Millen said in his book &quot;Specialist in Crime&quot;, &quot;the break-through with the informer came at a moment when I and my colleagues at the Yard were in a state of frustration almost approaching despair&quot;. This process saw them get eighteen names to be passed on to detectives to match up with the list being prepared from fingerprints collected at Leatherslade. Hatherill and Millen decided to publish photos of the wanted men, despite strong protests from Tommy Butler and Frank Williams. This resulted in most of the robbers going to ground.

===Tommy Butler, the thief-taker===
Tommy Butler was a shrewd choice to take over the Flying Squad and in particular the Train Robbery Squad. He became arguably the most renowned head of the Flying Squad in its history. He was known variously as &quot;Mr Flying Squad&quot;, as &quot;One-day Tommy&quot; for the speed with which he apprehended criminals and as the &quot;Grey Fox&quot; for his shrewdness. He was Scotland Yard&#x27;s most formidable thief-taker and, as an unmarried man who still lived with his mother, he had a fanatical dedication to the job. Butler worked long hours and expected all members of the squad to do the same.

The squad later had to work out rotations whereby one member would go home to rest as otherwise they were getting only three hours of sleep per night and had no time to eat healthily or see their families. When the squad tried to get him to ease the working conditions, Butler was enraged and threatened to send them back to their normal duties. Butler was said to be very secretive, with Jack Slipper claiming in his book &quot;Slipper of the Yard&quot; (1981) that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t even tell his own left hand what the right one was doing&quot;. This meant that Train Robbery Squad members were often dispatched on errands with no knowledge of how their tasks fitted into the overall investigation.

===Train Robbery Squad===
The six-man Train Robbery Squad consisted of Detective Inspector Frank Williams, Detective Sergeant Steve Moore, Detective Sergeant Jack Slipper, Detective Sergeant Jim Nevill, Detective Sergeant Lou Van Dyck and Detective Constable Tommy Thorburn. The senior officer, Frank Williams, was a quiet man. His speciality was dealing with informants and he had the best working knowledge of the south London criminal fraternity in the force. One of the squad, Jack Slipper, would later become head of the Flying Squad and would still be involved in the case many years later.

===Post Office Investigation===
The Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) had to establish the amount of money stolen, £2,595,997.10s.0d. They also sought to identify what money had been taken so that the relevant banks could be notified. Deficiencies in High-Value Package carriage security were reported and secure carriages were immediately brought back into service. The installation of radios was recommended as a priority. The investigation was detailed in a report by Assistant Controller Richard Yates that was issued in May 1964.

==Captures==
===Roger Cordrey===
The first gang member to be caught was Roger Cordrey. He was with his friend, William Boal who was helping him lie low in return for the payment of old debts. They were living in a rented, fully furnished flat above a florist&#x27;s shop in Wimborne Road, Moordown, Bournemouth. The Bournemouth police were tipped off by Ethel Clark when Boal and Cordrey paid her for three months rent in advance on a garage in Tweedale Road, off Castle Lane West. Clark was the widow of a former police officer and Boal and Cordrey made the whole payment in used ten-shilling notes. Boal, who was not involved in the robbery, was sentenced to 24 years and died in prison in 1970. Police later acknowledged that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.

===Others===
Other arrests followed. Eight of the gang members and several associates were caught. The other arrests were made by Sgt Stan Davis and Probationary Constable Gordon &#x27;Charlie&#x27; Case. On Friday 16 August 1963, two people who had decided to take a morning stroll in Dorking Woods discovered a briefcase, a holdall and a camel-skin bag, all containing money. They called police, who also discovered another briefcase full of money in the woods. In total, a sum of £100,900 was found. They also found a camel-skin bag containing a receipt from a hotel &quot;Sonnenbichel&quot; in the German town of Bad Hindelang in the Bavarian Prealps. It was made out to Herr and Frau Field. Surrey police delivered the money and the receipt to Fewtrell and McArthur in Aylesbury, who knew by then that Brian Field was a clerk at James and Wheater who had acted in the purchase of Leatherslade Farm. They quickly confirmed through Interpol that Brian and Karin Field had stayed at &quot;Sonnenbichel&quot; in February that year. The police knew that Field had acted for Gordon Goody and other criminals.

Several weeks later, the police went to Field&#x27;s house to interview him. He calmly (for someone whose relatives had dumped a large part of the loot) provided a cover story that implicated Lennie Field as the purchaser of the farm and his boss John Wheater as the conveyancer. He admitted to visiting the farm on one occasion with Lennie Field, but said he assumed it was an investment of his brother Alexander Field, whom Brian Field had defended (unsuccessfully) in a recent court case. Field, not knowing the police had found a receipt, readily confirmed that he and his wife had been to Germany on a holiday and gave them the details of the place at which they had stayed. On 15 September 1963 Brian Field was arrested and his boss John Wheater was arrested two days later. Lennie Field had already been arrested on 14 September. Jack Slipper was involved in the capture of Roy James, Ronald Biggs, Jimmy Hussey and John Daly.

==Trial, 1964==
The trial of the robbers began at Aylesbury Assizes, Buckinghamshire, on 20 January 1964. Because it would be necessary to accommodate a large number of lawyers and journalists, the existing court was deemed too small and so the offices of Aylesbury Rural District Council were specially converted for the event. The defendants were brought to the court each day from Aylesbury Prison in a compartmentalised van, out of view of the large crowd of spectators. Mr Justice Edmund Davies presided over the trial, which lasted 51 days and included 613 exhibits and 240 witnesses. The jury retired to the Grange Youth Centre in Aylesbury to consider its verdict.

On 11 February 1964, there was a sensation when John Daly was found to have no case to answer. His counsel, Walter Raeburn QC, claimed that the evidence against his client was limited to his fingerprints being on the Monopoly set found at Leatherslade Farm and the fact that he went underground after the robbery. Raeburn went on to say that Daly had played the Monopoly game with his brother-in-law Bruce Reynolds earlier in 1963, and that he had gone underground only because he was associated with people publicly sought by the police. This was not proof of involvement in a conspiracy. The judge agreed, and the jury was directed to acquit him.

Detective Inspector Frank Williams was shocked when this occurred because, owing to Tommy Butler&#x27;s refusal to share information, he had no knowledge of the fact that Daly&#x27;s prints were only on the Monopoly set. If Williams had known this, he could have asked Daly questions about the Monopoly set and robbed him of his very effective alibi. Daly was clever in avoiding having a photo taken when he was arrested until he could shave his beard. This meant that there was no photo to show the lengths he had gone to in order to change his appearance. No action was taken against Butler for his mistake in not ensuring the case against Daly was more thorough.

On 15 April 1964 the proceedings ended with the judge describing the robbery as &quot;a crime of sordid violence inspired by vast greed&quot; and passing sentences of 30 years&#x27; imprisonment on seven of the robbers.

===Sentencing===
The 11 men sentenced all felt aggrieved at the sentences handed down, particularly Bill Boal (who died in prison) and Lennie Field, who were later found not guilty of the charges against them. The other men (aside from Wheater) resented what they considered to be the excessive length of the sentences, which were longer than those given to many murderers or armed robbers. Train robbers who were sentenced later, and by different judges, received shorter terms. The severity of the sentences caused some surprise. When mastermind Bruce Reynolds was arrested in 1968, he allegedly told arresting officer Tommy Butler that those sentences had had a detrimental effect. According to him, they had prompted criminals generally to take guns with them when they set out on robberies.

===Appeals, July 1964===
On 13 July 1964, the appeals by Lennie Field and Brian Field (no relation) against the charges of conspiracy to rob were allowed. This resulted in their sentences being in effect reduced to five years only. On 14 July 1964, the appeals by Roger Cordrey and Bill Boal were allowed, with the convictions for conspiracy to rob quashed, leaving only the receiving charges. Justice Fenton Atkinson concluded that a miscarriage of justice would result if Boal&#x27;s charges were upheld, given that his age, physique and temperament made him an unlikely train robber. Luckily for him, as the oldest robber, Cordrey was also deemed to be not guilty of the conspiracy because his prints had not been found at Leatherslade Farm.

Brian Field was only reluctantly acquitted of the robbery. Justice Atkinson stated that he would not be surprised if Field were not only part of the conspiracy, but also one of the robbers. The charges against the other men were all upheld. In the end, Lennie Field and Bill Boal got some measure of justice, but Boal died in prison in 1970 after a long illness.

==Prison escapes==
On 12 August 1964, Wilson escaped from Winson Green Prison in Birmingham in under three minutes, the escape being considered unprecedented in that a three-man team had broken into the prison to extricate him. His escape team was never caught and the leader, nicknamed &quot;Frenchy&quot;, had disappeared from the London criminal scene by the late 1960s. Two weeks after his escape Wilson was in Paris for plastic surgery. By November 1965, Wilson was in Mexico City visiting old friends Bruce Reynolds and Buster Edwards. Wilson&#x27;s escape was yet another dramatic twist in the train robbery saga.

Eleven months after Wilson&#x27;s escape, in July 1965, Biggs escaped from Wandsworth Prison, 15 months into his sentence. A furniture van was parked alongside the prison walls and a ladder was dropped over the 30-foot-high wall into the prison during outside exercise time, allowing four prisoners to escape, including Biggs. The escape was planned by recently released prisoner Paul Seaborne, with the assistance of two other ex-convicts, Ronnie Leslie and Ronnie Black, with support from Biggs&#x27;s wife, Charmian. The plot saw two other prisoners interfere with the warders, and allow Biggs and friend Eric Flower to escape. Seaborne was later caught by Butler and sentenced to four-and-a-half years; Ronnie Leslie received three years for being the getaway driver. The two other prisoners who took advantage of the Biggs escape were captured after three months. Biggs and Flower paid a significant sum of money to be smuggled to Paris for plastic surgery. Biggs said he had to escape because of the length of the sentence and what he alleged to be the severity of the prison conditions.

==Pursuit of fugitives==

Jimmy White – With the other robbers on the run and having fled the country, only White was at large in the United Kingdom. White was a renowned locksmith/thief and had already been on the run for 10 years before the robbery. He was said to have &quot;a remarkable ability to be invisible, to merge with his surroundings and become the ultimate Mr Nobody.&quot; He was a wartime paratrooper and a veteran of Arnhem. According to Piers Paul Read in his 1978 book &quot;The Train Robbers&quot;, he was &quot;a solitary thief, not known to work with either firm, he should have had a good chance of remaining undetected altogether, yet was known to be one of the Train Robbers almost at once—first by other criminals and then by the police&quot;. He was unfortunate in that Brian Field&#x27;s relatives had dumped luggage containing £100,000 only a mile from a site where White had bought a caravan and hidden £30,000 in the panelling. In addition, a group of men purporting to be from the Flying Squad broke into his flat and took a briefcase containing £8,500. Throughout his three years on the run with wife Sheree and baby son Stephen, he was taken advantage of or let down by friends and associates. On 10 April 1966, a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed the police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. He only had £8,000 to hand back to them. The rest was long gone. He was tried in June 1966 at Leicester Assizes and Mr Justice Nield sentenced him to 18 years&#x27; jail, considerably less than the 30 years given to other principal offenders.

Buster Edwards – Edwards fled to Mexico with his family, to join Bruce Reynolds (and later Charlie Wilson) but returned voluntarily to England in 1966, where he was sentenced to 15 years.

Charlie Wilson – Wilson took up residence outside Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on Rigaud Mountain in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood where the large, secluded properties are surrounded by trees. He lived under the name Ronald Alloway, a name borrowed from a Fulham shopkeeper. His wife and three children soon joined him. He joined an exclusive golf club and participated in the activities of the local community. It was only when he invited his brother-in-law over from the UK for Christmas that Scotland Yard was able to track him down and recapture him. They waited three months before making their move, in the hope that Wilson would lead them to Reynolds, the last suspect still to be apprehended. Wilson was arrested on 25 January 1968 by Tommy Butler. Many in Rigaud petitioned that his wife and three daughters be allowed to stay in the Montreal area.

Bruce Reynolds – On 6 June 1964, Reynolds arrived in Mexico, with his wife Angela and son Nick joining him a few months later, after they evaded the obvious police surveillance. A year later in July 1965, Buster Edwards and his family arrived, although unlike the Reynolds family they planned to return to England at some stage, and did not like Mexico. Charlie Wilson, on the run with his family still back in England, visited them for six weeks, so three of the train robbers were together in exile for a time. After the Edwards family returned to England, the Reynoldses also decided to leave Mexico and go to Canada to potentially join up with the Wilson family, leaving on 6 December 1966. They had spent much of their share of the robbery by this point – living far more extravagantly than the Edwardses had. After realising the danger in settling near the Wilsons in Montreal, they went to live in Vancouver, and then went to Nice, France. Reynolds did not want to go to Australia where Biggs was, and needing money decided to go back to England, settling briefly in Torquay before being captured by Tommy Butler.

Ronnie Biggs – Biggs fled to Paris, where he acquired new identity papers and underwent plastic surgery. In 1966, he moved to Adelaide, Australia, where he worked as a builder and he and his wife had a third son. Tipped off that Interpol was showing interest, he moved to Melbourne working as a set constructor for Channel 9, later escaping to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after police had discovered his Melbourne address. Biggs could not be extradited because there was no extradition treaty between Britain and Brazil, and additionally he became father to a Brazilian son, which afforded him legal immunity. As a result, he lived openly in Rio for many years, safe from the British authorities. In 1981, Biggs&#x27;s Brazilian son became a member of a successful band Turma do Balão Mágico, but the band quickly faded into obscurity and dissolved.

In May 2001, aged 71 and having suffered three strokes, Biggs voluntarily returned to England. Accepting that he could be arrested, his stated desire was to &quot;walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter&quot;. Arrested on landing, after detention and a short court hearing he was sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. On 2 July 2009, Biggs was denied parole by Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who considered Biggs to be still &quot;wholly unrepentant&quot;, but was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on &#x27;compassionate grounds&#x27;. He died on 18 December 2013, aged 84.

==Fate of the robbers==
Following the deaths of Goody on 29 January 2016, and Tommy Wisbey on 30 December 2016, Bob Welch was the last known member of the gang known alive prior to his death on 2 November 2023. In later years, the robbers generally came together only for the funerals of their fellow gang members. Wilson&#x27;s funeral on 10 May 1990 was attended by Bruce Reynolds, who reported seeing Edwards, Roy James (who got into a verbal argument with the press), Welch (hobbling on crutches) and White (who went unnoticed due to his ability to blend into the background). At Edwards&#x27; funeral in 1994, Reynolds saw only Welch (Hussey, Wisbey and James were in prison).

Brian Field

After being sentenced on 16 April 1964, Field served four years of his five-year sentence. He was released in 1967. While he was in prison, his wife Karin divorced him and married a German journalist. Karin wrote an article for the German magazine &quot;Stern&quot;. She confirmed that she took Roy James to Thame railway station so he could go to London and that she led a convoy of two vans back to her house, where the gang were joined by wives and girlfriends for a big party to celebrate the crime. When Reynolds returned to the UK in 1968, he tried to contact Field as this was the only way he could get in touch with the &quot;Ulsterman&quot;. It seems that Field was ambushed upon his release from prison by a recently released convict, &quot;Scotch Jack&quot; Buggy, who presumably roughed up or even tortured Field with a view to extorting some of the loot from the robbery. Subsequently, Field went to ground and Buggy was killed shortly after. Reynolds gave up trying to find Field.

Field changed his name to Brian Carlton to disappear. Sometime after his release from prison he married Sian, from Wales. In the mid/late 1970s, they worked for the Children&#x27;s Book Centre (since sold) in Kensington High Street, London. Field and his wife Sian were responsible for the company&#x27;s operations in central and southern Europe, to where they shipped English language books and held book fairs at international English schools. Field, aged 44, and Sian, aged 28, died in a car crash on the M4 motorway on 27 April 1979, a year after the last of the robbers had completed their sentences. The accident occurred as they returned from a visit to Sian&#x27;s parents in Wales. A Mercedes driven by Amber Bessone, the pregnant 28-year-old daughter of a well-known hairdresser Raymond Bessone (Mr Teasy Weasy) crossed a damaged section of the guard rail and slammed into Field&#x27;s oncoming Porsche. The Fields, Amber, her husband and two children were all killed instantly. It was several weeks after the accident that Field&#x27;s true identity was discovered. It is not clear whether his wife Sian ever knew of his past.

Charlie Wilson

The last of the robbers released, (after serving about one-third of his sentence) Wilson returned to the life of crime and was found shot dead at his villa in Marbella, Spain, on 24 April 1990. His murder was thought to be related to suspected cheating in drug-dealing. He is buried in Streatham cemetery.

Buster Edwards
After he was released, he became a flower seller outside Waterloo station. His story was dramatised in the 1988 film &quot;Buster&quot;, with Phil Collins in the title role. Edwards died by suicide, hanging himself in a garage in November 1994. His family continued to run the flower stall after his death.

Roy James
James went back to motor racing following his release on 15 August 1975. However, he crashed several cars and his chances of becoming a driver quickly faded. After the failure of his sporting career, he returned to his trade as a silversmith. He produced the trophy given to Formula One promoters each year thanks to his acquaintance with Bernie Ecclestone. In 1982, he married a younger woman, but the marriage soon broke down. By 1983, James and Charlie Wilson had become involved in an attempt to import gold without paying excise duty. James was acquitted in January 1984 for his part in the swindle. In 1993, he shot and wounded his father-in-law, pistol-whipped and partially strangled his ex-wife, after they had returned their children for a day&#x27;s outing. He was sentenced to six years in jail. In 1996, James underwent triple-bypass surgery and was subsequently released from prison in 1997, only to die almost immediately afterwards on 21 August after another heart attack. He was the fifth member of the gang to die, despite being the youngest.

Roger Cordrey
Cordrey was the first of the robbers released, but his share of the theft had almost entirely been recovered by the police. He went back to being a florist at his sister&#x27;s business upon his release. He is now dead, and his son Tony has publicly acknowledged his dad confirmed that Bill Boal was innocent of any involvement in the robbery.

Bruce Reynolds
Bruce Reynolds, the last of the robbers to be caught, was released from prison on 6 June 1978 after serving 10 years. Reynolds, then aged 47, was helped by Gordon Goody to get back on his feet, before Goody departed for Spain. By October 1978, day-release ended and he had to report to a parole officer. Frank Monroe, one of the three robbers who was never caught, temporarily gave Reynolds a job, but did not want to attract undue attention by employing him for too long. Reynolds later got back together with his wife Angela and son Nicholas. He was arrested in 1983 for drug-related offences (Reynolds denied having any involvement). He was released again in March 1985 and dedicated himself to helping his wife recover from a mental breakdown. In 2001, he and his son Nicholas travelled with reporters from &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper to take Biggs back to Britain. In 2010, he wrote the afterword for &quot;Signal Red&quot;, Robert Ryan&#x27;s novel based on the robbery, and he regularly commented on the robbery. He died in his sleep, aged 81, on 28 February 2013.

John Daly
Upon his acquittal and release, and after finding his share of the loot stolen and/or destroyed, Daly gave up his life of crime and went &quot;straight&quot;. He and his wife Barbara and their three children moved to Cornwall, where he worked as a street sweeper until the age of 70, known to the locals as Gentleman John or John the Gent. Daly told no one about the robbery as he was told he could face a retrial. He died six weeks after his brother-in-law Reynolds.

Ronnie Biggs

On 6 August 2009, Biggs was granted release from prison on &quot;compassionate grounds&quot;, due to a severe case of pneumonia and other ongoing health problems. In 2011 he updated his autobiography, &quot;Odd Man Out: The Last Straw&quot;. Having suffered a series of strokes after his release, and unable to speak for the previous three years, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care home, London on 18 December 2013.

Tommy Wisbey and Big Jim Hussey
Tommy Wisbey was luckier than most of the others, in that his loot had been entrusted to his brothers, and when he emerged, he had a house in South London and a few other investments to keep him going. During his prison stint, his daughter Lorraine had died in a car accident. He took a while to learn how to live harmoniously with his wife Rene (his daughter Marilyn having moved out upon his return). Shortly after his release, Wisbey was imprisoned on remand over a swindle involving travellers&#x27; cheques. The judge acknowledged the minor nature of his role.

Jim Hussey was released on 17 November 1975 and married girlfriend Gill (whom he had met just before the robbery). Hussey&#x27;s share of the loot had been entrusted to a friend of Frank Monroe who squandered it despite Monroe periodically checking on its keeper.

Wisbey and Hussey fell back into crime and were jailed in 1989 for cocaine dealing, with Wisbey sentenced to 10 years and Hussey to seven years. In her book &quot;Gangster&#x27;s Moll&quot;, Marilyn Wisbey recounts that on 8 June 1988, after returning home from a visit to an abortion clinic and resting they were raided by the Drugs Squad. The raid uncovered 1 kg of cocaine and Rene and Marilyn Wisbey were arrested along with Jimmy Hussey, who had been spotted accepting a package from Wisbey in a park. Wisbey himself was captured a year later in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He was allegedly staying with another woman, to the shock of his wife and daughter. In return for Hussey and Wisbey pleading guilty, the two women were unconditionally freed. Upon their release from prison, both men retired from work.

Wisbey later explained: &quot;We were against drugs all our lives, but as the years went on, towards the end of the &#x27;70s, it became more and more the &#x27;in&#x27; thing. Being involved in the Great Train Robbery, our name was good. They knew we had never grassed anyone, we had done our time without putting anyone else in the frame&quot;. On 26 July 1989, the two men pleaded guilty and admitted at Snaresbrook Crown Court, London that they were a part of a £500,000 cocaine trafficking ring. Wisbey&#x27;s grandson has also had trouble with the law in Cyprus.

Bob Welch
Bob Welch (March 1929 - November 2023) was released on 14 June 1976. He was the last of those convicted in Aylesbury to be released. Welch moved back in with his wife June and his son. He threatened the man left in charge of his share of the theft to retrieve the remainder. A leg injury sustained in prison forced him to undergo several operations, which left him disabled. He died in 2023 following a battle with alzheimer&#x27;s. 

Douglas (Gordon) Goody
He was released from prison on 23 December 1975, aged 46 and went to live with his ill mother in her small cottage in Putney. Unlike the other robbers, he was exceptionally lucky in that the man he left in charge of his affairs was loyal and successful so he was able to live a relatively well-off life. In his final years of incarceration Goody had taken full benefit of the newly established education college at Wormwood Scrubbs and studied Spanish to GCE standard.

He later moved to Mojacar, southern Spain, where he bought property and a bar and settled down, believing it safer to be out of the United Kingdom. He was at one point accused of cannabis smuggling but ultimately cleared. He continued to live in Mojacar until his death on 29 January 2016, following an illness.

===The ones who got away===
While there has been a lot of mystery surrounding several of the gang who were not imprisoned, in reality, the police knew almost the entire gang almost instantly. By 29 August 1963 Commander Hatherill had 14 names, and told police that Brian Field had tried to enlist another gang to rob the train, who turned him down. Hatherill&#x27;s list was unerringly accurate—all the major gang members who were later jailed were identified, except Ronnie Biggs. With the exception of the minor accomplices Lennie Field, Bill Boal and the train driver, the list was complete, although of course &quot;The Ulsterman&quot; was not identified. In terms of the ones who got away, there were four others identified: Harry Smith, Danny Pembroke, a fair-haired man (25 years old and well-spoken, not named) and a nondescript man (not named but maybe Jimmy Collins).

In 2019, Pembroke&#x27;s son, also called Danny, confirmed that his father was present during the raid. He escaped detection as he always wore gloves, including at the hideout at the farm, and went outside to the toilet rather than using the one inside the house. The son stated that Pembroke, whose share of the loot was £150,000 (about £3 million in 2019), died in 2015 aged 79.

Both Piers Paul Read and Bruce Reynolds refer to three robbers who got away as Bill Jennings, Alf Thomas and Frank Monroe.

Bill &#x27;Flossy&#x27; Jennings a.k.a. Mr One

Piers Paul Read refers to this man as Bill Jennings in &quot;The Train Robbers&quot;, while Bruce Reynolds adds a nickname, &#x27;Flossy&#x27;. Ronnie Biggs refers to him as Mr One, as do other accounts. According to Bruce Reynolds, &quot;Flossy had no previous convictions and stayed well out of contact with the group. A shadowy figure, nobody knew exactly where he lived—or even what his real name was. All we knew that he was one hundred per cent, and was sure to last out the hullabaloo. The last report of him said that he was in a safe house, banged up with two gorgeous girls and enough champagne to sink a battleship.&quot;

It is clear that while Reynolds claims to not have known his real name, &#x27;Flossy&#x27; was not just a participant in the Great Train Robbery, he was a core part of the gang who participated in the London Airport robbery. This robbery was the audacious raid that Gordon Goody and Charlie Wilson were acquitted of. That raid consisted of Roy James and Mickey Ball as the getaway drivers, with six robbers—Bruce Reynolds, Buster Edwards, Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Flossy (and a sixth man who did not participate in the train robbery). In the end, the only one caught after the airport raid was Mickey Ball, who pleaded guilty to being a getaway driver when a witness mistook him for Flossy, and to avoid being blamed for the actual violence he agreed to plead guilty as an accomplice, and was in prison during the Great Train Robbery. He was given £500 from the proceeds of the Train Robbery.

Henry Thomas &#x27;Harry&#x27; Smith (born 20 October 1930) is believed to be Flossy, and unlike most other robbers, actually got to spend his share of the loot, buying 28 houses, a hotel and drinking club in Portsmouth. Smith died in 2008. Smith was the only man not ultimately arrested that was on both the Hatherill list and Tommy Butler&#x27;s list.

Danny Pembroke (Frank Monroe)

Danny Pembroke was an ex-army man who was a South London taxi driver and a South Coast Raider. At Leatherslade Farm he was the most careful of the gang, and nothing was ever found to associate him with the robbery, despite the police being satisfied that he was one of the gang, and had searched his house in September 1963. However, afraid that he would be betrayed, he did a deal with Frank Williams and paid back £47,245. Following the robbery, Pembroke left for America for a couple of years, knowing he was set up for life, and then returned to live quietly in Kent. He died aged 79 from a heart attack, at home and in his sleep on 28 February 2015. Pembroke had five children, and his son Danny Jr., admitted to his involvement in a Channel Four documentary in August 2019. According to Bruce Reynolds, Monroe, who was never caught, worked as a film stunt man for a while before starting a paper and scrap metal recycling business.

The Replacement Train Driver a.k.a. Pops/Dad a.k.a. Peter a.k.a. Stan Agate

The replacement train driver was never caught, and never suspected of even existing by police, due to the fact that Jack Mills in the end had to drive the train. He also never profited from the crime, as Ronnie Biggs never paid him his £20,000 &quot;drink&quot;. The driver, of course, was not a member of the gang (as defined by receiving an equal share), just an accomplice.

Piers Paul Read called the replacement train driver &quot;Stan Agate&quot;, and Stan was apparently the true nickname of the replacement driver. Read, concerned that the robbers may have hurt him, went to see Ronnie Biggs in Brazil to get his details, although was dismayed to find that Biggs did not know his last name and knew and cared very little about him. With the meagre details provided, Read used a detective agency to track down the driver at a town 20 miles south of London, and found that he was still alive, although somewhat senile and being cared for by his wife. The wife admitted that she had burnt all the clothes that he had worn that night, and had nervously waited for either the gang to murder him or the police to arrest him. Read promised not to reveal their identities. Unlike the other three members of the gang who got away, Peta Fordham does make mention of the replacement driver, but notes that he is said now to be dead, perhaps the robbers who provided material for the book did not want the police looking for him, as at the time of publishing (1965) Reynolds, White and Edwards were still on the run.

Ronnie Biggs, in his 1994 autobiography, &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, said that Bruce Reynolds offered him a chance to join the gang if he could find a train driver. Biggs was renewing the front windows of a train driver&#x27;s house in Redhill, who he calls &#x27;Peter&#x27; (and whom he believes to be dead by 1994). Ronnie offers him a £40,000 share of the profits, tells Reynolds and gives his address to John Daly who then proceeds to check him out. It seems that while he was an older man, he still had to apply for two weeks leave of absence from his job. According to Biggs, &#x27;Peter&#x27; was paid his £40,000 &#x27;drink&#x27;, although other accounts claim otherwise. Biggs states that Mary Manson drove &#x27;Peter&#x27; and John Daly home, while Reynolds drove Biggs home.

===Accomplices===
John Wheater was released from prison on 11 February 1966 and managed his family&#x27;s laundry business in Harrogate. He later wrote two articles in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, which published the first one on 6 March 1966. He died in July 1985.

Lenny Field was released in 1967 and went to live in North London. He disappeared from the public eye.

Mary Manson, an associate of Bruce Reynolds and John Daly, was charged with receiving £820 from the robbery; she was held for six weeks but was released. Mary took care of wives and children of some of the robbers while they were on the run or in jail.

==Fate of the victims==

===Jack Mills===
Mills had constant trauma headaches for the rest of his life, before dying of leukemia in 1970. Mills&#x27;s assailant was one of three members of the gang that were never identified by the others. However, in November 2012, Hussey made a death-bed confession that it was him, although there were suspicions that this was repayment of a debt, to divert attention from the real perpetrator.

Class 90 electric locomotive number 90 036 was named Driver Jack Mills on Crewe station on the 2 Dec 2014, and a road in Crewe was names Jack Mills Way in 2015.

Frank Williams (at the time a detective inspector) claimed that at least three men who were directly involved are still at liberty and enjoying their full share of the money stolen and the profits from the way they invested it, one of them being the man responsible for the attack on the train driver. Williams said that the train driver&#x27;s assailant was not some phantom figure lurking in the criminal underworld, and that he traced him, identified him and took him to Scotland Yard where, with Tommy Butler, Williams questioned him. He could not be charged because of lack of evidence; there were no fingerprints or identifiable marks anywhere. None of those arrested informed on this person, although it was claimed that he had completely disobeyed instructions and used violence during the robbery.

===David Whitby===
David Whitby (24 January 1937 – 6 January 1972) was also from Crewe. He was traumatised by his track-side assault and subsequent rough treatment and never recovered from his ordeal. He was 26 years old at the time of the robbery. He was able to resume his job as a secondman, but died from a heart attack on 6 January 1972 at the age of 34 in Crewe, Cheshire.

===Bill Boal===
Engineer William Gerald &quot;Bill&quot; Boal (22 October 1913 – 26 June 1970), an accomplice after the fact of Roger Cordrey. He was considered so at the time because he knew Cordrey and moreover was found in Cordrey&#x27;s car where a large stash of the stolen money was hidden. He died in jail of cancer. His family are now trying to have his name cleared, as they believe, based on evidence not used in the original trial, that Boal was at best an accomplice after the fact with no knowledge of the robbery, and that it was likely that Cordrey told him nothing about the provenance of the cash. Furthermore, both Ronnie Biggs and Gordon Goody, two surviving gang members at the time, gave sworn affidavits asserting that Boal was innocent. Both gang members stated that they believed Boal was &quot;stitched up&quot; by the police.

==Aftermath==
The audacity and scale of the robbery was yet another controversy with which the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan had to cope. Macmillan resigned in October 1963, claiming poor health—he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and believed he did not have long to live, but the diagnosis turned out to be incorrect. He did not contest his seat at the next election in September 1964, which the Labour Party won under Harold Wilson.

After his success in securing White and Edwards, Tommy Butler got the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Joseph Simpson, to suspend his retirement on his 55th birthday so he could continue to hunt the robbers. This paid off with the arrests of first Wilson, then Reynolds. When asked by a reporter after the sentencing of Reynolds whether that was the end of it, Butler replied that it was not over until Biggs was caught. In 1969 he was finally forced to accept compulsory retirement, and later died in 1970, aged 57. That same day, Biggs&#x27; memoirs were published in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper.

Butler&#x27;s deputy, Frank Williams, was passed over to be his replacement as head of the Flying Squad because of his deal with Pembroke (which he thought would seal his promotion) and his deal with another of the robbers who was never caught. Following this, he left the force to become head of security for the airline Qantas. He wrote his autobiography &quot;No Fixed Address&quot;, which was published in 1973.

Jack Slipper of the Metropolitan Police was promoted to detective chief superintendent. He became so involved in the case that he continued to hunt many of the escaped robbers after he retired. He believed Biggs should not be released after returning to the UK in 2001 and he often appeared in the media to comment on any news item connected with the robbery before his death on 24 August 2005 at the age of 81.

Detective Chief Superintendent Ernest Malcolm Fewtrell, head of the Buckinghamshire Crime Investigation Department (CID) was born on 29 September 1909 and died on 28 November 2005, aged 96. He retired on the last day of the trial after the verdicts were handed down at the then compulsory retirement age of 55. This allowed him (with Ronald Payne of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, who was involved in the paper&#x27;s coverage of the case) to be the first of the investigators to write a book &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; on the robbery investigation in 1964. In the book, he expressed some frustration with the Flying Squad although he mostly had praise for individual officers. His one regret was that he had the search for the hideout carried out radiating outwards from the scene of the robbery rather than an inwards search from a perimeter. He worked as an accommodation officer for Portsmouth Polytechnic before retiring to live by the sea near Swanage. He continued to express disgust at any film that he felt glamourised the robbers. It has been said that he bore a striking resemblance to John Thaw, who was the star of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, which, perhaps coincidentally, was a television series about a detective in the Thames Valley Police Force (the modern-day successor to Buckinghamshire Constabulary). Fewtrell was assisted and later succeeded in the investigation by John Woolley, who served in the Buckinghamshire Constabulary from 1959 to 1984.

George Hatherill (1898–1986) had his service extended by one year because of the need to complete the investigation of the Great Train Robbery. He visited Canada and the US as a lecturer on police matters. He died on 17 June 1986 at the age of 87.

Gerald MacArthur died aged 70 on 21 July 1996. He was famous for breaking up the Richardson Gang at a time when a significant number of London-based detectives were known to be corrupt.

===The crime scene===

One of the Post Office carriages that was part of the remaining train (not involved in the actual robbery) is preserved at the Nene Valley Railway at Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, and is being restored. The actual carriage that was robbed [M30204M] was retained for seven years following the robbery, and then taken to Norfolk and burned in the presence of police and Post Office representatives at a scrapyard near Norwich in 1970. This was to deter collector/souvenir hunters. Locomotive English Electric Type 4 – D326 (later 40126) was involved in a number of serious operating incidents. The locomotive was scrapped at Doncaster Railway workshops in 1984. The retrieved Monopoly board used by the robbers at their Leatherslade Farm hideout and a genuine £5 note from the robbery are on display at the Thames Valley Police museum in Sulhamstead, Berkshire.

For some years Network Rail described the location of the robbery as &quot;Train Robbers&#x27; bridge&quot; in their infrastructure records, and a structure identification plate showing this was attached to the bridge. This led to an outcry advocating restoration of the original name of Bridego Bridge. In late 2013 Network Rail bowed to public pressure, but this time named it Mentmore Bridge. The sign was replaced around 2017.

== Recovery of the money ==
£2,631,684 was stolen (although the police report says £2,595,997). The bulk of the haul was in £1 notes and £5 notes (both the older white note and the newer blue note which was half its size). The £5 notes were bundled in batches of £2,500, the £1 notes in batches of £500. There were also ten-shilling notes in batches of £250. A quantity of Irish and Scottish money was also stolen.
With the exception of a few &#x27;drinks&#x27; for associates, the loot was split into 17 equal shares of around £150,000 each (George Hatherill claims that there were 18 shares).

With a few notable exceptions, the money was quickly laundered or divided by friends, family and associates of the robbers. Much was laundered through bookmakers (Wilson and Wisbey were themselves bookmakers) although, astonishingly, only a few hundred pounds were identifiable by serial number so the robbers could have spent the money without fear of being traced. There were 1,579 notes whose serial numbers were known and the rest of the money was completely untraceable.

The £5 notes were of two different types, because in 1957 the British Government had begun to replace the large white notes with smaller blue ones. The final changeover had not been completed by the time of the robbery. The white notes quickly became far more conspicuous to use, making it harder for them to be spent.

Although within six months of the robbery 10 of the robbers had been locked up awaiting trial and three others were wanted criminals on the run, very little of the money had actually been recovered. This has led to speculation that there is a great deal of robbery loot still out there. In fact, the money was soon seized and spent by predatory gangsters and greedy associates, relatives and lawyers. Thus the proceeds of the greatest cash robbery in British history were quickly used up, with few of the robbers receiving any real long-term benefit.

Less than £400,000 was eventually recovered. Over half of this consisted of the shares of Roger Cordrey (£141,017) and (allegedly) Brian Field (£100,900). A further £36,000 was recovered from Jimmy White&#x27;s caravan. Roy James was carrying £12,041 when captured. £47,245 was found in a telephone box in Great Dover Street, Newington, South London.

===Telephone box controversy===
The £47,245 recovered from a telephone box included 57 notes whose serial numbers had been recorded by the bank in Scotland. This money was part of a deal struck with Frank Williams by Danny Pembroke. Piers Paul Read, in &quot;The Train Robbers&quot;, claimed that the police were feeling the pressure because although they had caught many of the robbers, they had failed to recover much of the money. While no evidence had been found against Pembroke, who was believed to have been one of the South Coast Raiders, some of the identifiable bank notes had been traced back to him through friends who had been charged with receiving. Given that the police had insufficient evidence against Pembroke, either at Leatherslade Farm or definitive connection with either of the two gangs, Butler was prepared to let him go. Williams convinced Butler to pull Pembroke in for questioning and in return for releasing him and not charging his friends with more serious crimes, £50,000 was to be returned.

On 3 December 1963, which happened to be the same day that Roy James was taken into custody, the police received an anonymous tip directing them to the money in the phone box. The money was driven up to Aylesbury and taken into custody by Detective Superintendent Fewtrell, who wondered how his London colleagues could know how much money there was. He had to bring in bank clerks to count the damp and musty money to determine the final sum.

Williams made no admission to the recovery of the money being the result of a deal with Pembroke. Despite claiming that his negotiations were responsible for the return of this money, Williams in his book &quot;No Fixed Address&quot; (1973) claimed not to know the identity of the person who had returned the money, although he did mention several robbers to whom he had offered deals through intermediaries. He noted that it seemed to him that Butler was sceptical of his efforts and that at the press conference Hatherill and Millen did not reveal the circumstances behind the find and that he was never asked to talk with them about it. Despite Pembroke being the man identified as the assailant of the train driver, Jack Mills, by Bruce Reynolds (albeit indirectly), Williams only makes mention of the assailant once in his book. In this section (often quoted by other sources), he confirms that, with Tommy Butler, he questioned the man they knew to be the assailant but that they had no evidence to convict him. Strangely, however, he makes no further mention of him.

The deal done with Pembroke caused outrage in the police hierarchy. It is hinted in several books that the deals done by Williams were responsible for his being overlooked for promotion and that Williams was unhappy that his efforts were not recognised by Butler, but were instead hidden from superiors.

For his part, George Hatherill, in his book &quot;A Detective&#x27;s Tale&quot;, stated that the motive behind the return of the money was not known for certain. He said that the money was returned by &quot;one about whom extensive inquiries had been made and who in fact was interrogated at length. But in spite of our strong suspicions, nothing could be proved against him and so no charge could be brought. My belief is that he thought we knew more about him than we did, and thinking things were getting hot, he decided to get rid of the money to avoid being found in possession with it&quot;. Hatherill does not mention Williams at all in his book. He retired on the last day of the trial at Aylesbury.

===Legal fees===
The 19 gang members who were arrested shortly after the robbery had to spend a large amount on legal fees (approximately £30,000 each).

===Money spent===
The robbers who spent much time on the run overseas—Reynolds, Wilson and Edwards—had very little left when finally arrested, having had to spend money avoiding capture and indulging in lavish lifestyles without finding employment. Much of Jimmy White&#x27;s money was taken from him.

According to Marilyn Wisbey, her father&#x27;s share was hidden by his father Tommy Wisbey Senior in the panels in the doors of his home. Butler raided them three times but he never found the train money. The majority of the money was reputedly entrusted to Wisbey&#x27;s father and also to his younger brother Ron, who coincidentally had saved some money of his own that was confiscated by the police and returned to Ron three months later. By the time Wisbey was released from jail all of his share had either been spent or invested. Marilyn agrees with Piers Paul Read&#x27;s assessment of how her father&#x27;s share of approximately £150,000 was spent. Although the Wisbey share was one that was not taken by other criminals, Marilyn Wisbey is still bitter that her relatives got to spend a fair amount of the loot while the overall sum dwindled away. However, her grandfather used some of the money to buy them a house in Upper Norwood.

Up to six of the robbers escaped punishment in one way or another - &quot;The Ulsterman&quot;, three robbers who were never caught, John Daly who had his charges dismissed at the trial and Ronnie Biggs who escaped from jail and managed to avoid being taken back to the UK. Daly had entrusted his money to another crook. This man had betrayed him to the police and had absconded with the money. He died before Daly could catch up with him. Upon the release of the others in the mid-1970s, &quot;Bill Jennings&quot; got in touch with Buster Edwards and &quot;Frank Monroe&quot; got in touch with the South Coast Raiders. Both said that they had no money left. Danny Pembroke went initially to America and John Daly at the time was said to be living on unemployment benefits in the west of England. Ronnie Biggs quickly spent his share getting a new life. He loved his new life in Australia, although by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 had been spent. £55,000 had been paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK. The rest had gone on legal fees and expenses.

==Sources==

===Early books===
These books were written in the immediate aftermath of the 1964 trial and before the capture of several of the gang.
* &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1964) by John Gosling and Dennis Craig. The first book about the robbery, it relied on the real-life experience of John Gosling, a former policeman.
* &quot;The Robbers&#x27; Tale&quot; (1965) by Peta Fordham, first published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London. It told the story of the robbery only shortly after the conclusion of the initial trial. The author was the wife of one of the lawyers involved in the case. The book mostly involves a description of the trial. The author constantly hints that she knew more than she was prepared to write, yet it was written before most of the facts emerged.

===Biographies of investigators===
Books written by senior police in the early 1970s, after their retirement, chiefly present accounts of the investigation, capture, trial and recapture of the robbers.
* &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; (1964) by Malcolm Fewtrell (with Ronald Payne), first published in London by Arthur Barker Limited.
* &quot;A Detective&#x27;s Story&quot; (1971) by George Hatherill, first published in London by Andre Deutsch Limited () is part autobiography and part description on what makes a detective. Chapter 14, the last chapter of the book is dedicated to the Great Train Robbery the final major investigation before Hatherill&#x27;s retirement.
* &quot;Specialist in Crime&quot; (1972) by Ernest Millen, first published by George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd (). An autobiography. When he retired, Millen was Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard and Commander of the CID. A unique inside story of his career as a detective.
* &quot;No Fixed Abode&quot; (1973) by Frank Williams, first published by W. H. Allen &amp; Co Ltd (). It tells the story of the aftermath of the robbery from Williams&#x27;s point of view, in particular describing the mistakes made in the early days by senior officers, and the autocratic nature of Tommy Butler. The book is targeted at Ronnie Biggs in the hope that he will contact Williams for a deal, similar to the one arranged by Buster Edwards. The book mistakenly identifies Bill Boal as a robber (although it concedes his role was a support role), and it also mistakenly identifies Biggs as one of the leaders.
* &quot;Slipper of the Yard&quot; (1981) by Jack Slipper, first published by Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd (). This book is an autobiography of the police career of Jack Slipper, who had retired the year before as one of the best-known and most decorated detectives in the Metropolitan Police Force. It includes a chapter on his participation in the Train Robbery Squad hunting for the robbers, and has details on the arrests of Roy James, John Daly and Jimmy Hussey. It also has a chapter on the mission to recover Ronnie Biggs from Brazil and denounces the press version of events.

* &quot;Slip Up&quot; (1975) by Anthony Delano and first published by Quadrangle / The New York Times Book Co. ().
* &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; (1978) by Piers Paul Read and first published by W.H. Allen and Company (). This book recounts a very detailed version of the story based on an exclusive account given by eight of the then-paroled robbers (Edwards, Goody, Hussey, Wisby, Welch, James, White and Cordrey with contradictory versions by Reynolds and Biggs). Despite revealing more than previous accounts, the book is flawed in that it includes inaccuracies that the funding source for the heist was former SS officer Otto Skorzeny. As the story unfolds in the book, however, the German connection was proved to be false.

===Film and video===
* The 1966 German three-part TV mini series &quot;&quot; tells a fictionalised version of the story more or less close to the facts, but changes the names of those involved and of locations.
* The 1967 film, &quot;Robbery&quot;, is a heavily fictionalised version based on the events of 1963 directed by Peter Yates. The movie launched Yates&#x27;s Hollywood career after it attracted the interest of Steve McQueen who got the British director to make his next feature, &quot;Bullitt&quot;. The film featured a gripping car chase (though this was connected to another earlier crime and not the robbery) which included scenes of a policeman being run down. Despite being a fictionalised account &quot;Robbery&quot; did draw on key details of the real robbery and these were reflected in the film. These included the detailed planning and preparation used, the use of a farmhouse as a base and the intended (but unsuccessful) use of a replacement driver for the train. The film ends with the mastermind of the robbery &quot;Clifton&quot;, played by Stanley Baker (whose own company Oakhurst Productions had produced the film), evading capture and going on the run overseas by posing as a merchant seaman.
* The 1969 French film &quot;The Brain&quot; stars David Niven as a British master criminal who perpetrates in France a heist based on the Great Train robbery. The script implies him to be the real planner of the 1963 robbery.
* Musician Phil Collins starred in the title role of &quot;Buster&quot; (1988), a comedy-drama film loosely based on the life of Edwards with Larry Lamb as Reynolds.
* In 2012, a five-part ITV docudrama, &quot;Mrs Biggs&quot;, was produced, relating events chiefly from the point of view of Charmian Biggs, who assisted in the scripting and production. ITV concurrently produced a 44-minute documentary film, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, written and directed by Marion Milne. Based on &quot;The Great Train Robbery – Crime of the Century – the definitive account&quot; (2013) by Nick Russell-Pavier, who also acted as programme consultant. Filmed at actual locations and featuring interviews with Charmian Biggs, Bruce Reynolds and other real-life participants.

<doc id="154191" wikidata="Q49075" url="?curid=154191" title="Louis Farrakhan">
<text>Louis Farrakhan (; born Louis Eugene Walcott; May 11, 1933) is an American religious leader who heads the Nation of Islam (NOI), a black nationalist organization. Farrakhan is notable for his leadership of the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, D.C., and for his rhetoric that has been widely denounced as antisemitic and racist.

Prior to joining the NOI, Farrakhan was a calypso singer who used the stage name Calypso Gene. Early in his career, he served as the minister of mosques in Boston and Harlem and was appointed to the post of National Representative of the Nation of Islam by then-NOI leader Elijah Muhammad. He adopted the name Louis X before being named Louis Farrakhan.

After Warith Deen Mohammed reorganized the original NOI into the orthodox Sunni Islamic group American Society of Muslims, Farrakhan began to rebuild the NOI as &quot;Final Call&quot;. In 1981, he officially adopted the name &quot;Nation of Islam&quot;, reviving the group and establishing its headquarters at Mosque Maryam. In October 1995, Farrakhan organized and led the Million Man March in Washington, D.C.. Due to health issues, he reduced his responsibilities with the NOI in 2007. However, Farrakhan has continued to deliver sermons and speak at NOI events. In 2015, he led the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March: Justice or Else.

Farrakhan is known for antisemitic statements and racist remarks directed at white people. His antisemitic statements and views have been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and other organizations. Farrakhan&#x27;s views and remarks have also been called homophobic. He has denied assertions that he is antisemitic, racist, or anti-gay.
Farrakhan was banned from Facebook in 2019 along with other public figures considered to be extremists.
==Early life and education==
Farrakhan, who is Black, was born Louis Eugene Walcott on May 11, 1933 in The Bronx, New York City. He is the younger of two sons of Sarah Mae Manning (1900–1988) and Percival Clark, immigrants from the Anglo-Caribbean islands. His mother was born in Saint Kitts, while his father was Jamaican. The couple separated before their second son was born, and Walcott says he never knew his biological father. Walcott was named after Louis Walcott, a man with whom his mother had a relationship after becoming separated from Percival Clark. In a 1996 interview with Henry Louis Gates Jr., Walcott speculated that Percival Clark, &quot;a light-skinned man with straight hair from Jamaica&quot;, may have been Jewish.

After Walcott&#x27;s stepfather died in 1936, the Walcott family moved to Boston, where they settled in the largely African-American neighborhood of Roxbury.

Walcott received his first violin at the age of five. By the time he was 12 years old, he had been on tour with the Boston College Orchestra. A year later, he participated in national competitions and won them. In 1946, he was one of the first black performers to appear on the Ted Mack &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot;, where he also won an award. Walcott and his family were active members of the Episcopal St. Cyprian&#x27;s Church in Roxbury.

Walcott attended the Boston Latin School, and later attended and graduated from the English High School. He completed three years at Winston-Salem Teachers College, where he had a track scholarship.
In 1953, Walcott married Betsy Ross (later known as Khadijah Farrakhan) while he was in college. Due to complications from his new wife&#x27;s first pregnancy, Walcott dropped out after completing his junior year of college to devote time to his wife and their child.

==Music career==
In the 1950s, Walcott began his professional music career as a singer billed as &quot;The Charmer&quot;. It was during a tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that he took this nickname. At this point, earning $500 a week, Walcott was touring the northeastern and midwestern United States, sometimes also using the nickname &quot;Calypso Gene&quot;. In 1953–1954, preceding Harry Belafonte&#x27;s success with his album &quot;Calypso&quot; (released in 1956), he recorded and released a dozen cheeky, funny tunes as &quot;The Charmer&quot; in a mixed mento/calypso style, including &quot;Ugly Woman&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Man&quot; and calypso standards like &quot;Zombie Jamboree&quot;, &quot;Hol &#x27;Em Joe&quot;, &quot;Mary Ann&quot; and &quot;Brown Skin Girl&quot;. Some were reissued: &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch Me Nylon&quot; has mild, explicit sexual lyrics as well as &quot;Female Boxer&quot;, which contains some sexist overtones and &quot;Is She Is, Or Is She Ain&#x27;t&quot; (inspired by Christine Jorgensen&#x27;s sex change operation).

When Farrakhan first joined the NOI, he was asked by Elijah Muhammad to put aside his musical career as a calypso singer. After many years, Farrakhan decided to take up the violin once more primarily due to the urging of prominent classical musician Sylvia Olden Lee.

On April 17, 1993, Farrakhan made his return concert debut with performances of the &quot;Violin Concerto in E Minor&quot; by Felix Mendelssohn. Farrakhan intimated that his performance of a concerto by a Jewish composer was, in part, an effort to heal a rift between him and the Jewish community. (Mendelssohn&#x27;s family converted to Christianity). &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Bernard Holland reported that Farrakhan&#x27;s performance was somewhat flawed due to years of neglect, but &quot;nonetheless Mr. Farrakhan&#x27;s sound is that of the authentic player. It is wide, deep and full of the energy that makes the violin gleam.&quot;&#x27;

In 2021, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Beethoven&#x27;s birth, Farrakhan performed Violin Concerto in D Major Op. 61 with the New World Symphony.

==Nation of Islam==

In February 1955, Walcott was headlining a show in Chicago, Illinois, called &quot;Calypso Follies&quot;. There he first came in contact with the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI) through Rodney Smith, a friend and saxophonist from Boston. Walcott and his wife Betsy were invited to the Nation of Islam&#x27;s annual Saviours&#x27; Day address by Elijah Muhammad. Prior to going to Saviours&#x27; Day, due to then-Minister Malcolm X&#x27;s media presence, Walcott had never heard of Elijah Muhammad, and like many outside of the Nation of Islam, he thought that Malcolm X was the leader of the Nation of Islam.

In 1955, Walcott fulfilled the requirements to be a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer. He memorized and recited verbatim the 10 questions and answers of the NOI&#x27;s Student Enrollment. He then wrote a Saviour&#x27;s Letter that must be sent to the NOI&#x27;s headquarters in Chicago. The Saviour&#x27;s Letter must be copied , and have the identical handwriting of the Nation of Islam&#x27;s founder, Wallace Fard Muhammad.

After having the Saviour&#x27;s Letter reviewed and approved by the NOI&#x27;s headquarters in Chicago in July 1955, Walcott received a letter of approval from the Nation of Islam acknowledging his official membership as a registered Muslim/registered believer/registered laborer in the NOI. As a result, he received his &quot;X.&quot; The &quot;X&quot; was considered a placeholder, used to indicate that Nation of Islam members&#x27; original African family names had been lost. They acknowledged that European surnames were slave names, assigned by the slaveowners in order to mark their ownership. Members of the NOI used the &quot;X&quot; while they were waiting for their Islamic names, which some NOI members received later in their conversions.

Hence, Louis Walcott became Louis X. Elijah Muhammad then replaced his &quot;X&quot; with the &quot;holy name&quot; Farrakhan, which is a corruption of the Arabic word فرقان &quot;furqan&quot;, which means &quot;The Criterion&quot;. On a very different tone from his calypso songs, he recorded two tunes as Louis X, criticizing racism in &quot;A White Man&#x27;s Heaven Is a Black Man&#x27;s Hell,&quot; a record album which was issued on Boston&#x27;s &quot;A Moslem Sings&quot; label in 1960. The summer after Farrakhan&#x27;s conversion, Elijah Muhammad stated that all musicians in the NOI had to choose between music and the Nation of Islam.

===Early ministry roles (1956–1980)===
After nine months of being a registered Muslim in the NOI and a member of Muhammad&#x27;s Temple of Islam in Boston, where Malcolm X was the minister, Farrakhan became his assistant minister. Eventually he became the official minister after Elijah Muhammad transferred Malcolm X to Muhammad&#x27;s Temple of Islam No. 7 on West 116th St. in Harlem, New York City. Louis X wrote in the Dec. 4, 1964, issue of Muhammad Speaks, the organization&#x27;s newspaper: &quot;The dye is set and Malcolm shall not escape. Such a man is worthy of death.&quot;

After Malcolm X&#x27;s death in 1965, Elijah Muhammad appointed Farrakhan to two prominent positions that Malcolm held before being dismissed from the NOI. Farrakhan became the national spokesman/representative of the NOI and was appointed minister of the influential Harlem Mosque, where he served until 1975.
Warith Deen Mohammed, the seventh son of Elijah and Clara Muhammad, was declared the new leader of the Nation of Islam at the annual Saviours&#x27; Day Convention in February 1975, a day after his father died. He made substantial changes in the organization in the late 1970s, taking most of its members into a closer relationship with orthodox Islam, and renaming the group &quot;World Community of Islam in the West&quot;. Eventually, Warith Deen Mohammed renamed the group the American Society of Muslims. He rejected the deification of the Nation of Islam&#x27;s founder Wallace D. Fard, the Mahdi of the Holy Qur&#x27;an, and the messiah of the Bible. Mohammed also welcomed white people—who were once considered devils and enemies by the NOI—as equal brothers, sisters, and friends. Mohammed gave some white people X&#x27;s, and he extended efforts at inter-religious cooperation and outreach to Christians and Jews.

Farrakhan joined Mohammed&#x27;s movement and served as a Sunni Imam under him for years from 1975 to 1978. In 1978, Farrakhan distanced himself from Mohammed&#x27;s movement. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Farrakhan &quot;could not embrace its new philosophy. In particular, Mr.
Farrakhan opposed the concept of working with whites to solve the problems of
blacks&quot;.

In 1979, Farrakhan&#x27;s group founded a weekly newspaper entitled &quot;The Final Call&quot;, which was intended to be similar to the original &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot; newspaper that Malcolm X claimed to have started.

====Assassination of Malcolm X and aftermath====
The day that Malcolm X was assassinated in Harlem, Farrakhan happened to be in Newark, New Jersey, on rotation, 45 minutes away from where Malcolm X was assassinated.

Farrakhan made numerous incendiary statements about Malcolm X, contributing to what was called a &quot;climate of vilification&quot;. Three men from a Newark NOI mosque—Thomas Hagan, Muhammad Abdul Aziz (aka Norman 3X Butler) and Kahlil Islam (aka Thomas 15X Johnson)—were convicted of the killing and served prison sentences. Only Hagan ever admitted his role.

Many, including Malcolm X&#x27;s family, have accused Farrakhan of being involved in the plot to assassinate Malcolm X. For many years, Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, harbored resentment toward the Nation of Islam—and Farrakhan in particular—for what she felt was their role in the assassination of her husband. In a 1993 speech, Farrakhan seemed to confirm that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the assassination:

We don&#x27;t give a damn about no white man law if you attack what we love. And frankly, it ain&#x27;t none of your business. What do you got to say about it? Did you teach Malcolm? Did you make Malcolm? Did you clean up Malcolm? Did you put Malcolm out before the world? Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the &quot;hell&quot; business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation. And a nation gotta be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats. The white man deals with his. The Jews deal with theirs.

During a 1994 interview, Gabe Pressman asked Shabazz whether Farrakhan &quot;had anything to do&quot; with Malcolm X&#x27;s death. She replied: &quot;Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of honor. Everybody talked about it, yes.&quot;

In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm X. &quot;I may have been complicit in words that I spoke&quot;, he said. &quot;I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being.&quot; A few days later Farrakhan denied that he &quot;ordered the assassination&quot; of Malcolm X, although he again acknowledged that he &quot;created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination.&quot;

===Leadership of Nation of Islam (1981–present)===
In 1981, Farrakhan and his supporters held their first Saviours&#x27; Day convention in Chicago, Illinois, and took back the name of the Nation of Islam. The event was similar to the earlier Nation&#x27;s celebrations, last held in Chicago on February 26, 1975. At the convention&#x27;s keynote address, Farrakhan announced his attempt to restore the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s teachings.

On October 24, 1989, at a press conference at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington, D.C., Farrakhan described a vision which he had on September 17, 1985 in Tepoztlán, Mexico. In the vision, he was carried up to &quot;a Wheel, or what you call an unidentified flying object&quot;, as in the Bible&#x27;s Book of Ezekiel. During this experience, he heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Farrakhan indicated that Elijah Muhammad &quot;spoke in short cryptic sentences and as he spoke a scroll full of cursive writing rolled down in front of my eyes, but it was a projection of what was being written in my mind. As I attempted to read the cursive writing, which was in English, the scroll disappeared and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad began to speak to me&quot;. [Elijah Muhammad said], &quot;President Reagan has met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan a war. I want you to hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., and announce their plan and say to the world that you got the information from me, Elijah Muhammad, on the Wheel&quot;.

During that same press conference, Farrakhan stated that he believed his vision had been proven: &quot;In 1987, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Sunday magazine and on the front page of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, the truth of my vision was verified, for the headlines of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; read, &#x27;President Reagan Planned War Against Libya.&#x27;&quot; Farrakhan added &quot;In the article which followed, the exact words that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad spoke to me on the Wheel were found; that the President had met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and planned a war against Libya in the early part of September 1985&quot;.

Farrakhan visited Turkey at invitation on February 18, 1996, and met with the country&#x27;s leading Islamist political figure, Necmettin Erbakan, and his Welfare Party&#x27;s officials. He said that the Turkish people must decide whether it wants to have a secular or Islamic government.
====Million Man March====
In October 1995, Farrakhan convened a broad coalition of what he and his supporters claimed was one million men in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March. The count however fell far below the hoped-for numbers. The National Park Service estimated that approximately 440,000 were in attendance. Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police.

Farrakhan and other speakers called for black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. In Farrakhan&#x27;s 2 hours he quoted from spirituals as well as the Old and New Testaments and termed himself a prophet sent by God to show America its evil. The event was organized by many civil rights and religious organizations and drew men and their sons from across the United States of America. Many other distinguished African Americans addressed the throng, including: Maya Angelou; Rosa Parks; Martin Luther King III, Cornel West, Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Chavis. In 2005, together with other prominent African Americans such as the New Black Panther Party leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, the activist Al Sharpton, Addis Daniel and others, Farrakhan marked the 10th anniversary of the Million Man March by holding a second gathering, the Millions More Movement, October 14–17 in Washington D.C.

=== Succession ===
It is unknown who will lead the Nation of Islam after Farrakhan&#x27;s death. Ishmael Muhammad has been speculated to be a potential successor. Before 1993, Khallid Muhammad was &quot;the most likely heir apparent&quot;.

== Views ==
Farrakhan has been the center of much controversy with critics saying that his political views and comments are antisemitic or racist. Farrakhan has categorically denied these charges and stated that much of America&#x27;s perception of him has been shaped by the media. His critics have labeled him a cult leader.

=== Racism and black nationalism ===
The Anti-Defamation League classifies Farrakhan as a racist, and the Southern Poverty Law Center considers the Nation of Islam (NOI) as a hate group and a black nationalist organization. According to the SPLC, the NOI asserts that black people are racially superior to white people and promotes a &quot;fundamentally anti-white theology&quot; amounting to an &quot;innate black superiority over whites&quot;. According to the NOI, whites were created 6,600 years ago as a &quot;race of devils&quot; by an evil scientist named Yakub, a story which originated with the founder of the NOI, Wallace D. Fard.

The NOI&#x27;s division into two factions after Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s death was caused in part by the fact that new leader Warith Mohammed wished to reject the Yakub myth, while national spokesman Farrakhan wanted to reaffirm it. At an event in Milwaukee in August 2015, Farrakhan said: &quot;White people deserve to die, and they know, so they think it&#x27;s us coming to do it&quot;.

===Antisemitism===

Both the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center consider Farrakhan an antisemite. Farrakhan has accused Jews of controlling large sections of the media, the US government and the global economy, regularly referring to these Jews as &quot;Satanic&quot;. He has repeatedly described Adolf Hitler as a &quot;great man&quot; and claimed Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws and black oppression in general.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center included some of Farrakhan&#x27;s comments on its list of the Top 10 antisemitic slurs in 2012.

In June 1984, after returning from a visit to Libya, Farrakhan delivered a sermon that was recorded by a &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reporter. A transcript from part of the sermon was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

After it was reported that Farrakhan called Judaism the &quot;gutter religion&quot;, he repeatedly denied referring to Judaism as such by explaining that he was instead noticing what he believed was &quot;the Israeli Government&#x27;s use of Judaism as a political tool.&quot; In a June 18, 1997, letter to a former &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editor Jude Wanniski he stated:

In response to Farrakhan&#x27;s speech, Nathan Pearlmutter, then Chair of the Anti-Defamation League, referred to Farrakhan as the new &quot;Black Hitler&quot; and &quot;Village Voice&quot; journalist Nat Hentoff also characterized the NOI leader as a &quot;Black Hitler&quot; while he was a guest on a New York radio talk-show.

In response, Farrakhan announced during a March 11, 1984, speech which was broadcast on a Chicago radio station:
At a later meeting of the Nation of Islam at Madison Square Garden in 1985, Farrakhan said of the Jews: &quot;And don&#x27;t you forget, when it&#x27;s God who puts you in the ovens, it&#x27;s forever!&quot; He has also claimed that German Jews financed the Holocaust in a speech at the Mosque Maryam, Chicago in March 1995: &quot;German Jews financed Hitler right here in America...International bankers financed Hitler and poor Jews died while big Jews were at the root of what you call the Holocaust&quot;. Almost three years later at a Saviors&#x27; Day gathering in the same city, he said: &quot;The Jews have been so bad at politics they lost half their population in the Holocaust. They thought they could trust in Hitler, and they helped him get the Third Reich on the road.&quot;

On March 23, 2002, Farrakhan visited Kahal Kadosh Shaare Shalom in Kingston, Jamaica, which was his first visit to a synagogue, in an attempt to repair his relationship with the Jewish community. Farrakhan was accepted to speak at Shaare Shalom in the native country of his father, after being rejected to appear at American synagogues, many of whom had fear of sending the wrong signals to the Jewish community.

Farrakhan made antisemitic comments during his May 16–17, 2013 visit to Detroit in which he accused President Obama of having &quot;surrounded himself with Satan…members of the Jewish community&quot;. Jews, according to Farrakhan, &quot;have mastered the civilization now, but they&#x27;ve mastered it in evil&quot;. In a weekly lecture series titled &quot;The Time and What Must Be Done&quot;, which began during January 2013, he prophesied the downfall of the United States soon and said the country faced divine punishment if his warnings were rejected.

In March 2015, Farrakhan accused &quot;Israelis and Zionist Jews&quot; of being involved in the September 11 attacks. (In 2012 and 2017 speeches, he said the American government were behind 9/11.) In his Saviours&#x27; Day speech in February 2018, Farrakhan described &quot;the powerful Jews&quot; as his enemy. He approvingly cited President Richard Nixon and the Reverend Billy Graham&#x27;s derogatory comments about Jews&#x27; &quot;grip on the media&quot;, claiming that Jews are responsible for &quot;all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men&quot;.
On February 20, 2019, at the Nation of Islam&#x27;s annual Saviour&#x27;s Day gathering, Farrakhan declared, &quot;I represent the Messiah. I represent the Jesus and I am that Jesus&quot;.
A three-hour speech by Farrakhan on July 4, 2020 was carried by Revolt TV&#x27;s YouTube channel, He claimed Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the anti-bigotry nonprofit Anti-Defamation League, is Satan, and described Alan Dershowitz as &quot;a skillful deceiver&quot; and &quot;Satan masquerading as a lawyer&quot;. Greenblatt responded in a tweet: &quot;This is routine for Farrakhan—give him a platform, he never fails to espouse hatred.&quot; Farrakhan made the factually inaccurate claim that Jews are required by their religion to poison prophets and claimed Jews had &quot;broken their covenant relationship with God&quot; and were the &quot;enemy of God&quot;. However, in his speech, Farrakhan also said: &quot;If you really think I hate the Jewish people, you don&#x27;t know me at all,&quot; adding &quot;[I&#x27;ve never] uttered the words of death to the Jewish people.&quot; As of July 15, 2020, Farrakhan&#x27;s speech had been viewed more than 1.2 million times on YouTube.

In October 2023, Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam sued the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Center for defamation damages in the amount of USD $4.8 billion, contending that the defendants have falsely characterized Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam as anti-Semites. The case was dismissed in April 2024.

===Hurricane Katrina===
In comments in 2005, Farrakhan stated that there was a hole under one of the key levees that failed in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. He implied that the levee&#x27;s destruction was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the population of the largely black sections within the city. Farrakhan later said that New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told him of the crater during a meeting in Dallas, Texas.

Farrakhan further claimed that the fact the levee broke the day after Hurricane Katrina is proof that the destruction of the levee was not a natural occurrence. Farrakhan has raised additional questions and has called for federal investigations into the source of the levee break. He also asserted that the hurricane was &quot;God&#x27;s way of punishing America for its warmongering and racism&quot;.

Experts including the Independent Levee Investigation Team (ILIT) from the University of California, Berkeley have countered his accusations. The report from the ILIT said &quot;The findings of this panel are that the over-topping of the levees by flood waters, the often sub-standard materials used to shore up the levees, and the age of the levees contributed to these scour holes found at many of the sites of levee breaks after the hurricane.&quot;

===Barack Obama===
In 2008, Farrakhan publicly criticized the United States and supported then-Senator Barack Obama who was campaigning at the time to become the president of the United States of America. Farrakhan and Obama had met at least once before that time.

The Obama campaign quickly responded to convey his distance from the minister. &quot;Senator Obama has been clear in his objections to Farrakhan&#x27;s past pronouncements and has not solicited the minister&#x27;s support,&quot; said Obama spokesman Bill Burton. Obama &quot;rejected and denounced&quot; Farrakhan&#x27;s support during an NBC presidential debate.

Following the 2008 presidential election, Farrakhan explained, during a BET television interview, that he was &quot;careful&quot; never to endorse Obama during his campaign. &quot;I talked about him—but, in very beautiful and glowing terms, stopping short of endorsing him. And unfortunately, or fortunately, however we look at it, the media said I &#x27;endorsed&#x27; him, so he renounced my so-called endorsement and support. But that didn&#x27;t stop me from supporting him.&quot;

On May 28, 2011, Farrakhan, speaking at the American Clergy Leadership Conference, lambasted Obama over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the intervention in Libya, calling him an &quot;assassin&quot; and a &quot;murderer&quot;. &quot;We voted for our brother Barack, a beautiful human being with a sweet heart,&quot; Farrakhan said, in a video that was widely shared on the Internet. &quot;But he has turned into someone else,&quot; Farrakhan told the crowd. &quot;Now he&#x27;s an assassin.&quot;

===Dianetics===
A connection between the Church of Scientology and the Nation of Islam is reported to date from the late 1990s when Farrakhan was introduced to its teachings by the musician Isaac Hayes, who was the Church of Scientology&#x27;s International spokesman for its World Literacy Crusade.

On May 8, 2010, Farrakhan publicly announced his embrace of Dianetics and has actively encouraged Nation of Islam members to undergo auditing from the Church. Although he has stressed that he is not a Scientologist, but only a believer in Dianetics and the theories related to it, the Church honored Farrakhan previously during its 2006 Ebony Awakening awards ceremony (which he did not attend). Farrakhan has also urged European Americans to join the Church of Scientology, stating in his 2011 Saviour&#x27;s Day speech, &quot;All white people should flock to [Scientology founder] L. Ron Hubbard.&quot; Reportedly, according to the SPLC, Hubbard was a racist who supported the apartheid regime in South Africa.

Since the announcement in 2010, the Nation of Islam has been hosting its own Dianetic courses and its own graduation ceremonies. At the third such ceremony, which was held on Saviours Day 2013, it was announced that nearly 8,500 members of the organisation had undergone Dianetic auditing. The Organisation announced it had graduated 1,055 auditors and had delivered 82,424 hours of auditing. The graduation ceremony was certified by the Church of Scientology, and the Nation of Islam members received official certification. The ceremony was attended by Shane Woodruff, vice-president of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s Celebrity Centre International. He stated that &quot;The unfolding story of the Nation of Islam and Dianetics is bold, it is determined and it is absolutely committed to restoring freedom and wiping hell from the face of this planet.&quot;

===Donald Trump===

During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Farrakhan praised Republican candidate Donald Trump as the only candidate &quot;who has stood in front of the Jewish community and said &#x27;I don&#x27;t want your money.&#x27;&quot; While he declined to endorse Trump outright, he said of Trump, &quot;I like what I&#x27;m looking at.&quot; In 2018, Farrakhan again praised Trump for &quot;destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise&quot;. He included the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in this group.

Conservative pundits Candace Owens and Glenn Beck both took note of Farrakhan&#x27;s position, with Owens saying, while she did not &quot;endorse Farrakhan&#x27;s views&quot;, it remained a &quot;really big deal&quot; that Farrakhan had &quot;aligned himself with Trump&#x27;s administration&quot; and Beck declaring that &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; and urged &quot;reconciliation&quot; between conservatives and Farrakhan.

===Women and allegations of sexism===
Farrakhan received sexual discrimination complaints filed with a New York state agency when he banned women from attending a speech he gave in a city-owned theater in 1993. The next year he gave a speech only women could attend. In his speech for women, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported,

Mr. Farrakhan urged the women to embrace his formula for a successful family. He encouraged them to put husbands and children ahead of their careers, shun tight, short skirts, stay off welfare and reject abortion. He also stressed the importance of cooking and cleaning and urged women not to abandon homemaking for careers. &#x27;You&#x27;re just not going to be happy unless there is happiness in the home,&#x27; Mr. Farrakhan said at the Mason Cathedral Church of God in Christ in the Dorchester section, not far from the Roxbury neighborhood where he was raised by a single mother. &#x27;Your professional lives can&#x27;t satisfy your soul like a good, loving man.&#x27;
==Relationship with Muammar Gaddafi==
In 1985, Farrakhan obtained working capital in the amount of $5 million, in the form of an interest-free loan from Libya&#x27;s Islamic Call Society to be repaid within 18 months which was to be used to create a toiletries firm with black employees. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had also offered Farrahkan guns to begin a black nation. Farrakhan said that he told Gaddafi that he preferred an economic investment in black America.

In January 1996, when Farrakhan visited Libya, Gaddafi pledged giving him a gift of $1 billion and a personal award of $250,000. As economic activity between the two countries had been restricted by the US government since 1986 following allegations of Libya&#x27;s connection to terrorism, the financial transfer was blocked. It was unclear if Gaddafi would have been in a position to finance the money transfer.

At the time of the wider uprisings in the Arab world and the Tsunami in Japan in a Chicago press conference on March 31, 2011, Farrakhan said President Obama&#x27;s action in supporting the rebels in Libya were going to advance the arrival of UFOs, or divine spaceships, as punishments for black sufferings. Depicting Obama as engulfed by the people surrounding him, he said: &quot;The stupid mistake that we make is to think that the president is the supreme power. Never was. Money is the power in America. … All of you know what I&#x27;m talking about, Zionist control of the government of the United States of America.&quot; When Gaddafi was killed in October 2011, Farrakhan blamed Obama&#x27;s advisors whom he called &quot;wicked demons&quot;.

==Social media==
Farrakhan lost his verified status on his Twitter posts in June 2018, denying him full verification, after asserting the Harvey Weinstein scandal was about &quot;Jewish power&quot;. A contributor to the &quot;Tablet&quot; website, Yair Rosenberg, objected to a potential suspension on the grounds that &quot;erasing hate from social media doesn&#x27;t make it go away, it just makes it easier to ignore&quot;: allowing such accounts to continue to have a social media presence makes them more difficult to dismiss as &quot;inconsequential&quot;. The following October, Twitter said that it would not suspend Farrakhan&#x27;s account after he posted a tweet that compared Jews to termites: Twitter substantiated its inaction by stating that he had not broken the site&#x27;s rules. After a Twitter rule change on hateful conduct in July 2019, the tweet—&quot;I&#x27;m not an anti-Semite. I&#x27;m anti-Termite&quot;—was removed.

At the beginning of May 2019, Farrakhan was banned from Facebook, along with other prominent individuals considered by the company to be extremists, with antisemitism believed to be the reason for Farrakhan&#x27;s removal.

During a speech at Saint Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago a week later, Farrakhan stated he had &quot;never been arrested&quot; for &quot;drunken driving&quot; and asked: &quot;What have I done that you would hate me like that?&quot; The Nation of Islam said his speech was Farrakhan&#x27;s response to the &quot;public outrage over the unprecedented and unwarranted lifetime ban&quot; from Facebook. He insisted he was neither a misogynist nor a homophobe and that: &quot;I do not hate Jewish people&quot;. Blase J. Cupich, the Archbishop of Chicago, condemned the decision of the church in allowing Farrakhan to speak there.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Farrakhan has been married to Khadijah Farrakhan since 1953. He is the father of nine children and the grandfather of basketball player Mustapha Farrakhan Jr. Farrakhan&#x27;s eldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr., died on June 2, 2018.

===Health===
Farrakhan announced that he was seriously ill in a letter on September 11, 2006. The letter was directed to his staff, the Nation of Islam members, and supporters. The letter, published in &quot;The Final Call&quot; newspaper, said that doctors in Cuba had discovered a peptic ulcer. According to the letter, Farrakhan lost 35 pounds (16 kg) due to subsequent infections, and he urged the Nation of Islam leadership to carry on while he recovered.

Farrakhan was released from his five-week hospital stay on January 28, 2007, after major abdominal surgery. The operation was performed to correct damage caused by side effects of a radioactive &quot;seed&quot; implantation procedure that he received years earlier to successfully treat prostate cancer.

Following his hospital stay, Farrakhan released a &quot;Message of Appreciation&quot; to supporters and well-wishers and weeks later delivered the keynote address at the Nation of Islam&#x27;s annual convention in Detroit.

In December 2013, Farrakhan announced that he had not appeared publicly for two months because he had suffered a heart attack in October.

<text>Frederick Wilmoth Hendricks (November 25, 1895 – August 6, 1973), best known as Wilmoth Houdini, was a prominent calypsonian.

==Life==
In 1916, he started his career in earnest when he began working with the African Millionaires, a large carnival group consisting of about 25 members. He arrived in New York City sometime around 1927, after working on cargo ships and travelling extensively. Not long after his arrival there, he began cutting records with local bands for Decca Records, notably Gerald Clark&#x27;s Night Owls. He released well over a hundred different 78s between 1928 and 1940, also under the names of Fredrick Wilmoth Hendricks (his given name), Edgar Leon Sinclair (the name on his US passport), and King Houdini. His 1939 composition &quot;He Had It Coming&quot; was a hit for Louis Jordan and Ella Fitzgerald under the new title &quot;Stone Cold Dead in the Market&quot;. The song stayed on the top of the R&amp;B charts for five weeks, and reached no. 7 on the pop charts. Gaining a good deal of recognition, Houdini wasted no time in organizing high-profile calypso festivals and concerts around New York, quickly becoming a respected member of the Caribbean communities there.

After moving to New York (as one of the earliest Trinidadian émigrés), he was often the object of derision by the calypsonians still in Trinidad, who claimed that he was stealing their ideas and capitalizing on them in the USA. This can be seen in numerous calypsos of the early to mid-1930s, from Roaring Lion and Attila the Hun in particular, who also recorded in New York at the time. This led to Houdini&#x27;s 1934 rebuttal, &quot;War Declaration&quot;. Towards the beginning of the 1950s he played regularly at the Caribbean Club on Seventh Avenue, New York, with his only real rival, The Duke of Iron, also a native of Trinidad.

Houdini died on August 6, 1973, in New York City, where he had lived for most his life. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

==Influence==
His song &quot;Uncle Joe&quot;, although melodically not original, had a huge influence upon the American psyche, influencing Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Lord Mouse and the Kalypso Katz, Hazmat Modine, Bob Brozman, and C. W. Stoneking, to name but a few. He has inspired a newer generation of artists around the world, for example with his recording &quot;Black But Sweet&quot; covered by Mighty Dub Katz (&quot;Son of Wilmot&quot;), Sabres of Paradise (&quot;Wilmot&quot;), Shantel (&quot;Bucovina&quot;) and Eleftheria Arvanitaki (&quot;Δεν μιλώ για μια νύχτα, εγώ&quot;). The Avalanches sampled Houdini&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Sox Idol&quot; heavily in the 2016 single &quot;Frankie Sinatra&quot;.

<doc id="154196" wikidata="Q328104" url="?curid=154196" title="Blankenberge">
<text>Blankenberge (; ; ) is a seaside city and a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Blankenberge proper and the settlement of Uitkerke. 

On 1 December 2014, Blankenberge had a total population of 19,897. The total area of the municipality is 17.41 km², giving a population density of 1,142 inhabitants per km². The towns inhabitants are called Blankenbergenaars.

Blankenberge is one of the most important seaside resorts on the Belgian coast in terms of tourist numbers and hotel reservations. It is a national and to a certain extent international seaside resort, attracting visitors from across northern Europe. It possesses a long sandy beach, and a Art Deco pier, the Belgium Pier, constructed in 1933.

== The fishery ==
The first fishing activities date back to the 11th century. By the 12th century, the fishing fleet had more than 60 ships. A pontoon was built in the 15th century in the vicinity of the lighthouse, a construction which served until the beginning of the 16th century. The fishermen of Blankenberge would land their catch in barges which approached the beach. No port was constructed until 1871 when a navigation channel with a wharf was built. The fishery declined during the period between the two world wars and disappeared in 1945. The port was destroyed by the Germans in World War 2. A new port for pleasure boats was rebuilt in 1955. The port has undergone two more extensions and currently accommodates 1,000 boats.

== Seaside resort ==
As early as the first half of the 18th century, tourists came to Blankenberghe (spelling influenced by French). The Brugsesteenweg was built in 1723. This not only ensured a growing export of fish but also an easy connection for the inhabitants of Bruges who came to the sea for a day of relaxation. There was no such thing as sea bathing at that time. Bathing developed under the influence of English tourism in the 19th century. The first bathing cabins appeared on the beach in 1838. Shortly afterwards, a wooden seawall was built and the first hotels appeared. In 1859 the impressive Casino Kursaal was built. 

On 16 August 1863, the Heist-Bruges railway opened, with a stop in Blankenberge. This made Blankenberge much more accessible for (wealthier) tourists, who previously could only reach Blankenberge by carriages along cobblestone roads or by boats (see tourist information in 1905 travel guide Pages 210 and 211 and Blad 212).

By the end of the 19th century, the seawall was filled with luxury hotels and holiday villas. A cast-iron pier (1893–1894) was also constructed, the first 350-metre structure out to sea on the European mainland. During the Belle époque, the fashionable Blankenberge was the favorite holiday destination of the Belgian beau monde; only the crowned heads, the nobility, prominent politicians, artists and the rich bourgeoisie could afford to spend their summer holidays in their second residence by the sea. Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Habsburg Empire, for example, regularly visited. Growing tourism provided employment and prosperity for the city. The population grew strongly. The cast iron pier was replaced by a concrete pier in 1933 and the old casino was replaced by a new Art Deco casino (1932–1934). The villas and hotels along the seawall were almost completely destroyed during the Second World War. In the reconstruction, quality and solidity were more important than aesthetics. In the mid-1950s, elite hotels such as the Hôtel des Bains et des Familles made way for cheaper, less luxurious apartment buildings and popular campsites. The tourists soon found their way back to Blankenberge, but the public had changed. With the increasing prosperity in the 1960s and 1970s, mass tourism also made its appearance in Blankenberge and from then on it mainly attracted the working and middle class from the Belgian interior. The population continues to swell in the summer months. The infrastructure to accommodate these tourists is still expanding.

== World War II ==
Blankenberge, formed part of the Atlantic Wall defences constructed by the German occupiers. Part of the pre war coastal tourist development were demolished to accommodate this. 

Allied bombings took place, including on the Zeedijk and the Grote Markt.

Blankenberge was liberated on 9 September 1944 by the Manitoba Dragoons led by Eric James. Every year this event is commemorated on the following Saturday afternoon with a ceremony and a performance by a concert band on Manitobaplein.

== Railways ==
Blankenberge railway station was opened in 1863. Trains operated by NMBS run towards Brussels, and the Kusttram run by De Lijn runs along the Belgian coast of the North Sea.

== Cultural history ==
Before the First World War, Blankenberge was an exclusive holiday resort frequently attended by Royalty. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg as well as his sister Archduchess Elisabeth Amalie of Austria and her husband Prince Aloys of Liechtenstein and his niece Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria were regular holiday makers in Blankenberge. They stayed in a special wing of the Grand Hotel des Bains et des Families. The Archduke enjoyed his walks to Wenduine and attended service daily at the St Rochus church. The Archduke and his wife were planning to travel again to Blankenberge after their last official engagement before the summer holiday at Sarajevo in 1914 where they were killed. 

Blankenberg (so spelt) also figures in Phineas Finn by Anthony Trollope as the scene of a duel between Finn and another character, Lord Chiltern.

The tenor Enrico Caruso attended Blankenberge for a performance in 1910.

After the First World War the Blankenberge police station was bombed by an unknown perpetrator. The blast killed 2 officers and wounded 2 others.

After World War II it was a regular holiday destination. Notable musical institutions were the &quot;Eden&quot; were popular Flemish artists performed on the board walk. The city hosted &quot;Spécial les vacancies&quot; in 1979 under the mayorship of Willem Content. International artist such as Joe Dassin, Boney M, Plastic Bertrand and Dalida attended this event. Later the Flemisch Private TV broadcaster VTM organised &quot;Tien om te Zien&quot; with musical performances of Flemish artists. Today the Flemish public radio organises yearly the &quot;Radio 2 Zomerhit&quot;.

The films &quot;Franz&quot; (1971) by Jacques Brel with Barbara , &quot;Isabelle and Lust&quot; (1975) with Anicée Alvina, &quot;Rimbaud Verlaine (Total Eclipse)&quot; (1995) with Leonardo DiCaprio and &quot;Le Tout Nouveau Testament&quot; (2015) with Catherine Deneuve, Benoît Poelvoorde and François Damiens were notably filmed in the city (or at least in part). 

The World&#x27;s Largest Sand Sculpture Festival, featuring giant sand sculptures (Zandsculptuur) took place on the beach in June until 2012.

== Nature &amp; Landscape ==
Blankenberge is located on the Belgian North Sea coast. There is a wide beach with a seawall and promenade. The town is below the sea wall so that one ascends steps to reach the sea from the town. East of Blankenberge are the Zeebos and De Fonteintjes nature reserves. To the south is the Uitkerkse Polder nature reserve.

<text>Damme () is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders, six kilometres northeast of Brugge (Bruges). The municipality comprises the city of Damme proper and the villages of Hoeke, Lapscheure, Moerkerke, Oostkerke, Sijsele, , and . On 1 January 2006, the municipality had a population of 10,899. The total area is 89.52 km2, giving a population density of 122 inhabitants per km2.

==History==
In the 13th century, Damme was one of the major ports of Europe and the outlet to the sea for the major trading city of Bruges, to which it was linked by the river Reie. The river has now been canalised into the long, straight, treelined and picturesque Damse Vaart, which continues across the Dutch border to Sluis. The line of the town&#x27;s star-shaped fortifications can still be traced by lines of tall poplar trees and in places by a moat. It was the site of the Battle of Damme, fought on 30 and 31 May 1213, when an English fleet under the Earl of Salisbury captured scores of French ships and their cargo of gold, silver, wine, bacon and other victuals.

Well-known Damme inhabitants include Jacob van Maerlant, a medieval poet and the town clerk of Damme until his death in around 1300, and Karel Verleye, co-founder of the Bruges College of Europe, who died in Damme in 2002.
According to Charles de Coster (Charles-Theodore-Henri De Coster. La legende et les aventures heroiques, joyeuses et glorieuses d’Ulenspiegel et de Lamme Goedzak au pays de Flandres et ailleurs), Damme is the birthplace of Till Eulenspiegel

== Tourism ==

Today, Damme is a popular side trip for tourists who are visiting Bruges and is a popular venue for eating out, and a destination for boat trips. Damme has more recently become known as a book town, with numerous bookshops and regular book fairs.

The most popular ways of traveling to Damme are by canal boat that runs during the summer high season or all year round by bus or bicycle. The bicycle route is along the canal path taking the same route that the canal boat takes.

<text>Knokke-Heist (; ) is a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Heist-aan-Zee, Knokke, Duinbergen, Ramskapelle and Westkapelle. On January 1, 2006, Knokke-Heist had a total population of 34,063. The total area is 56.44 km2 which gives a population density of 603 inhabitants per km2. Knokke-Heist is located along the North Sea in a polder area on the Belgian border with the Netherlands. It is Belgium&#x27;s best-known and most affluent seaside resort.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

Originally, the marshy Zwin area was mostly settled by shepherds and fishermen. With the encouragement of the Counts of Flanders, several dykes were built between the 11th and the 13th century and the land successfully dewatered, giving rise to agriculture and further sheep breeding. New parishes were founded and the early settlement of Sint-Anna-ter-Muiden, later made part of Westkapelle, obtained city rights in 1242.

The strategic importance of the Zwin harbour was recognized in 1301, during the war between Count Guy of Dampierre and the French King Philip the Fair. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War that followed shortly after, several battles were fought between France and England for supremacy of the area including the Battle of Sluys in June 1340. The local population tried to remain neutral as it was politically tied to Flanders, then allied to France, but economically dependent on wool from England. Under Philip the Bold’s leadership, it took advantage of the relative peace of the end of the century to fortify the canal linking the Zwin to the port of Bruges.

===15th to 17th century===
The beginning of the 15th century witnessed several renewed English attacks on neighboring Sluis, with devastating effects on the local economy, until a lasting peace was signed in 1439. The end of the century was marked by internal rebellions against Maximilian of Austria and strategic flooding of the polders. The reign of Charles V in the following century saw peace coming back to the region. This was also the time when the Zwin started silting and when apple orchards were planted to supplement the local economy.

The Wars of Religion of the late 16th century brought renewed floods and devastation, but the economy managed to come back to life after the Peace of Westphalia with the cultivation of rapeseed and potatoes. The strength of this agricultural rebirth and of the cattle trade allowed the local farmers to weather future economic crises relatively well.

===18th century until today===
Following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the territory of Knokke was annexed to the Netherlands, but the old border was reestablished at the Zwin a few years later. After the Battle of Fleurus (1794), Bruges, Knokke and the neighboring municipalities were included in the department of the Lys. The construction of the Leopold Canal in 1857 made the closing of the Zwin and its transformation in a natural reservation possible. The development of Knokke and Heist as tourist destinations followed soon after. The population of Knokke doubled between 1873 and 1914 to 3,326 inhabitants, then again from 1914 to 1930 and again to reach more than 14,000 in 1965 despite the heavy setbacks brought by World War II.

<text>Oostkamp (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the villages of Hertsberge, Oostkamp proper, Ruddervoorde and Waardamme. On January 1, 2019, Oostkamp had a total population of 23,698. The total area is 79.65 km² which gives a population density of 289 inhabitants per km².

==History==
The name Oostkamp comes from the Medieval name &quot;Orscamp&quot;, meaning place of the horses. The old word &quot;ors&quot; is a cognate of the English word &quot;horse&quot;.

===Oostkamp during World War II===
The Canadian 4th Armoured Division liberated the village on 8 September 1944 (World War II) during the Battle of Moerbrugge. A monument was erected by the Ghent-Bruges Canal to honour the 53 Canadian casualties.

===Fusion of 1977===
With the Belgian Unity Law the four villages of Oostkamp proper, Hertsberge, Ruddervoorde and Waardamme became the municipality of Greater Oostkamp.

== Landmarks and Monuments ==

===Churches===

*Sint Pieters-in-de-Bandenkerk, a hall church with a Romanesque tower (12th century), a late Gothic middle nave, and a baroque organ from 1717.
*Macieberrot, a Marian grotto from 1914

===OostCampus===

In 2012, all the different municipal services which had been accommodated over the years in a scattered collection of facilities, moved to a new complex: &#x27;OostCampus&#x27;. On March 9, 2017, the mayor and the chairman of the Social Services (OCMW) also moved from their former site in &#x27;Beukenpark&#x27; to OostCampus, which is now effectively the City Hall and Civic Centre of Oostkamp.

The building, designed by Spanish architect Carlos Arroyo, has received important awards, such as:

*Gold Prijs Bouwmeester 2013 awarded by the Government of Flanders, in the category &#x27;Renovation&#x27;.
*Archdaily&#x27;s 65 best new buildings in the world 2012
*Holcim Silver Award for Sustainable Construction in Europe 2011

Oostkamp has about twenty outstanding examples of &quot;Kasteel&quot; (plural &quot;kastelen&quot;), meaning castles, châteaux and mansions. These were erected as &#x27;countryside retreats&#x27; of &#x27;leisure houses&#x27; by the nobles and merchants of the area, many of them with permanent abodes in nearby Bruges. Most &quot;kastelen&quot; are private property and therefore not to be visited. Many are visible from the public road.

<doc id="154208" wikidata="Q506787" url="?curid=154208" title="Fansub">
<text>A fansub (short for fan-subtitled) is a version of a foreign film or foreign television program, typically anime or dorama which has been translated by fans (as opposed to an officially licensed translation done by paid professionals) and subtitled into a language usually other than that of the original.

== Process ==
The practice of making fansubs is called fansubbing and is done by a fansubber. Fansubbers typically form groups to divide the work. The first distribution media of fansubbed material was VHS and Betamax tapes.

Early fansubs were produced using analog video editing equipment. They would copy the anime (often from laserdiscs) onto VHS, translate the dialogue, and painstakingly time and format the subtitles for the video. Popular tools for this included JACOsub (Amiga) and Substation Alpha (Windows). The next step was to produce one or more masters, a high-quality copy of the finished fansub from which many distribution copies could be made. The fansubber would playback the raw video through a computer equipped with a genlock in order to generate the subtitles and then overlay them on the raw signal. The hardware most often used was an Amiga computer, as most professional genlocks were prohibitively expensive. The final output of the arrangement was then recorded. The master was most often recorded onto S-VHS tape in an attempt to maximize quality, though some fansubbers used the less expensive VHS or Beta. Once it was completed, the master copy was sent to a distributor.

===Digisubs===
The internet allows for highly collaborative fansubbing, and each member of a fansub team may only complete one task. Online fansubbing communities such as DameDesuYo are able to release a fully subtitled episode (including elaborate karaoke with translation, kana, and kanji for songs, as well as additional remarks and translations of signs) within 24 hours of an episode&#x27;s debut in Japan.

Platforms like Fansnub have emerged to showcase creative works by fansubbers and similar content creators. These platforms provide a space for fansubbers to connect with their audience, share their work, and earn recognition for their efforts.

The production of a fansub typically begins with obtaining the unsubtitled source video called a &quot;raw&quot; that typically comes from DVDs, VHS tapes, television broadcasts, peer-to-peer networks, and directly from Japanese-based contacts. Then, a translator watches the video and produces a time-stamped text file of the screenplay with any relevant notes. The same series or episode may be subtitled by multiple groups with independent translations of varying quality. Fansub groups sometimes translate other already translated fansubs that are more susceptible to errors. Translated text is assigned with start and end times in a process known as timing to ensure subtitles appear when dialogue is spoken and disappear with the silence. An editor and a translation-checker read over the script to ensure that English is natural and coherent while still retaining the original meaning. A typesetter then appearance for the dialogue, signs, translator notes, etc. Then groups perform quality control to catch any final errors.

Encoders then take the script file and create a single subtitled video file, often aiming for a target file size or video quality. &quot;Hard&quot; subtitles, or &quot;hard subs&quot;, are encoded into the footage, and thus become hard to remove from the video without losing video quality. &quot;Soft&quot; subtitles, or &quot;soft subs&quot;, are subtitles applied at playback time from a subtitle datafile, either mixed directly into the video file (.mkv, .ogm, etc.), or in a separate file (.ssa, .srt, etc.). Soft subs can also be rendered at higher resolutions, which can make for easier reading if the viewer is upscaling the file, but also are more difficult to blend into the video (for instance rotated text/moving text). Hard subs have traditionally been more popular than softsubs, due to a lack of player support and worries over plagiarism, but most fansub groups now release a softsub version of their releases.

The resulting fansub is a digital video file and can be distributed via CD, DVD, DDL, P2P software, and by file-sharing bots on IRC and also FTP. The distribution is usually handled by a distribution team, or &quot;distro&quot; team, composed of one or more individuals with a server or very high upload speed.

== History ==

===Pre-fansubs (pre–1970s)===
The first documented Japanese animation to be distributed in the United States was &quot;The Tale of the White Serpent&quot; airing on March 15, 1961. Until the late 1970s, Japanese community TV stations&#x27; broadcasts were aimed exclusive at very young children. Soon after the release video cassette recorders in November 1975, post-&quot;Astro Boy&quot; anime began to spread throughout the United States. By March 1976, TV stations in the United States began broadcasting super robot shows such as &quot;Getter Robo&quot;, and due to the availability of VCRs, fans could record these shows to show to their friends. Fred Patten describes his first exposure to anime at the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in 1976 when he met up with another fan who was an early adopter of Sony&#x27;s betamax technology. By May 1977 he and a group of fans founded the first anime club in the United States, the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization (C/FO).

In November 1977, the C/FO began corresponding with other Japanese animation fans across the country and because the distribution of shows across the United States was different based on location, fans began trading tapes of shows they were missing between each other. At the time many LASFS members maintained contact with members around the world, and thus C/FO members began exchanging videos with fans located in Japan, typically US military personnel, who wanted &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Fortunately, shows from either the United States or Japan could be played in either region as both used the NTSC format for broadcast. These shows were not translated; however, Japanese animations remained simple enough that the average viewer could discern the plot exclusively from the visuals. By 1979, fans and clubs of Japanese animation had begun to separate from the science fiction movement and began to refer to the media they watched as anime.

Throughout this period it was considered socially acceptable to screen anime for an audience without the publisher&#x27;s consent, as few companies had American offices, and the few that did would invariably refuse to grant permission. Japanese companies made it apparent that they knew fans in the United States engaged in unauthorized distribution and screening, but also knew that fans were not profiting. Japanese companies asked fans to help them publicize; for instance, Toei Animation asked the C/FO to aid it with some marketing research at San Diego Comic-Con. Starting in 1978, Japanese companies tried to set up their own American divisions; however, with the exception of the film &quot;The Sea Prince and the Fire Child&quot; which was licensed to RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, they realized they were not going to succeed in the American market and the last American anime company branch closed in 1982.

===Growth of anime fanclubs (1980s)===
After anime companies pulled out of the United States in 1982, there were no longer any legal or moral forces to discourage fans from copying and distributing tapes among themselves. From the late 1970s until the late 1980s, clubs began expanding to have chapters in other cities and grew to become of national and international scales. As the fandom grew, fans begun to experience ideological conflicts such as whether to keep the fandom niche or not. The visual quality of tapes began to degrade as fans made copies of copies; by the early 1980s some C/FO members reported tapes in their 15th to 20th generation that were extremely poor quality. In the mid to late 1980s, fans began to make booklets containing the translated dialogue for entire films (typically $2–3 to cover costs) and anime-focused magazines.

Despite numerous attempts, any efforts to convince US companies to license Japanese animation failed, with the exception of a handful of companies that were intent on &quot;carving up&quot; series to rewrite them into children&#x27;s cartoons. Sean Leonard states that entertainment executives at the time mistakenly believed that anime were, like Western cartoons, predominantly aimed at young children; furthermore, Japanese animated dramas and such were much too violent and complex in plot for children. Leonard states that the most notorious example was the translation of &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, released in the US in 1985, which left its creators Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata appalled; Takahata exclaimed that licensing Nausicaä was a huge error and that no further Studio Ghibli produced films would be licensed internationally. These edits however were no worse than most other non-Disney animation films that were available in the US. Fans who obtained the Japanese originals of &quot;Nausicaä&quot; were inspired to organize an anime tour to Tokyo in 1986 to see Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and landmarks in anime.

Carl Macek played a key role in expanding the North American anime fandom. Macek ran a comic book and movie memorabilia specialty shop. After assisting in marketing and promotion of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and the recent establishment of a nearby C/FO chapter, he began researching Japanese animation and imported Japanese cels, becoming known as a Japanese animation specialist. Harmony Gold, who had acquired international licenses for several series and planned to distribute them in Latin America, Europe, and the US, reached out to Macek and enlisted his help for the US market. After noticing Harmony Gold&#x27;s selection of &quot;Macross&quot; and similar science fiction series, Macek obtained Harmony Gold&#x27;s approval to edit three anime series together into a single unified series named &quot;Robotech&quot;. Macek went to science fiction conventions to promote the series and discovered a growing cult following among adolescents and young adults, in contrast to his initial assumption that the series could be exclusively targeted toward children. Macek edited &quot;Macross&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, and &quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA&quot; together into &quot;Robotech&quot;, which became a major commercial success and earned him significant recognition within the fanbase. Leonard describes &quot;Robotech&quot; as being more faithful to the original series than any other commercially successful North American anime release in its era, noting that &quot;Robotech&quot; included key elements such as the first love triangle on both Japanese and American animated television.

The C/FO was at its height between 1985 and 1989, with over three dozen chapters throughout the US. John Renault helped lead the C/FO chapter in Japan and played a key role throughout fansub history due to his Japanese fluency, anime industry contacts, and military background. Renault helped exchange raws from Japan, wrote informative articles about production, translated booklets, introduced military techniques to anime distribution, and provided plot synopses that proved invaluable for watching Japan-exclusive anime. Fan distribution through C/FO&#x27;s efforts, particularly C/FO Rising Sun, sought to keep anime free (but controlled within the C/FO organization) in order to promote Japanese animation. Bootlegging at the time was economically infeasible; accordingly, access to anime in North America was heavily dependent on one&#x27;s contacts within anime fan communities, leading to a growing divide in fandom between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;. In 1989 members began to accuse Patten of disloyalty for writing articles for general magazines rather than the perpetually behind-schedule C/FO fanzine. However, Patten felt that, by writing for popular magazines, he was furthering their cause to proselytize and promote anime. After Patten stepped down with no clear successor, the C/FO began to break apart, and eventually ceased to exist as a conglomerate in July 1989.

===Early fansubs (1980s)===
The first known fansub documented at the Rising Sun chapter of the C/FO was in 1986 of a &quot;Lupin III&quot; episode produced on the Amiga, marking the introduction of the formula for the process of fansubbing. However, fansubbing was extremely expensive at this time (on the order of $4000 in 1986 and over one hundred hours). There were a few ventures into subtitling in the late 1980s; Leonard labels the fansub of the first two episodes of &quot;Ranma ½&quot; in May 1989 as the earliest widely distributed fansub.

===Distribution and playback (1990s, early 2000s)===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, fansubs were primarily distributed through physical means like VHS or Beta tapes and mailed CD-Rs. Many fans did not have high-speed Internet and were unable to download large files. Many of the early digital fansubs were made from regular tape subs. In the mid-2000s, most fansubs were distributed through IRC channels, file hosting services and BitTorrent. In recent years, most fansub groups have moved from IRC to BitTorrent distribution. Dedicated anime trackers make finding the latest releases easy, while groups often have their own websites for release updates. File size standards are less strict due to the lack of CD-R and DVD-R reliance.

==Legal and ethical issues==
Hye-Kyung Lee, a lecturer at King&#x27;s College London, states that anime fansubbers embody the general characteristics of fans described by John Fiske: fansubbers are motivated by a strong affection for anime, devotion to sharing it with other fans, a sense of community interaction with their viewers, a desire to work collaboratively in a group, and a strong desire to support the local animation industry by promoting anime culture and widening anime&#x27;s accessibility. Lee describes fansubbers as involved in productive activities that enhance their knowledge of anime, improve their skills, and develop a final product. The goal of the first anime club, Cartoon Fantasy Organization, and its subsequent chapters was to proselytize and promote anime. Sean Leonard and Lee agree that without fan distribution that began in the 1970s and 1980s, the anime industry would not take off as it did in the 1990s. Some companies such as Protoculture Addicts with its titular magazine and Viz Media with &quot;Animerica&quot; drew their origins from anime club fanzines in the early history of fansubs.

Lee describes an unspoken rule in the early fan community: &quot;once the anime was licensed the fansubbed version should no longer be circulated&quot;. As a result, many fansubbers do not view themselves as pirates. Sean Leonard distinguishes fansubs from bootlegs in this period, arguing that fansubs followed that unspoken rule, whereas bootlegs aimed to make a profit. Many fansubs began to include a &quot;This is a free fansub: not for sale, rent, or auction&quot; disclaimer as a response to bootleggers, and would encourage viewers to buy official copies. As fansubbing was so expensive in the 1980s, and official Western releases of anime were rare and often poor-quality, bootlegging tended to be financially infeasible during this period.

Early fansubs would often have markedly worse visual quality than official releases, as the VHS tapes of fansubs would deteriorate from repeated copying; this reduced the level of competition between fansubs and official releases. During the 1980s, US publishers typically found fansubbing useful for testing demand and broadening their fanbase, whereas Japanese publishers treat fansubbing as something remote and insignificant. Lee states that some Japanese producers even praised fansubbers&#x27; efforts at promoting their work overseas. However, ongoing technological advancement complicated that relationship. As subtitling became more affordable in the 1990s, both fansubbing and official Western releases of anime enjoyed an upswing. Further advances in the twenty-first century made each step of the fansubbing process easier and cheaper, and the visual standards of fansubs improved dramatically.

These technological developments were also coupled with shifts in how fansubs were produced and distributed. Fansubs began to be shared mostly online, first on IRC and then over BitTorrent. The move to the Internet also enabled the globalization of the fansubbing community; although English remained the dominant language among fansubbers, the consumption of fansubs expanded worldwide. This globalization was one factor in fansubbers moving away from their earlier aim of not competing against the official releases: because anime might only be licensed to certain international markets, some fansubbers argue that they would be abandoning the rest of the world if they stopped circulating fansubs of series that received official US releases. Fansubbers have also continued to subtitle and release shows owned by companies that significantly edit the shows they own, such as 4Kids. The change in fansubbers&#x27; attitudes may also derive from shifts in the attitudes of their consumers: fans began to demand greater immediacy in the digital era, and the lower barrier of entry facilitated the emergence of casual fans who were less willing to purchase and collect DVDs.

The anime industry&#x27;s views on fansubbing hardened as fansubs became more widespread. The 1993 Anime Expo was the first time when US industry representatives publicly discussed the ways in which pre-existing copies were eating into profits. In the 2000s, US companies have gone farther, and directly blamed fansubbers for the decline in DVD sales. Representatives of companies such as Geneon and ADV Films have publicly criticized fansubs. Japanese copyright holders have also begun to take action against fansubs. The Japanese copyright society JASRAC began requesting takedowns against YouTube-based fansubs during the 2000s, and groups such as Media Factory and Nippon TV have requested that their works be removed from download sites.

Some figures from the anime industry still maintain a positive view of fansubs. For instance, Steve Kleckner of Tokyopop described fansubs as &quot;flattering [rather than] threatening&quot;, and stated that fansubs provided publishers with a means to identify what media their customer base might want to see.

Intellectual property lawyer Jordan Hatcher situates fansubs on the boundary between the desirable doujinshi fan culture and the &quot;massive online file trading so vilified by the recording and motion picture industries&quot;. Legal scholar Lawrence Lessig states that the re-working of culture—remix—is necessary for cultural growth, and points to doujinshi in Japan as an example of how permitting remixes can contribute to a vibrant cultural industry. However, Hatcher states that fansubs are not analogous to this type of remix because their aim is to remain faithful to the original. Furthermore, Hatcher states that fansubs compete with the original cultural product since they have the potential to replace the market need for official translations, thus creating a similar situation to the debate over peer-to-peer file trading. Conversely, Henry Jenkins has argued that fansubbing has a positive impact on the anime industry through its function as publicity.

Hatcher states that copyright law does not condone fansubs. The Berne Convention, an international copyright treaty, states that its signatories—including Japan—grant authors exclusive right to translation. Hatcher states that fansubs could &quot;potentially&quot; be legal within Japan given the nature of Japan&#x27;s domestic copyright laws, although the target audience of fansubs is the non-Japanese market. However, Hatcher notes that copyright law in the United States—the frame of reference for most online discussions of fansub legality—construes translations as derivative, and holds that fansubs infringe on the author&#x27;s right to prepare derivative works and to reproduction by copying original source material.

==Legal action==
In 1999, Ryuta Shiiki, a former representative of SPE Visual Works Inc. sent a letter to a fansub distribution group to take down the illegal copies of the anime Rurouni Kenshin, because a company that was interested in the rights of said series notified the Japanese company about the illegal distribution of it. The group complied and the series was pulled from distribution. This is the first legal action via a cease-and-desist letter against a fansub in the United States.

In 2002, Hideaki Hatta, president of Kyoto Animation, sent a letter to a fansub group requesting the stop of illegal distribution of the anime OAV &quot;Munto&quot;. The fansub group complied and the distribution stopped. This was the first legal action via a cease-and-desist letter against the fansubbing of an anime title not available outside Japan. However, it was later confirmed that Central Park Media licensed the title in the United States.

In 2003, a fansubbing group known as Anime Junkies was involved in a conflict with Urban Vision, the licensor and co-producer of the &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; TV series. Urban Vision sent a letter asking for Anime Junkies to stop hosting the licensed material, but Anime Junkies did not comply with the request and responded negatively to Urban Vision. Christopher Macdonald, an editor at Anime News Network, highlighted the ethics code of the fansubbing community and asked that fans not support Anime Junkies as a result of their actions.

On December 7, 2004, a Tokyo law firm representing Media Factory sent letters and e-mails to the anime BitTorrent directory AnimeSuki and fansub groups Lunar Anime and Wannabe Fansubs requesting that they halt the fansubbing and hosting of all current and future fansubbing productions. AnimeSuki and Lunar Anime complied, and shortly after, other fansub groups such as Solar and Shining Fansubs followed suit. Despite the request, Wannabe Fansubs and a handful of other fansubbing groups continued to produce fansubs of MFI anime series.

On July 27, 2006, the legal department representing the Spanish anime company Selecta Visión sent a cease-and-desist letter to the anime BitTorrent and fansubbing site Frozen-Layer requesting the halt of the fansubbing and publishing all of current and prior anime licensed by the company. The owner complied and, until 2013, established that all licensed anime in Spain was banned from the site, regardless of the status of the license.

In Singapore, anime distributor Odex has been actively tracking down and sending legal threats against internet users in Singapore since 2007. These users have allegedly downloaded fansubbed anime via the BitTorrent protocol. Court orders on ISPs to reveal subscribers&#x27; personal information have been ruled in Odex&#x27;s favour, leading to several downloaders receiving letters of legal threat from Odex and subsequently pursuing out-of-court settlements for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) per person, the youngest person being only nine years old. These actions were considered controversial by the local anime community and have attracted criticisms towards the company, as they are seen by fans as heavy-handed.

On May 18, 2007, Anime News Network reported that the police in Poland and Germany seized the fansubbing site Napisy.org arrested at least 9 people related to it. These raids were orchestrated by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV), a collective rights organisation, and German authorities shut the site which was hosted on servers in that jurisdiction. In May 2013, that case was closed, as prosecutors decided to drop the charges due to the charged individuals&#x27; ignorance of the unlawfulness of their actions. The site Napisy.org is currently closed and it shows sites to watch legal content.

On May 19, 2007, the Spanish organization Federación Anti Piratería (FAP) sent a cease-and-desist against the website Wikisubtitles.net and their website provider Bluehost, requesting the closure of the site since the owners were profiting with the content of others, violating copyright laws. The webmaster complied and the site was closed. However, the webmaster published the source-code of the website. Since then, websites like Addic7ed, Subtitulos.es and Wikisubs appeared using the Wikisubtitles source code.

On July 9, 2013, the Swedish copyright enforcement agency Intrångsundersökning seized the servers for Swedish and English website Undertexter.se, a website that contained fansub scripts of several movies and series. On 2016, the owner of the website, Eugen Archy was prosecuted of violating the Swedish Copyright Act and was found guilty of copyright violation and the Attunda District Court sentenced him to probation. In addition, he has to pay 217,000 Swedish kronor ($27,000), which will be taken from the advertising and donation revenues he collected through the site.

On September 21, 2016, the Kyoto Prefectural Police in Japan arrested two Chinese company workers, Liang Wang and Wangyi Yang, on Wednesday on suspicion of violating the Japanese Copyright Act by uploading the anime series &quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan: Dust Storm Dance&quot; and &quot;Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya Drei!!&quot; with Chinese subtitles. Both suspects admitted to the charge, and Yang claimed to be a member of a Chinese fansubbing group. This became the first known legal action against fansubbing in Japan.

On October 27, 2016, the Kyoto Prefectural Police arrested two Chinese individuals on charges of violating the Japanese Copyright Act. The two suspects were both located in Tokyo. The first suspect is a 29-year-old male living in Edogawa ward. The second suspect is a 23-year-old male college student. According to police, the first suspect is accused of fansubbing episodes of the anime &quot;Saki: The Nationals&quot; in Chinese and uploading the subtitled episodes on a file sharing service. The second suspect allegedly subtitled a different anime in Chinese, and similarly used a file sharing service, but the report did not mention the anime.

On February 16, 2017, the Kyoto Prefectural Police arrested a 26-year-old Chinese man on the charge of illegally subtitle the anime Ange Vierge in Chinese and distribute it through a file sharing software. Police allege that the man is a member of the group &quot;Jimaku Gumi&quot; (sic).

On April 22, 2017, a judge in Amsterdam, Netherlands, declared fansubtitling illegal. The Dutch court declared that these translations correspond to the producers and no one else. In case they do not exist, they can not be created by fans. After this ruling, the creation of subtitles without the consent of the author of an audiovisual production is now considered a crime in the Netherlands. This is the first ruling in the world that values subtitles as intellectual property and that punishes with fines and imprisonment those who violate copyright laws.

On January 31, 2018, Sankei West and &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; reported that police departments from Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Shizuoka, Mie, and Shimane Prefectures in Japan, along with the Association of Copyright for Computer Software arrested four Chinese nationals for illegally fansubbing anime, manga and videogames. The suspects, who range in age from 23 to 28, are allegedly part of a translating group that distributed Chinese-translated manga, anime, and other materials online. The titles included &quot;Yuki Ochimura ni Ojō-sama!&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V&quot; and &quot;Kimi ni Todoke&quot;. The Association of Copyright for Computer Software reported that one of the suspects, a 23-year-old female company worker from Niiza City in Saitama Prefecture, translated the 123rd and final chapter of the manga &quot;Kimi ni Todoke&quot;. Police from Kanagawa, Ishikawa, Gifu, and Shiga Prefectures also worked on the case. This is the first known arrest regarding illegal manga translation in Japan.

<doc id="154209" wikidata="Q6657456" url="?curid=154209" title="Countdown (game show)">
<text>Countdown is a British game show involving word and mathematical tasks that began airing in November 1982. It is broadcast on Channel 4 and is most recently presented by Colin Murray, assisted by Rachel Riley with lexicographer Susie Dent. It was the first programme to be broadcast on Channel 4 and 90 series have been broadcast since its debut on 2 November 1982. With over 8,000 episodes, &quot;Countdown&quot; is one of Britain&#x27;s longest-running game shows; the original French version, &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot; (Numbers &amp; Letters), ran on French television almost continuously from 1965 until 2024. 

The two contestants in each episode compete in three game types: ten letters rounds, in which they attempt to make the longest word possible from nine randomly chosen letters, four numbers rounds, in which they must use arithmetic to reach a random target figure from six other numbers and the conundrum, a buzzer round in which the contestants compete to solve a nine-letter anagram. During the series heats, the winning contestant returns the next day until they either lose or retire with eight wins as an undefeated &quot;Octochamp&quot;. The best eight contestants are invited back for the series finals, which are decided in knockout format. Contestants of exceptional skill have received national media coverage and the programme, as a whole, is widely recognised and parodied within British culture.

&quot;Countdown&quot; was produced by Yorkshire Television and was recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to the Manchester-based Granada Studios in 2009. Following the development of MediaCityUK, &quot;Countdown&quot; moved again in 2013 to the new purpose-built studios at Dock10 in Greater Manchester.

==Presenters==
The programme was presented by Richard Whiteley for 23 years until his death on 26 June 2005. It was then presented by Des Lynam from October 2005 until December 2006, Des O&#x27;Connor from January 2007 until December 2008, Jeff Stelling from January 2009 until December 2011 and Nick Hewer from January 2012 until his retirement in June 2021, with Colin Murray standing in for Nick Hewer during part of the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme was then presented by Anne Robinson from June 2021 until July 2022. Murray then returned on 14 July as a stand-in host. On 25 July 2022, it was announced that Les Dennis would guest host the show from 4 to 15 August followed by Jenny Eclair from 16 to 19 August because Murray tested positive for COVID-19.

Guest hosts returned later that year as part of the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations, with Floella Benjamin, Richard Coles, Trevor McDonald (for a second time) and Moira Stuart each hosting one week&#x27;s episodes. Murray was announced as the programme&#x27;s new permanent host in January 2023.

In the early years, the show had multiple assistant presenters, including Carol Vorderman who was hired for Series 1 and originally appeared as &quot;vital statistician&quot;, a role in which she alternated with Dr Linda Barrett until Barrett&#x27;s departure after Series 2. Letters were placed on the board initially by Cathy Hytner, who was then followed by Karen Loughlin in Series 14 (1987) and Lucy Summers for Series 17 in early 1989. Numbers were originally put up on the board by Beverley Isherwood and this was taken over by Hytner mid-way through Series 3. From the start of Series 18 in July 1989, after Summers left the show, Vorderman began putting up the letters and numbers on a permanent basis. After 26 years, she left the show in December 2008 (at the same time as O&#x27;Connor) and was replaced by Rachel Riley who has appeared in the role since January 2009. Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon stood in for Riley from December 2021 to March 2022 whilst Riley was on maternity leave. Dr Tom Crawford, an Oxford and Cambridge university lecturer, stood in for Riley for three weeks in early 2025, making his first appearance on 24 February as the show&#x27;s first-ever male arithmetician.

Susie Dent first appeared on the show in June 1992 as one of the regularly rotated lexicographers; however, it was not until 2003 that she became a recurring member of the now reduced on-screen team. Since 2005 she is the sole lexicographer on the show and has been credited as a co-presenter since January 2015; in each episode she appears in &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot; alongside a celebrity guest who changes from week to week. The other more notable past lexicographers, that have appeared in more than 100 episodes, include Catherine Clarke, Damian Eadie, Alison Heard, Mark Nyman, Richard Samson, Julia Swannell, Della Thompson, Freda Thornton and Yvonne Warburton.



===Timeline===
The timeline below includes all main, co and guest presenters alongside notable past lexicographers as stated above.


==Background and origin==
&quot;Countdown&quot; originated from the format of the French game show &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot; (&quot;Numbers and Letters&quot;), created by Armand Jammot. After watching the programme, Belgian record executive Marcel Stellman brought the format to Britain on the belief it could be popular overseas and proposed his concept for the British version to several networks. The concept was purchased in the early 1980s by Yorkshire Television, which commissioned a series of eight shows under the title &quot;Calendar Countdown&quot;, which were broadcast between April and June 1982. Aimed at being a spin-off of their regional news programme &quot;Calendar&quot;, the programme&#x27;s host deemed the natural choice for the concept. The spin-off was aired only in the Yorkshire area, with Whiteley earning the nickname of &quot;Twice Nightly Whiteley&quot; because of his daily appearances on both programmes. He was assisted by Cathy Hytner and Denise McFarland-Cruickshanks, who handled the letters and numbers rounds respectively.

By 1982, after an additional pilot episode was made with a refined format – an episode that was never broadcast – the show was bought by Channel 4, a new British television channel set to launch in November 1982, based on the refined concept. While Whiteley and Hytner from the original pilot were retained, the programme was renamed &quot;Countdown&quot;, and the format was expanded to include additional members in the hosting team, including letters and number experts. It was commissioned to be broadcast four times a week for seven weeks initially, but was such a success that it is still being recommissioned as of 2024.

An additional spin-off to the programme for young contestants was proposed at the time, dubbed &quot;Junior Countdown&quot; – the concept would be similar in format, but hosted by Gyles Brandreth and Ted Moult – but while a pilot was created, the proposal was abandoned after it was found to be highly flawed.

&quot;Countdown&quot; was the first programme broadcast by Channel 4 when it launched on 2 November 1982, with Whiteley opening the programme with the line:

 —Richard Whiteley introducing the first Channel 4 episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==History==
===Whiteley tenure===
Alongside the original cast from &quot;Calendar Countdown&quot;, the new format of the gameshow led to production staff seeking out further hostesses through advertising in national newspapers for young women to become a member of the programme&#x27;s cast, with notable conditions about their involvement; in particular, those recruited for calculations found it made clear that as an applicant, their appearance would be less important than their skill as a mathematician. Amongst those recruited, Beverley Isherwood was hired to work alongside Hytner in handling the selection of number and letter tiles respectively, while Linda Barrett and Carol Vorderman were recruited for checking over calculations by contestants in the numbers round. In addition, a lexicographer was also required to form part of the format&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot; segment, to verify words given by contestants in the letters round (see &quot;Letters round rules&quot;) and to point out any longer or otherwise interesting words available; such a role was aided by the show&#x27;s producers, with no assistance from any computer program and accompanied by a celebrity guest for a set period on the programme – contributing words and providing entertainment through anecdotes, puzzles, poems and stories. The role of lexicographer was traditionally occupied by a member of the Oxford University Press or sometimes by a member of the show&#x27;s production team. Amongst these who have appeared on the programme in &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot; are Nigel Rees, Jo Brand, Martin Jarvis, Richard Digance, Geoffrey Durham, Ken Bruce, Magnus Magnusson, Pam Ayres, Paul Zenon, Jenny Eclair, Al Murray, John Sergeant and Gyles Brandreth.

Over time, the additional hostesses on the programme were dropped by production staff who retained Vorderman and assigned her primarily to handle the selection of letter and number tiles, as well as verifying contestant calculations. The programme frequently rotated between more than thirty different lexicographers all with varying tenures, including Richard Samson and Alison Heard, for each series, until January 2005, when the role was permanently given to Susie Dent, after her debut on &quot;Countdown&quot; in 1992.

On 26 June 2005, Richard Whiteley died after a failed heart operation. At the time, he had been slowly recovering from pneumonia earlier that year, which had prevented him recording further episodes. His death impacted the show, causing the episode scheduled for that day to be postponed by Channel 4 as a mark of respect, while the remaining episodes he had completed were aired after his death, the first of which was preceded by a tearful tribute from Carol Vorderman. After the series&#x27; conclusion, &quot;Countdown&quot; was placed into hiatus from 1 July to determine how to proceed.

===Post-Whiteley===
In October 2005, Channel 4 announced that Des Lynam would take over as the main presenter, having previously participated in the celebrity edition (&quot;Celebrity Countdown&quot;) in April 1998. Lynam&#x27;s tenure ran until December 2006, whereupon his demanding filming schedule forced him to resign from the programme. Channel 4 proposed reducing his travelling by moving filming from Leeds to a site closer to his residence in Worthing, West Sussex, but viewers reacted angrily to the idea and Lynam decided it would cause considerable disruption for many of the programme&#x27;s camera crew.

In January 2007, Des O&#x27;Connor took over as the main presenter. During his tenure as host, Susie Dent went on maternity leave over the winter of 2007–2008 and Alison Heard temporarily replaced her on the programme until 6 February 2008. By July 2008, both Des O&#x27;Connor and Carol Vorderman had announced that they would be leaving by the end of that year after the end of Series 59. While Des O&#x27;Connor was forced to leave in order to concentrate on other projects, Carol Vorderman left after her offer to take a 33% salary decrease was rejected and production staff asked her to take a 90% pay cut; her agent stated that staff had told her that the show had survived without Richard Whiteley and could &quot;easily survive without you&quot;. Some media reports suggested that the new presenter would be either Rory Bremner, the early favourite or Alexander Armstrong, but both ruled themselves out of the job. At the same time there was speculation that several prominent women, including Anthea Turner, Ulrika Jonsson and Myleene Klass were strong candidates to take over Carol Vorderman&#x27;s job, but Channel 4 revealed that the role was to be assigned to a previously unknown male or female arithmetician with &quot;charm and charisma&quot;.

When Des Lynam became the new presenter after Richard Whiteley&#x27;s death in 2005, the show regularly drew an average 1.7 million viewers every day; this was around half a million more than in the last few years of Richard Whiteley presenting. The Series 54 final on 26 May 2006 attracted 2.5 million viewers. 3–4 million viewers had watched the show daily in its previous 16:15 slot. The drop in viewing figures following the scheduling change coupled with the show&#x27;s perceived educational benefits, even caused Labour MP Jonathan Shaw to table a motion in the UK Parliament requesting that the show be returned to its later time. Minor scheduling changes have subsequently seen the show move from 15:15 to 15:30, 15:45, 15:25 and 15:10. As of 2025, it is broadcast at 14:10.

In November 2008, Jeff Stelling was confirmed as the new host, while Oxford maths graduate Rachel Riley was confirmed as Carol Vorderman&#x27;s replacement. Jeff Stelling remained with the programme until the end of 2011, when his football commitments with Sky Sports forced him reluctantly to leave &quot;Countdown&quot;. Before his departure, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; star Nick Hewer was announced as his replacement and he took over as the main presenter when his first episode aired on 9 January 2012. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that Colin Murray (a frequent Dictionary Corner guest) would fill in for Nick Hewer while he spent a period of time in isolation during the UK&#x27;s second lockdown.

Des O&#x27;Connor died on 14 November 2020 after suffering a fall at home the previous week; the episode that aired two days later was dedicated to his memory.

On 7 December 2020, Nick Hewer announced that he would be stepping down as the host of &quot;Countdown&quot; at the end of Series 83 in Summer 2021. Nick Hewer said it had been &quot;privilege and a pleasure to take the helm of &quot;Countdown&quot;&quot;. It was then announced on 15 February 2021 that Anne Robinson, who first appeared on the show as a guest in Dictionary Corner in 1987, would take over from Nick Hewer at the start of Series 84. Nick Hewer&#x27;s final show aired on 25 June 2021. On 28 June 2021, Anne Robinson became the show&#x27;s first female host in its 39-year history. In May 2022, it was announced that she would be leaving the show after just one year with Colin Murray taking over for the majority of Series 86. In total, Anne Robinson recorded 265 episodes, which equates to two full series and the first three weeks of Series 86.

===Character===

&quot;Countdown&quot; quickly established cult status within British television – an image which it maintains today, despite the loss of key presenters. The programme&#x27;s audience comprises mainly students, homemakers and pensioners, because of the &quot;teatime&quot; broadcast slot and inclusive appeal of its format and presentation. &quot;Countdown&quot; has been one of Channel 4&#x27;s most-watched programmes for over twenty years, but has never won a major television award.

On each episode, the prize for defeating the reigning champion (or for claiming the championship when two new contestants compete) is a teapot that is styled to resemble the renowned clock used in each round. Introduced in December 1998, the teapot is custom-made and can only be obtained by winning a game on the programme. Defeated contestants and retiring undefeated champions receive an assortment of &quot;Countdown&quot;-themed merchandise as a parting gift.

At first, the prize for the series winner was a leather-bound copy of the twenty-volume &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, worth over £4,000. David Acton (winner of Series 31) opted for a CD-ROM version of the dictionaries, not wanting to accept leather-bound books owing to his strict veganism, and donated the monetary difference in the prices to charity. Between 2011 and 2021, the prize consisted of ordinary hardback twenty-one-volume dictionaries, a laptop computer and a lifetime subscription to Oxford Online (replaced by a MacBook Pro laptop by Series 68). The physical dictionaries were discontinued as a prize after Series 83, as they were deemed obsolete. As of Series 54 in 2006, the series champion also receives the Richard Whiteley Memorial Trophy in memory of the show&#x27;s original presenter.

Runner-up prizes in the finals increased over the years from a £100 book voucher to £250, later to £500 and then £1,000. Beginning with Series 68, the runner-up in the finals wins a laptop.

===Celebrations===
The first episode of &quot;Countdown&quot; was repeated on 1 October 2007 on More4 and also on 2 November 2007 on Channel 4; this was as part of &quot;Channel 4 at 25&quot;, a season of programmes to celebrate its 25th birthday.

On 2 November 2007, &quot;Countdown&quot; celebrated its 25th anniversary and aired a special &#x27;birthday episode&#x27;. The two players were 2006 winner Conor Travers and 2002 winner Chris Wills. However, for the rounds, VIP guests selected the letters and numbers. Guests included Gordon Brown, Amir Khan and Richard Attenborough. A statement from the French TV network France Télévisions was read out on air by Carol Vorderman to commend Channel 4 on its success of &quot;Countdown&quot;.

On 26 March 2010, Queen Elizabeth II congratulated &quot;Countdown&quot; for amassing 5,000 episodes. On 5 September 2014, the programme received a Guinness World Record at the end of its 6,000th show for the longest-running television programme of its kind during the course of Series 71.

In September 2014, &quot;Countdown&quot; entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for the most series of a TV game show broadcast.

==Format==
&quot;Countdown&quot; has occupied a daytime broadcast slot since its inception, originally in a 30-minute format. Since 2001, an episode lasts around 45 minutes including advertising breaks. During the normal series, the winner of each game returns for the next day&#x27;s show. A player who wins eight games is declared an &quot;octochamp&quot; and retires from the programme. At the end of the series, the eight best players (ranked first by number of wins, then by total score if required to break a tie) are invited back to compete in the series finals. They are seeded in a knockout tournament, with the first seed playing the eighth seed, the second playing the seventh and so on. The winner of this knockout, which culminates in the Grand Final, becomes the series champion. Each series lasts approximately six months with approximately 125 episodes.

Approximately every four series, a Champion of Champions tournament takes place. For this, sixteen of the best players to have appeared since the previous Championship are invited back for another knockout tournament. The producer, former contestant Damian Eadie, decides which players to include, but typically the tournament includes the series winners and other noteworthy contestants. Series 33 was designated a &quot;Supreme Championship&quot;, in which 56 of the best contestants from all the previous series returned for another knockout tournament. Series 10 champion Harvey Freeman was declared Supreme Champion after beating Allan Saldanha in the final. There are also occasional special episodes, in which past contestants return for themed matches. For example, David Acton and Kenneth Michie returned for a rematch of their Series 31 final, while brothers and former contestants Sanjay and Sandeep Mazumder played off against each other on 20 December 2004.

Since the change to 45-minute episodes, the game has been split into three sections, separated by advertising breaks. The first section contains two letters rounds and one numbers round, the second has two letters rounds and one numbers round followed by the anecdote from the Dictionary Corner guest and then a further two letters rounds and one numbers round, while the last section has two letters rounds, Susie Dent&#x27;s &quot;Origins of Words&quot; item since September 2007, two further letters rounds, one numbers round and a final &quot;Conundrum&quot; puzzle. With the exception of the Conundrum, the contestants swap control after every round so that each of them has control for five letters rounds and two numbers rounds.

At the end of the first two sections, the host poses a &quot;Teatime Teaser&quot; for the viewers since series 46 in 2001, giving a set of short words and a cryptic clue to a single word that can be anagrammed from them. The solution is revealed at the start of the next section. (Example: Given the words SAD MOODY and the clue &quot;We&#x27;ll all be sad and moody when this arrives&quot;, the solution would be DOOMSDAY.) The length of the Teatime Teaser anagram has varied between seven and nine letters since its introduction.

===Letters Round===
The contestant in control chooses between two stacks of face-down letter tiles, one containing vowels (A-E-I-O-U only) and the other consonants, and the assistant reveals the top tile from that stack and places it on the board. This is done nine times and the final grouping must contain at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have 30 seconds to form the longest single word they can, using the nine revealed letters; no letter may be used more often than it appears in the selection. The frequencies of the letters within each stack are weighted according to their frequency in natural English, in the same manner as Scrabble. For example, there are many &quot;N&quot;s and &quot;R&quot;s in the consonant stack, but very few tiles for rarely used letters such as &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;J&quot;. The letter frequencies are altered by the producers from time to time, so any published list does not necessarily reflect the letters used in any particular programme. The two stacks of tiles are not replenished between rounds.

Both contestants write down the words they form, in case they select the same one. After time runs out, the host asks the contestants to declare their word lengths, starting with the contestant who chose the letters. The host then asks the discovered words, starting with the shorter declared length. If one contestant has not written their word down in time, they must state this fact; if both then declare the same length, that contestant must give their word first to prevent cheating. If both contestants state that they have not written their words, the host allows them a moment to do so; this is typically edited out of the final broadcast. The contestant with the longer valid word scores one point per letter, or 18 points if they have used all nine. If the words are identical or of the same length, both contestants score. In the former case, the contestants must show their written words to each other as proof that they are the same. If a contestant is visually impaired, Dictionary Corner will verify the word. Contestants who inaccurately declare the length of their word score zero, even if the word is valid. Each round ends with Dictionary Corner revealing the longest words and/or any unusual ones that can be formed from the available letters, aided by the production team.

Any word which appears in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; is valid, as well as accepted forms of them that may not be explicitly listed. Examples are:
* Common nouns and their plurals
* Verbs and their inflections (e.g. &quot;escape&quot;, &quot;escaped&quot;, &quot;escaping&quot;)
* Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives (if the adjective is more than one syllable, the form must be explicitly listed)
* Plurals of foods specified as mass nouns that may be ordered in restaurants (e.g. &quot;pastas&quot;, as in &quot;We&#x27;ll have two pastas&quot;)

Words that are not allowed include:
* Terms which are always capitalised, including proper nouns (e.g. &quot;Jane&quot; or &quot;London&quot;)
* Words spelled with an apostrophe (e.g. &quot;Didn&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t&quot;)
* Hyphenated terms
* Words that are never used alone (e.g. &quot;gefilte&quot;; only used as part of &quot;gefilte fish&quot;)
* Since 2002, American spellings of words are not allowed (e.g. &quot;flavour&quot; and &quot;signalled&quot; are allowed, but &quot;flavor&quot; and &quot;signaled&quot; are not). Notably, though, words with the suffix &quot;-ize&quot; (e.g. &quot;realize&quot;) and derived words thereof (e.g. &quot;realizing&quot;) are permitted in addition to the corresponding &quot;-ise&quot; spellings (e.g. &quot;realise&quot;), as the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; regards both as British English spellings per the Oxford spelling convention.

:Example:
::Contestant One chooses five consonants, then three vowels, then another consonant.
::Selection is:

::Contestant One declares 7, while Contestant Two declares 8.
::Contestant One reveals &quot;younger&quot;, but Contestant Two reveals &quot;hydrogen&quot; and scores 8 points. Contestant One does not score.

===Numbers Round===
The contestant in control chooses six of 24 shuffled face-down number tiles, arranged into two groups: 20 &quot;small numbers&quot; (two each of 1 to 10) and four &quot;large numbers&quot; of 25, 50, 75 and 100. The contestant decides how many large numbers are to be used, from none to all four, after which the six tiles are randomly drawn and placed on the board. A random three-digit target figure is then generated by an electronic machine, known as &quot;CECIL&quot; (which stands for &quot;Countdown&#x27;s Electronic Calculator In Leeds&quot;). The contestants have 30 seconds to work out a sequence of calculations with the numbers whose final result is as close to the target number as possible. They may use only the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and do not have to use all six numbers. A number may not be used more times than it appears on the board. Division can only be performed if the result has no remainder (i.e., the divisor is a factor of the dividend). Fractions are not allowed and only positive integers may be obtained as a result at any stage of the calculation. As in the letters rounds, both contestants must declare their results and any contestant who has not fully written their calculations down in time must go first if both declare the same result. In addition, both contestants must show their written work to each other if their results and calculations are identical.

The contestant who has declared a result closer to the target is called upon to state their calculations first. Only if they make a mistake or if both contestants are equally close to the target, is the opponent called upon.

Only the contestant whose result is closer to the target scores points: ten for reaching it exactly, seven for being between one and five from the target and five for being within six and ten from the target. Contestants score no points for being more than ten away, if their calculations are flawed or if they take too long to give a solution or after saying they have not written it down. Both score if they reach the same result or if their results are the same distance away. Should neither contestant reach the target exactly, the assistant is called upon to attempt a solution, either immediately or at a later time during the episode.

:Example:
::Contestant One requests two large numbers and four small numbers.
::Selection is:
:::75 50 2 3 8 7
::Randomly generated target is:
:::812
::Contestant One declares 813, while Contestant Two declares 815.
::Contestant One is closer and so reveals: 75 + 50 – 8 = 117, and 117 × 7 – (3 × 2) = 813, which scores 7 points for being 1 away. Contestant Two does not score.
::Assistant notes: 50 + 8 = 58, and 7 × 2 × 58 = 812, which would have scored 10 points.

In some games, there are many ways to reach the target exactly; the example target above could also be reached by 7 × (75 + 50 + 2 – 8 – 3) = 812. Not all games are solvable, and for a few selections it is impossible even to get within 10, most commonly when a contestant picks six small numbers and the target number is quite large. There is a tactical element in selecting how many large numbers to include. One large and five small numbers is the most popular selection, despite two large numbers giving the best chance of the game being solvable exactly. Selections with zero or four large numbers are generally considered the hardest.

The 24 tiles are laid out in four rows, the topmost of which contains only the four large numbers. The contestant may specify how many tiles to draw from each row, or simply state how many large and small numbers will be used; in the latter case, the assistant draws the tiles randomly. The numbers are usually placed on the board from right to left, starting with the small ones, but have occasionally been displayed in scrambled order. On rare occasions, the contestant has declined to make any choices, in which case the assistant selects the tiles. Unlike the letters round, the pool of tiles is fully replenished after each numbers round.

:Example:
::Contestant requests one from the top (large), two from the second row (small), and three more from the top (large).
::Selection is (in disorder):
:::50 10 6 25 100 75

A special edition, broadcast on 15 March 2010, for two previous series champions, Kirk Bevins and Chris Davies, used instead of the usual four large numbers, the numbers 12, 37 and two numbers unrevealed for the duration of the show. In a further special broadcast on 16 August 2010 between the Series 59 finalists Charlie Reams and Junaid Mubeen, the other two numbers were revealed to be 62 and 87.

===Conundrum===
The final round of the game is the &quot;Countdown Conundrum&quot;, in which the contestants are shown a combination of two or three words with a total of nine letters. They have 30 seconds to form a single word using all the letters and must buzz in to respond (a bell for the champion and a buzzer for the challenger). Each contestant is allowed only one guess and the first to answer correctly scores 10 points. If a contestant buzzes-in and either responds incorrectly or fails to give any response, they are frozen out and the remaining time is given to the opponent. If neither contestant can solve it, the presenter asks whether anyone in the audience knows the answer and if so, chooses someone to call it out (this practice was stopped temporarily in 2009 to avoid difficulties with camera angles after the studio layout was changed). The Conundrum is designed to have only one solution, but on occasion more than one valid word is found by happenstance (e.g. MISSATTEE can become both ESTIMATES and STEAMIEST). If this happens, any of these results are accepted. On rare occasions, the Conundrum is presented as a single nine-letter word that must be anagrammed into another one (e.g. SMARTENED becoming TRADESMEN).

If the contestants&#x27; scores are within ten points of each other going into this round, it is referred to as a &quot;Crucial Countdown Conundrum.&quot; Since ten points are at stake, the contestant who solves it (if any) will either win the game or force a tiebreaker. If the scores are tied after the Conundrum, additional Conundrums are played until the tie is broken. There have been several instances in which two Conundrums were used to decide the winner, but only a handful of episodes have required three. There have also been cases when even more Conundrums have been required to provide a winner, but not all have been included in the transmitted programme.

:Example:
::Conundrum is revealed:
:::C H I N A L U N G
::Contestant One buzzes-in and says &quot;launching&quot;. This answer is revealed to be correct and Contestant One scores 10 points.

==Evolution==

The rules of &quot;Countdown&quot; are derived from those of &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot;. Perhaps the biggest difference is the length of the round; &quot;DCedL&quot;&#x27;s number rounds are each 45 seconds long to &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s 30. &quot;DCedL&quot; also features &quot;duels&quot;, in which players compete in short tasks such as mental arithmetic problems, forming two themed words from a set of letters, or being asked to spell a word correctly. Other minor differences include a different numbers scoring system (9 points for an exact solution, or 6 points for the closest inexact solution in &quot;DCedL&quot;) and the proportion of letters to numbers rounds (10 to 4 in &quot;Countdown&quot;, 8 to 4 in &quot;DCedL&quot;).

The pilot episode followed significantly different rules from the current ones. Most noticeably, only eight letters were selected for each letters round. If two contestants offered a word of the same length, or an equally close solution to a numbers game, then only the contestant who made the selection for that round was awarded points. Also, only five points were given for an exact numbers solution, three for a solution within 5, and one point for the closer solution, no matter how far away.

Though the style and colour scheme of the set have changed many times (and the show itself moved to Manchester after more than 25 years in Leeds), the clock has always provided the centrepiece and like the clock music (composed by Alan Hawkshaw), it is an enduring and well-recognised feature of &quot;Countdown&quot;. Executive producer John Meade once commissioned Alan Hawkshaw to revise the music for extra intensity to introduce at the start of Series 31 in January 1996; after hundreds of complaints from viewers, the old tune was reinstated after just 12 shows.

The original set, known as the Pastel set, was used from its launch in 1982 until Series 17 in early 1989. A new brown wooden set was introduced in Series 18 in July 1989 but remained in use for less than two years. Series 22 from July 1991 saw the introduction of the familiar and long-lived &quot;Wings&quot; set which was used in its original form, a red colour scheme, until 1995. Series 31 in January 1996 saw its colour scheme change to purple and changed again to tangerine at the end of 1999 alongside updated displays for the scores and CECIL. January 2003 saw the set updated to a new pink and purple striped theme with the letters and numbers boards now on separate islands rather than being integrated into the set. Six years later, in January 2009, the set received another redesign with a numerical blue theme and the letters and numbers boards mounted on opposite sides of a single display stand. New modern displays for the scores and the numbers round came in January 2013 while the set received a slight redesign in July 2017 while retaining the blue background which has been used to up to the most recent series. The original clock featured until September 2013, when it was replaced.

Until the end of Series 21, if the two contestants had equal scores after the first conundrum, the match was declared a draw and they both returned for the next show. A significant change in the format occurred in September 2001, when the show was expanded from nine rounds and 30 minutes to the current fifteen rounds and 45 minutes. The older format was split into two halves, each with three letters and one numbers game, plus the conundrum at the end of the second half. When the format was expanded to fifteen rounds, Richard Whiteley continued to refer jokingly to the three segments of the show as &quot;halves&quot;. Under the old format, Grand Finals were specially extended shows of fourteen rounds, but now all shows use a fifteen-round format.

The rules regarding which words are permitted have changed with time. American spelling was allowed until 2002 and more unspecified inflections were assumed to be valid.

In September 2007, an &quot;Origin of Words&quot; feature was added to the show, in which Susie Dent explains the origin of a word or phrase she has been researching. This feature follows the eighth letters round, partway through the third section of each episode. The feature was omitted during the time that she was absent for maternity leave and was reinstated upon her return.

When the 15-round format was first introduced in September 2001, the composition of the rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds; four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that there was a slight imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The Dictionary Corner guest&#x27;s spot was immediately before the first advertising break and Susie Dent&#x27;s Origin of Words spot preceded the second numbers game shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4&#x27;s decision to increase the amount of advertising and to alter the times when they occur during the programme, therefore reducing &quot;Countdown&quot;″s actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.

==Notable contestants==
Since the debut of &quot;Countdown&quot; in 1982, there have been over 8,000 televised episodes and 90 complete series. There have also been sixteen &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; tournaments, the most recent in January 2023.

Several of the programme&#x27;s most successful contestants have received national media coverage. Teenager Julian Fell set a record score of 146 in December 2002. In 2006, 14-year-old Conor Travers became the youngest series champion in the show&#x27;s history, and 11-year-old Kai Laddiman became the youngest octochamp for 20 years. Conor Travers went on to win the 30th Anniversary Champion of Champions series in March 2013 with a record-equalling top score of 146. On 17 January 2019, in the quarter-final of the 15th &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; tournament, Zarte Siempre, who eventually won that tournament set a new record score of 150. This record was beaten in May 2019 by Elliott Mellor&#x27;s score of 152. A new record was set on 29 September 2022 when contestant Tom Stevenson scored 154. This record score of 154 was equalled by contestant Cillian McMulkin on 31 January 2023.

At eight years old, Tanmay Dixit was the youngest player ever to appear on the show, achieving two wins in March 2005. He also received press attention for his offerings in the letters round, which included &quot;fannies&quot; and &quot;farted&quot;.

On Christmas Day 1987, Nic Brown set the highest score difference ever achieved in a standard 14-round game, beating Joel Salkin 108–36, a margin of 72 points. Brown also went on to become one of the only two contestants ever to achieve an undefeated &#x27;grand slam&#x27; – becoming an Octochamp, winning a series, and winning a Championship of Champions.

In April 2013, Giles Hutchings, a student at Royal Grammar School, Guildford broke the record for the highest octochamp score, amassing 965 points over 8 games. He went on to win Series 68. The record was beaten by Dylan Taylor, who achieved an octochamp score of 974 in August 2013, but he lost the Grand Final of that series. In 2019 the record was beaten by 87 points by teenager Elliott Mellor, who became the first octochamp to break the 1,000-point barrier scoring a total of 1,061 over his eight preliminary games. Echoing Dylan&#x27;s appearance, Mellor was pipped to the series title, finishing as runner up. Three former contestants have returned to &quot;Countdown&quot; as part of the production team: Michael Wylie, Mark Nyman (as producer, and occasional lexicographer in Dictionary Corner) and Damian Eadie (the current series producer).

In 1998, sixteen celebrities were invited to play &quot;Celebrity Countdown&quot;, a series of eight games broadcast every Thursday evening over the course of eight weeks. The celebrities included Whiteley&#x27;s successor Des Lynam, who beat Siân Lloyd. The highest and lowest scores were posted in the same game when TV&#x27;s Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall beat wine critic Jilly Goolden 47–9.

Richard Whiteley and Carol Vorderman competed in another special episode on Christmas Day 1997. For this game, the presenter&#x27;s chair was taken by William G. Stewart, the host of fellow Channel 4 game show &quot;Fifteen to One&quot;. Susie Dent took over Carol Vorderman&#x27;s duties, and Mark Nyman occupied Dictionary Corner, accompanied by Magnus Magnusson. The game was close-fought and decided only by the crucial Countdown conundrum &quot;mistletoe&quot; which Carol Vorderman solved in two seconds, after Richard Whiteley had inadvertently buzzed after one second because when he regularly hosted the show, he hit the button to reveal the conundrum and kept his old habit up.

Contestants who have or had become notable for other reasons include &quot;Nuts&quot; magazine editor-at-large Pete Cashmore, rugby player Ayoola Erinle, footballers Neil MacKenzie, Clarke Carlisle and Matt Le Tissier, musicians Jon Marsh and Nick Saloman, comedian Alex Horne, noted Irish playwright Peter Sheridan and professional darts referee Kirk Bevins, who won Series 60 and was a quarter-finalist in the 30th Birthday Championship.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Countdown&quot; is often referenced and parodied in British culture.

===Assorted allusions===
In 1992, Saint Etienne used a sample of the host&#x27;s lead-in for &quot;today&#x27;s Countdown Conundrum&quot; as the opening for the track &quot;Stoned to Say the Least&quot;.

In the 2002 film &quot;About a Boy&quot;, protagonist Will Freeman is a regular viewer of &quot;Countdown&quot;.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; (2005) mentions a futuristic version of &quot;Countdown&quot;, in which the goal is to stop a bomb from exploding in 30 seconds. &quot;Countdown&quot; was referenced again in a later series in &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; (2007), where Professor Docherty expresses a keen fondness for the show and how it &quot;hasn&#x27;t been the same since Des took over—both Deses&quot;.

Fairport Convention guitarist Simon Nicol titled one of his solo albums &quot;Consonant Please Carol&quot;, echoing one of the show&#x27;s catchphrases.

Mentioned in episode one (2012) of series 4 of TV series &quot;Misfits&quot;.

===Video game===
A &quot;Countdown&quot; video game was released for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii in 2009. There have also been mobile apps of the game released.

===Outtakes===

&quot;Countdown&quot; has also generated a number of widely viewed outtakes, with the letters occasionally producing a word that was deemed unsuitable for the original broadcast. A round in which Dictionary Corner offered the word &quot;gobshite&quot; featured in &quot;TV&#x27;s Finest Failures&quot; in 2001 (the actual episode aired on 10 January 2000), and in one episode from 1991, contestants Gino Corr and Lawrence Pearse both declared the word &quot;wankers&quot;. This was edited out of the programme but has since appeared on many outtakes shows. When contestant Charlie Reams declared &quot;wankers&quot; on 21 October 2008 edition, the declaration was kept in but the word itself was bleeped. Other incidents with only marginally rude words (including &quot;wanker&quot;, singular) have made it into the programme as they appeared, such as those with Tanmay Dixit referenced above, a clip from a 2001 episode in which the word &quot;fart&quot; appeared as the first four letters on the board (which also featured on &quot;100 Greatest TV Moments from Hell&quot;), and a round where an anagram of the word &quot;fucked&quot; appeared on the board in the string &quot;A U O D F C K E G&quot;, although neither player chose to use the word and Dictionary Corner was able to find two seven-letter words that could have been made from the board&#x27;s offerings. On 2 February 2017, the board for the letters round was &quot;M T H I A E D H S&quot;, and with both players offering sevens, Dictionary Corner found the word &quot;shithead&quot;, which was bleeped out in the audio and censored on-screen with the poo emoji.

===Humour===
The programme is mentioned in an episode of Irish sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot; entitled &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Theft&quot;, &quot;Still Game&quot; (in the episode &quot;Wireless&quot;) and is also referenced in the very first episode of &quot;Little Britain&quot; from 2003. BBC impression sketch show &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; parodies &quot;Countdown&quot; numerous times, and another television programme, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, parodied &quot;Countdown&quot; in a feature called &quot;Countdown Under&quot;. In a sketch &quot;Countdown to Hell&quot; from the comedy show &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, Stephen Fry lampooned Richard Whiteley&#x27;s punning style and Hugh Laurie played one of the contestants, while Gyles Brandreth (played by Steve Steen), presented with the letters &quot;&quot;, got the (non-)word &quot;sloblock&quot; (supposedly meaning exactly the same as &quot;bollocks&quot;). The show also has a fleeting reference in British sitcom &quot;The Office&quot; when Chris &#x27;Finchy&#x27; Finch attempts to insult temporary worker Ricky when he explains he had a job to pay for his studies. Finchy states that it probably was &#x27;professor in charge of watching &quot;Countdown&quot; every day&#x27;, commenting on its student audience, and referring to the fact anyone watching &quot;Countdown&quot; during its &#x27;hometime&#x27; time slot cannot be out at work.

The format of the show has been parodied on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. In 1999, when Whiteley was a guest, the numbers game was copied along with the clock music and at the end of the show was a conundrum, &quot;PHANIOILS&quot;, to which the answer was Ian Hislop. In 2004, when Vorderman was a guest, one of the usual rounds was replaced with a conundrum round based on the week&#x27;s news. When Vorderman hosted &quot;Have I Got News&quot; in 2006, one of the rounds was the &quot;Spinning Conundrum Numbers Round&quot;, altering the &quot;Spinning Headlines&quot; round by adding a number to a picture relating to the week&#x27;s news; at the end of the round, the six numbers from the picture were used for a numbers game.

Richard Whiteley was the victim of a practical joke while presenting the show in 1998. The contestants and rounds had been planted as part of a &quot;Gotcha!&quot;, a regular prank feature on the light entertainment show &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;. In the prank, both the two contestants and Dictionary Corner missed the word &quot;something&quot; from the letters OMETHINGS, and from another selection, both of the contestants declared &quot;I&#x27;ve got diarrhoea&quot; referring to the selection. In the numbers round that followed, the male contestant &quot;answered&quot; the puzzle by concatenating 6, 2, and 3 to make the target of 623. Whiteley did not uncover the joke until &quot;House Party&quot; presenter Noel Edmonds appeared on the set, having revealed the unusually short conundrum of HOGCAT to be &quot;gotcha&quot; at the end of the programme.

In a 2003 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Richard Whiteley participated in the &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment. Before Whiteley&#x27;s lap was shown, presenter Jeremy Clarkson played a game of &quot;Countdown&quot; with Whiteley, using words such as &quot;imin&quot; (Mini), &quot;sexul&quot; (Lexus), &quot;nevor lard&quot; (Land Rover), &quot;mushi bits&quot;(Mitsubishi) and &quot;pianos shiazu&quot; (Hispano-Suiza).

It was also referred to on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; twice. The first time it was referred to was when &quot;Dev&quot; (&quot;Coronation Street&quot;) made a sound like &quot;Countdown&quot; end of thirty seconds time. The second time was when the competition &quot;Where Has The Knitted Character Been This Week?&quot; had the answer &quot;on Rachel Riley&#x27;s chair&quot;.
On 2 July 2010, the game was featured in the series 4 episode &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;. Moss stuns everyone, including Jeff Stelling and Rachel Riley (both playing themselves), by declaring that the 9 letter string TNETENNBA is in fact a word. Later, Moss becomes an octochamp and is consequently invited into an underground club named &quot;8+&quot;, where he competes in a game of &quot;Street Countdown&quot; as part of a spoof of &quot;Boogie Town&quot;. The episode featured a cameo from Gyles Brandreth, a regular contributor to Dictionary Corner.

British entertainer Stevie Riks has parodied the show in one of his many YouTube comedy videos.

In an episode from spring 2011, the Blackpool-supporting producer of the show arranged the conundrum &quot;PNECRISIS&quot; (&quot;priciness&quot;), poking fun at their local rivals Preston North End&#x27;s relegation from the Championship in the 2010–11 season.

===Non-canon games===
The game has also been played on a number of different programmes, notably as the first challenge in &quot;What&#x27;s Next&quot; on &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, featuring the pair versus one of the duo&#x27;s old head teachers. In 2010, it was played as a shopping task on the final Channel 4 series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, with a team of housemates competing in the house against the then current champion, Chris Davies, in the &quot;Countdown&quot; studio via satellite. The housemates failed this task.

==Spin-offs==
* &quot;Countdown Masters&quot; was a regular feature segment within &quot;The Channel Four Daily&quot;, throughout its run from 1989 to 1992. It had the same hosts and rules as the standard game but was played in shorter bite-sized chunks. It was abbreviated: for example, the letters were chosen all in one go as &quot;x vowels and y consonants&quot; and there was no celebrity guest in &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot;.
* &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot; has comedian Jimmy Carr as host and team captains Jon Richardson and Sean Lock (until his death in 2021) as regular contestants. Susie Dent and Rachel Riley fill their normal roles. It uses similar rules to the standard game, but has a strong comedy element, a reduced amount of rounds and is two against two. It began in 2012 and continues airing new episodes; as of 31 January 2025, 167 episodes of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot; have aired.
* &quot;Celebrity Countdown&quot; had celebrities competing on the show without the cast of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; and with its usual presenters. Only two series have been broadcast; Series 1 in 1998 and Series 2 in 2019–2020. Both series used a modified format and were broadcast in the evening, the second of which was aired on More4.

<text>The Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization or the elliptic-curve factorization method (ECM) is a fast, sub-exponential running time, algorithm for integer factorization, which employs elliptic curves. For general-purpose factoring, ECM is the third-fastest known factoring method. The second-fastest is the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve, and the fastest is the general number field sieve. The Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization is named after Hendrik Lenstra.

Practically speaking, ECM is considered a special-purpose factoring algorithm, as it is most suitable for finding small factors. , it is still the best algorithm for divisors not exceeding 50 to 60 digits, as its running time is dominated by the size of the smallest factor &quot;p&quot; rather than by the size of the number &quot;n&quot; to be factored. Frequently, ECM is used to remove small factors from a very large integer with many factors; if the remaining integer is still composite, then it has only large factors and is factored using general-purpose techniques. The largest factor found using ECM so far has 83 decimal digits and was discovered on 7 September 2013 by R. Propper. Increasing the number of curves tested improves the chances of finding a factor, but they are not linear with the increase in the number of digits.

==Algorithm==
The Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization method to find a factor of a given natural number formula_1 works as follows:
# Pick a random elliptic curve over formula_2 (the integers modulo formula_1), with equation of the form formula_4 together with a non-trivial point formula_5 on it. 
#:This can be done by first picking random formula_6, and then setting formula_7 to assure the point is on the curve.
# One can define &quot;Addition&quot; of two points on the curve, to define a group. The addition laws are given in the article on elliptic curves.
#:We can form repeated multiples of a point formula_8: formula_9. The addition formulae involve taking the modular slope of a chord joining formula_8 and formula_11, and thus division between residue classes modulo formula_1, performed using the extended Euclidean algorithm. In particular, division by some formula_13 includes calculation of the formula_14.
#: Assuming we calculate a slope of the form formula_15 with formula_16, then if formula_17, the result of the point addition will be formula_18, the point &quot;at infinity&quot; corresponding to the intersection of the &quot;vertical&quot; line joining formula_19 and the curve. However, if formula_20, then the point addition will not produce a meaningful point on the curve; but, more importantly, formula_14 is a non-trivial factor of formula_1.
# Compute formula_23 on the elliptic curve (formula_24), where formula_25 is a product of many small numbers: say, a product of small primes raised to small powers, as in the p-1 algorithm, or the factorial formula_26 for some not too large formula_27. This can be done efficiently, one small factor at a time. Say, to get formula_28, first compute formula_29, then formula_30, then formula_31, and so on. formula_27 is picked to be small enough so that formula_27-wise point addition can be performed in reasonable time.
#*If we finish all the calculations above without encountering non-invertible elements (formula_24), it means that the elliptic curves&#x27; (modulo primes) order is not smooth enough, so we need to try again with a different curve and starting point.
#*If we encounter a formula_35 we are done: it is a non-trivial factor of formula_1.

The time complexity depends on the size of the number&#x27;s smallest prime factor and can be represented by , where &quot;p&quot; is the smallest factor of &quot;n&quot;, or formula_37, in L-notation.

==Explanation==

If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are two prime divisors of &quot;n&quot;, then implies the same equation also and These two smaller elliptic curves with the formula_38-addition are now genuine groups. If these groups have &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;Nq&quot; elements, respectively, then for any point &quot;P&quot; on the original curve, by Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, is minimal such that formula_39 on the curve modulo &quot;p&quot; implies that &quot;k&quot; divides &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot;; moreover, formula_40. The analogous statement holds for the curve modulo &quot;q&quot;. When the elliptic curve is chosen randomly, then &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;q&quot; are random numbers close to and respectively (see below). Hence it is unlikely that most of the prime factors of &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;q&quot; are the same, and it is quite likely that while computing &quot;eP&quot;, we will encounter some &quot;kP&quot; that is ∞ but not or vice versa. When this is the case, &quot;kP&quot; does not exist on the original curve, and in the computations we found some &quot;v&quot; with either or but not both. That is, gave a non-trivial factor 

ECM is at its core an improvement of the older algorithm. The algorithm finds prime factors &quot;p&quot; such that is b-powersmooth for small values of &quot;b&quot;. For any &quot;e&quot;, a multiple of and any &quot;a&quot; relatively prime to &quot;p&quot;, by Fermat&#x27;s little theorem we have . Then is likely to produce a factor of &quot;n&quot;. However, the algorithm fails when has large prime factors, as is the case for numbers containing strong primes, for example.

ECM gets around this obstacle by considering the group of a random elliptic curve over the finite field Z&quot;p&quot;, rather than considering the multiplicative group of Z&quot;p&quot; which always has order 

The order of the group of an elliptic curve over Z&quot;p&quot; varies (quite randomly) between and by Hasse&#x27;s theorem, and is likely to be smooth for some elliptic curves. Although there is no proof that a smooth group order will be found in the Hasse-interval, by using heuristic probabilistic methods, the Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance theorem with suitably optimized parameter choices, and the L-notation, we can expect to try curves before getting a smooth group order. This heuristic estimate is very reliable in practice.

==Example usage==

The following example is from , with some details added.

We want to factor Let&#x27;s choose the elliptic curve with the point on it, and let&#x27;s try to compute 

The slope of the tangent line at some point &quot;A&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is . Using &quot;s&quot; we can compute 2&quot;A&quot;. If the value of &quot;s&quot; is of the form &quot;a/b&quot; where &quot;b&quot; &gt; 1 and gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) = 1, we have to find the modular inverse of &quot;b&quot;. If it does not exist, gcd(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) is a non-trivial factor of &quot;n&quot;.

First we compute 2&quot;P&quot;. We have so the coordinates of are and all numbers understood Just to check that this 2&quot;P&quot; is indeed on the curve: 

Then we compute 3(2&quot;P&quot;). We have Using the Euclidean algorithm: then then then then then Hence and working backwards (a version of the extended Euclidean algorithm): Hence and Given this &quot;s&quot;, we can compute the coordinates of 2(2&quot;P&quot;), just as we did above: Just to check that this is indeed a point on the curve: After this, we can compute formula_41.

We can similarly compute 4!&quot;P&quot;, and so on, but 8!&quot;P&quot; requires inverting The Euclidean algorithm gives that 455839 is divisible by 599, and we have found a 

The reason that this worked is that the curve has points, while it has points. Moreover, 640 and 777 are the smallest positive integers &quot;k&quot; such that on the curve and respectively. Since is a multiple of 640 but not a multiple of 777, we have on the curve but not on the curve hence the repeated addition broke down here, yielding the factorization.

==The algorithm with projective coordinates==

Before considering the projective plane over formula_42 first consider a &#x27;normal&#x27; projective space over formula_43: Instead of points, lines through the origin are studied. A line may be represented as a non-zero point formula_44, under an equivalence relation ~ given by: formula_45 ⇔ ∃ c ≠ 0 such that &quot;x&#x27; = cx&quot;, &quot;y&#x27; = cy&quot; and &quot;z&#x27; = cz&quot;. Under this equivalence relation, the space is called the projective plane formula_46; points, denoted by formula_47, correspond to lines in a three-dimensional space that pass through the origin. Note that the point formula_48 does not exist in this space since to draw a line in any possible direction requires at least one of x&#x27;,y&#x27; or z&#x27; ≠ 0. Now observe that almost all lines go through any given reference plane - such as the (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,1)-plane, whilst the lines precisely parallel to this plane, having coordinates (&quot;X,Y&quot;,0), specify directions uniquely, as &#x27;points at infinity&#x27; that are used in the affine (&quot;X,Y&quot;)-plane it lies above.

In the algorithm, only the group structure of an elliptic curve over the field formula_43 is used. Since we do not necessarily need the field formula_43, a finite field will also provide a group structure on an elliptic curve. However, considering the same curve and operation over formula_51 with not a prime does not give a group. The Elliptic Curve Method makes use of the failure cases of the addition law.

We now state the algorithm in projective coordinates. The neutral element is then given by the point at infinity formula_52. Let be a (positive) integer and consider the elliptic curve (a set of points with some structure on it) formula_53.

# Pick formula_54 with ≠ 0.
# Calculate formula_55. The elliptic curve is then in Weierstrass form given by formula_56 and by using projective coordinates the elliptic curve is given by the homogeneous equation formula_57. It has the point formula_58.
# Choose an upperbound formula_59 for this elliptic curve. Remark: You will only find factors if the group order of the elliptic curve over formula_60 (denoted by formula_61) is B-smooth, which means that all prime factors of formula_61 have to be less or equal to .
# Calculate formula_63.
# Calculate formula_64 (&quot;k&quot; times) in the ring formula_65. Note that if formula_66 is -smooth and is prime (and therefore formula_67 is a field) that formula_68. However, if only formula_61 is B-smooth for some divisor of , the product might not be (0:1:0) because addition and multiplication are not well-defined if is not prime. In this case, a non-trivial divisor can be found.
# If not, then go back to step 2. If this does occur, then you will notice this when simplifying the product formula_70

In point 5 it is said that under the right circumstances a non-trivial divisor can be found. As pointed out in Lenstra&#x27;s article (Factoring Integers with Elliptic Curves) the addition needs the assumption formula_71. If formula_72 are not formula_52 and distinct (otherwise addition works similarly, but is a little different), then addition works as follows:

* To calculate: formula_74 formula_75,
* formula_76,
* formula_77,
* formula_78,
* formula_79.

If addition fails, this will be due to a failure calculating formula_80 In particular, because formula_81 can not always be calculated if is not prime (and therefore formula_67 is not a field). Without making use of formula_67 being a field, one could calculate:

* formula_84,
* formula_85,
* formula_86,
* formula_87, and simplify if possible.

This calculation is always legal and if the gcd of the -coordinate with ≠ (1 or ), so when simplifying fails, a non-trivial divisor of is found.

==Twisted Edwards curves==
The use of Edwards curves needs fewer modular multiplications and less time than the use of Montgomery curves or Weierstrass curves (other used methods). Using Edwards curves you can also find more primes.

Definition. Let formula_25 be a field in which formula_89, and let formula_90 with formula_91. Then the twisted Edwards curve formula_92 is given by formula_93 An Edwards curve is a twisted Edwards curve in which formula_94.

There are five known ways to build a set of points on an Edwards curve: the set of affine points, the set of projective points, the set of inverted points, the set of extended points and the set of completed points.

The set of affine points is given by:

:formula_95.

The addition law is given by

:formula_96

The point (0,1) is its neutral element and the inverse of formula_97 is formula_98.

The other representations are defined similar to how the projective Weierstrass curve follows from the affine.

Any elliptic curve in Edwards form has a point of order 4. So the torsion group of an Edwards curve over formula_99 is isomorphic to either formula_100 or formula_101.

The most interesting cases for ECM are formula_102 and formula_101, since they force the group orders of the curve modulo primes to be divisible by 12 and 16 respectively. The following curves have a torsion group isomorphic to formula_102:

* formula_105 with point formula_106 where formula_107 and formula_108
* formula_105 with point formula_106 where formula_111 and formula_112

Every Edwards curve with a point of order 3 can be written in the ways shown above. Curves with torsion group isomorphic to formula_101 and formula_114 may be more efficient at finding primes.

==Stage 2==

The above text is about the first stage of elliptic curve factorisation. There one hopes to find a prime divisor such that formula_115 is the neutral element of formula_116.
In the second stage one hopes to have found a prime divisor such that formula_115 has small prime order in formula_118.

We hope the order to be between formula_119 and formula_120, where formula_119 is determined in stage 1 and formula_120 is new stage 2 parameter.
Checking for a small order of formula_115, can be done by computing formula_124 modulo for each prime .

==GMP-ECM and EECM-MPFQ==

The use of Twisted Edwards elliptic curves, as well as other techniques were used by Bernstein et al to provide an optimized implementation of ECM. Its only drawback is that it works on smaller composite numbers than the more general purpose implementation, GMP-ECM of Zimmermann.

==Hyperelliptic-curve method (HECM)==

There are recent developments in using hyperelliptic curves to factor integers. Cosset shows in his article (of 2010) that one can build a hyperelliptic curve with genus two (so a curve formula_125 with of degree 5), which gives the same result as using two &quot;normal&quot; elliptic curves at the same time. By making use of the Kummer surface, calculation is more efficient. The disadvantages of the hyperelliptic curve (versus an elliptic curve) are compensated by this alternative way of calculating. Therefore, Cosset roughly claims that using hyperelliptic curves for factorization is no worse than using elliptic curves.

==Quantum version (GEECM)==
Bernstein, Heninger, Lou, and Valenta suggest GEECM, a quantum version of ECM with Edwards curves. It uses Grover&#x27;s algorithm to roughly double the length of the primes found compared to standard EECM, assuming a quantum computer with sufficiently many qubits and of comparable speed to the classical computer running EECM.

<text>The APC-7 connector (also referred to as a 7 mm connector) is a precision coaxial connector used on laboratory microwave test equipment for frequencies up to 18 GHz. APC-7 connectors are advantageous because they have a low reflection coefficient, make repeatable coaxial connections, and are genderless. The connectors are expensive, so they are seldom used outside the laboratory where their cost can be justified by their accuracy and convenience. Due to their high cost, their 18 GHz frequency limitation, and new laboratory practices, the connectors are now uncommon. Modern low-frequency microwave equipment often uses the less expensive 3.5 mm (26.5 GHz) connector. Higher-frequency equipment must use higher-performance connectors such as the 2.92 mm (40 GHz), 2.4 mm (50 GHz), 1.85 mm (67 GHz), or 1.0 mm (110 GHz) connectors.

== Features ==
APC-7 connector pairs have several desirable features:
* The connectors are genderless. This avoids some awkward adapters or duplication of laboratory standards. With a gendered connector, a laboratory might need a precision male load and a precision female load. With a genderless connector, only one load is required. Although the illustration shows threads on one connector of the pair, all connectors contain a retractable male thread. Any two can be mated by retracting the thread in either one and leaving it protruding in the other.
* The connectors have a well-defined reference plane. Consequently, the connectors simplify some measurements.
* The mated pair of APC-7 connectors has a low reflection coefficient and thus low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). The low reflection coefficient means better measurement accuracy. The typical VSWR is 1.025:1 at 18 GHz.
* The mated pair makes a repeatable connection. A pair has a repeatable reflection coefficient to ±0.001. Consequently, laboratory measurements have reduced uncertainty.

==Adapters==
APC-7 connectors require adapters to change from the connectors used in the laboratory to those used on everyday products. These adapters are expensive precision devices. For example, an APC-7 to type N (f) cost $105 in 1979. Such adapters bought new today (as of July 2012) can cost as much as $294.

==History==
&quot;APC&quot; stands for Amphenol Precision Connector and &quot;-7&quot; for 7 millimetres. Hewlett-Packard started developing the connector in the mid-1960s. Amphenol improved the design and manufactured the connector.

<text>Rosemarie Magdalena Albach (23 September 1938 – 29 May 1982), known professionally as Romy Schneider (), was a German and French actress. She is regarded as one of the greatest screen actresses of all time and became a cult figure due to her role as Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the &quot;Sissi&quot; trilogy in the mid-1950s. She later reprised the role in a more mature version in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1973). She began her career in the German genre in the early 1950s when she was 15. Schneider moved to France, where she made successful and critically acclaimed films with some of the most notable film directors of that era. Coco Chanel called Romy &quot;the ultimate incarnation of the ideal woman&quot;. Bertrand Tavernier remarked: &quot;Sautet is talking about Mozart with regard to Romy. Me, I want to talk of Verdi, Mahler...&quot;

== Early life ==
Schneider was born Rosemarie Magdalena Albach in Vienna, six months after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria into the German Reich. She was born to a theatrical couple; her father Wolf Albach-Retty was a leading actor of Vienna&#x27;s Volkstheater, and her mother Magda Schneider starred in scores of lavish musical films in Germany. Her paternal grandmother Rosa Albach-Retty had been one of the most popular actresses of the Austrian theater. Rosemarie, known to family as Romy from her earliest years, was educated at private schools in Berchtesgaden and Salzburg. Interested in painting, she planned to continue her education at art school, but she was also interested in school plays, not only acting in them but directing as well.

Four weeks after her birth, her parents took her to Schönau am Königssee in Germany where she and later her brother Wolf-Dieter (born 1941) grew up with their grandparents Franz Xaver and Maria Schneider on the country estate . In her first year, Schneider was cared for by a governess. Her parents were very rarely present due to their acting engagements. In 1943, they separated and divorced in 1945.

In September 1944, Schneider was enrolled in the elementary school of Schönau and from July 1949 she attended the girls&#x27; boarding school at , a private secondary school of the Augustinian Canonesses of the Congregation of Notre Dame in Elsbethen near Salzburg. During her schooldays, she discovered her passion for acting which is why she was often on stage at theatrical performances at the residential school. In her diary entry of 10 June 1952, she wrote: &quot;If it were up to me, I would immediately become an actress. ... Every time I see a nice movie, my first thoughts are about the idea: I definitely have to become an actress. Yes! I have to!&quot; On 12 July 1953, she left the residential school Goldenstein with the degree of &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;. After the summer holidays, she moved to Cologne to join her mother who lived there with the restaurateur and entrepreneur .

After her parents&#x27; divorce in 1945, Magda took charge of Schneider and her brother Wolf-Dieter, eventually supervising her career, often appearing alongside her daughter. Her career was also overseen by her stepfather Blatzheim who, Schneider said, had made sexual advances on her.

==Early career==

Schneider&#x27;s first film, made when she was 15, was &quot;When the White Lilacs Bloom Again&quot; (1953), credited as Romy Schneider-Albach. In 1954, Schneider, for the first time, portrayed a royal, playing a young Queen Victoria in the Austrian film &quot;Mädchenjahre einer Königin&quot; (known in the U.S. as &quot;The Story of Vickie&quot; and in Britain as &quot;Victoria in Dover&quot;).

Schneider&#x27;s breakthrough came with her portrayal of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the romantic biopic &quot;Sissi&quot; (1955) and its two sequels, &quot;Sissi – The Young Empress&quot; (1956) and &quot;Sissi – Fateful Years of an Empress&quot; (1957), all with Karlheinz Böhm, who became a close friend. Less stereotypical films during this busy period include &quot;The Girl and the Legend&quot; (1957), working with a young Horst Buchholz, and &quot;Monpti&quot; (1957), directed by Helmut Käutner, again with Buchholz. In an attempt to work on a higher artistic level, she starred with Lilli Palmer in the 1958 remake of &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;.

Schneider starred in &quot;Christine&quot; (1958), a remake of Max Ophüls&#x27;s 1933 film &quot;Liebelei&quot; (in which her mother Magda Schneider had played the same role). It was during the filming of &quot;Christine&quot; that Schneider fell in love with French actor Alain Delon who co-starred in the film. She left West Germany to join him in Paris, and they announced their engagement in 1959.

Schneider decided to live and to work in France, slowly gaining the interest of film directors such as Orson Welles for &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962), based on Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;. She was also introduced to Luchino Visconti. Under Visconti&#x27;s direction, she gave performances in the Théâtre Moderne as Annabella (and Delon as Giovanni) in John Ford&#x27;s stage play &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (1961), and in the film &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (segment: &quot;The Job&quot;). In 1962, Schneider played Anna in Sacha Pitoëff&#x27;s production of Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;The Seagull&quot;, also at the Théâtre Moderne.

A brief stint in Hollywood included a starring role in &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964), a comedy with Jack Lemmon, and &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965), in which Schneider co-starred with Peter O&#x27;Toole, Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen.

In 1964, Delon broke up with Schneider to marry Nathalie Barthélémy as he got her pregnant, and they had a son together, Anthony Delon. Delon divorced Barthélémy in 1969, after which he kept pursuing Schneider, but she always refused to get back together. However, they remained close lifelong friends and continued to work together in such films as &quot;La Piscine&quot; (&quot;The Swimming Pool&quot;, 1968) and &quot;The Assassination of Trotsky&quot; (1972).

==Later career==

Schneider continued to work in France during the 1970s, most notably with director Claude Sautet on five films. Their first collaboration, &quot;The Things of Life&quot; (&quot;Les choses de la vie&quot;, 1970) featuring Michel Piccoli, made Schneider an icon in France. The three collaborated again for the noir thriller &quot;Max et les ferrailleurs&quot; (&quot;Max and the Junkmen&quot;, 1971), and she appeared with Yves Montand in Sautet&#x27;s &quot;César et Rosalie&quot; (1972).

Schneider portrayed a more mature and realistic Elisabeth of Austria in &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1973), Visconti&#x27;s film about the life of King Ludwig II of Bavaria.&quot;Sissi sticks to me just like oatmeal&quot;, Schneider once said.

&quot;Paris Match&quot; wrote in 1971: &quot;Forty years after Greta and Marlene, fifteen years after Marilyn, the screen again has a great star.&quot;

Other successes from this period included &quot;Le Train&quot; (1973), Claude Chabrol&#x27;s thriller &quot;Innocents with Dirty Hands&quot; (&quot;Les innocents aux mains sales&quot;, 1975) with Rod Steiger, and &quot;Le vieux fusil&quot; (1975). The gritty &quot;That Most Important Thing: Love&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;important c&#x27;est d&#x27;aimer&quot;, 1974) garnered her first César Award (France&#x27;s equivalent of the Oscar), a feat she repeated five years later, in her last collaboration with Sautet, for &quot;A Simple Story&quot; (&quot;Une histoire simple&quot;, 1978).

On 30 October 1974, Schneider was the second guest on Dietmar Schönherr&#x27;s talk show &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Later the Evening&quot;) when she, after a rather terse interview, remarked passionately to the last guest, bank robber and author Burkhard Driest: &quot;Sie gefallen mir. Sie gefallen mir sehr.&quot; (I like you. I like you a lot.)

, U.S. filmmaker Michael Cimino wanted Schneider to star as the female lead in his political love story &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. She would have starred alongside Roy Scheider and Oskar Werner. The film, however, was ultimately cancelled after several weeks of pre-production shooting because of &quot;political machinations&quot;.

She also acted in &quot;The Infernal Trio&quot; (1974) with Michel Piccoli, and in &quot;Garde à vue&quot; (1981) with Michel Serrault and Lino Ventura. An unpleasant incident occurred during this period with leading German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who wanted to cast her as the lead in his film &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979). Negotiations broke down when he called Schneider a &quot;dumb cow&quot;, to which she responded by declaring she would never work with such a &quot;beast&quot;. Fassbinder cast Hanna Schygulla instead, reviving his professional association with an actress to whom he had likewise been offensive.

Schneider starred in Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;Death Watch&quot; (&quot;La mort en direct&quot;, 1980), playing a dying woman whose last days are watched on national television via a camera implanted in the brain of a journalist (Harvey Keitel). It is based on David G. Compton&#x27;s novel. Schneider&#x27;s last film was &quot;La Passante du Sans-Souci&quot; (&quot;The Passerby&quot;, 1982).

==Personal life==
Following the end of her relationship with Delon in 1964, Schneider married German director and actor Harry Meyen in July 1966; they divorced in 1975. They had a son, David Christopher (1966–1981). David died in July 1981, at the age of 14, after attempting to climb the spiked fence at his stepfather&#x27;s parents&#x27; home and puncturing his femoral artery in the process. Schneider had affairs with Willy Brandt, Louis Malle (1963), Sammy Davis Jr. (1964), Oswalt Kolle (1964), Giovanni Volpi (1964–1970s), Luis Miguel Dominguín (1970s) and actor Bruno Ganz (early 1970s). She also had an affair with Jorge Guinle (1965), who said that Schneider was the great love of his life. She had a brief affair with Jean-Louis Trintignant while filming &quot;The Train&quot; (1973). She also had in 1974 a brief affair with Jacques Dutronc while filming &quot;That Most Important Thing: Love&quot;.

Schneider appeared as one of 28 women under the banner &quot;We&#x27;ve had abortions!&quot; () on the cover page of the West German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; on 6 June 1971. In that issue, 374 women publicly stated that they had had pregnancies terminated, which at that time was illegal.

In 1975, Schneider married , her private secretary; they divorced in 1981. Their daughter, Sarah, is an actress. Schneider’s last romantic partner was film producer (born 1949).

In her 2018 biography &quot;Romy Schneider intime&quot;, Alice Schwarzer stated that Schneider confided to her that she had sexual relationships with women and was deeply in love with her close friend Simone Signoret.

==Death==
Schneider was found dead in her Paris apartment on 29 May 1982. The examining magistrate declared that she had died from cardiac arrest. Claude Pétin said that Schneider&#x27;s cardiac arrest was due to a weakened heart caused by a kidney operation she had had months before. Schneider began drinking alcohol excessively after her son&#x27;s death. However, Schneider&#x27;s friend and sister-in-law of Laurent Pétin, Claude Pétin, said that she no longer drank at the time of her death and that she was convinced it was a natural death.

Her tombstone at Boissy-sans-Avoir, Yvelines, bears her birth name, Rosemarie Albach. Funeral guests were Jean-Claude Brialy, Michel Piccoli, Jean-Loup Dabadie and Jean Rochefort. Alain Delon arranged for her son David to be buried in the same grave.

==Enduring popularity==
The French journalist Eugène Moineau initiated in 1984 the Prix Romy Schneider. It is one of the most prestigious awards for upcoming actresses in the French film industry, and is given by a jury each year in Paris in conjunction with the Prix Patrick Dewaere (formerly the Prix Jean Gabin). In 1990, the Austrian newspaper &quot;Kurier&quot; created the Romy TV Award in honour of Schneider. In 2003, she was voted 78th on the list of the greatest Germans in the German TV program Unsere Besten (the German version of 100 Greatest Britons)—the second-highest ranked actress (Marlene Dietrich was 50th) on that list. Until 2002, the Austrian Federal Railways InterCity service IC 535 from Wien Südbahnhof to Graz was named &quot;Romy Schneider&quot;.

Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s film &quot;All About My Mother&quot; (1999) is partially dedicated to her.

A movie about Schneider&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Eine Frau wie Romy/Une femme comme Romy&quot; (&quot;A Woman Like Romy&quot;), was planned by Warner Bros. for 2009; Schneider&#x27;s role was going to be played by Yvonne Catterfeld. The project was cancelled in July 2009. A musical about Schneider, &quot;Romy – Die Welt aus Gold&quot; (&quot;Romy – The Golden World&quot;) was premiered in 2009 at the Theater Heilbronn. In November 2009, the ARD broadcast the feature film &quot;&quot; with Jessica Schwarz in the title role. The film &quot;3 Days in Quiberon&quot; (2018) by Emily Atef describes a 1981 episode in Schneider&#x27;s life in the French town of Quiberon.

On 23 September 2020, Google celebrated her 82nd birthday with a Google Doodle in Germany, France, Austria, Iceland and Ukraine.

The culture broadcaster Arte dedicated a documentary to Romy Schneider and Alain Delon: &quot;Romy and Alain – The Eternal Betrothed&quot;, 2022.

<text>&quot;What the Tortoise Said to Achilles&quot;, written by Lewis Carroll in 1895 for the philosophical journal &quot;Mind&quot;, is a brief allegorical dialogue on the foundations of logic. The title alludes to one of Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes of motion, in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll&#x27;s dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an infinite regression.

==Summary of the dialogue==
The discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:
* &quot;A&quot;: &quot;Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other&quot; (a Euclidean relation)
* &quot;B&quot;: &quot;The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same&quot;
* Therefore, &quot;Z&quot;: &quot;The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other&quot;

The tortoise accepts premises &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as true but not the hypothetical:
* &quot;C&quot;: &quot;If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are true, &quot;Z&quot; must be true&quot;

The Tortoise claims that it is not &quot;under any logical necessity to accept &quot;Z&quot; as true&quot;. The tortoise then challenges Achilles to force it logically to accept &quot;Z&quot; as true. Instead of searching the tortoise’s reasons for not accepting &quot;C&quot;, Achilles asks it to accept &quot;C&quot;, which it does. After which, Achilles says:
* &quot;D&quot;: &quot;If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are true, &quot;Z&quot; must be true&quot;

The tortoise responds, &quot;That&#x27;s another Hypothetical, isn&#x27;t it? And, if I failed to see its truth, I might accept A and B and C, and still not accept Z, mightn&#x27;t I?&quot;

Again, instead of requesting reasons for not accepting &quot;D&quot;, he asks the tortoise to accept &quot;D&quot;. And again, it is &quot;quite willing to grant it&quot;, but it still refuses to accept Z. It then tells Achilles to write into his book,

* &quot;E:&quot; If A and B and C and D are true, Z must be true.

Following this, the Tortoise says: &quot;until I’ve granted that [i.e., &quot;E&quot;], of course I needn’t grant Z. So it&#x27;s quite a necessary step&quot;. With a touch of sadness, Achilles sees the point.

The story ends by suggesting that the list of premises continues to grow without end, but without explaining the point of the regress.
==Explanation==

Lewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from &quot;modus ponens&quot; deductions. 
:formula_1
Or, in words: proposition &quot;P&quot; (is true) implies &quot;Q&quot; (is true), and given &quot;P&quot;, therefore &quot;Q&quot;.

The regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here &quot;modus ponens&quot;, and once &quot;that&quot; principle is explained, &quot;another&quot; principle is required to explain &quot;that&quot; principle. Thus, if the argumentative chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced whereby &quot;modus ponens&quot; is simply a rule of inference defined within the system, then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system. That is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules (consider, for example, the constructivist&#x27;s rejection of the law of the excluded middle and the dialetheist&#x27;s rejection of the law of noncontradiction). In this way, formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress: &quot;modus ponens&quot; is placed as a rule within the system, the validity of &quot;modus ponens&quot; is eschewed without the system.

In propositional logic, the logical implication is defined as follows:

P implies Q if and only if the proposition &quot;not P or Q&quot; is a tautology.

Hence &quot;modus ponens&quot;, [P ∧ (P → Q)] ⇒ Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.

In addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.

Some logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the conditional connective and the implication relation. These logicians use the phrase &quot;not p or q&quot; for the conditional connective and the term &quot;implies&quot; for an asserted implication relation.

==Discussion==
Several philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll&#x27;s paradox. Bertrand Russell discussed the paradox briefly in § 38 of &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903), distinguishing between &quot;implication&quot; (associated with the form &quot;if &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;q&quot;), which he held to be a relation between &quot;unasserted&quot; propositions, and &quot;inference&quot; (associated with the form &quot;p&quot;, therefore &quot;q&quot;&quot;), which he held to be a relation between &quot;asserted&quot; propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise&#x27;s attempt to treat &quot;inferring&quot; &quot;Z&quot; from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the &quot;hypothetical&quot; &quot;If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are true, then &quot;Z&quot; is true.&quot;

Peter Winch, a Wittgensteinian philosopher, discussed the paradox in &quot;The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy&quot; (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that &quot;the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning &quot;to do&quot; something&quot; (p. 57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper &quot;application&quot; of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of &quot;further&quot; rules, and so that &quot;a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts&quot; (p. 53).

Carroll&#x27;s dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to conventionalism about logical truth, later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by W.V.O. Quine.

<text>Peter Dennis Blandford Townshend (; born 19 May 1945) is an English musician. He is the co-founder, guitarist, second lead vocalist, principal songwriter and leader of the Who, one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s. His aggressive playing style and poetic songwriting techniques, with the Who and in other projects, have earned him critical acclaim.

Townshend has written more than 100 songs for 12 of the Who&#x27;s studio albums. These include concept albums, the rock operas &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1973), plus popular rock radio staples such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971); as well as dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and tracks on rarities compilation albums such as &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot; (1974). He has also written more than 100 songs that have appeared on his solo albums, as well as radio jingles and television theme songs.

While known primarily as a guitarist, Townshend also plays keyboards, banjo, accordion, harmonica, ukulele, mandolin, violin, synthesiser, bass guitar, and drums; he is self-taught on all of these instruments and plays on his own solo albums, several Who albums, and as a guest contributor to an array of other artists&#x27; recordings. Townshend has also contributed to and authored many newspaper and magazine articles, book reviews, essays, books, and scripts, and he has collaborated as a lyricist and composer for many other musical acts.

In 1983, Townshend received the Brit Award for Lifetime Achievement and in 1990 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Who. Townshend was ranked No. 3 in Dave Marsh&#x27;s 1994 list of Best Guitarists in &quot;The New Book of Rock Lists&quot;. In 2001, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of the Who; and in 2008 he received Kennedy Center Honors. He was ranked No. 10 in Gibson.com&#x27;s 2011 list of the top 50 guitarists, and No. 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2023 list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time. He and Roger Daltrey received The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016.

== Early life and education ==
Townshend was born in Chiswick, West London, at the Chiswick Hospital, Netheravon Road, in the UK. He came from a musical family: his father, Cliff Townshend, was a professional alto saxophonist in the Royal Air Force&#x27;s dance band the Squadronaires and his mother, Betty (née Dennis), was a singer with the Sidney Torch and Les Douglass Orchestras.

The Townshends had a volatile marriage. Both drank heavily and had fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis, whom Pete later described as &quot;clinically insane&quot;, later citing this experience as having unknowingly influenced the plot of &quot;Tommy&quot;. The two-year separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middle-class Acton, and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents. His neighbourhood was one-third Polish, and a devout Jewish family upstairs shared their housing with them and cooking with them—many of his father&#x27;s closest friends were Jewish.

Townshend says he did not have many friends growing up, so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. He enjoyed his family&#x27;s frequent excursions to the seaside and the Isle of Man. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, sparking his fascination with American rock and roll.

Not long thereafter, he went to see Bill Haley perform in London, Townshend&#x27;s first concert. At the time, he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician; instead, he wanted to become a journalist.

Upon passing the eleven-plus exam, Townshend was enrolled at Acton County Grammar School. At Acton County, he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught him a couple of chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a short-lived trad jazz group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, and Lonnie Donegan. However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richard&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Move It&quot;. Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group&#x27;s drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a &quot;reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar&quot; at his mother&#x27;s antique shop.

Townshend&#x27;s brothers Paul and Simon were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively. Lacking the requisite grades to attend university, Townshend was faced with the decision of art school, music school, or getting a job. He ultimately chose to study graphic design at Ealing Art College, enrolling in 1961. At Ealing, Townshend studied alongside future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. Townshend dropped out in 1964 to focus on music full-time.

== Musical career ==
=== 1961–1964: the Detours ===
In late 1961, Entwistle joined the Detours, a skiffle/rock and roll band, led by Roger Daltrey. The new bass player then suggested Townshend join as an additional guitarist. In the early days of the Detours, the band&#x27;s repertoire consisted of instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their lineup coalesced around Roger Daltrey on rhythm guitar, Townshend on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Doug Sandom on drums, and Colin Dawson as vocalist. Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and, according to Townshend, &quot;ran things the way he wanted them.&quot;

Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey, who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result, Townshend, with Entwistle&#x27;s encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend&#x27;s mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce, who started booking the band as a support act for bands including Screaming Lord Sutch, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. In 1963, Townshend&#x27;s father arranged an amateur recording of &quot;It Was You&quot;, the first song his son ever wrote. The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name. Townshend&#x27;s roommate Richard Barnes came up with &quot;The Who&quot;, and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.

=== 1964–1982: The Who ===
Not long after the name change, drummer Doug Sandom was replaced by Keith Moon, who had been drumming semi-professionally with the Beachcombers for several years. The band was soon taken on by a mod publicist named Peter Meaden who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single (&quot;I&#x27;m the Face/Zoot Suit&quot;), they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers, Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert, who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them. The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best, and dropped the High Numbers name, reverting to the Who. In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern, Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument. The on-stage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Who&#x27;s live shows.

With the assistance of Lambert, the Who caught the ear of American record producer Shel Talmy, who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, as a deliberate sound-alike of the Kinks, another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; was the Who&#x27;s first hit, reaching number eight on the British charts. A follow-up single (&quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot;), credited to both Townshend and Daltrey, also reached the top 10 in the UK. However, it was the release of the Who&#x27;s third single, &quot;My Generation&quot;, in November that, according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson, &quot;cemented their reputation as a hard-nosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissed-off adolescents at the time.&quot; The Townshend-penned single reached number two on the UK charts, becoming the Who&#x27;s biggest hit. The song and its famous line &quot;I hope I die before I get old&quot; was &quot;very much about trying to find a place in society&quot;, Townshend stated in an interview with David Fricke.

To capitalise on their recent single success, the Who&#x27;s debut album &quot;My Generation&quot; (&quot;The Who Sings My Generation&quot; in the US) was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several James Brown covers that Daltrey favoured. Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band, including &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot;, and &quot;Happy Jack&quot;. Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album, which became &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;. The album was subsequently titled &quot;A Quick One&quot; and reached No. 4 in the charts upon its release in December 1966. In their stage shows, Townshend developed a guitar stunt in which he would swing his right arm against the guitar strings in a style reminiscent of the vanes of a windmill. He developed this style after watching Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards warm up before a show.
The Who commenced their first US tour on 22 March 1967. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites, though not to the extent of his bandmate Moon. He also began experimenting with LSD, though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the Monterey Pop Festival on 18 June. Released in December, their next album was &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;—a concept album based on pirate radio, which had been instrumental in raising the Who&#x27;s popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, and the Who&#x27;s biggest US single, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;. Despite the success of &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, which reached No. 9 on the American charts, Townshend was surprised it was not an even bigger hit, as he considered it the best song he had written up to that point.

By 1968, Townshend became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. He began to develop a musical piece about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy who would experience sensations musically. The piece would explore the tenets of Baba&#x27;s philosophy. The result was the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, released on 23 May 1969 to critical and commercial success. In support of &quot;Tommy&quot;, the Who launched a tour that included a memorable appearance at the Woodstock Festival on 17 August. While the Who were playing, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman jumped the stage to complain about the arrest of John Sinclair. Townshend promptly knocked him offstage with his guitar, shouting, &quot;Fuck off my fucking stage!&quot;

In 1970, the Who released &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, which several music critics cite as the best live album of all time. Townshend began writing material for another rock opera. Dubbed &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, it was designed to be a multi-media project that symbolised the relationship between a musician and his audience. The rest of the band were confused by its convoluted plot and simply wanted another album. Townshend began to feel alienated, and the project was abandoned after he suffered a nervous breakdown. Much of the material intended for &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was released as a traditional studio album, &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. It became a commercial smash, reaching number one in the UK, and spawned two successful hit singles, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, that featured pioneering use of the synthesizer. &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; in particular was written as Townshend&#x27;s ode to his two heroes at the time, Meher Baba and composer Terry Riley.
Townshend began writing songs for another rock opera in 1973. He decided it would explore the mod subculture and its clashes with rockers in the early 1960s in the UK. Entitled &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, it was the only Who album written entirely by Townshend, and he produced the album as well due to the souring of relations with Lambert. It was released in November, and became their highest charting cross-Atlantic success, reaching No. 2 in the UK and US. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Charles Shaar Murray called it &quot;prime cut Who&quot; and &quot;the most rewarding musical experience of the year.&quot; On tour, the band played the album along to pre-recorded backing tapes, causing much friction. The tapes malfunctioned during a performance in Newcastle, prompting Townshend to drag soundman Bob Pridden onstage, scream at him and kick over all the amplifiers, partially destroying the malfunctioning tapes. On 14 April 1974, Townshend played his first solo concert, a benefit to raise funds for a London community centre.

A film version of &quot;Tommy&quot; was directed by Ken Russell, and starred Roger Daltrey in the title role, Ann-Margret as his mother, and Oliver Reed as his step-father, with cameos by Tina Turner, Elton John, Eric Clapton, and other rock notables; the film premiered on 18 March 1975. Townshend was nominated for an Academy Award for scoring and adapting the music in the film. &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; came out in November of that year and peaked at No. 7 in the UK and 8 in the US. It featured introspective songs, often with a negative slant. The album spawned one hit single, &quot;Squeeze Box&quot;, that was written after Townshend learned how to play the accordion. After a 1976 tour, Townshend took a year-long break from the band to focus on spending time with his family.

The Who continues despite the deaths of two of the original members (Keith Moon in 1978 and John Entwistle in 2002). The band is regarded by many rock critics as one of the best live bands from the 1960s to the 2000s. The Who continues to perform critically acclaimed sets into the 21st century, including highly regarded performances at The Concert for New York City in 2001, the 2004 Isle of Wight Festival, Live 8 in 2005, and the 2007 and 2015 Glastonbury Festival.

Townshend remained the primary songwriter and leader of the group, writing over 100 songs which appeared on the band&#x27;s eleven studio albums. Among his creations is the rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. Townshend revisited album-length storytelling throughout his career and remains associated with the rock opera form. Many studio recordings also feature Townshend on piano or keyboards, though keyboard-heavy tracks increasingly featured guest artists in the studio, such as Nicky Hopkins, John Bundrick, or Chris Stainton.

Townshend is one of the key figures in the development of feedback in rock guitar. When asked who first used feedback, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said:

Similarly, when Jimmy Page was asked about the development of guitar feedback, he said:

Many rock guitarists have cited Townshend as an influence, among them Slash, Alex Lifeson, and Steve Jones.

=== 1972–present: solo career ===
In addition to his work with the Who, Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend, along with other devotees to Meher Baba, recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings: &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, &quot;I Am&quot;, and &quot;With Love&quot;. In response to bootlegging of these, he compiled his personal highlights (and &quot;Evolution&quot;, a collaboration with Ronnie Lane), and released his first major-label solo title, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Who Came First&quot;. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs as well as a showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with the Faces&#x27; bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album (1977&#x27;s &quot;Rough Mix&quot;). In 1979 Townshend produced and performed guitar on the novelty single &quot;Peppermint Lump&quot; by Angie on Stiff Records, featuring 11-year-old Angela Porter on lead vocals.

Townshend made several solo appearances during the 1970s, two of which were captured on record: Eric Clapton&#x27;s Rainbow Concert in January 1973 (which Townshend organized to revive Clapton&#x27;s career after the latter&#x27;s heroin addiction), and the Paul McCartney-sponsored Concerts for the People of Kampuchea in December 1979. The commercially available video of the Kampuchea concert shows the two rock icons duelling and clowning through Rockestra mega-band versions of &quot;Lucille&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;; Townshend closes the proceedings with a characteristic split-legged leap.

Townshend&#x27;s solo breakthrough, following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon, was the 1980 release &quot;Empty Glass&quot;, which included the top-10 single &quot;Let My Love Open the Door&quot;, and lesser singles &quot;A Little Is Enough&quot; and &quot;Rough Boys&quot;. This release was followed in 1982 by &quot;All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes&quot;, which included the popular radio track &quot;Slit Skirts&quot;. While not a huge commercial success, music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as &quot;Townshend&#x27;s most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia.&quot; Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats, releasing several story-based albums including &quot;White City: A Novel&quot; (1985), &quot;The Iron Man: A Musical&quot; (1989), and &quot;Psychoderelict&quot; (1993). Townshend also got the chance to play with his hero Hank Marvin for Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Rockestra&quot; sessions, along with other rock musicians such as David Gilmour, John Bonham, and Ronnie Lane.

Townshend recorded several concert albums, including one featuring a supergroup he assembled called Deep End, with David Gilmour on guitar, who performed just three concerts and a television show session for &quot;The Tube&quot;, to raise money for his Double-O charity, supporting drug addicts. In 1993, he and Des McAnuff wrote and directed the Broadway adaptation of the Who album &quot;Tommy&quot;, as well as a less successful stage musical based on his solo album &quot;The Iron Man&quot;, based upon the book by Ted Hughes. McAnuff and Townshend later co-produced the animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, also based on the Hughes story.

A production described as a Townshend rock opera and titled &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot; debuted as part of Vassar College&#x27;s Powerhouse Summer Theater program in July 2007.

On 2 September 2017 at Tanglewood in Lenox, Massachusetts, Townshend embarked with fellow singer and musician Billy Idol, tenor Alfie Boe, and an orchestra on a short (5-date) &quot;Classic Quadrophenia&quot; US tour that ended on 16 September 2017 in Los Angeles, California.

=== 1996–present: latest Who work ===
From the mid-1990s through the present, Townshend has participated in a series of tours with the surviving members of the Who, including a 2002 tour that continued despite Entwistle&#x27;s death.

In February 2006, a major world tour by the Who was announced to promote their first new album since 1982. Townshend published a semi-autobiographical story &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot; as a serial on a blog beginning in September 2005. The blog closed in October 2006, as noted on Townshend&#x27;s website. It is now owned by a different user and does not relate to Townshend&#x27;s work in any way. On 25 February 2006, he announced the issue of a mini-opera inspired by the novella for June 2006. In October 2006 the Who released their first album in 24 years, &quot;Endless Wire&quot;.

The Who performed at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show on 7 February 2010, playing a medley of songs that included &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Who Are You&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;, and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. In 2012, the Who announced they would tour the rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

The Who were the final performers at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, performing a medley of &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;, and &quot;My Generation&quot;.

On 22 March 2018, Townshend stated that a new Who album should feature original songs by Roger Daltrey as well as him. That album, simply titled &quot;Who,&quot; was released on 6 December 2019. It was the band&#x27;s second album as a duo, and their first in thirteen years.

=== Unfinished work ===
&quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;, formerly &quot;Floss the Musical&quot;, is the name given to a work-in-progress by Townshend. The musical has been a work in progress at least since 2009 with an original estimated release of 2011. On 24 January 2012 Townshend sold the rights to all of his back catalog and much of his future work including &quot;Floss The Musical&quot; if it is ever completed. He summarized the work in an interview with Sirius Satellite Radio published February 2010. In a 2015 interview Townshend stated that the work was intended to be an art installation. In March 2019 it was announced that a work entitled &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot; would be published as a novel, with an opera to follow.

== Musical influences ==
Townshend was born ten days after Nazi Germany surrendered in the Second World War and grew up in the shadow of reconstruction in and around London. According to Townshend, postwar trauma was the driving force behind the rock music revolution in the UK. &quot;Trauma is passed from generation to generation&quot;, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve unwittingly inherited what my father experienced.&quot; Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life. In his autobiography, he wrote: 

Although he grew up in a household with jazz musicians, Townshend absorbed many of his ideas about performance and rock music themes during art school. Townshend&#x27;s roommate at Ealing Art College, Tom Wright, had a large record collection, and Townshend listened to and became influenced by R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll artists like Howlin&#x27; Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Bo Diddley, Booker T. &amp; the MGs, Little Walter, and Chuck Berry. He was also strongly influenced by cellist Malcolm Cecil, who often damaged his cello during performances, along with Gustav Metzger, pioneer of auto-destructive art. In light of these influences, guitar smashing became not just an expression of youthful angst, but also a means of conveying ideas through musical performance. &quot;We advanced a new concept&quot;, he writes. &quot;Destruction is art when set to music.&quot; Townshend also cited Robbie Basho as a significant influence, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve totally been influenced by him. You can hear it in my work.&quot;

== Equipment ==

=== Guitars ===

Throughout his solo career and his career with the Who, Townshend has played a large variety of guitars—mostly various Fender, Gibson, and Rickenbacker models. He has also used Guild, Takamine and Gibson J-200 acoustic models, with the J-200 providing his signature recorded acoustic sound in such songs as &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;.

In the early days with the Who, Townshend played an Emile Grimshaw SS De Luxe and 6-string and 12-string Rickenbacker semi-hollow electric guitars primarily (particularly the Rose-Morris UK-imported models with special f-holes). When the excited audience responded enthusiastically after he accidentally broke the head off his guitar on a low ceiling during a concert at the Railway Hotel pub in Wealdstone, west London, he incorporated the eventual smashing of his instrument into the band&#x27;s performances. However, as instrument-smashing became increasingly integrated into the Who&#x27;s concert sets, he switched to more durable and resilient (and, importantly, cheaper) guitars for smashing, such as the Fender Stratocaster, Fender Telecaster and various Danelectro models. On the Who&#x27;s &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; appearance in 1967, Townshend used a Vox Cheetah guitar, which he only used for that performance; the guitar was destroyed by Townshend and Moon&#x27;s drum explosion. In the late 1960s, Townshend began playing Gibson SG Special models almost exclusively. He used this guitar at the Woodstock and Isle of Wight shows in 1969 and 1970, as well as the &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; performance in 1970.

By 1970 Gibson changed the design of the SG Special that Townshend had been using previously, and he began using other guitars. For much of the 1970s, he used a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe, some with only two mini-humbucker pick-ups and others modified with a third pick-up in the &quot;middle position&quot; (a DiMarzio Superdistortion / Dual Sound). He can be seen using several of these guitars in the documentary &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, although in the studio he often played a &#x27;59 Gretsch 6120 guitar (given to him by Joe Walsh), most notably on the albums &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

During the 1980s, Townshend mainly used Fenders, Rickenbackers and Telecaster-style models built for him by Schecter and various other luthiers. Since the late-1980s, Townshend has used the Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster, with Lace Sensor pick-ups, both in the studio and on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pick-up system to simulate acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra volume control behind the guitar&#x27;s bridge.

During the Who&#x27;s 1989 Tour Townshend played a Rickenbacker guitar that was ironically smashed accidentally when he tripped over it. Instead of throwing the smashed parts away, Townshend reassembled the pieces as a sculpture. The sculpture was featured at the &quot;Rock Stars, Cars And Guitars 2&quot; exhibit during the summer of 2009 at The Henry Ford museum.

There are several Gibson Pete Townshend signature guitars, such as the Pete Townshend SG, the Pete Townshend J-200, and three different Pete Townshend Les Paul Deluxes. The SG was clearly marked as a Pete Townshend limited edition model and came with a special case and certificate of authenticity, signed by Townshend himself. There was a Pete Townshend signature Rickenbacker limited edition guitar of the model 1998, which was his main 6-string guitar in the Who&#x27;s early days. The run featured 250 guitars that were made between July 1987–March 1988, and according to Rickenbacker CEO John Hall, the entire run sold out before serious advertising could be done.

He also used the Gibson ES-335, one of which he donated to the Hard Rock Cafe. Townshend also used a Gibson EDS-1275 double-neck very briefly circa late 1967, and both a Harmony Sovereign H1270 and a Fender Electric XII for the studio sessions for &quot;Tommy&quot; for the 12-string guitar parts. He also occasionally used Fender Jazzmasters on stage in 1967 and 1968 and in the studio for &quot;Tommy&quot;.

=== Amps ===
Over the years, Townshend has used many types of amplifier, including Vox, Selmer, Fender, Marshall, and Hiwatt, sticking to using Hiwatt amps for most of four decades. Around the time of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, he used a tweed Fender Bandmaster amp (also given to him by Joe Walsh in 1970), which he also used for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; and &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot;. While recording &quot;Face Dances&quot; and the collaborative album &quot;Rough Mix&quot;, Townshend made use of a Peavey Vintage 4×10 amplifier in the studio. Since 1989, his rig consisted of four Fender Vibro-King stacks and a Hiwatt head driving two custom made 2×12&quot; Hiwatt/Mesa Boogie speaker cabinets. However, since 2006, he has only three Vibro-King stacks, one of which is a backup.

Townshend figured prominently in the development of what is widely known in rock circles as the &quot;Marshall stack&quot;. He ordered several speaker cabinets that contained eight 12&quot; speakers in a housing standing nearly six feet in height with the top half of the cabinet slanted slightly upward. These were too heavy to move easily, so Jim Marshall cut the massive speaker cabinet in half, at the suggestion of Townshend, with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born, and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.

He has always regarded his instruments as being merely tools of the trade and has, in latter years, kept his most prized instruments well away from the concert stage. These instruments include a few vintage and reissue Rickenbackers, the Gretsch 6120, an original 1952 Fender Telecaster, Gibson Custom Shop&#x27;s artist limited edition reissues of Townshend&#x27;s Les Paul DeLuxe models 1, 3 and 9 as well his signature SG Special reissue.

=== Keyboards ===
Townshend played keyboards on several Who songs. On &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, he began to work with analogue synthesizers, using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He had this to say about the instrument: &quot;I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren&#x27;t in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you&#x27;re stuck with as fast as you can play and I don&#x27;t play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth.&quot;

The synths Townshend was referring to included the EMS VCS3 and ARP 2600, some of which modified a Lowrey TBO Berkshire organ. Current photos of his home studio also show an ARP 2500. Townshend was featured in ARP promotional materials in the early 1970s.

Since the late 1980s Townshend has predominantly used Synclavier Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition, particularly solo albums and projects.

Although known for his musical compositions and musicianship, Townshend has been extensively involved in the literary world for more than three decades, writing newspaper and magazine articles, book reviews, essays, books, and scripts.

An early example of Townshend&#x27;s writing came in August 1970 with the first of nine installments of &quot;The Pete Townshend Page&quot;, a monthly column written by Townshend for the British music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The column provided Townshend&#x27;s perspective on an array of subjects, such as the media and the state of US concert halls and public address systems, as well as providing valuable insight into Townshend&#x27;s mindset during the evolution of his &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.

Townshend also wrote three sizeable essays for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the first of which appeared in November 1970. &quot;In Love With Meher Baba&quot; described Townshend&#x27;s spiritual leanings. &quot;Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy&quot;, a blow-by-blow account of the Who compilation album of the same name, followed in December 1971. The third article, &quot;The Punk Meets the Godmother&quot;, appeared in November 1977.

Also in 1977, Townshend founded Eel Pie Publishing, which specialised in children&#x27;s titles, music books, and several Meher Baba-related publications. He also opened a bookstore named Magic Bus (after the popular Who song) in London. &quot;The Story of Tommy&quot;, a book written by Townshend and his art school friend Richard Barnes (now the Who&#x27;s official biographer) about the writing of Townshend&#x27;s 1969 rock opera and the making of the 1975 Ken Russell-directed film, was published by Eel Pie the same year.

In July 1983, Townshend took a position as an acquisitions editor for London publisher Faber and Faber. Notable projects included editing Animals frontman Eric Burdon&#x27;s autobiography, Charles Shaar Murray&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Crosstown Traffic: Jimi Hendrix and Post-War Pop&quot;, Brian Eno and Russell Mills&#x27;s &quot;More Dark Than Shark&quot;, and working with Prince Charles on a volume of his collected speeches. Townshend commissioned Dave Rimmer&#x27;s &quot;Like Punk Never Happened&quot;, and was commissioning editor for radical playwright Steven Berkoff.

Two years after joining Faber and Faber, Townshend decided to publish a book of his own. &quot;Horse&#x27;s Neck&quot;, issued in May 1985, was a collection of short stories he&#x27;d written between 1979 and 1984, tackling subjects such as childhood, stardom and spirituality. As a result of his position with Faber and Faber, Townshend developed friendships with both Nobel prize-winning author of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; Sir William Golding and British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes. His friendship with Hughes led to Townshend&#x27;s musical interpretation of Hughes&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Iron Man&quot;, six years later, as &quot;The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend&quot;, released in 1989.

Townshend has written several scripts spanning the breadth of his career, including numerous drafts of his elusive &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, the last of which, co-written with radio playwright Jeff Young, was published in 1999. In 1978, Townshend wrote a script for &quot;Fish Shop&quot;, a play commissioned but not completed by London Weekend Television, and in mid-1984 he wrote a script for &quot;White City: A Novel&quot; which led to a short film.

In 1989 Townshend began work on a novel titled &quot;Ray High &amp; The Glass Household&quot;, a draft of which was later submitted to his editor. While the original novel remains unpublished, elements from this story were used in Townshend&#x27;s 1993 solo album &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;. In 1993, Townshend authored another book, &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;, a chronicle of the development of the award-winning Broadway version of his rock opera.

The opening of his personal website and his commerce site Eelpie.com, both in 2000, gave Townshend another outlet for literary work. (Eelpie.com was closed down in 2010.) Several of Townshend&#x27;s essays have been posted online, including &quot;Meher Baba—The Silent Master: My Own Silence&quot; in 2001, and &quot;A &quot;Different&quot; Bomb&quot;, an indictment of the child pornography industry, the following year.

In September 2005, Townshend began posting a novella online entitled &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot; as background for a musical of the same name. He posted a chapter each week until it was completed, and novella was available to read at his website for several months. Like &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;, it was yet another extrapolation of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; and &quot;Ray High &amp; The Glass Household&quot;.

In 1997 Townshend signed a deal with Little, Brown and Company publishing to write his autobiography, reportedly titled &quot;Pete Townshend: Who He?&quot; Townshend&#x27;s creative vagaries and conceptual machinations have been chronicled by Larry David Smith in his book &quot;The Minstrel&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (Praeger 1999). After a lengthy delay, Townshend&#x27;s autobiography, now titled &quot;Who I Am&quot;, was released 8 October 2012. The book ranked in the top 5 of &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list in October 2012.

On 5 March 2019, Townshend announced that his debut novel, titled &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;, would be published on 5 November 2019 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton imprint Coronet. Townshend called the work an &quot;extended meditation on manic genius and the dark art of creativity.&quot; The novel will be accompanied by an opera, which is currently in development, with an art installation to follow.

== Spirituality ==
In 1967 Townshend had begun to explore spirituality. Townshend swiftly absorbed all of Meher Baba&#x27;s writings that he could find; by April 1968, he announced himself Baba&#x27;s disciple. At about this time, Townshend, who had been searching the past two years for a basis for a rock opera, created a story inspired by the teachings of Baba and other writings and expressing the enlightenment he believed that he had received from them, which ultimately became &quot;Tommy&quot;.

In interviews Townshend was more open about his beliefs, penning an article on Baba for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1970 and stating that following Baba&#x27;s teachings, he was opposed to the use of all psychedelic drugs, making him one of the first rock stars with counterculture credibility to turn against their use. This did not prevent him from later indulging in substance abuse. He wrote in &quot;Who I Am&quot; of becoming addicted to cocaine in 1980-1981, to the point of overdosing and needing resuscitation. He also wrote that by January 1982, &quot;I needed help to break my dependence on prescription drugs and heroin.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Townshend met Karen Astley, daughter of film composer Edwin Astley, while in art school. They married on 20 May 1968 and moved into a three-bedroom townhouse in Twickenham in outer south-west London that overlooked the Thames. They have three children: Emma (born 1969), who is a gardening columnist, Aminta (born 1971), who works in film production, and Joseph (born 1989), who studied graphic design at Central St. Martins.

Townshend and his wife separated in 1994. He has since been in a romantic relationship with arranger and musician Rachel Fuller, whom he secretly married in 2016. Townshend lived at The Wick, Richmond, London, England, but sold the house in August 2021 for more than £15 million. He also owns a house in Churt, Surrey, and in 2010 purchased a lease of part of the National Trust property Ashdown House in Oxfordshire. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List his assets were worth £40 million as of 2009.

=== Sexuality ===
In a 1989 interview with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song &quot;Rough Boys&quot; on his 1980 studio album &quot;Empty Glass&quot;. He called the song a &quot;coming out, an acknowledgment of the fact that I&#x27;d had a gay life, and that I understood what gay sex was about.&quot; In a 1994 interview for &quot;Playboy&quot;, he said, &quot;I did an interview about it, saying that &#x27;Rough Boys&#x27; was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my &#x27;gay life&#x27;, which—I meant—was actually about the friends I&#x27;ve had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t&#x27;s and crossed the i&#x27;s and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn&#x27;t at all.&quot; Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography &quot;Who I Am&quot; that he is &quot;probably bisexual&quot;. Townshend also stated that he once felt sexually attracted to the Rolling Stones&#x27; lead vocalist, Mick Jagger.

=== Legal issues ===

Townshend accepted a caution from the Metropolitan Police (the Met) as part of Operation Ore, a major investigation on child sexual abuse images conducted in 2002–2003. The Met stated that &quot;it was established that Mr Townshend was not in possession of any downloaded child abuse images&quot;. Townshend was on a sex offenders register for five years, beginning in 2003, after admitting he had used his credit card to access a child sexual abuse images website. Townshend said he accessed the images as research in a campaign against child sexual abuse—specifically, to prove that British banks were complicit in channelling the profits from paedophile rings. Authorities could not prove that the website accessed by Townshend involved children, and no incriminating evidence was found on his personal computer.

=== Hearing loss ===
Townshend suffers from partial deafness and tinnitus, likely the result of noise-induced hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud music. The Who were known as a very loud band in their live performances; for example, a Who concert at the Charlton Athletic Football Club on 31 May 1976—where the volume level 32 metres from the stage was measured at 126 decibels—was listed as the &quot;Loudest Concert Ever&quot; by the Guinness Book of Records. Townshend has also attributed his hearing loss to the explosion of Keith Moon&#x27;s drum set during a 1967 Who appearance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

In 1989, Townshend gave the initial funding to allow the formation of the non-profit hearing advocacy group H.E.A.R. (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers). After the Who performed at half-time at Super Bowl XLIV in 2010, Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;If my hearing is going to be a problem, we&#x27;re not delaying shows. We&#x27;re &quot;finished&quot;. I can&#x27;t really see any way around the issue.&quot; Neil Young introduced him to an audiologist who suggested he use an in-ear monitor, and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule, Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the Who.

In March 2011, Roger Daltrey said in an interview with the BBC that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but severe hearing loss and was trying to save what remained of his hearing: &quot;Pete&#x27;s having terrible trouble with his hearing. He&#x27;s got really, really bad problems with it...not tinnitus, it&#x27;s deterioration and he&#x27;s seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing&quot;.

Referring to that, in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog: &quot;My hearing is actually better than ever because after a feedback scare at the indigO2 in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies that are out of my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage, proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for TCT at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010. I&#x27;m 66, I don&#x27;t have perfect hearing, and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus&quot;.

=== Political views ===
In 1998, Townshend was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the UK Labour Party. He refused to let Michael Moore use &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; (2004), saying that he watched &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; (2002) and was not convinced. In 1961 while in art school, Townshend joined the Young Communist League and was a prominent figure in their 1966 &quot;Trend&quot; recruitment campaign. In a 1974 &quot;Penthouse&quot; interview he stated that he recognised in practice he was a capitalist who was rewarded well for his work, but that his ideals were communist.

In a widely reported 2012 interview with ABC, Townshend described himself jokingly as being &quot;a bit of a neocon&quot; stating that, &quot;I like the idea of America as the world&#x27;s police force. Then we don&#x27;t have to do it. You guys sort it out.&quot;

In a 2019 interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Townshend revealed he was in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m a Remainer, he [Roger Daltrey] is a Brexiteer. I believe in God, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

== Charity work ==

Townshend has woven a long history of involvement with various charities and other philanthropic efforts throughout his career, both as a solo artist and with the Who. His first solo concert, for example, was a 1974 benefit show which was organised to raise funds for the Camden Square Community Play Centre.

The earliest public example of Townshend&#x27;s involvement with charitable causes was in 1968, when Townshend donated the use of his former Wardour Street apartment to the Meher Baba Association. The following year, the association was moved to another Townshend-owned apartment, the Eccleston Square former residence of his wife Karen. Townshend sat on a committee that oversaw the operation and finances of the centre. &quot;The committee sees to it that it is open a couple of days a week, and keeps the bills paid and the library full&quot;, he wrote in a 1970 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article.

In 1969 and 1972, Townshend produced two limited-release albums, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and &quot;I Am&quot;, for the London-based Baba association. This led to 1972&#x27;s &quot;Who Came First&quot;, a more widespread release, 15 per cent of the revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release, &quot;With Love&quot;, was released in 1976. A limited-edition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD, &quot;Avatar&quot;, was released in 2000, with all profits going to the Avatar Meher Baba Trust in India, which provided funds to a dispensary, school, hospital and pilgrimage centre.

In July 1976, Townshend opened Meher Baba Oceanic, a London activity centre for Baba followers, which featured film dubbing and editing facilities, a cinema and a recording studio. In addition, the centre served as a regular meeting place for Baba followers. Townshend offered very economical (reportedly £1 per night) lodging for American followers who needed an overnight stay on their pilgrimages to India. Townshend wrote in a 1977 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article: Townshend also embarked on a project dedicated to the collection, restoration and maintenance of Meher Baba-related films. The project was known as MEFA, or Meher Baba European Film Archive.

=== Children&#x27;s charities ===
Townshend has been an active champion of children&#x27;s charities. The debut of Townshend&#x27;s stage version of &quot;Tommy&quot; took place at San Diego&#x27;s La Jolla Playhouse in July 1992. The show was earmarked as a benefit for the London-based Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Foundation, an organisation that helps children with autism and intellectual disability.

Townshend performed at a 1995 benefit organised by Paul Simon at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Paramount Theatre for the Children&#x27;s Health Fund. The following year, Townshend performed at a benefit for the annual Bridge School Benefit, a California facility for children with severe speech and physical impairments, with concerts organised by Neil and Pegi Young. In 1997, Townshend established a relationship with Maryville Academy, a Chicago area children&#x27;s charity. Between 1997 and 2002, Townshend played five benefit shows for Maryville Academy, raising at least $1,600,000. His 1998 album &quot;A Benefit for Maryville Academy&quot; was made to support their activities and proceeds from the sales of his release were donated to them.

As a member of the Who, Townshend has also performed a series of concerts, beginning in 2000 to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK, which raised several million pounds. In 2005, Townshend performed at New York&#x27;s Gotham Hall for Samsung&#x27;s Four Seasons of Hope, an annual children&#x27;s charity fundraiser. In the same year, he donated a smashed guitar to the Pediatric Epilepsy Project.

On 4 November 2011, Roger Daltrey and Townshend launched the Daltrey/Townshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, to be funded by the Who&#x27;s charity Who Cares. The launch, followed on 5 November by a fund-raising event, was also attended by Robert Plant and Dave Grohl.

In 2024, Townshend contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

=== Drug rehabilitation ===
Townshend has also advocated for drug rehabilitation. In a 1985 radio interview, he said:

The &quot;large clinic&quot; Townshend was referring to was a drug treatment facility in London that he and drug rehabilitation experimenter Meg Patterson had devised, but the plan failed to come to fruition. Two early 1979 concerts by the Who raised £20,000 for Patterson&#x27;s Pharmakon Clinic in Sussex.

Further examples of Townshend&#x27;s drug rehabilitation activism took place in the form of a 1984 benefit concert (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band the Stone Roses), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain&#x27;s &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; urging better care for the nation&#x27;s growing number of drug addicts, and the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he&#x27;d recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend&#x27;s 1985–86 band, Deep End, played two benefits at Brixton Academy in 1985 for Double-O Charities.

=== Amnesty International ===
In 1979 Townshend donated his services to the human rights organisation Amnesty International when he performed three songs for its benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;—performances that were released on record and seen in the film of the show. Townshend&#x27;s acoustic performances of three of his songs (&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Drowned&quot;, and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;) were subsequently cited as forerunners and inspiration for the &quot;unplugged&quot; phenomenon in the 1990s.

Townshend had been invited to perform for Amnesty by Martin Lewis, the producer of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, who stated later that Townshend&#x27;s participation had been the key to his securing the subsequent participation for Amnesty (in the 1981 sequel show) of Sting, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Phil Collins and Bob Geldof. Other performers inspired to support Amnesty International in future &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows and other benefits because of Townshend&#x27;s early commitment to the organisation include Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, David Gilmour and U2&#x27;s lead singer Bono who in 1986 told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine: &quot;I saw &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...&quot;

=== Guest appearances ===
In 1968 Townshend helped assemble a band called Thunderclap Newman consisting of three musicians he knew: pianist Andy Newman (an old art school friend), drummer John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keen (who had written &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot; for the Who to record for their 1967 studio album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;) and teenage guitarist Jimmy McCulloch (later to join Wings). Townshend produced the band and played bass on their recordings under the tongue-in-cheek pseudonym &quot;Bijou Drains&quot;. Their first recording was the single &quot;Something in the Air&quot;, which became a number one hit in the UK and a substantial hit elsewhere in the world. Following this success, Townshend produced their sole album, &quot;Hollywood Dream&quot;.

In 1971 Townshend, along with Keith Moon and Ronnie Lane, backed Mike Heron (of the Incredible String Band) on one song &quot;Warm Heart Pastry&quot; from Heron&#x27;s first solo LP, &quot;Smiling Men with Bad Reputations&quot;. On the album notes, they are listed as &quot;Tommy and the Bijoux&quot;.

In 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to the track &quot;I&#x27;m the Answer&quot; on his brother Simon&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Sweet Sound&quot;.

Townshend shares songwriting credit on two songs (&quot;Love on the Air&quot; and &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged&quot;) on Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour&#x27;s 1984 solo album &quot;About Face&quot;.

Townshend often recorded and performed alongside his girlfriend Rachel Fuller, a classically trained pianist and singer-songwriter.

In 2006 Townshend opened a website for implementation of The Lifehouse Method based on his 1971 &quot;Lifehouse&quot; concept. This website was in collaboration with composer Lawrence Ball and software developer David Snowden, with instrumentation by Steve Hills. Applicants at the website could input data to compose a musical &quot;portrait&quot; that the musical team could then develop into larger compositions for a planned concert or series of concerts.

<text>Roger Harry Daltrey (born 1 March 1944) is an English singer, musician and actor. He is the co-founder and lead singer of the rock band the Who.

Daltrey&#x27;s hit songs with the Who include &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;You Better You Bet&quot;. He began a solo career in 1973 while still a member of the Who, and has released ten solo studio albums, five compilation albums and one live album. His solo hits include &quot;Giving It All Away&quot;, &quot;Walking the Dog&quot;, &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Free Me&quot;, &quot;Without Your Love&quot; and &quot;Under a Raging Moon&quot;.

The Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. As a member of the band, Daltrey received a Lifetime achievement award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. He and Pete Townshend received Kennedy Center Honors in 2008, and The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016. 

Daltrey was ranked number 61 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest singers of all time in 2008; Planet Rock listeners voted him rock&#x27;s fifth-greatest voice in 2009. Daltrey has also been an actor and film producer, with roles in films, theatre, and television.

==Early life==
Daltrey was born on 1 March 1944 in Hammersmith Hospital, East Acton, London, during a World War II bombing raid. He is the eldest of three children of Harry and Irene Daltrey, and has two younger sisters. His father, an insurance clerk, was called up to fight in the Second World War, and three-month-old Roger and his mother were evacuated to a farm in Scotland.

Daltrey attended Victoria Primary School and Acton County Grammar School in west London, the same school Pete Townshend and John Entwistle attended. He showed academic promise in the English state school system and was top of his class in the eleven-plus examination, after which he went to Grammar School.

Daltrey&#x27;s first guitar, a cherry red Stratocaster replica, he made himself in 1957. He joined a skiffle group called the Detours who needed a lead singer, and produced it when they told him to bring a guitar. His father bought him an Epiphone guitar in 1959 and he became the band&#x27;s lead guitarist.

He also became the band&#x27;s leader, and gained a reputation for using his fists to impose discipline. According to Townshend, Daltrey &quot;ran things the way he wanted. If you argued with him, you usually got a bunch of fives, [a hard punch]&quot;. Daltrey explained, later in life, that this harsh approach came from the tough neighbourhood in which he had grown up, where arguments were resolved by fighting. He was expelled from school, and Townshend wrote in his autobiography, &quot;&quot;&quot;until he was expelled, Roger had been a good pupil.&quot;

They discovered in 1964 that another band was performing as the Detours, and discussed changing their name. Townshend suggested &quot;the Hair&quot; and Townshend&#x27;s room-mate Richard Barnes suggested &quot;The Who&quot;. The next morning, Daltrey made the decision for the band, saying &quot;It&#x27;s the Who, innit?&quot;

== The Who ==
=== Overview ===
Townshend began writing original material for the band, and after their first hit single (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;) and record deal in early 1965, Daltrey&#x27;s dominance of the band diminished. The other members of the Who fired him from the band in late 1965 after he beat up their drummer, Keith Moon, for supplying illegal drugs to Townshend and Entwistle, but he was re-admitted to the band a week later on probation after he promised not to do it again. He recalled, &quot;I thought if I lost the band, I was dead. If I didn&#x27;t stick with the Who, I would be a sheet metal worker for the rest of my life.&quot;

The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot;, was a collaboration between Daltrey and Townshend. While Townshend was developing into an accomplished composer, Daltrey was gaining a reputation as a singer and front-man. The Who&#x27;s stage act was energetic, and Daltrey&#x27;s habit of swinging the microphone around by its cord on stage became a signature move. His Townshend-inspired stuttering expression of youthful anger, frustration and arrogance in the band&#x27;s breakthrough single, &quot;My Generation&quot;, captured the revolutionary feeling of the 1960s for young people around the world and became a trademark sound. His scream near the end of &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; was a defining moment in rock and roll.

By 1973, Daltrey was experiencing success with his solo projects and acting roles. While the other members of the band were recording the music for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, he took the opportunity to examine the Who&#x27;s financial books and found they had fallen into disarray under the management of Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Lambert was Pete Townshend&#x27;s artistic mentor, and challenging him led to renewed tension within the band. During a filming session, in an incident that Daltrey later claimed was overblown, Townshend and Daltrey argued over the schedule, Townshend hit Daltrey over the head with his guitar, and Daltrey responded by knocking Townshend unconscious with a single blow.

In the Who&#x27;s milestone achievements, &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, Daltrey became the face and voice of the band as they defined themselves as rebels in a generation of change. When Ken Russell&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot; appeared as a feature film in 1975, Daltrey played the lead role. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture&quot;, and appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine on 10 April 1975. He worked with Russell again, starring as Franz Liszt in &quot;Lisztomania,&quot; and collaborated with Rick Wakeman on the soundtrack of the film.
The Who&#x27;s drummer, Keith Moon, died in 1978. The band continued working after his death, but Daltrey thought that new drummer Kenney Jones had been the wrong choice. The Who broke up in 1983 when Townshend felt that he could no longer write for them.

The band reformed in 1989 for a 25th Anniversary Tour, which also celebrated the 20th anniversary of their rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. The tour featured a large backing band, with guest appearances by Steve Winwood, Patti LaBelle, Phil Collins, Elton John, and Billy Idol. Daltrey managed to complete the tour in spite of an abdominal ailment, for which he later received surgery.

In 1996, Pete Townshend was approached to produce &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; for the Prince&#x27;s Trust concert at Hyde Park, London. Daltrey agreed to help to produce a one-off performance, and the opera was to be performed with a large backing band. On the night before the show, Daltrey was struck in the face by a microphone stand swung by Gary Glitter and the accident fractured his eye socket. There was concern that he might not be able to perform, but Daltrey covered the bruises with an eye patch and completed the show as scheduled. Townshend took the production on tour in 1996–97 as the Who.

After the success of the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; tour, the band returned as the Who with a five-piece line-up for tours in 1999–2000, and they made a major impact at the Concert for New York City in 2002. After Entwistle&#x27;s death in June 2002, Daltrey and Townshend decided to continue with an already planned tour, with bass player Pino Palladino taking Entwistle&#x27;s place. They also completed a brief tour in 2004. In 2006, they released the Who&#x27;s first studio album of new material in twenty-four years, &quot;Endless Wire&quot;, which led to suggestions that the much-discussed artistic tension in the Who lay between Daltrey and Townshend. The band undertook a world tour in 2006–07 in support of the album.

In February 2010, Townshend and Daltrey, headlining as the Who, performed the half-time show at Super Bowl XLIV in Miami, Florida, and were seen by 105.97 million viewers across the world. In March 2010, Townshend and Daltrey, with an extensive backing band, performed &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in London as a tenth-anniversary charity benefit for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam sang the part of the Godfather and Tom Meighan of Kasabian sang the part of Aceface.

=== Songwriting ===
Daltrey wrote several songs in the band&#x27;s catalogue during their early years:
* &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot; (1965) – the Who&#x27;s second single, co-written with Townshend.
* &quot;See My Way&quot; (1966) – Daltrey&#x27;s contribution to &quot;A Quick One&quot;.
* &quot;Early Morning Cold Taxi&quot; (1967) – Outtake from &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (later appearing as a bonus track on deluxe editions and on the 1994 box set &quot;Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot;), co-written with David &quot;Cyrano&quot; Langston.
* &quot;Here for More&quot; (1970) – B-side to &quot;The Seeker&quot;.

Daltrey also wrote a song titled &quot;Crossroads Now&quot; for the Who, which grew from an onstage jam in 1999. Another Daltrey song, &quot;Certified Rose&quot;, was rehearsed by the Who shortly before the death of John Entwistle. The band had intended to play it, as well as Townshend&#x27;s &quot;Real Good Looking Boy&quot;, during their 2002 tour, but it was dropped after Entwistle&#x27;s death. It was rumoured that a studio version had been recorded during the &quot;Endless Wire&quot; sessions which may have featured Entwistle&#x27;s basslines from 2002, but Townshend later stated that no such recording had been made. A more recent recording of &quot;Certified Rose&quot; was released on Daltrey&#x27;s 2018 album, &quot;As Long As I Have You&quot;.

==Solo career==
===Overview===

Daltrey has released ten solo studio albums. The first, &quot;Daltrey&quot; (1973), was recorded during a hiatus in the Who&#x27;s touring schedule. The best-selling single from the album, &quot;Giving It All Away&quot;, peaked at No. 5 in the UK and the album, which introduced Leo Sayer and David Courtney as songwriters, made the Top 50 in the United States. The inner sleeve photography showed a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; which referred to the Narcissus myth, as Daltrey&#x27;s reflection in the water differed from his actual appearance. He also released a single in 1973, &quot;Thinking&quot;, with &quot;There is Love&quot; on the B-side. The British release, with considerable airplay of &quot;Giving It All Away&quot; (first lines &quot;I paid all my dues so I picked up my shoes, I got up and walked away&quot;) coincided with news reports of the Who being sued for unpaid damage to their hotel on a recent tour, which included a TV set thrown out of a window.

Daltrey&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Ride a Rock Horse,&quot; was released in 1975. It was his second most commercially successful solo album. &quot;McVicar&quot; was a soundtrack album from the film of the same name, in which Daltrey starred and also co-produced; it featured all the other members of the Who (Townshend, Entwistle, and Kenney Jones). &quot;McVicar&quot; included two hit singles, &quot;Free Me&quot;, and &quot;Without Your Love&quot;, Daltrey&#x27;s best-selling solo recording.

His next album, &quot;Parting Should Be Painless,&quot; received negative reviews and was his poorest-selling studio album up to that point. In it, Daltrey had vented his frustrations after the break-up of the Who by assembling a set of roughly autobiographical songs. They included a track contributed by Bryan Ferry (&quot;Going Strong&quot;), and one contributed by the Eurythmics (&quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;). Daltrey said the album covered musical areas that he had wanted the Who to pursue. The title track of the next album, &quot;Under a Raging Moon,&quot; was a tribute to the Who&#x27;s drummer, Keith Moon, who had died in 1978 at the age of 32. On his &quot;Rocks in the Head&quot; album, Daltrey&#x27;s voice ranged from a powerful bluesy growl in the style of Howlin&#x27; Wolf, to tender vocals shared with his daughter Willow on the ballad &quot;Everything a Heart Could Ever Want&quot;.

Daltrey appeared in the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992, singing the hard rock Queen song &quot;I Want It All&quot;, in homage to his friend Freddie Mercury who had died the previous year one day after a public announcement that he had AIDS.

To celebrate his 50th birthday in 1994, Daltrey performed two shows at Carnegie Hall in New York. A recording of the concerts was later issued on CD and video, entitled &quot;A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who&quot;, and is sometimes called &quot;Daltrey Sings Townshend&quot;. The success of these shows led to a US tour under the same name, featuring Pete Townshend&#x27;s brother Simon on lead guitar. Phil Spalding played bass in the first half of each show and John Entwistle played bass in the second half. An Australian leg was considered but eventually scrapped.

A fan of Premier League football club Arsenal F.C., Daltrey wrote and performed a specially commissioned song, &quot;Highbury Highs&quot;, for the 2006 Highbury Farewell ceremony after the final football match was played at the Highbury ground. Daltrey&#x27;s performance was part of Arsenal&#x27;s celebration of the club&#x27;s 93 years at Highbury as it prepared to move to a new stadium.

Daltrey embarked on a solo tour of the US and Canada on 10 October 2009, the &quot;Use It or Lose It&quot; tour, with a new touring band he called &quot;No Plan B&quot; on the Alan Titchmarsh Show. The band included Simon Townshend on rhythm guitar and backing vocals, Frank Simes on lead guitar, Jon Button on bass guitar, Loren Gold on keyboards, and Scott Devours on drums. Eddie Vedder made a guest appearance at the Seattle show on 12 October. In 2010, Daltrey and No Plan B appeared for several dates with Eric Clapton, including Summerfest at Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

On 15 March 2018, Daltrey announced the forthcoming release on 1 June of a new solo studio album, &quot;As Long as I Have You&quot;. He appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 13 April 2018 to promote the single taken from the album.

In May 2021, Daltrey announced a return to touring, with the solo Live and Kicking Tour, starting in August 2021. The tour was rescheduled and carried out during the summer of 2022.

==Collaborations==
In 1998, Daltrey performed two songs with the Jim Byrnes Blues Band at the Los Angeles Highlander Convention.

On 12 January 2009, he headlined a one-off concert with Babyshambles at the O2 Academy Bristol for Teenage Cancer Trust. On 5 July 2009, he joined the Jam&#x27;s lead singer, Paul Weller, on stage at Hop Farm Festival in Kent for an encore of &quot;Magic Bus&quot;. In 2011, Daltrey recorded a duet on the song &quot;Ma seule amour&quot; with French singer and composer Laurent Voulzy for his album &quot;Lys and Love&quot;.

In November 2014, while staying at the Mar Hall Hotel in Bishopton, Renfrewshire ahead of the Who&#x27;s gig at the SSE Hydro, Daltrey joined local band Milestone for an impromptu rendition of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;. The band were playing at a wedding reception in the hotel.

== Legacy ==
Pete Townshend said Daltrey had &quot;almost invented the pseudo-messianic role taken up later by Jim Morrison and Robert Plant&quot;. His stage persona earned him a position as one of the &quot;gods of rock and roll&quot;. He developed a trademark move of swinging and throwing his microphone through a complex sequence, matching these sequences with the tempo of the song that was being played, although Daltrey reduced the athleticism of his performances in later years. According to a review of the Who&#x27;s performance at the Quart Festival in 2007:

Suddenly each and everyone stopped caring about the down-pouring rain. When the Who took the stage we couldn&#x27;t do anything but to reach for the sky and howl. Anyone who has ever thought of calling these gods old men and dinosaurs should be deeply ashamed. The reports we&#x27;ve heard from around the world were true: Live rock doesn&#x27;t get any better.
== Equipment ==

Daltrey hand-built his first guitar from a piece of plywood, and he also built guitars for the band in the early days when they had little money to buy equipment. As lead guitarist for the Detours, Daltrey played a 1961 Epiphone Wilshire solid-body electric guitar, which he later sold to Pete Townshend on an easy payment plan. After he took over as the band&#x27;s vocalist in the 1960s, and during the 1970s, Daltrey rarely played guitar on stage, except for a Martin acoustic guitar he used while promoting his solo album &quot;Daltrey&quot;. He began playing guitar with the Who again during the band&#x27;s tours in the 1980s, and used a Fender Esquire to play a second guitar part for the song &quot;Eminence Front&quot; on the Who&#x27;s 1982, 1989 and later tours. During the 1989 tour, Daltrey played a Gibson Chet Atkins SST guitar for the song &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. During the Who&#x27;s 1996–97 Quadrophenia tour, he played a Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar.

After 1999, it became common for Daltrey to play guitar during both the Who and solo shows. He played a Versoul Buxom 6 handmade acoustic guitar on the Who&#x27;s 2002 tour. Daltrey owns a Gibson Everly Brothers Flattop acoustic guitar which he played on the Who and solo tours in the late first decade of the 21st century. On his 2009 tour, he played Pete Townshend&#x27;s &quot;Blue, Red and Grey&quot; on an Ashbury cutaway tenor EQ ukulele.

Daltrey is among those who brought the harmonica into British popular music. Harmonica brands he has used include Hohner and Lee Oskar.

Daltrey uses Shure microphones. Their cords are taped to strengthen the connection to the microphone and to avoid cutting his hands when he swings and catches it. He commonly uses a standard Shure SM58, but has also used Shure SM78 (in 1981), Shure model 565D Unisphere 1, and Shure model 548 Unidyne IV. Daltrey also uses a hybrid monitoring system, with one in-ear monitor supplemented by floor wedges.

==Acting career==


==Literary work==
Daltrey contributed to a collection of childhood fishing stories published in 1996 entitled &quot;I Remember: Reflections on Fishing in Childhood&quot;. In 2009, he contributed a foreword to &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere: The Complete Chronicle of The Who 1958–1978&quot; by Andrew Neill and Matt Kent. In 2011, he wrote a tribute article in honour of the late Ken Russell which was published in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

In October 2018, Daltrey published his memoir, &quot;Thanks a Lot Mr. Kibblewhite: My Story&quot;. The title is a reference to the man who threw him out of grammar school, enabling him to go into a successful music career.

== Awards and achievements ==
In 1976, Daltrey was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture&quot; for his starring role in the film version of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. He also performed as a guest on the Chieftains&#x27; recording of &quot;Irish Evening: Live at the Grand Opera House&quot; which won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album in 1993. With the Who, Daltrey received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001 for outstanding artistic significance in music.

In 1990, Daltrey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio as a member of the Who. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also included three songs that Daltrey recorded with the Who on the list of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, including: &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;, and &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;. In 2005, Daltrey received a British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors Gold Badge Award for special and lasting contributions to the British entertainment industry.

In 2003, Daltrey was honoured by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as a European Hero for his work with the Teenage Cancer Trust and other charities. In the New Year&#x27;s Honours List published on 31 December 2004, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to Music, the Entertainment Industry and Charity.

As a member of the Who, Daltrey was inducted in 2005 into the UK Music Hall of Fame. In December 2008, he and Pete Townshend were honoured with America&#x27;s most prestigious cultural awards as recipients of the 31st annual Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., by the then-president of the United States, George W. Bush. On 4 March 2009, three days after his 65th birthday, Daltrey accepted the James Joyce Award from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin for outstanding success in the music field.

On 12 March 2011, he received the Steiger Award (Germany) for excellence in music. In November 2011, Daltrey and Pete Townshend received the Classic Album Award for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; from the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards at the Roundhouse in London.

In July 2012, Daltrey received an honorary degree from Middlesex University in recognition of his contributions to music.

Daltrey has received numerous awards for his music, including Best Blues Album in the British Blues Awards 2015 alongside Wilko Johnson.

In 2019, Daltrey was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He received his Golden Plate along with Pete Townshend and presented by Awards Council member Peter Gabriel.

==Charities==

All of the Who&#x27;s Encore Series profits go to young people&#x27;s charities. Daltrey was instrumental in starting the Teenage Cancer Trust concert series in 2000, with the Who playing in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2010, and Daltrey playing solo in 2011 and in 2015 as the Who. The annual concerts have raised over £20 million. He has endorsed the Whodlums, a Who tribute band which raise money for the trust.

Daltrey performed at the first ChildLine Rocks concert at London&#x27;s the O2 on 13 March 2008. In 2009, Daltrey was a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists. In the same year, he appeared on stage with Michael J. Fox for the &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Cure Parkinson&#x27;s&quot; benefit. In April 2010, he headlined the Imagine A Cure II show honouring the legacy of John Lennon, which raised money for the Puget Sound Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer charity. In 2011, Daltrey became a patron of the Children&#x27;s Respite Trust for children with disabilities.

In 2011, Daltrey, Steven Tyler, and Julie Andrews provided funding for Robert S. Langer&#x27;s research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology into vocal cord repair for victims of cancer and other disorders. On 4 November 2011, Daltrey and Pete Townshend launched the Daltrey/Townshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Programme at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, to be funded by the Who&#x27;s charity &quot;Teen Cancer America&quot;. The launch, followed on 5 November by a fund-raising event, was also attended by Robert Plant, and Dave Grohl. Daltrey also announced that a portion of ticket sales from his solo tours would go to fund the teen cancer centres. In 2012, he offered his support to a project helping unemployed young people in Heathfield, run by Tomorrow&#x27;s People Trust.

== Political views ==
In 1970, Daltrey publicly supported The National Campaign for Freedom of Information, saying: &quot;I come from a working-class background and I am proud of it, and I intend to fight for the workers&#x27; right to know. We all need to know what goes on behind the scenes that is causing this country&#x27;s economic mess. When we have a Freedom of Information Act in this country we shall have restored our Right to Know the Truth and that will bring sanity to our tax laws.&quot;

Daltrey was previously a supporter of the British Labour Party, but he withdrew his endorsement, citing his opposition to the &quot;mass immigration&quot; policies put in place under the Blair government. In 2018, he criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, describing him as a &quot;communist&quot;.

Daltrey supported Britain leaving the European Union. He wrote in &quot;The Mirror&quot;: &quot;Whatever happens, our country should never fear the consequences of leaving. We went into the Common Market in 1973. Do you know what was going on before we went in? It was the 1960s. The most exciting time ever – Britain was Swinging. Films, Theatre, Fashion, Art and Music... Britain was the centre of the world. You got that because Britain was doing its own thing. It was independent. Not sure we&#x27;ll ever get that again when we&#x27;re ruled by bureaucrats in the European Union.&quot; He again criticised the EU in 2019, saying, &quot;If you want to be signed up to be ruled by a fucking mafia, you do it. Like being governed by FIFA&quot;.

In 2017, Daltrey opined that a &quot;dead dog&quot; could have defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. In 2018, he denounced the MeToo movement, saying: &quot;I find this whole thing so obnoxious. It&#x27;s always allegations and it&#x27;s just salacious crap.&quot;

In 2021, Daltrey criticised &quot;the woke generation&quot; in an interview with Zane Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Apple Music 1&quot; podcast, arguing that younger generations are limiting themselves by stifling and undoing creative freedoms that had emerged through the artistic revolutions of the 1960s. He elaborated by saying &quot;It&#x27;s terrifying, the miserable world they&#x27;re going to create for themselves. I mean, anyone who&#x27;s lived a life and you see what they&#x27;re doing, you just know that it&#x27;s a route to nowhere.&quot;

==Personal life==
Daltrey has been married twice. In 1964 he married Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Rickman, and later that year their son, Simon, was born. They divorced in 1968. In 1967, another son, Mathias, was born, the result of an affair with Swedish model Elisabeth Aronsson. In 1968 he met Heather Taylor, a UK-born model living with her grandmother at the time, who supposedly was the subject of the 1967 Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;. Daltrey and Taylor have been married since 1971, and have three children: daughters Rosie Lea (born 1972) and Willow Amber (born 1975), and son Jamie (born 1981), who runs Daltrey&#x27;s trout farm near Burwash Common.

On 1 March 1994, his 50th birthday, Daltrey received a letter from a woman who claimed to be his daughter from a brief relationship in the interval between his marriages. Daltrey later met two more daughters who were born during this period in the late 1960s. All three had been adopted, and had grown to adulthood before meeting their biological father. Daltrey stated that Heather had joined him in welcoming them to their extended family. As well as his eight children, Daltrey has fifteen grandchildren.

In 1971, Daltrey bought a farm at Holmshurst Manor, near Burwash, Sussex.

Daltrey announced onstage in 2018 that he had suffered hearing loss as a result of exposure to loud noise levels during performances and was now &quot;very, very deaf&quot;. He urged audience members to use earplugs.

In 1978, during the recording of the Who&#x27;s album &quot;Who Are You&quot;, Daltrey had throat surgery to remove nodules. During a solo tour in 2009 he began finding it harder to reach the high notes. In December 2010 he was diagnosed with vocal cord dysplasia and consulted Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Voice Center and professor at Harvard Medical School. Zeitels performed laser surgery to remove a possibly pre-cancerous growth. Both surgeries were considered successful, and Daltrey has regular checks to monitor his condition.

Daltrey has an allergy to cannabis that affects his singing voice. When second-hand marijuana smoke from an audience has affected his performance, he has occasionally interrupted the concert to request that people not smoke it. Daltrey has stated that he has never taken hard drugs.

Daltrey is a supporter of Arsenal F.C.

<text>There are currently two operating [[heritage railway]]s in [[Northern Ireland]].

== Operating heritage railways ==
*Downpatrick and County Down Railway is located on part of the former Belfast &amp; County Down Railway and is Ireland&#x27;s only heritage railway using the standard Irish track gauge of . It has approximately of track, with branches to Inch Abbey, Magnus Barefoot&#x27;s grave and Downpatrick station from a triangular junction. It operates with preserved steam and diesel locomotives and vintage wooden carriages.
*Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway is on the north coast in County Antrim. Narrow gauge steam-powered services run from the Giant&#x27;s Causeway to Bushmills. Laid on part of the course of the original Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway, which was electric-powered with its own hydroelectric plant (the first such system in the world).

== Former heritage railways ==

* Foyle Valley Railway is the name of two previous narrow gauge railways in Derry which used rolling stock from the former County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. The first (1975–1978) consisted of 300 metres of track at Victoria Road station. The second (1993–c.2000) stretched approximately south-west from the museum building on Foyle Road. The current owners of the museum have tentative plans to reopen the railway.
* Shane&#x27;s Castle Railway was a tourist railway in the grounds of the castle which used preserved narrow gauge steam locomotives. It was long and operated between 1971 and 1995.
* Kings Road Railway was operated by William McCormick in the 1960s and 70s in his back garden in Knock, Belfast using a former industrial narrow gauge steam locomotive.

<text>There are a small number of [[heritage railway]]s in the [[Republic of Ireland]], reflecting Ireland&#x27;s long history of rail transport. Some former operations have closed, and aspirant operations may have museums and even rolling stock, but no operating track. There are also working groups, which may run heritage rolling stock on main lines.

==Heritage railways==
===Operating===
Some of the main preserved or restored railways include:
* Fintown Railway, based in Fintown, County Donegal, which runs along the length of Lough Finn to Glenties Line for about a mile
* Listowel and Ballybunion Railway, a section of the Lartigue Monorail system, has been restored for visitors in Listowel, County Kerry
* Stradbally Woodland Railway, County Laois
* Waterford Suir Valley Railway, County Waterford, running a narrow-gauge railway for from Kilmeaden Station along the former mainline route from Waterford to Mallow. It operates alongside the Waterford Greenway and is Ireland&#x27;s longest heritage line.

===Under development / suspended===
* Connemara Railway, based at Maam Cross, County Galway, not open to the public, sometime operating a temporary narrow-gauge railway, later fitting standard gauge track (operation not apparent from last ref. check)
* West Clare Railway – installation intact but closed 1 June 2022 until further notice

===Defunct===
* Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway in County Offaly, run by Bord na Móna, near Shannonbridge, closed 2008
* Tralee and Dingle Light Railway, between Tralee and Dingle, which operated 1993–2013

==Railway museums==
* Castlerea Railway Museum, County Roscommon
* Cavan and Leitrim Railway, County Leitrim
* The Donegal Railway Heritage Centre in County Donegal, commemorating the operations of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee which once had two narrow-gauge railway systems

==Preservation groups==
Preservation groups in the Republic of Ireland include:
* The Irish Steam Preservation Society, based in Stradbally, County Laois, which operates the Stradbally Woodland Railway with vintage steam and diesel locomotives.
* The Irish Traction Group, based in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, which has a diesel locomotive collection at the site by the Limerick–Waterford railway route. ITG also run regular railtours around the country, sometimes with older (but still in regular use) Iarnród Éireann locomotives and rolling stock.
* The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, an all-island body, with bases in County Antrim and Dublin, and a museum in the former; holds a full operating licence and operates heritage-themed excursions on the main lines in both jurisdictions.

<doc id="154236" wikidata="Q573988" url="?curid=154236" title="Leopold Bloom">
<text>Leopold Paula Bloom is the fictional protagonist and hero of James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. His peregrinations and encounters in Dublin on 16 June 1904 mirror, on a more mundane and intimate scale, those of Ulysses/Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s epic poem: The &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

== Factual antecedents ==
Joyce first started planning a piece in 1906 that he described as &quot;deal[ing] with Mr. Hunter&quot; to be included as the final story in &quot;Dubliners&quot;, which he later retitled &quot;Ulysses&quot; in a letter to his brother that year. The protagonist of the piece was apparently to be based on a Dubliner named Alfred H. Hunter, who, according to Joyce&#x27;s biographer, Richard Ellmann, was rumored around town to have been from a Jewish background and to have an unfaithful, promiscuous wife. The same source that related this reputation to Ellmann also suggested that on the night of 20 June 1904, an intoxicated Joyce approached a young woman standing alone in St. Stephen&#x27;s Green and spoke to her just before her escort appeared and, feeling Joyce has insulted his date, proceeded to thrash the future author. Sometime after this, according to the Ellmann&#x27;s source, Hunter appeared on the scene, helped Joyce to his feet, and walked him home. The incident, if accurate, runs parallel to Bloom&#x27;s rescue of Stephen Dedalus in the closing scene of the Circe episode of &quot;Ulysses.&quot;

Another Dublin-based model for Bloom, and especially as regards the character&#x27;s nationalist politics, was the successful entrepreneur and municipal politician Albert L. Altman. Altman owned and operated one of the largest salt depots and distributors in the city during Joyce&#x27;s entire youth in Ireland and, as noted continuously throughout the period in the Dublin press, was involved in nationalist controversies and Home Rule politics where he was well acquainted with John Joyce, Joyce&#x27;s father. He was elected to the Dublin Corporation City Council as Usher&#x27;s Quay Town Councilor from 1901 to 1903 and died in office that final year. Like Bloom, Altman had a son who died in infancy and a father who died by his own hand through accidental poisoning.

Another model for Bloom was undoubtedly Italo Svevo. Svevo was the nom de plume of Hector (Ettore) Schmitz, who was one of Joyce&#x27;s favorite students when he was a Berlitz English language tutor in Trieste. Schmitz was born and raised a Jew but converted to Catholicism to marry. Joyce had many conversations with him about literature, art, his Jewish background, and Judaism. After Joyce allowed him to read both &quot;Dubliners&quot; and a draft of &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,&quot; Schmitz revealed to his tutor that he too was a novelist, although his first published novels had gone unnoticed by the reading public. After Joyce was given these novels and read them, he declared Schmitz to be an overlooked important Italian writer and worked during the course of the rest of their friendship to get his former pupil&#x27;s works noticed and published. It has been argued as well that the protagonists of Svevo&#x27;s novels may have influenced Bloom&#x27;s personality and habits as a Jewish character.

The character&#x27;s name (and maybe some of his personality) may have been inspired by Joyce&#x27;s Trieste acquaintance Leopoldo Popper. Popper was a Jew of Bohemian descent who had hired Joyce as an English tutor for his daughter Amalia. Popper managed the company of Popper and Blum and it is possible that the name Leopold Bloom was invented by taking Popper&#x27;s first name and anglicizing the name Blum.

==Fictional biography==
Bloom is introduced to the reader as a man of appetites:
Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods&#x27; roes. But most of all, he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.
The Bloom character, born in 1866, is the only son of Rudolf Virág (a Hungarian Jew from Szombathely who emigrated to Ireland, converted from Judaism to Protestantism, changed his name to Rudolph Bloom and later died by suicide), and of Ellen Higgins, an Irish Catholic. He is uncircumcised. They lived in Clanbrassil Street, Portobello. Bloom converted to Catholicism to marry Marion (Molly) Tweedy on 8 October 1888. The couple has one daughter, Millicent (Milly), born in 1889; their son Rudolph (Rudy), born in December 1893, died after 11 days. The family lives at 7 Eccles Street in Dublin.

Episodes (chapters) in &quot;Ulysses&quot; relate a series of encounters and incidents in Bloom&#x27;s contemporary odyssey through Dublin in the course of the single day of 16 June 1904 (although episodes 1 to 3, 9 and to a lesser extent 7, are primarily concerned with Stephen Dedalus, who in the plan of the story is the counterpart of Telemachus). Joyce aficionados celebrate 16 June as &#x27;Bloomsday&#x27;.

As the day unfolds, Bloom&#x27;s thoughts turn to the affair between Molly and her manager, Hugh &#x27;Blazes&#x27; Boylan (obliquely, through, for instance, telltale ear worms), and, prompted by the funeral of his friend Paddy Dignam, the death of his child, Rudy. The absence of a son may be what leads him to take a shine to Stephen, for whom he goes out of his way in the book&#x27;s latter episodes, rescuing him from a brothel, walking him back to his own house, and even offering him a place there to study and work. The reader becomes familiar with Bloom&#x27;s tolerant, humanistic outlook, his penchant for voyeurism and his (purely ) infidelity. Bloom detests violence, and his relative indifference to Irish nationalism leads to disputes with some of his peers (most notably &#x27;the Citizen&#x27; in the Cyclops chapter). Although Bloom has never been a practising Jew, converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Molly, and has in fact received Christian baptism on three occasions, he is of partial Jewish descent and is sometimes ridiculed and threatened because of his being perceived as a Jew.

Richard Ellmann, Joyce&#x27;s biographer, described Bloom as &quot;a nobody&quot;, who &quot;has virtually no effect upon the life around him&quot;. In this Ellmann found nobility: &quot;The divine part of Bloom is simply his humanity - his assumption of a bond between himself and other created beings.&quot; 
Hugh Kenner took issue with the view of Bloom as &quot;the little man&quot;, citing textual evidence to show that he is taller than average. He also has &quot;relative wealth, an exalted dwelling-place, handsome features, a polysemous wit, a famously beautiful wife&quot;. Kenner admitted that the evidence came late in the text. He argued that Joyce gave the initial impression of Bloom&#x27;s ordinariness because of the parallel with Ulysses, whose &quot;normal strategy was to withhold his identity&quot;.
Others such as Joseph Campbell see him more as an Everyman figure, a world (cosmopolis) traveler who, like Homer&#x27;s Odysseus &quot;visited the dwellings of many people and considered their ways of thinking&quot; (Odyssey 1.3).

One critic has argued that Joyce used the doctrines of the Incarnation cited early in &quot;Ulysses&quot; to characterize his relation to both Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom and their relation to each other. The theme of &quot;reincarnation,&quot; also introduced early in the novel, has been linked to one of the doctrines to signify that Bloom is the mature Joyce in another form and that Joyce speaks through him.

==Popular culture==

Joyce told Sylvia Beach that Holbrook Jackson resembled Bloom.

Writer-director Mel Brooks used the name &quot;Leo Bloom&quot; for the mousy accountant protagonist in his film/musical &quot;The Producers&quot;. Leo is a nervous accountant, prone to panic attacks, who keeps a security blanket to calm himself. Nevertheless, it is Leo who has the idea of how to make money from a failed play. In the 2001 stage musical and its 2005 film adaptation, after realizing his inner potential, Leo loudly asks &quot;When&#x27;s it gonna be Bloom&#x27;s Day?&quot; Hidden in the background of the office of Max Bialystock is a calendar marked for 16 June, which is Bloomsday.

Former Pink Floyd bandmate Roger Waters references Leopold Bloom in his song &quot;Flickering Flame&quot; as sitting with Molly Malone.

Jeffrey Meyers suggested in &quot;Orwell&#x27;s Apocalypse: &quot;Coming Up for Air, Modern Fiction Studies&quot;&quot; that George Orwell&#x27;s character George Bowling was modelled on Leopold Bloom.

Grace Slick&#x27;s song &quot;Rejoyce&quot;, from the album &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot;, concerns the novel &quot;Ulysses;&quot; Bloom is mentioned in the song.

<text>The ringtail (Bassariscus astutus) is a mammal of the raccoon family native to arid regions of North America. It is widely distributed and well-adapted to its distributed areas. It has been legally trapped for its fur. Globally, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List but is a Conservation Strategy Species in Oregon and Fully Protected in California The species is known by a variety of names, such as ring-tailed cat, miner&#x27;s cat, civet cat, and cacomistle (or cacomixtle), though the last of these can refer to &quot;B. sumichrasti&quot;.

The ringtail is the state mammal of Arizona.

==Description==
The ringtail is black to dark brown in color with pale underparts. The animal has a pointed muzzle with long whiskers, similar to that of a fox (its Latin name means &#x27;clever little fox&#x27;) and its body resembles that of a cat. The ringtail&#x27;s face resembles a mask as dark brown and black hair surround its eyes.

These animals are characterized by a long black and white &quot;ringed&quot; tail with 14–16 stripes, which is about the same length as its body.

Ringtails are primarily nocturnal, with large eyes and upright ears that make it easier for them to navigate and forage in the dark. An adept climber, it uses its long tail for balance. The rings on its tail can also act as a distraction for predators. The white rings act as a target, so when the tail rather than the body is caught, the ringtail has a greater chance of escaping.

The claws are short, straight, and semi-retractable, well-suited for climbing.

Smaller than a house cat, it is one of the smallest extant procyonids (only the smallest in the olingo species group average smaller). Its body alone measures and its tail averages from its base. It typically weighs around .
Its dental formula is = 40.

The ankle joint is flexible and is able to rotate over 180 degrees, making the animal an agile climber. The long tail provides balance for negotiating narrow ledges and limbs, even allowing individuals to reverse directions by performing a cartwheel. Ringtails also can ascend narrow passages by stemming (pressing all feet on one wall and their back against the other or pressing both right feet on one wall and both left feet on the other), and wider cracks or openings by ricocheting between the walls.

As adults, these mammals lead solitary lives, generally coming together only to mate. A typical call is a very loud, plaintive bark. They produce a variety of sounds, including clicks and chatters reminiscent of raccoons.

Ringtails have been reported to exhibit fecal marking behavior as a form of intraspecific communication to define territory boundaries or attract potential mates. It has been suggested that ringtails use feces as a way to mark territory. In 2003, a study in Mexico City found that ringtails tended to defecate in similar areas in a seemingly nonrandom pattern, mimicking that of other carnivores that utilized excretions to mark territories.

Ringtails prefer a solitary existence but may share a den or be found mutually grooming one another. They exhibit limited interaction except during the breeding season, which occurs in the early spring. Ringtails can survive for long periods on water derived from food alone, and have urine which is more concentrated than any other mammal studied, an adaptation that allows for maximum water retention.

==Reproduction==
Ringtails mate in the spring. The gestation period is 45–50 days, during which the male will procure food for the female. There will be 2–4 kits in a litter. The cubs open their eyes after one month, and will hunt for themselves after four months. They reach sexual maturity at 10 months. The ringtail&#x27;s lifespan in the wild is about seven years.

==Range and habitat==
The ringtail is commonly found in rocky desert habitats, where it nests in the hollows of trees or abandoned wooden structures. It has been found throughout the Great Basin Desert, which stretches over several states (Nevada, Utah, California, Idaho, and Oregon) as well as the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, and the Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico. The ringtail also prefers rocky habitats associated with water, such as the riparian canyons, caves, or mine shafts.

In areas with a bountiful source of water, as many as 50 ringtails/sq. mile (20/km2) have been found. Ranging from , the territories of male ringtails occasionally intersect with several females.

The ringtail is found in the Southwestern United States in southern Oregon, California, eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, southern Nevada, Utah, Louisiana and Texas. In Mexico it ranges from the northern desert state of Baja California to Oaxaca. Its distribution overlaps that of &quot;B. sumichrasti&quot; in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Veracruz.

Fossils assigned to &quot;B. astutus&quot; dating back to the early Pliocene epoch have been found as far north as Washington.

==Diet==
Small vertebrates such as passerine birds, rats, mice, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, lizards, frogs, and toads are the most important foods during winters. However, the ringtail is omnivorous, as are all procyonids. Berries and insects are important in the diet year-round, and become the primary part of the diet in spring and summer, along with other fruit.

As an omnivore the ringtail enjoys a variety of foods in its diet, the majority of which is made up of animal matter. Insects and small mammals such as rabbits, mice, rats and ground squirrels are some examples of the ringtail&#x27;s carnivorous tendencies. Occasionally the ringtail will also eat fish, lizards, birds, snakes and carrion. The ringtail also enjoys juniper, hack and black berries, persimmon, prickly pear, and fruit in general. They have even been observed partaking from birdseed feeders, hummingbird feeders, sweet nectar or sweetened water.

The results of a study of scat from ringtails on Isla San José, Baja California Sur, showed that the ringtail tended to prey on whatever was most abundant during each respective season. During the spring the ringtail&#x27;s diet consisted largely of insects, showing up in about 50% of the analyzed feces. Small rodents, snakes, and some lizards were also present. Plant matter was presented in large amounts, around 59% of the collected feces contained some type of plant, with fruits of &quot;Phaulothamnus&quot;, &quot;Lycium&quot;, and &quot;Solanum&quot; most common. The large amount of ironwood seeds and leaves demonstrated that these fleshy fruits were an obvious favorite of the ringtail.

==Ecology==
Foxes, coyotes, raccoons, bobcats, hawks, and owls opportunistically prey upon ringtails of all ages, though predominantly on younger, more vulnerable specimens. Also occasional prey to coatis, lynxes, and mountain lions, the ringtail is rather adept at avoiding predators. The ringtail&#x27;s success in deterring potential predators is largely attributed to its ability to excrete musk when startled or threatened. The main predators of the ringtail are the great horned owl and the red-tailed hawk.

Ringtails have occasionally been hunted for their pelts, but the fur is not especially valuable. Fur trapping has slowed down considerably, but current population sizes and growth rates remain unclear.

==Tameability==
Ringtail are said to be easily tamed / habituated to humans, and can make an affectionate pet and effective mouser. Miners and settlers once kept pet ringtails to keep their cabins free of vermin; hence, the common name of &quot;miner&#x27;s cat&quot;.
