<text>Tallmadge ( ) is a city in eastern Summit County, Ohio, United States, with a small district in neighboring Portage County. It is a suburb of Akron and part of the Akron metropolitan area. The population was 18,394 at the 2020 census. Tallmadge was founded in 1807 and is the second-oldest city in Summit County, following Hudson, which was founded in 1799.

==History==
Historically, Tallmadge was a part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, which was a three million acre plot of land in northeast Ohio. Prior to being named Tallmadge, it was part of Town 2, Range 10 in the Western Reserve. In 1807, the Reverend David Bacon founded and organized Tallmadge, placing a square road in the center of town where several other roads met, modeled after New England designs of the time period. The town was named after Benjamin Tallmadge, an American Revolutionary War figure and local landowner. The first syllable rhymes with &quot;shall&quot;, not &quot;tall&quot;.

In the nineteenth century, Tallmadge continued to develop around the square as its centerpiece, which years later became a traffic circle named &quot;Tallmadge Circle&quot; (or simply &quot;the Circle&quot;). The Circle as it is today represents New England&#x27;s role in the settlement of the Ohio Western Reserve. The rest of the city was designed in a grid pattern, with industry tending to develop near the railroad.

No alcohol could be bought or consumed in public in Tallmadge until the early 1990s, when the law was amended to allow the retail sale of alcohol in stores, but public consumption was still illegal. In 2001, the law was repealed and alcohol could be sold and consumed in restaurants, provided that alcohol not account for more than 30% of any establishment&#x27;s revenue. The first restaurant to offer alcohol in Tallmadge was Delanie&#x27;s on West Avenue.

Tallmadge lies within two counties. While the vast majority of the city lies in Summit County, portions on the east side protrude into neighboring Portage County. This phenomenon resulted from the annexation of small portions of a neighboring township, Brimfield.

==Landmarks==
At the center of the town is the Historic Tallmadge Church (built in 1825), recognized as a historic place by the Ohio Historical Society, and was featured on the cover of the November 20, 1944, edition of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. An intersection surrounds the church and a small park, the Tallmadge Circle Park, on which the church sits. The Circle Park is also home to Tallmadge&#x27;s Old Town Hall (established 1859), which houses a museum on its second floor. In 2003, a new steeple was placed atop the Old Town Hall, replacing the original which had been removed decades earlier.

The Circle itself, which surrounds the Historic Church, Old Town Hall, and Circle Park, continues to be a notable landmark at the center of the town. While two separate Ohio state routes meet at the intersection (SR 91 and SR 261; at one point SR 18 and SR 532 also met there), the one-lane circle regularly accommodates several dozen vehicles at a time without congestion, although jams are present on roads leading to the circle itself at peak hours. The eight roads that meet at the Circle form a spoke design that, as they lead away from the Circle, travel in the cardinal and ordinal directions. The roads are named according to the respective directions they travel away from the Circle (e.g. Northwest Avenue); these names are not preserved by the neighboring municipalities into which the eight roads run. Four of these eight roads comes to a six-point intersection within the original city, forming a square. In summer 2010, one of these six-point intersections in the northeastern portion of Tallmadge was converted to a roundabout based on the design of the original Circle.

<text>Green Springs is a village in Sandusky and Seneca counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 1,233 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Green Springs area was originally inhabited by the Kaskaskia and Miami Nation.

On September 29, 1817, the Seneca whom had been displaced from their native lands in New York signed the Treaty of Fort Meigs, which established the 40,000 acre Seneca Indian Reservation and a $500 annuity. But on February 28, 1831, as part of the Treaty of Little Sandusky the Seneca agreed to relinquish their 40,000 acres in Ohio in exchange for 67,000 acres west of the Mississippi River and other provisions including a 5% annuity on the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the land in Ohio. This was part of the larger Indian Removal developed by the administration of Andrew Jackson.

In 1831, Jacob Stem, the founder of Green Springs, bought the land from the government. He purchased about within Sandusky and Seneca counties, including the sulfur spring. The village was originally called Stemtown, named after the founder. It was later called Green Springs, named from the color of the water from the spring.

State Route 19 passes through the community, the in-town portion of which is called Broadway Street.

===Pollution===
North, just outside Green Springs, was the site of the dumping of toxic industrial waste by the Whirlpool Corporation.

<text>Norton is a city in southwestern Summit County, Ohio, United States, with a district extending into Wayne County. The population was 11,673 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1818, Norton Township was organized as a part of Wolf Creek Township which consisted of present-day Norton, Copley, Wadsworth, Sharon, Guilford, and Montville townships. Norton Township was plotted into lots half a square mile after being surveyed by Joseph Darrow. Norton was known as Town 1, Range 12 of the Western Reserve. It was named after Birdseye Norton, one of the original owners of the township. The first two people to settle on this land, in 1810, were James Robinson and John Cahow. Robinson purchased lot 19 and Cahow lot 20. The first marriage in the township was in the fall of 1814 between James Robinson and Lois Bates. The first tavern was built by John Cahow on his lot 20 in 1812. The first saw and grist mills were built by Thomas Johnson in 1823 (saw) and 1830 (grist). Norton Township consisted of seven small villages: Loyal Oak (also known as Bates&#x27; Corners, located at 261 &amp; Cleveland-Massillon Rd), Western Star (Greenwich and Medina Line Roads), Sherman (Originally known as Dennison located at Hametown Rd &amp; Sherman St), Johnson&#x27;s Corners (31st St and Wooster Rd W), Norton Center (Cleveland-Massillon &amp; Greenwich Rd &amp; Norton Ave), Hametown (Hametown and Wooster Roads), and New Portage (Wooster Rd N &amp; Norton Ave.).

One of Norton&#x27;s famous families is the Seiberling family; Frank A. and Charles W. Seiberling started the Goodyear tire and rubber company in 1898. The Seiberling farm is still in operation today on Greenwich Road at Knollbrook Drive. In 1890, Ohio Columbus Barber, Charles Baird, Albert T. Paige and John K. Robinson purchased a number of farms adjacent to New Portage. Their purchase was for the purpose of founding a new manufacturing city. This city was named Barberton after O. C. Barber. The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal ran through the southeastern part of the township from 1827–1913. In 1905, electric trolley lines were installed in Norton, from Barberton to Wadsworth. In 1958 the Norton Township Development Committee was formed. Residents believed the Township form of government, with its three Trustees, needed a more structured form of government to effectively meet the needs of a fast-growing community. After time, an issue to incorporate as a village was placed on the election ballot. Although defeated the first time, it passed in 1961, thus incorporating Norton as a village. Norton&#x27;s first Village Mayor was Richard DuFore. The General Election of November 1968, brought Norton to a City status. The former Norton Village officially assumed City status on January 11, 1969. Norton&#x27;s current government consists of Mayor Mike Zita and council members: Doug DeHarpart, Jamie Lukens, Don Harbert, Paul Tousley, Judith Lynn Lee, Bill Mowery, and Paul Eader.

<text>Geary is a city in Blaine and Canadian counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 994 at the 2020 census.

Edmund Guerriere, of French - Cheyenne ancestry and a former Army scout and interpreter, had acquired a land allotment about northeast of the town. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the town name was spelled &quot;Geary&quot; because the settlers had difficulty spelling and pronouncing the original name.

<text>Okarche ( ) is a town in Canadian and Kingfisher counties in Oklahoma, United States, that is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The population was 1,141 as of the 2020 United States census. 
==History==
Okarche is located on land that, before 1830, was within the historic area of the Wichita people. The location was in territory assigned to the Creek and Seminole people when removal of tribes from the southeastern United States began in 1830. After the Civil War, parts of Indian Territory were designated for resettlement of Plains Indians. The site of the future town of Okarche was just inside the eastern border of the Cheyenne and Arapaho reservation.

From 1867 to 1884, cattle were driven through the area on the Chisholm Trail from Texas to railheads in Kansas. Later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad and the state road which would become the Meridian Highway and U.S. Highway 81 would follow roughly the same route through Oklahoma Territory.
On March 2, 1887, the U.S. Congress approved construction of a railroad through Indian Territory. The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was given a right of way through the territory and authorized to take additional right of way for stations every of track. Railway assets would be turned over to the CRI&amp;P in June 1890. Construction proceeded southward from Caldwell, Kansas, and was completed to Pond Creek by April 1889 and to El Reno in January 1890. The railway depot where Okarche was platted was completed at that time.

The Okarche post office was established June 28, 1890. Cheyenne and Arapaho lands were opened to settlement by land run on April 19, 1892. The town was incorporated in 1905 – two years before statehood. The name of the town is a portmanteau, derived from parts of three words, Oklahoma (OK), Arapaho (AR), and Cheyenne (CHE). The Southern Arapaho and Cheyenne Native American tribes had been relocated to Oklahoma from the northern Great Plains in the late 19th century. The town&#x27;s population hovered in the 400s for more than three decades after statehood had risen to over 1,200 by 2010.

By the late 1890s, German immigrants were a greater part of the population and German a widely used language of the community. Many had come to America in the wave of 1.5 million German immigrants to the United States in the 1880s and lived in states to the north such as Iowa, Nebraska, or Missouri before coming to Oklahoma Territory. Catholic and Lutheran churches with schools were established as immigrants sought to keep faith and customs from the old country alive in their new home. St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church was founded in 1892 and Holy Trinity Catholic Church in 1893. Worship and education was conducted principally in German until American entry into World War I in 1917. Bilingual worship would continue for about two decades.

When federal highway numbering was implemented in November 1926, the Meridian Highway through Okarche was designated US-81 and fully paved in the Okarche area by 1931. The Northwest Highway (OK-3) was opened as a gravel-surfaced road in 1939 and fully paved by 1947. Okarche now has four-lane divided highway access to neighboring communities, including the Oklahoma City metro area. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad entered its final bankruptcy in 1975. The Union Pacific Railroad now operates on the former Rock Island route.

==Geography==
Okarche is located on the boundary of Kingfisher and Canadian counties. U.S. Route 81 leads south to El Reno and to Interstate 40, and north of Kingfisher. Oklahoma State Highway 3 leads southeast to Oklahoma City.

Piedmont remained a small but stable rural community for the first half of the 20th century. Starting in the 1970s, the town became an increasingly popular bedroom community for those working in nearby Oklahoma City. Development of the &quot;Northwest Expressway&quot; (Oklahoma State Highway 3) resulted in population growth of 124%.

Piedmont&#x27;s school district consists of 7 school facilities: Early Childhood Center, 3 Elementary Schools, Intermediate School, Middle School, and High School. School teams are known by the nickname &quot;Wildcats.&quot;

==Government==
Piedmont is a home rule city served by a council–manager government. 

Jason Orr was the City Manager from July 2016 until August 2021 when he was fired by the City Council as the result of an investigation by the Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector. The report revealed that Orr had violated Piedmont ordinances with the purchase of two pickup trucks by not obtaining prior Council approval and soliciting competitive bids as required. The report also revealed that Orr had contacted City Council members via phone calls prior to the purchase in February 2020 which appeared &quot;to be an action of the Council conducted outside of an official meeting, a circumvention of the Open Meetings Act&quot;. No action was ever taken against the Council members for their actions.

Josh Williams has been the City Manager since June 2022. Kurt Mayabb was the Mayor from April 2019 to November 2023. Former Mayor Pro-tem Melissa Ashford is the current Mayor until the term expires in April 2023.

<text>Fort Gibson is a town in Cherokee and Muskogee counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 3,814 as of the 2020 Census. It is the location of Fort Gibson Historical Site and Fort Gibson National Cemetery and is located near the end of the Cherokees&#x27; Trail of Tears at Tahlequah.

Colonel Matthew Arbuckle of the United States Army established Fort Gibson in 1824. The Army abandoned the fort in 1890. A recreation of the fort stands at the historic site, which was built as a Works Progress Administration project between 1935 and 1939, at a different location from the original fort.

The town calls itself &quot;The Oldest Town in Oklahoma.&quot;

==History==
Fort Gibson was originally established as a military garrison, Cantonment Gibson, in April 1824. The camp was set up to facilitate U.S. government policies of westward expansion and Indian removal. After the founding of Fort Gibson in 1824, military families, Indians desiring military protection, and free African-Americans settled near the fort, forming a town. After the Army abandoned Fort Gibson in 1857, the Cherokee Nation took over the military stockade and renamed the town Keetoowah.

The Army reoccupied Fort Gibson during the American Civil War and was renamed Fort Blunt from 1862 - 1865 for Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt. The town again prospered as refugees from fighting elsewhere fled to the relative safety of the fort. By the spring of 1863, soldiers in the Indian Home Guard occupied the fort. For several months, the Federal supported garrison had to fight off raids by Stand Watie and his Confederate backed Cherokee horsemen. Aside from Confederate raids, the garrison also suffered from outbreaks of cholera and smallpox. Sonuk Mikko, an officer in the Indian Home Guard, contracted smallpox while stationed at the Fort and succumbed to the illness.

On May 20, 1898, the Articles of Incorporation for the town of Fort Gibson were established under the Arkansas Statutes, placing all of the densely settled areas under one jurisdiction.

The townspeople considered Fort Gibson poorly located after suffering fires, mosquitoes, and other afflictions. They moved the town to higher ground around 1900. The first buildings had faced west toward the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad) tracks. In 1904 the town of Fort Gibson, Indian Territory, was surveyed and platted. In 1904 the town was turned around and situated one block east when J. C. Pierce built the first brick building. In 1906 John C. Berd constructed a brick-and-stone building for his drugstore, and the commercial district grew around these two permanent features. It had 1,063 residents in 1907.

One of the oldest non-Indian settlements in Oklahoma, Fort Gibson had other firsts for Oklahoma, such as: 
*the first telephone,
*first drama theater, 
*first steamboat landing, 
*first school for the blind, 
*first highway to Fort Smith
*the first interurban, which connected Fort Gibson to Muskogee.

In 1896 J. S. Holden started a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Post&quot;. At least six other newspapers followed in the early 20th century; the &quot;Fort Gibson Times&quot; continued into the 21st century.

In 1940, 1,233 people populated the town, and by 1970 there were 1,418 citizens. Home to twenty-six churches and fourteen civic clubs and organizations at the beginning of the 21st century, the town boasted a strong civic spirit. The town has a board of trustees type of government. The manufacturing industry supports the majority of workers, and the health care sector is close behind. The 2000 census listed 4,054 residents, and the school system housed 1,900 students at a teacher-student ratio of one to fifteen.

===Steamboats===
Part of the reason for the locale’s original success was that Fort Gibson was placed on the Grand River (a/k/a the lower section of the Neosho River) near where both it and the Verdigris River join and enhance the Arkansas River. This made it the head of navigation on the Arkansas—the farthest point up the river that could be navigated by significant ships—and an obvious river transportation point. So, while some of the early vessels operating from the town were canoes, bateaux, or even keelboats (frequently pulled by men on shore with towropes), the town was reached by steamboat as early as 1824 when the &quot;Florence&quot; delivered army recruits to Fort Gibson. In February 1828 the locale received a visit from a vessel called &quot;The Facility&quot; captained by one Philip Pennywit, and was within three years of that a regular steamboat stop. In 1832, noted author Washington Irving, who had spent twenty days traveling in Indian Territory—an experience documented in his book &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot;—departed the territory via steamboat at Fort Gibson.

Steamboat traffic grew and peaked in the two decades preceding the Civil War. For example, the riverboat &quot;Philip Pennywit&quot; (part owned by the aforementioned captain) was advertising in February 1849 its regular runs from New Orleans to Fort Gibson. The usual &quot;boating season&quot; ran from January to June, but some ships attempted to operate year-round.

The Civil War curtailed riverboat activity, as when the Union steamer &quot;J. R. Williams&quot; was destroyed by Confederate forces on June 15, 1864 trying to make a supply run to Fort Gibson. Nevertheless, activity picked up again after the war, as shown by a report in 1870 that twenty cargo-laden steamboats averaging three hundred tons apiece were operating between Fort Gibson and various ports on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. However, with the rise of railroads, riverboat usage trailed off and Fort Gibson declined as a transportation and commercial center.

==Geography==
Fort Gibson is located in northeastern Muskogee County. A small portion of the town extends north into a corner of Cherokee County. Fort Gibson is bordered to the west by the city of Muskogee, the Muskogee County seat.

<text>Oaks is a town in Cherokee and Delaware counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 288 at the 2010 census, a decrease from the figure of 412 recorded in 2000.

==History==
In 1842, the Moravian Brethren began a new mission which they named New Springplace. It was intended to replace their former mission in Georgia, which they had abandoned after the Cherokees had been forced to emigrate to Indian Territory. The mission operated in its new location until after the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1862, a group of Union troops and Pin Indians killed James Ward, a Cherokee missionary. They abducted Ward&#x27;s wife and twin infant sons, though they released them about from the mission. The mission was abandoned for the remainder of the war.

The Moravians resumed their mission work in October 1866. After reassessing their activities, the church abandoned its work among the Cherokees, asking Niels Nielsen, a minister of the Evangelical Danish Lutheran Church, to help the New Springplace congregation. Nielsen took over the facilities in 1902 and dropped the Springplace name.

George Miller opened a post office named Oaks on July 18, 1881. A plat for the town was filed on December 10, 1906. All of the land was owned by William Israel, subject to allotment by the Cherokees.

Rev. Christian Adolphus Vammen, with his family, succeeded Nielsen in 1924 and two years later began a children&#x27;s home, Oaks Indian Mission. The mission still operates at present.

==Geography==
Oaks is located in southern Delaware County. A small portion of the town extends south into Cherokee County. It is southwest of the town of Kansas and north of Tahlequah, the Cherokee County seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Oaks has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 412 people, 125 households, and 86 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 137 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 13.59% White, 72.57% Native American, 0.24% Asian, 0.49% from other races, and 13.11% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.43% of the population.

There were 125 households, out of which 36.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.8% were married couples living together, 16.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.4% were non-families. 28.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.97 and the average family size was 3.64.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 38.3% under the age of 18, 11.7% from 18 to 24, 21.6% from 25 to 44, 19.4% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $25,268, and the median income for a family was $27,396. Males had a median income of $19,375 versus $15,000 for females. The per capita income for the town was $8,031. About 18.7% of families and 29.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 39.5% of those under age 18 and 36.8% of those age 65 or over.

==New Springplace Indian Mission==
In 1801, members of the Moravian Church from Salem in North Carolina (now Winston-Salem) decided to begin a mission to the Cherokee people who were then living in Georgia and Tennessee. As a result, they set up Springplace Mission in Springplace, Georgia. They continued the mission to the Cherokees there until the Cherokees signed the Treaty of New Echota with the federal government. This forced the Cherokees and the other four Civilized Tribes (the Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks and Seminoles) to give up their homelands in the southeastern United States and move to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. Springplace Mission was forced to close its doors and move with the Cherokees to northeastern Indian Territory. Upon arrival in Indian Territory, the Moravians selected a spot north of Tahlequah, the new Cherokee Nation capital, to found New Springplace Indian Mission, near current-day Oaks.

The area selected was a beautiful one with plentiful oak trees (which is probably where Oaks got its name from) and a spring creek (today called Spring Creek), and the site was on the military road from Fort Gibson, Indian Territory, to St. Louis, Missouri. The Civil War temporarily closed the mission, but work resumed until 1902, when Danish Lutherans took over. Also in 1902, Oaks-Mission School was formed to accommodate the education for the Indian children staying in what became the Oaks Indian Mission. Later, a nearby school consolidated with Oaks, and the school became Oaks-Mission Public School. In 1980, the name of the mission was changed to Oaks Indian Center, and &quot;mission&quot; was dropped from Oaks&#x27; school name until the 1990s, when &quot;mission&quot; was re-instated. In 2004, the name of the Oaks Indian Center was restored to Oaks Indian Mission.

Currently, the Oaks Indian Mission continues to house and mission to Indian children, just like it did in the early days as Springplace and New Springplace.

<text>Purcell is a city in and the county seat of McClain County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 6,651, a 13% increase from 2010.

Founded in 1887, Purcell was a railroad town named after Edward B. Purcell, who was an official with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (&quot;AT&amp;SF&quot;).

Purcell is often called the &quot;Quarterhorse Capital of the World&quot; and its official motto is &quot;Heart of Oklahoma.&quot; The city has registered trademarks on both titles.

==History==
Purcell was at the north end of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, owned by the AT&amp;SF. Today, Amtrak serves the town with the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; at the station near the old AT&amp;SF depot.

Purcell was the only town on the border of the Unassigned Lands, and began attracting hopeful settlers even before the Land Rush of 1889. Town lots went on sale April 5, 1887, and a post office was established 16 days later. The &quot;Purcell Register&quot;, the town&#x27;s oldest newspaper, was established in 1887, and continued operating into the 21st Century. Residents elected the town&#x27;s first mayor, James Taylor Bradley, on August 13, 1895. The town was incorporated on October 3, 1898.

Located on the Canadian River, it was called the &quot;Queen City of the Chickasaw Nation.&quot; In 1895, one of the five district courts of the Chickasaw Nation was located in Purcell, with the first session opening November 18, 1895. The court house escaped destruction the next day, when a fire destroyed most of the buildings in the business district.

Construction of the Oklahoma Central Railroad (&quot;OCR&quot;), which would connect the Lehigh coal mines with Chickasha, reached Purcell in March 1907. The OCR located its main yards, barns and most of its equipment in Purcell. Although the OCR went bankrupt in the following year, its assets were acquired by the AT&amp;SF.

Purcell is located along the I-35 Corridor in the central part of the state, on a bluff overlooking the Canadian River valley within the Interior Plains region. It is south of Norman. The view from atop Purcell&#x27;s Red Hill offers a scenic glimpse at both the South Canadian River and the University of Oklahoma campus in neighboring Norman.

The central core of Purcell is located at the intersection of US-77 and OK-74/OK-39. Access to I-35 is at the north and south ends of the town.

Prior to the construction of I-35, this route of US-77 was the heavily traveled road from Oklahoma City to Dallas.

==Local Historic landmarks==
Purcell&#x27;s downtown business district and its many historic buildings underwent major improvements and revitalization at a cost of over $1 million in the 1990s via the &quot;U.S. Main Street&quot; program. The improvements included new sidewalks, Victorian lamp posts, storefront restorations, and landscape islands in the downtown area.

Purcell has four sites that are NRHP-listed:
* Hotel Love A three-story Victorian brick building that currently houses an antique store, a bed and breakfast inn, and retail offices/storefronts.
* McClain County Courthouse. An original turn-of-the-century three-story brick building. It underwent a $2 million restoration in 1995.
* US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge, at Canadian River, connecting Purcell to Lexington. 
* United States Post Office Purcell, located at 228 W Main St.

==US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge between Purcell and Lexington==
The US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge connecting Purcell and Lexington was originally built as a circa 1938 deck truss two-lane bridge and in 2019 rebuilt as a concrete pier four-lane bridge crossing the Canadian River between Purcell and Lexington, Oklahoma. The bridge carries U.S. Route 77 (US-77) and Oklahoma State Highway 39 (SH-39) from McClain County to Cleveland County. The bridge is named for James C. Nance, longtime community newspaper chain publisher and Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate and member of U.S Uniform Law Commission.

The Nance bridge allows travel time from Purcell (west side of the Canadian river) to Lexingon (East side of the river) to be only 3 minutes by car, according to google maps. When the bridge was closed (Emergency Closure, below), the same trip was 43 minutes when re-routed North to the nearest bridge, or 1 hour and 4 minutes when re-routed Southeast to the nearest bridge.

The 1938 construction of this bridge enabled communities from West and Southwest (Byars, Cole, Dibble, Paoli, Pauls Valley, Purcell, Rosedale, and Wayne) side of the river to reach the communities on the East side of the river (Lexington, Slaughterville, and Wanette). Traffic using the bridge allows trade and commerce to freely flow in this retail trade area of southern McClain County, southern Cleveland County, Southern Pottawatomie County, and northern area of Garvin County, and eastern portion of Grady county. The 2019 rebuilt bridge features the same design elements with concrete post and original circa 1938 design wrought iron railings which provide a separate pedestrian walkway offering sweeping views of the South Canadian River valley.

According to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, &quot;History was made Friday July 26, 2019 in Purcell and Lexington, just as it was more than 80 years ago when the two cities celebrated the grand opening of a new bridge connecting their communities. The new US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge that links the twin cities, located less than one mile apart, fully opened to traffic with much fanfare on Friday, July 26, 2019, the culmination of a major two-year, expedited reconstruction project.&quot;

==Historic site of Federal Courthouse for Indian Territory==
The site of the now demolished U.S. Federal Courthouse for Indian Territory, at the east end of Main Street, is landmark site of the former court of jurisdiction for Indian Territory. Prior to demolition, it was renovated into a car dealer showroom, later used as a fitness center and finally a retail floral shop before it became structurally unsound and demolished. The territorial courthouse was established under the Nonintercourse Act. 

Beginning with the Dawes Act of 1887, Congress passed several laws designed to divide and allocate land between members of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole tribes in the Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). As part of this scheme, subsequent legislation authorized a “Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes,” commonly known as the Dawes Commission, to determine the citizenship of Native Americans claiming membership in these tribes. Unsuccessful applicants were entitled to appeal to the United States District Court for Indian Territory which was located on the east end of Main Street in Purcell OK.

<text>Bromide is a town in Coal and Johnston counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 123 as of the 2020 Census. 

The area around Bromide was noted for its mineral springs, and the bromide content of the water gave the town its name. It was also noted for limestone quarrying and the potential to produce manganese. Proposals to promote economic growth from these assets never materialized.

==History==
Bromide was founded by Judge William H. Jackson, a former superintendent of the nearby Wapanucka Academy, who recognized the site near several mineral springs as a potential tourist attraction. The community was initially called &quot;Juanita&quot; (1905 - 1906), then &quot;Zenobia&quot; (1906 - 1907), before it was named &quot;Bromide&quot;. It incorporated in July 1908. Juanita and Zenobia were the names of two of Jackson&#x27;s daughters. The name &quot;Bromide&quot; was chosen because of the high content of bromine in the mineral water.

Before Oklahoma statehood, the townsite was part of the Chickasaw Nation. Native Americans were well acquainted with the mineral springs in the area. The Chickasaws called these &quot;Oka-Alichi&quot; (Medicine Water) or &quot;Hopi Kuli&quot; (Salt Springs), and believed that the waters had medicinal power, especially for &quot;rheumatism, diseases of the stomach, kidney and bladder ailments, [and] nerve and skin problems&quot;.

The first large business in Bromide was a limestone quarry, established by Robert Galbreath Jr., a Tulsa businessman. Stone became economically important about 1911, when the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf (MO&amp;G) Railway (later bought by the Kansas, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf (KO&amp;G)) built a spur into Bromide. A rock-crushing plant was built just outside the city. Galbreath built a three-story hotel from rock quarried there. The KO&amp;G promoted Bromide as &quot;the best health resort in the southwestern states&quot;. It also ran weekly excursions to the city. Three more hotels, a bathhouse, and a swimming pool were added to support the tourist trade. By 1920, the population had reached 520. The Great Depression dried up the tourist trade. The population of Bromide fell to 352 in 1930, 258 in 1950, and to 180 in 1980. KO&amp;G abandoned its line in 1950.

Manganese (chemical symbol: Mn) ore was discovered in the vicinity of Bromide in 1890. A report published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stated that the ore deposits were small and could not yield high grade ore (more than 45 percent Mn). However, during World War I, steel producers began accepting ores as low as 35 percent Mn. The USGS report said that about 5,000 tons of ore containing 35 to 40 percent Mn could be produced from the Bromide area deposits. Oilman Robert Galbreath evidently thought this could become sufficiently profitable to be a worthwhile investment. However, the Great Depression put an end to the concept.

The nearby Wapanucka Academy site is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR72001065).

Chattanooga emerged after the opening of the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation to non-Indian settlement on August 6, 1901. Named by N. C. Sisson after his hometown in Tennessee, the Chattanooga Town Company, comprising Sisson, T. E. Richey, and E. C. Blake, obtained the townsite patent on December 18, 1902. The post office was established in January of the following year.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway played a pivotal role in Chattanooga&#x27;s early development, extending a branch line from Lawton in 1903. The railway facilitated access to the Big Pasture, opened for settlement in 1906. The branch line was completed to Grandfield in 1920, and was later abandoned in 1942. Chattanooga, with rail access, quickly became an agricultural center, boasting three cotton gins, a lumberyard, a feed yard, and various small businesses by 1912. In 1930, the town had two gins and two elevators.

<doc id="150952" wikidata="Q959865" url="?curid=150952" title="Drumright, Oklahoma">
<text>Drumright is a city in Creek and Payne counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It began as an oil boom town. However, the population has declined as oil production has waned in the area. The population was 2,907 at the 2010 census, a figure almost unchanged from 2,905 in 2000. Drumright and nearby Cushing were at the center of the large, productive Cushing-Drumright Oil Field in the 1910s and 1920s. Now Drumright is home to a festival called The Drumright Monthly Market, where hundreds of visitors come on the first Saturday of every month, seeking crafts and delicacies from all over the region. 

==History==

The town sprang up nearly overnight in 1912, after wildcatter Tom Slick struck oil on the farm of Frank Wheeler, causing a rush of speculators, oilfield workers, and merchants into the area. A post office was established in the community on December 28, 1912. Local landowners James W. Fulkerson and Aaron Drumright platted a townsite, which was initially called Fulkerson, The town was renamed for Aaron Drumright, a farmer and later local businessman whose farm was part of the townsite.

Oil workers flooded into town so quickly that they lived in tents or shacks made from box cars, causing the community to be known locally as &quot;Ragtown.&quot; Hotels and boarding houses were constructed next, as well as amenities like gambling dens, dance halls, and roadhouses, where the workers could spend their money. Drumright incorporated as a town on May 27, 1913. In 1914, the city built a two-story building of stone to serve as an elementary and high school. It was called Washington School, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRIS 81000462). Two banks opened in the town during 1914. Drumright was designated a first-class city after an election on April 18, 1916. The 1920 census reported a population of 6,460.

The Oil Fields and Santa Fe Railway, an Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad (AT&amp;SF) subsidiary, built a track from Frey Junction (south of Oilton) to Drumright in 1915. The following year, the AT&amp;SF built a line north from Shamrock to Drumright. The Oil Fields and Santa Fe Railway was merged into the AT&amp;SF in 1941.

In 1919 a riot broke out in Drumright during a strike by telephone workers. The town&#x27;s mayor and chief of police were locked in the town jail by rioters. The Governor of Oklahoma sent six militia units to town to restore order.

Drumright hosted minor league baseball. The Drumright Oilers teams played as members of the Class D level Western Association and Oklahoma State League between 1920 and 1923.

A post office was established April 11, 1903.

When the Army Corps of Engineers began making plans for flood control that would flood the town of Mannford, citizens formed a plan to relocate several miles southeast of the original site. The move was completed in 1963.

<text>Stroud is a city in Creek and Lincoln counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,690.

==History==
Stroud was founded in 1892 and named for James W. Stroud, a developer. Early in its history, Stroud lay in Oklahoma Territory, where alcoholic drinks could be sold legally. Towns close to the boundary between Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were known as &quot;whiskey towns,&quot; and had a reputation as a &quot;wild&quot; town due to its many saloons and other businesses catering to thirsty cowboys and travelers arriving from &quot;dry&quot; Indian Territory. These days were short-lived, however, because Oklahoma statehood in 1907, forced Stroud to become &quot;dry&quot; as well.

In 1901, after a race riot, Stroud became a sundown town, with a prominent sign warning African Americans not to stay overnight.

During the first decade of the 20th century, Stroud&#x27;s economy was based on cotton farming in the surrounding countryside. The population at statehood was 1,312. By 1909, Stroud had two banks, two newspapers, four cotton gins, and a cottonseed-oil mill, but the 1910 census showed population declined to 1,220.

On March 27, 1915 Stroud became the victim of a legendary outlaw: &quot;Henry Starr, along with six other men, decided to rob two banks at the same time... The [Stroud] robbery would prove... disastrous for Henry Starr. Proceeding to rob the Stroud National Bank and the First National Bank, word of the holdup spread quickly and the citizens took up arms against the bandits. Henry and another outlaw named Lewis Estes were wounded and captured in the gun battle. The rest of the gang escaped with $5815...&quot;. Henry was sentenced to prison at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, but was paroled after serving only four years.

The town became quiet until about 1926 when U.S. Route 66 was built. When construction of the highway was completed, Stroud became a rest stop with amenities such as motels, gas stations and restaurants. The Rock Café, built during the Great Depression using local sandstone removed during the construction of Route 66, operated 24 hours a day during its 1950s heyday. Business diminished after the Turner Turnpike diverted cross-country traffic from the town&#x27;s main street.

Stroud was devastated by the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, which destroyed the town&#x27;s 53-store Tanger Outlet Center, as well as a distribution center owned by foodservice company Sygma. Neither of these facilities were rebuilt; the resulting loss of 800 jobs caused a significant amount of economic distress to the town.

In 2001, Pixar crews visited to research US 66 for the animated film Cars, at a time when the town economy was still attempting to recover from the 1999 tornado, and the Rock Café was undergoing historic restoration. The character of Radiator Springs hotelier Sally Carrera is heavily based on Rock Café proprietor Dawn Welch and her efforts to promote and rebuild the town. A fire gutted the restaurant on May 20, 2008 but the grill and the original stone walls survived. The Rock Café was rebuilt by historic preservationist David Burke; Dawn Welch reopened the business on May 29, 2009.

==Geography==

==Economy==
Currently, Stroud is enjoying recovery due to increased economic activity in the oil and gas sectors, and is home to Service King, a manufacturer of oilfield workover rigs. Additionally, tourism and agriculture contribute to the local economy, including the emergence of locally produced wines, and affiliated businesses. International tourists are frequently found travelling historic U.S. 66, the main street of Stroud&#x27;s downtown area. Stroud continues to exploit its location as the centerpoint between Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The city also owns Stroud Midway Industrial Park.

The Sac and Fox national headquarters is located about south of the city and is one of the area&#x27;s largest employers.

<text>Clinton is a city in Custer and Washita counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 8,521 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The community began in 1899 when two men, J.L. Avant and E.E. Blake, decided to locate a town in the Washita River Valley.

Because of governmental stipulations that an Indian could sell no more than one half of a allotment, the men made plans to purchase from four different Indians (Hays, Shoe-Boy, Nowahy, and Night Killer) and paid them each $2,000 for to begin the small settlement of Washita Junction.

Congressional approval for the sale was granted in 1902 and Washita Junction quickly developed. The first businesses were the office of the &quot;Custer County Chronicle&quot; newspaper and the First National Bank building. When a post office was started, the postal department would not accept the name of Washita Junction; so the town was named for Judge Clinton F. Irwin.

Early on, Clinton was well-served by railroads: the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway—which had its depot west of downtown—and both the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad—which had their combined depot east of downtown. In 1909 a group of Clinton businessmen formed the Clinton Street Railway, which ran straight between the two depots particularly to service transferring passengers. But the line’s single gas-powered railcar proved problematic, and service stopped by 1911. In 1912 the line was electrified and restarted, while the new owners talked of extending the tracks north to the county seat of Arapaho, and perhaps even further to Taloga. However, a trolley’s collision in 1914 with an SLSF switch engine, killing one passenger and injuring others, caused the line to dissolve under lawsuits, and the rails were dug up and salvaged by 1915 to pay legal fees.

Clinton particularly benefited from the presence of U.S. Highway 66. Like most other cities and towns on Route 66, Clinton was home of tourist businesses including several restaurants, cafés, motels and filling stations. The Pop Hicks Restaurant was once the longest running restaurant on Route 66. It opened in 1936 and closed after a fire in 1999. The U.S. Highway 66 Association, founded 1927 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, curtailed its activity when World War II rationing of rubber and fuel disrupted leisure travel. After the war, Jack and Gladys Cutberth revived the organization in Clinton, where it promoted the &quot;Main Street of America&quot; from 1947 until it disbanded in the 1980s. Dr. Walter S. Mason Jr. operated a Best Western motel (1964–2003) which welcomed Elvis Presley as an occasional guest in the 1960s.

Today, cross-country traffic passes Clinton to the south on Interstate 40, which bypassed the city in 1970. Clinton remains a popular tourist stop as one of the largest Route 66 cities between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas. Much of the old U.S. 66 route that passed through the city is now designated as an I-40 business loop; the town became home to the first state sponsored Route 66 Museum in the nation.

In 1942, the federal government built a naval airfield at nearby Burns Flat and named it Naval Air Station Clinton. During the World War II period, the population of Clinton grew to nearly 7,000 residents. In 1949, Naval Air Station Clinton was deactivated and the airfield was deeded to the City of Clinton, specifying that the land could be recaptured in case of national emergencies. Later, the government leased the site back and used it as Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base a bomber base supporting 4123rd Strategic Wing, then the 70th Bombardment Wing, Heavy of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), operating B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft. Purchasing more land, the site soon expanded to more than , where both the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy utilized the airfield for both operational and training purposes. When military operations were de-emphasized, the Clinton-Sherman base was designated for closure in 1969. The entire complex was deeded to the City of Clinton in 1971 and three years later became the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark.

Clinton is also home to the &quot;Clinton Daily News&quot;, a five-day daily newspaper edited by Sean Stephens which has a circulation of 4,500. The newspaper has been published continuously from its inception in 1927 to the current day.

<text>Hammon is a town in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, the majority of which is in Roger Mills County, but some of which extends into Custer County. It is located at the junction of Oklahoma State Highways 33 and 34.

The town is named for Indian agent James H. Hammon, who was assigned to the Red Moon Agency near the future site of Hammon. This was a subagency of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Agency at Darlington, north of Fort Reno, and his mission was to build a reservation school and to teach the Cheyenne and Arapaho to farm. His wife, Ida M. Hammon, was postmaster when a post office was established in their home on June 30, 1894.

The townsite was originally located in Custer County, but when the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railroad (later known as the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway) laid track west of the town in 1910, the majority of the town was moved west into Roger Mills County to be near the railroad. On May 22, 1911, the board of county commissioners accepted the incorporation of the town.

<text>Davis is a city in Garvin and Murray counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population is 2,823 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Davis is named after Samuel H. Davis, who moved to Washita in what was then Indian Territory in 1887. At the time of its founding, the community was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

Davis owned a dry goods store, which was four miles south of the current town of Davis. Davis submitted a petition for a Santa Fe depot to be built near his store, and the petition was accepted. In 1890, he also successfully petitioned for a post office to be built. The post office was supposed to be named after Nelson Chigley, a Chickasaw Indian who owned the land on which the town was to be built. Chigley was already an Indian Territory name, so it was named after Davis. The town was established on November 16, 1898. It is located 23 miles north of Ardmore and 23 miles south of Pauls Valley.

By 1900, Davis had 57 businesses, two banks, 10 doctors, three dentists, and three lawyers. Cotton farming was a common occupation in Davis, which was in one of the best cotton producing sections in Oklahoma.

Later, when U.S. Interstate 35 was constructed, it was built two miles to the west of Davis.

<text>Blanchard is a city in McClain and Grady counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 8,879 at the 2020 census, up from 7,670 at the 2010 census. Blanchard is part of a rapidly growing area of northern McClain and Grady counties known as the &quot;Tri-City Area&quot; with Newcastle and Tuttle.

==History==
The center of Blanchard is situated in Township 8 North, Range 4 West, Section 30 in northwestern McClain County. Named after William G. &quot;Bill&quot; Blanchard, the community was organized originally by the Canadian Valley Construction Company, which also planned to build a railroad. However, the company went into bankruptcy, and the railroad came under the control of the Oklahoma Central Railroad which also experienced financial problems. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway took over and completed the line.

The townsite was established by three lot sales beginning with the Canadian Valley Construction Company sale on September 19, 1906. The second sale was held on July 18, 1907, and final lots were sold on March 25, 1908, by the Blanchard Townsite Company. Within a year the town was described as having forty business establishments, including a state and a national bank, four blacksmith shops, three livery barns, two grain elevators, and a weekly newspaper.

Several incorporation dates are reported in various publications about the history of Blanchard, and the town offices as well. The most reliable source seems to be the &quot;Blanchard Record&quot; of October 25, 1907, which reported, &quot;That Blanchard is now an incorporated town is realized by but a few of our citizens. The petition praying for incorporation was favorably acted upon at the [federal] courts at Chickasha last week. On or about November 19 notice of an election of officers will be given. In the meantime, candidates will be chosen.&quot;

A population of 629 was reported by 1910, and 1,040 in 1930. The Blanchard post office charter was granted by the Post Office Department on December 19, 1906. Mail had previously been received at Womack. When Arthur H. &quot;Art&quot; and Bill Blanchard moved their store from Womack to the new townsite in 1906, they took the post office with them.

In 1909, the Northern District Court was established whereby McClain County was divided into two sections for legal matters for the convenience of the citizens. A courthouse was built in Blanchard, and the first case began on December 13, 1909. The district was disestablished in the late 1920s and combined with District One in Purcell, the county seat. At the turn of the 21st-century legal records could be found at Blanchard.

==Geography==
Blanchard is located in northwestern McClain County. The city limits extend west into Grady County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.38%, are water.

U.S. Route 62 passes through the center of town as 2nd Street, leading northeast to the center of Oklahoma City and southwest to Chickasha. Oklahoma State Highway 76 heads north out of town on Main Street, ending after in the northern part of Newcastle. Highway 76 leads south to Lindsay.

Blanchard consists of one square mile &quot;core&quot; of streets roughly laid out in a grid pattern, situated atop a gentle hill surrounded by newer development and agricultural areas within about a radius of the center. Central Blanchard, located in McClain County, consists of homes (about half built before 1960), several churches and a historic Main Street downtown area. The commercial downtown features antique shops, eating establishments, city services, senior center, and a fitness center.

On the periphery of the city center are schools, businesses, and modern housing subdivisions. These subdivisions tend to be low-density (typically one to lots.)

While Blanchard is often described as a commuter town with much of its workforce commuting to nearby Norman and Oklahoma City, local businesses are beginning to surge. As of 2008, local amenities included a supermarket, several restaurants, a public library, banks, a large building supply center, a new hardware store, and a large car dealership.

Residents of Blanchard tend to view it as a small-town environment with character and charm, but the rapid growth in the area has brought change. To keep the town from being swallowed by urban sprawl, a large annexation was effected in 2004 to provide Blanchard with a &quot;buffer zone&quot;. A Main Street beautification project is underway and infrastructure is being improved to handle the rise in population. In 2007, several older buildings in central Blanchard were removed to allow the widening of U.S. 62, yet the historic downtown commercial buildings were preserved.

<text>Allen is a town in Hughes and Pontotoc counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 805 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town was founded in 1883 by a group of white settlers who had arrived in Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory in 1882 from Gainesville, Texas, led by Confederate Army veteran Doctor John Trigg Gilmore, his wife, Elizabeth Louise Oliveaux, their children, and relatives William and George McCall, with their respective families. They first settled in Cold Springs, northwest of the present town site, where other settlers soon joined them. The first log cabin was built in Allen in 1883, and this building was used as both a school and church. The town was named after the son of deputy United States marshal William McCall.

Allen, Oklahoma is the modern-day site of the Battle of Middle Boggy during the American Civil War.

In 1892, Dr. Gilmore became Allen&#x27;s first postmaster and founded the town&#x27;s first Masonic Lodge two years later.

The Missouri, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railway built a line through the area in 1909, although it bypassed Allen, by a half-mile.

Allen became a boomtown in 1913, when an oil well was drilled west of the town. The population rose from 645 in 1910 to 1,389 in 1930, but dropped to 907 in 1970. Its principal industries besides petroleum are ranching and agriculture.

<doc id="150961" wikidata="Q1778752" url="?curid=150961" title="Ponca City, Oklahoma">
<text>Ponca City () is a city in Kay County in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The city was named after the Ponca tribe. Ponca City had a population of 24,424 in the 2020 census, down from 25,387 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==

Ponca City was created in 1893 as &quot;New Ponca&quot; after the United States opened the Cherokee Outlet for European-American settlement during the Cherokee Strip land run, the largest land run in United States history. The site for Ponca City was selected for its proximity to the Arkansas River, a railway, and the presence of a freshwater spring near the river at what is modern 13th Street and South Avenue in Ponca City. The city was laid out by Burton Barnes, who drew up the first survey of the city and sold certificates for the lots he had surveyed. After the drawing for lots in the city was completed, Barnes was elected the city&#x27;s first mayor.

Another city, Cross, vied with Ponca City to become the leading city in the area. After the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway had opened a station in Cross, people thought it would not open another in Ponca City because of the two cities&#x27; proximity. New Ponca boosters eventually secured a station after offering the Santa Fe station agent two town lots and the free relocation of his house from Cross. Ponca City reportedly obtained its first boxcar station by some Ponca City supporters going to Cross and returning with the town&#x27;s station pulled behind them. Cross eventually became defunct, and today, what was once Cross is now a residential district in Ponca City. In 1913, New Ponca changed its name to Ponca City.

===Petroleum industry===

Ponca City&#x27;s history and economy has been shaped chiefly by the ebb and flow of the petroleum industry. E. W. Marland, a Pennsylvania oil man, came to Oklahoma and founded the Marland Oil Company, which once controlled about 10% of the world&#x27;s oil reserves. He founded the 101 Ranch Oil Company, located on the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch, and drilled his first successful oil well on land he leased in 1911 from the Ponca tribe of American Indians. He was elected in 1932 as a U.S. congressman and in 1934 as governor of Oklahoma.

Marland&#x27;s exploitation of oil reserves generated growth and wealth that were previously unimaginable on the Oklahoma prairie, and his company virtually built the city from the ground up. Marland and his associates built mansions to display their new wealth, including the Grand Home and the E.W. Marland Estate (once called the &quot;Palace on the Prairie&quot;). Because of this period of wealth and affluence, Ponca City has a high concentration of buildings that exemplify the popular Spanish Colonial Revival architecture of the period, as well as Art Deco-influenced buildings and homes.

The &quot;Roaring &#x27;20s&quot; came to an end for Ponca City shortly before the Great Depression. After a successful takeover bid by J.P. Morgan, Jr., son of financier J.P. Morgan, Marland Oil Co. merged with Continental Oil Co. in the late 1920s. It was known as Conoco for more than 70 years. The company maintained its headquarters in Ponca City until 1949 and continued to grow into a global corporation.

During the oil boom years of the 1980s, Conoco was owned by the DuPont Corp., which took control of the company in 1981. After nearly two decades of ownership and an oil bust that crippled Oklahoma&#x27;s economy in the late 1980s, DuPont sold off its Conoco assets in 1998. In 2002, Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum (another major petroleum player with roots in northern Oklahoma) to become ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips was then the sixth-largest publicly traded oil company in the world, and the third largest in the United States. It maintains a significant presence in its historic home state.

Since the company has reduced its workforce and facilities in the city, the population has declined steadily since the early 1990s. In February 2009, ConocoPhillips announced that all of its remaining nonrefinery operations in Ponca City (representing 750 jobs) would be moved out of the city. The city&#x27;s recent efforts to grow its economy beyond the petroleum industry have attracted a number of technology, manufacturing, and service jobs.

In 2005, ConocoPhillips announced plans to build a $5 million museum across from its Ponca City refinery. Opened to the public in May 2007, the Conoco Museum features artifacts, photographs, and other historical items related to the petroleum industry and its culture in northern Oklahoma. A sister museum, Phillips Petroleum Company Museum, was to be opened in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Funded by a private foundation, the Conoco Museum charges no admission fee.

In 2012, ConocoPhillips split into two separate companies, with the upstream portion retaining the ConocoPhillips name and the refining and transportation portions taking the name Phillips 66.

Based in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 continues to operate a 200,000-barrel-per-day refinery. Phillips 66 | Ponca City Refinery in Ponca City.

===Native Americans===
Until recently, European Americans&#x27; accounts of their settlement and the growth of the oil industry in Ponca City have often overshadowed both the long ancient history of indigenous peoples in the area, and those tribes who were resettled to Oklahoma in the 19th century under Indian Removal.

Ponca City is named after the Ponca tribe, part of whom were relocated from Nebraska to northern Oklahoma from 1877 to 1880. Like all of the forced American Indigenous removals of the 19th century, the Poncas&#x27; trek was arduous. Followed by the United States government&#x27;s failure to provide adequate supplies and malaria at their destination, nearly one-third of the Ponca died from illness and exposure. &quot;Out of 700 Ponca who left the Nebraska reservation, 158 died in Oklahoma within two years.&quot;

The Ponca protested their conditions. An additional irritant occurred upon the death of Standing Bear&#x27;s oldest son in 1879. The chief had promised to bury him in his homeland, and about 60 Ponca accompanied him back to Nebraska. The U.S. Army was ordered to arrest them for having left the reservation, and they were confined to Fort Omaha. Most of the tribal members who left eventually returned to the reservation in Oklahoma. With the aid of prominent attorneys working &quot;pro bono&quot;, Standing Bear filed a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; challenging his arrest. The case of &quot;Standing Bear v. Crook&quot; (1879) was a landmark decision in the U.S. District Court, where the judge ruled that Indians had the same legal rights as other United States citizens.

A statue of Standing Bear was erected in his honor at the intersection of Highway 60 and Standing Bear Parkway in Ponca City. In the late 20th century, the city developed a park and museum named in his honor. In addition to the Standing Bear Museum, the 63-acre park includes more than eight fully developed acres with off street parking, a one-acre pond and a walking trail.

The Ponca Nation, which has kept its headquarters south of Ponca City since 1879, played a major part in the development of the Marland Oil Company and the city. Chief White Eagle leased resource-containing portions of the tribe&#x27;s allotted land to E.W. Marland in 1911 for oil exploration and development.

Since the late 20th century, the Ponca tribe has worked to build its infrastructure and improve services for its people. In February 2006, the tribe received a grant of more than $800,000 from the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota for debt retirement and economic development.

Nearby north-central tribes are the Kaw, Osage, Otoe-Missouria, Pawnee, and Tonkawa. These are all federally recognized tribes, as is the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. In 1994, the six tribes established the Standing Bear Foundation and Pow-wow, beginning the first of annual shared pow-wows, to which they invite the public. They wanted to build collaboration among the tribes and with the non-Native residents of Ponca City. The pow-wow is now held in Standing Bear Park.

E. W. Marland built the Ponca City refinery in 1918 and founded the Marland Oil Company. In 1929, the Continental Oil Company merged with Marland, and the two became Conoco Inc. The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when they moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002, Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company, whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma, merged into ConocoPhillips. In 2012, ConocoPhillips split into two separate companies, with the upstream portion retaining the ConocoPhillips name and the refining and transportation portions taking the name Phillips 66. The Ponca City Refinery, operated by Phillips 66, is the largest refinery in Oklahoma.

The Ponca City Refinery processes a mixture of light, medium, and heavy crude oils. Most of the crude oil processed is received by pipeline from Oklahoma, Texas, and Canada. Infrastructure improvements have enabled the delivery of increased volumes of locally produced advantaged crude oil by pipeline and truck. The refinery is a high-conversion facility that produces a full range of products, including gasoline, diesel, aviation fuels, liquefied petroleum gas, and anode-grade petroleum coke. Its facilities include two fluid catalytic cracking units, alkylation, delayed coking, naphtha reforming, and hydrodesulfurization units. Finished petroleum products are shipped by truck, railcar, and pipelines to markets throughout the Midcontinent region.

===Pioneer Woman statue and museum===
Ponca City is the site of the Pioneer Woman Museum and the &quot;Pioneer Woman&quot; statue. The statue was erected to commemorate women pioneers. In the early 1920s, E. W. Marland decided to create a statue commemorating the pioneer woman. Marland was reportedly asked, &quot;E. W., why don&#x27;t you have ... a statue to the vanishing American, a Ponca, Otoe, or an Osage - a monument of great size?&quot; Marland answered, &quot;the Indian is not the vanishing American - it&#x27;s the pioneer woman.&quot; He sponsored a competition for the winning statue.

In 1927, miniature sculptures were submitted as part of a competition by 12 U.S. and international sculptors: John Gregory, Maurice Sterne, Hermon Atkins MacNeil, James Earle Fraser, Alexander Stirling Calder, Wheeler Williams, Mario Korbel, F. Lynn Jenkins, Mahonri Young, Arthur Lee, Jo Davidson, and Bryant Baker. They were displayed in 12 cities around the state, where they were viewed by 750,000 people, who voted for their favorite. The original submissions have been on display at the museum at Woolaroc near Bartlesville, Oklahoma since the 1930s. Marland sold them to Frank Phillips after losing control of the Marland Oil Company.

British-born American sculptor Bryant Baker was chosen as the winner. His full-scale work was unveiled in a public ceremony on April 22, 1930. About 40,000 guests came to hear Will Rogers pay tribute to Oklahoma&#x27;s pioneers. The statue is high and weighs 12,000 lb. Widely known as the Pioneer Woman Statue, the bronze sculpture&#x27;s true name is &quot;Confident&quot;.

A related museum commemorating Oklahoma women was opened on September 16, 1958, on the 65th anniversary of the Cherokee Strip land run. It recognizes the work of Native American, as well as European-American women, and their leadership and stamina in creating homes, raising children, and taking care of the work of sustaining life and communities.

<text>Cashion is a town in Kingfisher and Logan counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The Logan County portion of Cashion is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 850 as of the 2020 United States census, up 6% from the 802 reported at the 2010 census.

==History==
Cashion began as the town of Downs, Oklahoma on a hill south of the Cimarron River. The Oklahoma legislature had once passed a bill to make Downs the capitol of Oklahoma Territory, but the bill was vetoed a few days later by George W. Steele, the first governor of the territory. Once when later Governor A.J. Seay was on the road and spent the night in Downs, the townspeople claimed they were the capitol for that night because the governor had the Great Seal of Oklahoma Territory with him at the time.

In 1900, the Guthrie and Kingfisher Railway (later part of the Rock Island Railroad), which was building east from Kingfisher, and the Guthrie and Western Railway (an affiliate of the Santa Fe Railroad), which was building west from Seward, agreed to connect at a point a half-mile south of Downs. The site was on land owned by the Guthrie &amp; Kingfisher Improvement Company, which sold lots, with the area becoming the town of Cashion. Since supplies to Downs had up to this point only been moved by wagons, the merchants in Downs, wanting to be on the rail line, relocated to Cashion along with most of the residences, leaving the former Downs site as agricultural land.

Cashion was named for Roy Cashion of Hennessey, Oklahoma. Roy, a graduate of the Hennessy Class of 1897, had a strong passion and belief in the freedom of the Cuban people. His graduation speech was entitled &quot;Liberty for Cuba&quot;. When the territorial governor asked for volunteers, Cashion&#x27;s name was first one on the list. He passed through this area on his way to join Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders in the Spanish–American War. On July 1, 1898, Cashion was killed by a gunshot to the head in the famous charge on San Juan Hill in Cuba. He is believed to be the first Oklahoman to die in battle on foreign soil.

Incorporated in Oklahoma Territory in 1901, Cashion experienced a boom. Its growth peaked by 1915 and 1916. At this time, two railroads were running two trains a day into town from both Guthrie (the Santa Fe) and Kingfisher (the Rock Island). An oil boom brought in the &quot;Cashion Pool&quot;, which was considered the largest single pool ever discovered. It ran from south of Cashion to just west of Enid.

Cashion was known as &quot;The Town Too Tough to Die&quot;. While the neighboring towns of Downs, Wandell, Big Four, Lockridge, Navina, Reeding, Columbia and Lincoln Town all folded up and vanished in the Great Depression or shortly thereafter, Cashion hung on. However, the population declined as farms failed in the surrounding area. The Santa Fe Railroad abandoned its line in 1934, and the Rock Island removed its track in 1937. The population dropped from 291 in 1930 to 232 in 1940, then to its all-time low of 182 in 1950.

A resurgent economy created more jobs in nearby Guthrie and Kingfisher, causing new residents to move into Cashion. In 1960, the census recorded 221 residents. The 1970 census recorded 329. The 2020 census reports the population of the town as 850.

In August of 2020, Cashion made national news after a police officer, Charlie Missinne, tasered a 65 year old woman after a traffic stop for a broken car light. The woman was said by the officer to be &quot;resisting arrest&quot; The woman later accepted a plea bargain for misdemeanor charges of &quot;resisting an officer, obstruction, eluding and officer and operating a vehicle with defective equipment.&quot;

Railroad executives and investors made an inspection trip on the newly built line; at each designated station a name was drawn from a hat, and that name was used to designate the new town.

<text>Bartlesville is a city mostly in Washington County and Osage County, Oklahoma. The population was 37,290 at the 2020 census. Bartlesville is north of Tulsa and south of the Kansas border. It is the county seat of Washington County. The Caney River runs through Bartlesville.

Bartlesville is the primary city of the Bartlesville Micropolitan area, which consists of Washington County and had a population of 51,843 in 2018. A small portion of the city is in Osage County. The city is also part of the Tulsa Combined Statistical Area, with a population of 1,151,172 in 2015.

Bartlesville is notable as the longtime home of Phillips Petroleum Company. Frank Phillips founded Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville in 1905 when the area was still an Indian Territory. The company merged with Conoco as ConocoPhillips and later split into the two independent companies, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips. Both companies have retained some operations in Bartlesville, but they have moved their corporate headquarters to Houston.

It is one of two places in Oklahoma where a Lenape Native American tribe lives, the other being Anadarko.

==History==
Jacob Bartles, son-in-law of Delaware chief Charles Journeycake, moved from Wyandotte County, Kansas, to Indian Territory in 1873. He settled first at Silver Lake, a natural lake south of the present city of Bartlesville. In 1874, he opened a trading post and post office on Turkey Creek, in what is now East Bartlesville. In the following year, he bought a grist mill on the Caney River and modified it to produce flour. Bartles then built a two-story general store and residence, and added a rooming house, a blacksmith shop and a livery stable. Other settlers soon moved into the immediate area, which was then called Bartles Town. In 1880, Bartles moved his Turkey Creek post office to this town. Bartles then provided the community with electricity, a telephone system and a water distribution system.

Development of the present city began after William Johnstone and George B. Keeler opened a general store on the south side of the Caney River in 1884. The first newspaper, &quot;The Weekly Magnet&quot;, began publication in March 1895. The town was incorporated in Indian Territory in January 1897. The town was surveyed and platted in 1898, and eighty acres were offered to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad for a depot. The railroad, though its Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway subsidiary, reached the town in 1899. The post office was moved from &quot;North Bartlesville&quot; in 1899. Bypassed by the railroad, Jacob Bartles moved his store to what became Dewey, Oklahoma.

Bartlesville was also home to Frank Phillips (November 28, 1873 – August 23, 1950) who along with his brother, Lee Eldas &quot;L.E.&quot; Phillips Sr founded Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville in 1917 and made Bartlesville the headquarters of Phillips 66. The new company began with assets of $3 million, 27 employees and leases throughout Oklahoma and Kansas but grew to become a multi-billion dollar oil company. Although Bartlesville is no longer the headquarters, the company still has many employees in the community. In 2002, Phillips Petroleum merged with Conoco Oil Company and became ConocoPhillips.

Bartlesville was originally a sundown town where African Americans were not allowed to live. By 1907, the restriction had been lifted, and newspapers noted the town&#x27;s first natural death of an African American, a man named Robert McGee.

In 1957, Bartlesville was the test site for the first experiment in pay cable television. The Bartlesville Telemovie System debuted with the film &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, starring Doris Day, and aired it to an audience of 300 homes. The headline of the September 4, 1957, issue of &quot;Variety&quot; read, &quot;First-Run Films Now at Home&quot;. However, after only nine months of operation, on Friday, June 6, 1958, Telemovie signed off forever.

Bartlesville was struck by an EF4 tornado that also heavily impacted Barnsdall on May 6, 2024. Debris cleanup and other recovery efforts were ongoing as of July 2024.

==Geography==

The Caney River flows through Bartlesville, separating the downtown area from the east side. The river flooded in October 1986 as a result of unusually heavy rainfall. The city was split in half for several days, and the flood caused considerable property damage. The river broke its banks again in June 2007, cresting five feet below the 1986 level. The Pathfinder Parkway, a paved trail for walking, running, and cycling, runs alongside the Caney River.

Bartlesville is familiar with both very hot conditions in the summer with a record high of and with very cold conditions with a record of low of . However, even with this record of extremes, the climate of Bartlesville is considered humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with cool winters and hot summers, with the majority of precipitation falling in spring, between the months of April and June.

==Economy==
Oklahoma&#x27;s first commercial oil well, the Nellie Johnstone, discovered oil on 15 April 1897 along a bank of the Caney River, near Bartlesville.

Before its merger with Conoco, Phillips Petroleum Company had its headquarters in Bartlesville. After ConocoPhillips formed, the combined company established a global systems and services office in Bartlesville. ConocoPhillips spun most of its operations not related to exploration and production to form a new company, Phillips 66, in 2012. The two companies combined employ or contract with more than 3,800 people in the area. Chevron Phillips also has an office here.

Phillips Petroleum had a large presence in Bartlesville. A writer for the Tacoma (Washington) &quot;News Tribune&quot; said, &quot;I never quite understood why the town where I spent my high school years wasn&#x27;t named Phillipsburg. Nearly everything else in town was named after the Phillips Petroleum company or its founder&quot;.

The Bartlesville area has two industrial parks, the Bartlesville Industrial Park and the Sunset Industrial Park. The Bartlesville Industrial Park landed a multi-million dollar lithium-ion battery recycling plant in September 2023.

=== Tourism ===

Price Tower, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, stands in downtown Bartlesville. It is Wright&#x27;s only realized skyscraper, and one of only two vertically oriented Wright structures extant (the other is the S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower in Racine, Wisconsin).

The nearby Bartlesville Community Center, designed by William Wesley Peters, one of Wright&#x27;s students, hosts OKM Music, an annual week-long music event in June. Begun in 1985 as the &quot;OK Mozart&quot; International Festival, and organized around the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the festival featured performances of classical music, jazz, light opera, and more. World-renowned musicians who have performed at OK Mozart include Itzhak Perlman, Joyce Yang, Joshua Bell, and André Watts. Around 2018 the festival renamed itself OKM Music to signify that it was broadening its range beyond the predominantly classical music it had featured for much of its 33-year history. The Community Center also hosts the concerts presented by the Bartlesville Community Concert Association.

The city also hosts several annual festivals and shows, nearly all focused in the downtown. Sunfest is the first weekend of June. It includes an arts and crafts show, a music festival, a kids festival, and a classic cars show. A second classic air show and festival is held in the fall. An Oklahoma Indian Summer Festival is held at the Community Center downtown each fall.

Bartlesville&#x27;s downtown revitalization efforts are in full swing, with many blocks of the National Register Historic District, and the catalyst project, the once burned out May Brothers and 1904 Buildings, coming to completion at the downtown&#x27;s center. The original Kress Building has been taken over by Bartlesville Monthly Magazine and restored. Downtown Bartlesville Inc., the Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority, the Bartlesville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and the Bartlesville Development Authority work in tandem to promote this thriving &quot;Next City&quot;.

Frank Phillips&#x27;s former home is a museum maintained by the Oklahoma Historical Society. His ranch and retreat about southwest of Bartlesville is called Woolaroc (a portmanteau of the words woods&quot;, lakes&quot;, &quot;rocks&quot;). A working ranch of , Woolaroc houses a museum exhibiting Phillips&#x27;s extensive collections of Native American, western, and fine art. It holds one of the most complete private collections of Colt firearms in the world. The property includes the Phillips family&#x27;s lodge and mausoleum, along with a huge wildlife preserve with herds of American bison, elk, Texas longhorn cattle, water buffalo, zebra, and more than 20 other animal species.

The Phillips Petroleum Company Museum shows the early days of petroleum production in Oklahoma and the evolution of Phillips Petroleum in that industry. Admission is free.

A Wall of Honor is inside Washington Park Mall, with names of service members listed on panels beside cabinets that display military artifacts, photos, story boards, POW/MIA listings, and other exhibits. A special display honors Lance Corporal Thomas A. Blair, Oklahoma&#x27;s first casualty during the Iraq War.

Bruce Goff designed &quot;Shin&#x27;enKan&quot; (&quot;The House of the Far Away Heart&quot;) in 1956. Built for Joe D. Price as his house and studio, it was destroyed by fire in December 1996. Bartlesville is the home of multiple other Goff buildings, a home for the Price Pipe and Supply Family by Frank Lloyd Wright, and numerous homes by the Kansas City architect Edward Buehler Delk, most notably LaQuinta. The Conference Basketball tournament for The Great American Conference is hosted in Bartlesville.

<text>Sand Springs is a city in Osage, Creek and Tulsa counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. A western suburb of Tulsa, it is located predominantly in Tulsa County. The population was 19,874 in the 2020 U. S. Census, an increase of 5.1 percent from the figure of 18,906 recorded in 2010.

==History==
The city was founded in 1911, by philanthropist Charles Page, a wealthy businessman in Oklahoma. He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows. Page helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.

Page bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook &amp; Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa, were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.

Page decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children&#x27;s home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the Sand Springs Railway, an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year. Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.

In 1911, Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.

Some of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; Empire Chandelier Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf. Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H. Kerr company, which made fruit jars, were the only glass companies remaining in business as recently as 1955. In 1965, Sand Springs annexed Prattville, on the south side of the Arkansas River, an event that would explain the large jump in population in the 1960s.

In 1935, Commander Mills&#x27; workers picketed against purported incompliance by mill administration following the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. Parleys between mill officials and workers were initiated February 14th, with unionized mill workers demanding full accordance with the act&#x27;s codes and ordinances. The disagreement between mill officials and workers was over section 7-A of the N.R.A., stating that employees had the right to self organization. Mill officials disagreed, stating section 7-A was invalid by decree of the courts. On April 4th, a brawl between union and non-union workers broke out at the gates of Commander Mills, ending in several injuries and one arrest. The following month, multiple mill workers subsequently began with acts of violence and terrorism in retaliation against mill officials and non-union workers. Totaling eleven explosions (twelve attempts in total, one failed to explode), four shootings, and one assault, the criminal campaign lasted from May 5th to July 4th.

Sand Springs Children&#x27;s Home is still operating, caring for school-age children in a family-style setting, and with an Independent Living program for graduated students. The facility supports Camp Charles, which is an eight-acre camp in Grove on Grand Lake, where the kids get to camp, cookout, swim, ski and take boat rides. The Charles Page Family Village, formerly known as the Widow&#x27;s colony, provides duplex housing to 110 mothers and their children at no cost for rent, utilities or home maintenance.

An EF2 tornado hit Sand Springs on March 25, 2015, killing one resident, injuring 30 citizens, and damaging 50 mobile homes.

On November 26, 2018, Clyde Boyd Middle School had a CO leak. The leak started sometime during the morning. Between 11:15 a.m. and 12:58 p.m., five students went home ill, and between 1:15 to 1:35, seven more students became sick. At approximately 2:27, an announcement on the intercom instructed all the students to &quot;go to the new gym&quot;. Many students went to hospital from carbon monoxide poisoning. &quot;There was no evidence of the presence of carbon monoxide in the 6th Grade Center&quot;. Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn&#x27;t have carbon monoxide detectors at the time, which the district said: &quot;it&#x27;ll resolve&quot;. The school was closed for several days while the problem was fixed. The district has now installed proper carbon monoxide detectors.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.0 square miles (54.3 km), of which 18.7 square miles (48.4 km) is land and 2.3 square miles (5.9 km) (10.84%) is water.

<text>Skiatook (Skī·ǎ·tōōk &quot;or&quot; Skī·ǎ·tǒǒk versus Skī·tōōk &quot;or&quot; Skī·tǒǒk) is a city in Osage and Tulsa counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma located in the northeastern part of the state, approximately 20 miles north and west of Tulsa. Due to its location on the border between Osage County and Tulsa County, Skiatook has been referred to as &quot;the Gateway to the Osage.&quot; The town includes the state highway junction of Oklahoma State Highway 11 and Oklahoma State Highway 20.

==History==
===19th century===
====Battle of Chustenahlah====
The Battle of Chustenahlah was fought just west of Skiatook, on December 26, 1861, during the American Civil War. The battle began when Confederate Col. James McIntosh ordered an attack on the Union aligned Creek Chief Opothleyahola&#x27;s forces. Opothleyahola was travelling with about 1,700 Creek and Seminole refugees following his defeat at the Battle of Chusto-Talasah. After being defeated by the Confederate forces, many refugees were forced to abandoned their supplies as they fled to Kansas. 
A historical marker commemorates the battle.

====Founding and origin of name====
William C. Rogers, last hereditary Chief of the Cherokees, founded Skiatook in 1872, when he established a trading post in the Cherokee Nation on the south bank of Bird Creek. When a post office was established in Rogers&#x27; store in 1872, the place was named Ski-a-took. The word is Cherokee in origin, and means &quot;Big-Indian-Me&quot; or refers to something of large size. An Osage trader, &quot;Skiatooka&quot; is also cited as influencing the town&#x27;s name. In 1892, the name was changed from Ski-a-took to Skiatook.

===20th century===

On December 18, 1904, a bank was established on the present day location of Skiatook. William C. Rogers relocated his general store and post office to the town and began building near the bank. In March 1905 the Midland Valley Railroad was built through the town and the settlement expanded to include parts of Osage County and the Osage Nation. The route no longer exists, but has been converted from rail into the 14.5 mile Osage Prairie Trail linking Skiatook with Tulsa to the south. Skiatook&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Skiatook Sentinel&quot;, began publication in April 1905 and the town was incorporated shortly after on May 28, 1905. Skiatook&#x27;s first school was also founded in 1905.

After Oklahoma Statehood in 1907, construction began on permanent roads and bridges.
The first church building constructed in Skiatook was the First Christian Church in 1907.
Cement sidewalks were constructed between 1909 and 1910, and in 1912 Skiatook received water, sewer and electric light improvements.
By 1920, the towns population had increased to around 2000.
A road to Tulsa was paved in the early 1920s, and with good roads leading out in all directions, Skiatook became known as the &quot;Gateway to all points North, South, East and West&quot;.
In the 1930s, Skiatook began purchasing water from Lake Spavinaw.
The completion of Skiatook Lake in 1984 gave Skiatook its own water source.

===21st century===
In the 2000s, Skiatook commissioned a &quot;Main Street program&quot; in order to revitalize its downtown area.

In 1922, the town approved a new high school and junior high to be built. In 1929, the original school building burned down, leading to the building of a new elementary school in 1930. In the 1960s a new junior high school was built and in 1968 Mars Elementary was built. In 1976, the current high school was built with a sports complex added in 1978, an auditorium added in 1979. A football stadium, baseball field, soccer field, and agriculture building were also built around the high school. In 1990, Newman Middle School was built and named after former Superintendent Jim Newman.

Currently operating Skiatook Public Schools include: 
*Joyce Jech Early Childhood Center
*Mars Elementary
*Skiatook Elementary
*Skiatook Intermediate Elementary
*Newman Middle School
*Skiatook High School
*Skiatook Virtual Academy (virtual school for 6th-12th grades)

==Arts and culture==

The Skiatook Museum was organized in April 1976. In the early 21st century, the Skiatook Museum moved into the former home of doctor W. G. Phillips. The home, built in 1912, contained his office.

==Media==

Skiatook in film
*Parts of the 1983 film adaptation of S.E. Hinton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; were filmed in locations around Skiatook, but it was called Windrixville.
*Parts of the 2020 film &quot;Minari&quot; were filmed in and around Skiatook.

<doc id="150969" wikidata="Q44989" url="?curid=150969" title="Tulsa, Oklahoma">
<text>Tulsa ( ) is the second-most-populous city in the state of Oklahoma, after Oklahoma City, and the 48th-most-populous city in the United States. The population was 413,066 as of the 2020 census. It is the principal municipality of the Tulsa metropolitan area, a region with 1,034,123 residents. The city serves as the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, with urban development extending into Osage, Rogers and Wagoner counties.

Tulsa was settled between 1828 and 1836 by the Lochapoka Band of Creek Native American tribe and most of Tulsa is still part of the territory of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.

Historically, a robust energy sector fueled Tulsa&#x27;s economy; however, today the city has diversified and leading sectors include finance, aviation, telecommunications and technology. Two institutions of higher education within the city have sports teams at the NCAA Division I level: the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University. As well, the University of Oklahoma has a secondary campus at the Tulsa Schusterman Center, and Oklahoma State University has a secondary campus located in downtown Tulsa. For most of the 20th century, the city held the nickname &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot; and played a major role as one of the most important hubs for the American oil industry.

It is situated on the Arkansas River between the Osage Hills and the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in northeast Oklahoma, a region of the state known as &quot;Green Country&quot;. Considered the cultural and arts center of Oklahoma, Tulsa houses two art museums, full-time professional opera and ballet companies, and one of the nation&#x27;s largest concentrations of art deco architecture.

== History ==


The area where Tulsa now exists is considered Indian Territory, on the land of the Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo), Wahzhazhe Ma zha (Osage), Muscogee (Creek), and Caddo tribes, among others, before it was first formally settled by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 1836. They established a small settlement under the Creek Council Oak Tree at the present-day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. They named their new settlement &quot;Tallasi&quot;, meaning &quot;old town&quot; in Creek, which later became &quot;Tulsa&quot;. The area around Tulsa was also settled by members of the other so-called &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; who had been relocated to Oklahoma from the Southern United States. Most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the Cherokee and Osage Nations.

Although Oklahoma was not yet a state during the Civil War, the Tulsa area saw its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah took place on the north side of Tulsa and several battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction treaties with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.

===Incorporation and &quot;Oil Capital&quot; prosperity===
Around August 1, 1882, the town was almost centered at a location just north of the current Whittier Square, when a construction crew laying out the line of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad chose that spot for a sidetrack. However, an area merchant persuaded them to move the site further west into the Muscogee Nation, which had friendlier laws for white business owners. On January 18, 1898, Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected Edward E. Calkins as the city&#x27;s first mayor.

Tulsa was still a micro town near the banks of the Arkansas River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1, was established. Much of the oil was discovered on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the Osage Nation under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the grand Glenn Pool Oil Reserve (located approximately south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of Glenpool) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area&#x27;s growing number of oil fields; Tulsa&#x27;s population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930. Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the South and Texas, many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest. This migration distinguished the city&#x27;s demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa&#x27;s upscale neighborhoods.

Known as the &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot; for most of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s success in the energy industry prompted construction booms in the popular Art Deco style of the time. Profits from the oil industry continued through the Great Depression, helping the city&#x27;s economy fare better than most in the United States during the 1930s.

In 1923, Harwelden was built by oil baron E. P. Harwell and his wife Mary, and is an example of prosperity in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the 1920s.

===1921 race massacre===

In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to the &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;, one of the most prosperous Black communities in the United States at the time. Located in the Greenwood neighborhood, it was the site of the Tulsa Race Massacre, said to be &quot;the single worst incident of racial violence in American history&quot;, in which mobs of White Tulsans killed Black Tulsans, looted and robbed the Black community, and burned down homes and businesses. Sixteen hours of massacring on May 31 and June 1, 1921, ended only when National Guardsmen were brought in by the governor. An official report later claimed that 23 Black and 16 White citizens were killed, but other estimates suggest as many as 300 people died, most of them Black. Over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, and an estimated 1,000 Black people were left homeless as 35 city blocks, composed of 1,256 residences, were destroyed by fire. Property damage was estimated at . Efforts to obtain reparations for survivors of the violence have been unsuccessful, but the events were re-examined by the city and state in the early 21st century, acknowledging the terrible actions that had taken place.

===20th century===

In 1925, Tulsa businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the &quot;Father of Route 66,&quot; began his campaign to create a road linking Chicago to Los Angeles by establishing the U.S. Highway 66 Association in Tulsa, earning the city the nickname the &quot;Birthplace of Route 66&quot;. Once completed, U.S. Route 66 took an important role in Tulsa&#x27;s development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the Blue Whale of Catoosa. During this period, Bob Wills and his group, The Texas Playboys, began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, Cain&#x27;s Ballroom became the base for the group, which is largely credited for creating Western Swing music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today.

For the rest of the mid-20th century, the city had a master plan to construct parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising. The Spavinaw Dam, built during this era to accommodate the city&#x27;s water needs, was considered one of the largest public works projects of the era.

A national recession greatly affected the city&#x27;s economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily dependent on oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, was one of the hardest-hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state&#x27;s economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.

===21st century===
In 2003, the &quot;Vision 2025&quot; program was approved by voters, to enhance and revitalize Tulsa&#x27;s infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of the initiative, the BOK Center, was designed to be a home for the city&#x27;s minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect Cesar Pelli, broke ground in 2005 and was opened on August 30, 2008.

In July 2020 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; that as it pertains to criminal law much of eastern Oklahoma, including Tulsa, remains as Native American lands. Specifically, prosecution of crimes by Native Americans on these lands falls into the jurisdiction of the tribal courts and federal judiciary under the Major Crimes Act, rather than Oklahoma&#x27;s courts. The Supreme Court further clarified the scope of tribal jurisdiction in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, finding that regarding crimes committed by non-Native Americans on native lands, federal and state courts would hold joint jurisdiction.

== Geography ==
Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma between the edge of the Great Plains and the foot of the Ozarks in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the Cross Timbers, an ecoregion of forest and prairie transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east. With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to &quot;Green Country&quot;, a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region&#x27;s green vegetation and relatively large number of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma, which lie largely in the drier Great Plains region of the Central United States. Located near the western edge of the U.S. Interior Highlands, northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing seven of Oklahoma&#x27;s 11 eco-regions and more than half of its state parks. The region encompasses 30 lakes or reservoirs and borders the neighboring states of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.

===Topography===
The city developed on both sides of the prominent Arkansas River, which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through Tulsa is controlled by reservoirs at Keystone Lake, and a low-water dam was built at Zink Lake in downtown Tulsa to maintain a full channel at all times. This dam deteriorated and eventually failed, and was repaired and reopened in 2014.

Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city has several prominent hills, such as &quot;Shadow Mountain&quot; and &quot;Turkey Mountain&quot;, which create varied terrain, especially in its southern portions. While its central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, north of the city, is the tallest point in the Tulsa Metro area at 1,360 ft (415 m) According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.24%) is water.

===Cityscape===
====Architecture====

A building boom in Tulsa in the early 20th century coincided with the rise of art deco architecture in the United States. Most commonly in the zigzag and streamline styles, the city&#x27;s art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the Mid-Continent Tower, the Boston Avenue Methodist Church, Will Rogers High School, and the Philtower, have attracted events promoting the preservation and architectural interest.

In addition, the city&#x27;s early prosperity funded the construction of many elegant Craftsmen, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek Revival, Italianate, Spanish revival, and colonial revival homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa&#x27;s uptown and Midtown neighborhoods). Noted architects and firms working in Tulsa during this period include Charles Dilbeck, John Duncan Forsyth, and Nelle Peters.

Growth in the twentieth century gave the city a larger base of contemporary architectural styles, including several buildings by famed Tulsa architects Bruce Goff and Adah Robinson. The Prairie School was very influential in Tulsa: Barry Byrne designed Tulsa&#x27;s Christ the King Church and, in 1927, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s midtown Tulsa residential project Westhope was completed. In particular, the middle of the 20th century brought a wealth of modern architecture to Tulsa. Tulsa&#x27;s Mies-trained modernist Robert Lawton Jones designed many buildings in the region, including the Tulsa International Airport. Other noted modernists working in Tulsa include the pioneering Texas architect O&#x27;Neil Ford and Joseph R. Koberling Jr., who had also been active during the art deco period. South, East, and Midtown Tulsa are home to a number of the ranch and Mid-Century Modern homes that reflect Tulsa&#x27;s prosperous post-war period.

The BOK Tower, built during this period, is the second tallest building in Oklahoma and the surrounding states of Missouri, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Kansas. Tulsa also has the third-, and fourth-tallest buildings in the state, including the Cityplex Tower, which is located in South Tulsa across from Oral Roberts University, far from downtown. One of the area&#x27;s unique architectural complexes, Oral Roberts University, is built in a Post-Modern Futuristic style, incorporating bright gold structures with sharp, jetting edges and clear geometric shapes. The BOK Center, Tulsa&#x27;s new arena, incorporates many of the city&#x27;s most prominent themes, including Native American, art deco, and contemporary architectural styles. Intended to be an architectural icon, the building was designed by César Pelli, the architect of the Petronas Towers in Malaysia.

====Neighborhoods====

Downtown Tulsa is an area of approximately surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75. The area serves as Tulsa&#x27;s financial and business district, and is the focus of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area&#x27;s historic architecture. Much of Tulsa&#x27;s convention space is located in downtown, such as the Tulsa Performing Arts Center, the Tulsa Convention Center, and the BOK Center. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts district, the &quot;Oil Capital Historic District&quot;, the Greenwood Historical District, Owen Park Historical Neighborhood, and the site of ONEOK Field, a baseball stadium for the Tulsa Drillers opened in 2010.

The city&#x27;s historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to Greek Revival. The University of Tulsa, the Swan Lake neighborhood, Philbrook Museum, and the upscale shopping districts of Utica Square, Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city&#x27;s southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low-density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state&#x27;s largest shopping malls, Woodland Hills Mall, as well as Southern Hills Country Club, and Oral Roberts University. East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large Asian and Mexican communities and much of the city&#x27;s manufacturing industry.

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called West Tulsa and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to OSU-Tulsa, Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa International Airport, the Tulsa Zoo, the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, and the nation&#x27;s third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.

===Climate===

Tulsa has a temperate climate of the humid subtropical variety (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with a yearly average temperature of and average precipitation of just under per year. Average monthly precipitation is lowest from December to February, and peaks dramatically in May, which averages of rainfall. Early June can still be wet, but late June through the end of August is frequently dry. On average, Tulsa experiences a secondary rainfall peak in September and early October. As is typical of temperate zones, weather patterns vary by season with occasional extremes in temperature and rainfall.

Primarily in the spring and early summer months, the city is subjected to severe thunderstorms containing large hail, damaging winds, and, occasionally, tornadoes, providing the area with a disproportionate share of its annual rainfall. Severe weather is not limited to this season, however. For instance, on December 5, 1975, and on December 24, 1982, Tulsa experienced tornadoes. Due to its potential for major flooding events, the city has developed one of the most extensive flood control systems in the nation. A comprehensive flood management plan was developed in 1984 following a severe flood caused by a stalled weather front that dropped of rain overnight, killing 14, injuring 288, and destroying 7,000 buildings totaling in damage. In the early 1990s and again in 2000, the Federal Emergency Management Agency honored Tulsa as leading the nation in flood plain management.
Triple-digit temperatures (≥38 °C) are observed on average 11 days per year, most of which occur from July to early September, and are usually accompanied by high humidity brought in by southerly winds. The highest recorded temperature was on August 10, 1936. Lack of air circulation due to heat and humidity during the summer months leads to higher concentrations of ozone, prompting the city to release &quot;Ozone Alerts&quot;, encouraging all parties to do their part in complying with the Clean Air Act and United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. The autumn season is usually short, consisting of pleasant, sunny days followed by cool nights. Winter temperatures, while generally mild, dip below on average three nights per year, and occasionally below , the most recent such occurrence being a reading on January 16, 2024. The average seasonal snowfall is 8.7 inches (22.1 cm) with the record highest seasonal snowfall of 26.1 inches (66.3 cm) occurring in the winter of 2010–2011. Only three winters on record have officially recorded trace amounts or no snowfall, the most recent being 1910–11. The lowest recorded temperature was on January 22, 1930.

===August 6, 2017 tornado===

An EF2 tornado struck Tulsa early on the morning of Sunday, August 6, 2017. The funnel touched down just after 1 A.M. near 36th Street and Harvard Avenue, then traveled in an easterly direction for about six minutes. The heaviest property damage occurred along 41st Street between Yale Avenue and Sheridan Road. Two restaurants, TGI Friday&#x27;s and Whataburger, were particularly hard hit, with several people being sent to hospitals for treatment. The Whataburger was later bulldozed, and rebuilt in 2019.

Tulsa is part of the Southern region demographers and commentators refer to as the &quot;Bible Belt,&quot; where Protestant and, in particular, Southern Baptist and other evangelical Christian traditions are very prominent. In fact, Tulsa, home to Oral Roberts University, Phillips Theological Seminary, and RHEMA Bible Training College (in the suburb of Broken Arrow), is sometimes called the &quot;buckle of the Bible Belt&quot;. Tulsa is also home to a number of vibrant Mainline Protestant congregations. Some of these congregations were founded during the oil boom of the early twentieth century and are noted for striking architecture, such as the art deco Boston Avenue Methodist Church and First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa. The metropolitan area has at least four religious radio stations (KCFO, KNYD, KXOJ, &amp; KPIM), and at least two religious TV stations (KWHB &amp; KGEB).

===Crime rate===
Tulsa experienced elevated levels of gang violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when crack cocaine flooded neighborhoods in North Tulsa. Tulsa gang problems became noticeable after an outbreak of gang-related crime between 1980 and 1983, which was traced to the Crips, a local gang which had been founded by two brothers whose family had recently moved to Oklahoma from Compton. In 1986, gang graffiti started to show up on walls and drive-by shootings started occurring on late nights. In 1990 the city hit a record of 60 homicides, the highest since the 1981 peak. North Tulsa has the highest crime rate in the city, with public housing projects being the most heavily affected areas., the Broken Arrow murders took place on July 22, 2015, when five members of the Bever family were murdered in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. the attackers were identified as 18 year-old Robert Bever and 16 year-old Michael Bever.

===Energy industry&#x27;s legacy and resurgence===
The United States Oil and Gas Association was founded in Tulsa on October 13, 1917. Over the city&#x27;s history many large oil companies have been headquartered in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with Gulf Oil in what was then the largest merger in the energy industry), Skelly Oil, Getty Oil and CITGO. In addition, ConocoPhillips was headquartered in nearby Bartlesville. Industry consolidation and increased offshore drilling threatened Tulsa&#x27;s status as an oil capital, but new drilling techniques and the rise of natural gas have buoyed the growth of the city&#x27;s energy sector.

Today, Tulsa is again home to the headquarters of many international oil- and gas-related companies, including Williams Companies, ONE Gas, Syntroleum, ONEOK, Laredo Petroleum, Samson Resources, Helmerich &amp; Payne, Magellan Midstream Partners, and Excel Energy.

===Diversification and emerging industries===
Tulsa has diversified to capitalize on its status as a regional hub with substantial innovation assets. Products from Tulsa manufacturers account for about sixty percent of Oklahoma&#x27;s exports, and in 2001, the city&#x27;s total gross product was in the top one-third of metropolitan areas, states, and countries, with more than in total goods, growing at a rate of each year.

Tulsa&#x27;s primary employers are small and medium-sized businesses: there are 30 companies in Tulsa that employ more than 1,000 people locally, and small businesses make up more than 80% of the city&#x27;s companies.

During a national recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite economic growth and recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. By 2007, employment levels had surpassed pre-recession heights and the city was in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa&#x27;s housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs have been added to the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.

Since 1969, public displays of artwork in Tulsa have been funded by one percent of its annual city budget. Each year, a sculpture from a local artist is installed along the Arkansas River trail system, while other sculptures stand at local parks, such as an enlarged version of Cyrus Dallin&#x27;s Appeal to the Great Spirit sculpture at Woodward Park. At the entrance to Oral Roberts University stands a large statue of praying hands, which, at high, is the largest bronze sculpture in the world. As a testament to the city&#x27;s oil heritage, the Golden Driller guards the front entrance to the Tulsa County Fairgrounds. Tulsa has a number of exhibits related to U.S. Route 66, including The Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza, located next to the east entrance of the historic 11th Street Bridge.

===Cuisine===
Tulsa restaurants and food trucks offer a number of cuisines, but several cuisines are particularly prominent in its culinary landscape because of its distinctive history.

====BBQ====
Tulsa is known nationally for its barbecue offerings; its barbecue reflects its midpoint location &quot;between pig country and cow country,&quot; that is, in the transition zone between the South and the West. The city&#x27;s barbecue is also helped by its geography; the wood used in barbecuing is abundant in Northeastern Oklahoma (including pecan, oak, hickory, mesquite and maple). The region&#x27;s ethnic diversity is felt, too: its BBQ traditions bear the influences of white, African-American and American Indian foodways.
Tulsa is also home to the nationally acclaimed premium smoker manufacturer Hasty-Bake Company. Some Tulsa based barbecue joints have expanded even beyond the state&#x27;s borders, including Leon&#x27;s Smoke Shack, Rib Crib and Billy Sims Barbecue. The prize-winning Oklahoma Joe&#x27;s was founded by Oklahoman Joe Davidson, who mastered his craft at Tulsa&#x27;s T-Town BBQ Cook-Off.

Oklahoma barbecue is also unique in its emphasis on hickory-smoked barbecue bologna, nicknamed &quot;Oklahoma tenderloin,&quot; and its fried okra.

====Lebanese steakhouses====
Lebanese steakhouses were once numerous in the region stretching from Bristow, Oklahoma to Tulsa, but now mostly exist in the Tulsa region. These restaurants were founded by Syrian and Lebanese families who immigrated to Oklahoma before statehood. Traditionally, many of these restaurants had live entertainment (including performers like Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots) and featured Mediterranean dishes like tabbouleh, rice pilaf and hummus alongside local favorites like smoked BBQ bologna.

====Chili and Coney Island hot dogs====
Oklahomans have been consuming chili since well before statehood, owing to the influence of Mexican-American culture on the state. In 1910, iconic Tulsa restaurant Ike&#x27;s Chili Parlor opened and Ivan &quot;Ike&quot; Johnson is purported to have acquired his recipe from a Hispanic-Texan named Alex Garcia.

Greek immigrants to Tulsa who came by way of Brooklyn, Pennsylvania and Michigan brought with them the tradition of Coney Island-style hot dogs with chili on a bun. Today, a related group of Greek-American families operate Coney restaurants around the city, including Coney I-Lander which opened in 1926 and was described by food writers Jane and Michael Stern as perfectly delivering &quot;the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney&#x27;s soul&quot;. Many of these restaurants sell Greek food, either year round or at Tulsa&#x27;s annual Greek Holiday, sponsored by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (which dates to 1925).

====Southern &quot;homestyle&quot; food====
By and large, Tulsa&#x27;s traditional cuisine reflects the influence of Southern foodways, particularly &quot;upland South and... Texas where many of Oklahoma&#x27;s nineteenth-century population originated.&quot; The prominence of certain foods reflects the agricultural heritage of the surrounding regions. For instance, at the suggestion of experts at what is now Oklahoma State University, peanuts became a major crop in now eastern Oklahoma as a means for lessening the reliance on cotton cultivation. Chicken-fried steak is part of the state meal of Oklahoma and is the signature dish at a number of Tulsa restaurants.

====Wild onion dinner====
The wild onion dinner is a festive gathering that originated with the Southeastern tribes which call Eastern Oklahoma home. The meals often feature wild onion, pork, frybread, corn bread, Poke salad and a unique dish known as grape biscuits. The Tulsa Indian Women&#x27;s Club has been holding annual Wild Onion Dinners since at least 1932.

====Baking and confectionery====
Tulsa is home to the Oklahoma Sugar Arts Show, a premier sugar craft competition hosted by Tulsa-based Food Network personality Kerry Vincent. Tulsa is also home to the nationally renowned Pancho Anaya Mexican bakery, recognized by Food &amp; Wine as one of America&#x27;s 100 best bakeries. Tulsa is home to several national dessert companies: Daylight Donuts was founded in Tulsa and remains headquartered there, as is the Bama Pie Company.

====Breweries====
Brewing in Tulsa dates back to at least the late 1930s with the Ahrens Brewing Company and their Ranger Beer line. The Ahrens Brewing Company opened in May 1938. Tulsa&#x27;s craft beer scene has boomed since legislation passed allowing for microbreweries to serve the public directly (Tulsa&#x27;s first microbrewery in the post-World War II era was Marshall Brewing Company in 2008).

===Public libraries===
The largest library system in the Tulsa Metropolitan Area, the Tulsa City-County Library, contains over volumes in 25 library facilities. The library is active in the community, holding events and programs at most branches, including free computer classes, children&#x27;s storytimes, business and job assistance, and scholarly databases with information on a variety of topics. The McFarlin Library at the University of Tulsa is a federal depository library holding over three million items. Founded in 1930, the library is known for its collection of Native American works and the original works of Irish author James Joyce. The Tulsa City-County Library and the University of Tulsa&#x27;s Law Library are also federal depository libraries, making Tulsa the only city in Oklahoma with more than two federal depository libraries. The Tulsa City County Library&#x27;s Downtown branch was massively renovated and opened to the public on Saturday, October 1, 2016.

The race has since accommodated &quot;over two hundred race rigs, bleachers for thousands of people and an ever-growing trade show&quot;.

==Parks and recreation==

, the city of Tulsa manages 134 parks spread over . Woodward Park, a tract located in midtown Tulsa, doubles as a botanical garden, featuring the Tulsa Municipal Rose Garden, with more than 6,000 rose plants in 250 varieties, and the Linnaeus Teaching Gardens, which demonstrate the latest and most successful techniques for growing vegetables, annuals, perennials, woody plants and groundcovers.

Some Tulsa-area parks are run by Tulsa County Parks. These include the LaFortune Park in Midtown Tulsa, and the Chandler Park.

Some parks are under the Tulsa River Parks Authority. These include a series of linear parks that run adjacent to the Arkansas River for about from downtown to the Jenks bridge. Since 2007 a significant portion of the River Parks area has been renovated with new trails, landscaping, and playground equipment. The River Parks Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area on the west side of the Arkansas River in south Tulsa is a area that contains over of dirt trails available for hiking, trail running, mountain biking and horseback riding.

Gathering Place is a park which features a playground, lodge, boathouse, splash playground, sports courts, skate park, wetland pond and garden, trails, classrooms, and amphitheatre.

===Bicycling===
Tulsa has a number of cycling trails, and has installed protected bike lanes in parts of the downtown area. Additional efforts to expand this infrastructure have been included as part of the city&#x27;s &quot;GoPlan&quot;.

==Government==


A mayor-council government has been in place in Tulsa since 1989, when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Democrat Monroe Nichols, who won the 2024 mayoral election and took office on December 2, 2024. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who represented Oklahoma in the United States Senate for 30 years, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.

A city councilor from each of the city&#x27;s nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of the city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in the city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. The auditor is elected for a term of two years. Phil Wood, a Democrat, held the position for 21 years before being defeated by Republican Preston Doerflinger in the 2009 election. The city serves as the seat of county government for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within Oklahoma&#x27;s 1st congressional district, with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in Oklahoma&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. Municipal and state laws are enforced in Tulsa by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization of 781 officers .

==Education==


===K–12 education===
Tulsa Public Schools, with nine high schools and over 41,000 students, is the second-largest school district in Oklahoma. In 2006, there were more than 90,000 students attending Tulsa County&#x27;s public schools.

Portions of Tulsa within Tulsa County are in the following school districts: Tulsa, Berryhill, Bixby, Broken Arrow, Jenks, Owosso, and Union. Portions within Osage County are in Tulsa Public Schools. Portions within Wagoner County are in the following districts: Tulsa, Broken Arrow, and Catoosa.

A variety of independent and sectarian schools exist in Tulsa, also. Most, but not all, of the private schools have religious affiliations with various Christian, Jewish or Muslim denominations. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa supports a system of parochial and diocesan schools, including Bishop Kelley High School, administered by the LaSallians (French Christian Brothers). Another Catholic high school, Cascia Hall Preparatory School, is administered by Augustinians. Holland Hall School is independent but historically affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Riverfield Country Day School is non-sectarian.

===History of K-12 education===
The Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) established the Presbyterian Mission Day School, a one-story building at what would become the intersection of 4th Street and Boston Avenue in 1884. A second story was soon added to accommodate the number of children who were to attend. This school operated until 1889. When Tulsa incorporated in 1899, it took over the school, which became the first public school. James M. Hall and three other men bought the property with their own funds and held the title until the city could reimburse them.

Tulsa built its first two public schools in 1905. The construction of more schools began accelerating in 1906. In December 1907, control of the public schools passed from the city government to the Tulsa Board of Education.

Tulsa High School opened in 1906 on the same block formerly occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was a three-story cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed Central High School. The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922. The building remained in this service until 1976, when it was replaced by a new building on West Edison Street. The old building was taken over by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma.

===Higher education===
The first institute of higher education was established in Tulsa when Kendall College, a Presbyterian school, moved from Muskogee to Tulsa in 1907. In 1920, the school merged with a proposed McFarlin College to become the University of Tulsa (abbreviated as TU). The McFarlin Library of TU was named for the principal donor of the proposed college, oilman Robert M. McFarlin.
Tulsa has 15 institutions of higher education, including two private universities: the University of Tulsa, a school founded in 1894, and Oral Roberts University, a school founded by evangelist Oral Roberts in 1963.

The University of Tulsa has an enrollment of 3,832 undergraduate and graduate students as of 2021. In addition to doctoral and masters programs, TU is home to the University of Tulsa College of Law and the Collins College of Business. TU also manages the famous Gilcrease Museum in northwest Tulsa and hosts the Alexandre Hogue Gallery on its main campus.

Oral Roberts University is a charismatic Christian institution with an enrollment of 5,109 undergraduate and graduate students.

Both of the state&#x27;s flagship research universities have campuses in Tulsa:

* Oklahoma State University houses three campuses in the city, the OSU Center for Health Sciences, the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, and OSU – Tulsa, accommodating upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses. OSU-Tulsa has an advanced materials research facility and is home to the Oklahoma Center for Poets and Writers.
* The University of Oklahoma operates what is known as the OU-Tulsa Schusterman Center, offering bachelors, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree programs in conjunction with the main campus in Norman and the OU Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. The OU-Tulsa Schusterman Center also houses the OU School of Community Medicine, the first medical school of its kind in the United States.

Rogers State University in Claremore, Oklahoma, is the Tulsa area&#x27;s original public, undergraduate-focused, four-year university. Tulsa Community College (TCC), the largest community college in Oklahoma, operates four campuses spread across the area as well as a conference center in Midtown, and has a partnership allowing students to complete four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees through OU-Tulsa, OSU-Tulsa, LU-Tulsa and NSU-Broken Arrow. Tulsa also has a Tulsa branch of Langston University, the only historically black college or university in the state, founded in 1897. Tulsa previously had a branch campus of St. Gregory&#x27;s University, a Catholic university with its main campus in Shawnee, Oklahoma; however, that school went into bankruptcy in 2017. New York University operates a study away center in Tulsa for its students.

The Spartan School of Aeronautics enrolls 1,500 students at its flight programs near Tulsa International Airport and the city&#x27;s vocational education is headed by Tulsa Technology Center, the oldest and largest vocational technology institution in the state.

Among trade schools located in Tulsa are Community Care College (including branches Oklahoma Technical College and Clary Sage College), Holberton School Tulsa, Tulsa Welding School (Tulsa Campus) and Tulsa Tech.

==Media==

===Print===
Tulsa&#x27;s leading newspaper is the daily &quot;Tulsa World&quot;, the second-most widely circulated newspaper in Oklahoma with a Sunday circulation of 189,789.

&quot;The Tulsa Voice&quot; is an Alt-Weekly newspaper covering entertainment and cultural events. Covering primarily economic events and stocks, the &quot;Tulsa Business Journal&quot; caters to Tulsa&#x27;s business sector. Other publications include the &quot;Oklahoma Indian Times&quot;, the &quot;Tulsa Daily Commerce and Legal News&quot;, the &quot;Tulsa Beacon&quot;, &quot;This Land Press&quot;, and the &quot;Tulsa Free Press&quot;. The first black-owned newspaper was the &quot;Tulsa Star&quot;, which ceased publication when its office burned during the Tulsa race massacre. It was succeeded by the &quot;Oklahoma Eagle&quot;, which began publishing using the press salvaged from the &quot;Star&quot; office.

Until 1992, the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; served as a daily afternoon newspaper competing with the &quot;Tulsa World&quot;. The paper was acquired by the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; that year. &quot;Urban Tulsa Weekly&quot; served as the city&#x27;s alt-weekly paper from 1991 until its closure in 2013.

===Television and radio===
Tulsa is also served by television and radio broadcasting networks. All major U.S. television networks are represented in Tulsa through local affiliates in the designated market area (a region covering a 22-county area serving the northeastern and east-central portions of Oklahoma, and far southeastern Kansas); these include NBC affiliate KJRH-TV (channel 2), CBS affiliate KOTV-DT (channel 6), ABC affiliate KTUL (channel 8), PBS station KOED-TV (channel 11, a satellite of the state-run OETA member network), CW affiliate KQCW-DT (channel 19), Fox affiliate KOKI-TV (channel 23), MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYT-TV (channel 41), Ion Television owned-and-operated station KTPX-TV (channel 44).

Cable television service in the area is provided by Cox Communications, which acquired Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI)&#x27;s franchise rights to the area in a $2.85 billion deal (which also included the purchase of AT&amp;T Broadband&#x27;s Louisiana cable systems, minority ownership of TCA Cable TV systems in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico, and TCI&#x27;s Peak Cablevision systems in four other Oklahoma cities, and select markets in Arkansas, Utah and Nevada) in July 1999; Cox assumed control of TCI&#x27;s Tulsa-area systems on March 15, 2000.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Transportation in Tulsa is aided by Tulsa Transit&#x27;s bus network of 97 vehicles and two primary airports, while the Tulsa Port of Catoosa provides transportation of goods and industry through international trade routes.

====Highways====
Tulsa has an extensive highway system that connects many cities in the region such as Joplin, Missouri on the Will Rogers Turnpike and Oklahoma City on the Turner Turnpike. Most commuters use the highway system in Tulsa to get to and from work. Highways that run through Tulsa are I-44, I-244, US-412, US-169, OK-66, US-64, US-75, OK-11, OK-51, Creek Turnpike, and Gilcrease Expressway. In 2011, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported that Tulsa&#x27;s busiest freeway was US-169 with about 121,500 vehicles daily between 51st and 61st Streets, and its second busiest freeway was OK-51 with about 104,200 vehicles between Memorial and I-44. Surrounding Downtown is the Inner Dispersal Loop (sometimes called the &quot;I-D-L&quot;), which connects Downtown with almost all the highways in Tulsa.
====Buses====
Tulsa Transit, the city&#x27;s transit bus operator, runs 97 buses on 19 different routes across Tulsa and in surrounding suburbs such as Broken Arrow, Sand Springs and Jenks. Tulsa Transit has two stations: the Memorial Midtown Station at 7952 E. 33rd St. in Midtown Tulsa, and the Denver Avenue Station at 319 S. Denver, across from the BOK Center in Downtown. Most routes go through one or both of the stations, facilitating the commute to work and events in Downtown or Midtown. Buses stop at specific stops such as Tulsa Community College, Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, CityPlex Towers, Cox Communications, the various medical facilities in Tulsa, and many shopping destinations, hotels, and schools. The bus schedules are periodically changed; votes are taken by Tulsa Transit to help decide the particulars of certain routes. Tulsa debuted its first bus rapid transit line, Aero on Peoria Avenue, in November 2019. The service has more frequent buses, upgraded stations, and faster travel times.

Intercity bus service is provided by both Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines. The station for both is at 317 S. Detroit, five blocks from Tulsa Transit&#x27;s Downtown bus terminal. As to private chartered bus companies, Red Carpet Charters a/k/a Red Carpet Trailways of Tulsa, is an independent member of the Trailways Charter Bus Network.

====Airports====
Tulsa International Airport, which has service on twelve commercial airlines (eight passenger and four cargo ones), serves more than three million travelers annually, with almost 80 departures every day. In 2007, the airport completed most of an expansion project, which included larger terminal sizes and the addition of restaurants and shops. In 2011, the airport opened the newly renovated Concourse B, complete with skylights, open gate holds, an average of 76 ways to charge a device per gate, and much more. Concourse A is under renovation. Richard L. Jones Jr. Airport, a/k/a Jones-Riverside Airport, a general aviation airport in West Tulsa, saw 335,826 takeoffs and landings in 2008, making it the busiest airport in Oklahoma and the fifth-busiest general aviation airport in the nation. Its operations contribute over to the economy annually. The Tulsa Airports Improvement Trust also manages the Okmulgee Regional Airport in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, further to the south of Tulsa.

====Railways====
Freight railways bisect the city in every direction; the state&#x27;s chief freight rail transporter is BNSF, operator of the Cherokee Rail Yard in Tulsa, which facility includes a freight terminal, diesel shop and hump yard for railcar sorting. Other Class I transporters are Union Pacific Railroad, as well as the CPKC (formerly the Kansas City Southern Railway) via a short-line switch on the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad.

Tulsa Union Depot served Frisco, M-K-T and Santa Fe passenger trains until the 1960s. The Santa Fe continued service through use of its own station until 1971. There are no mass transit rail lines in Tulsa, but the prospect of passenger rail lines from Downtown Tulsa to the suburb of Broken Arrow has been studied.

Long-distance passenger rail transportation today serves Tulsa only through Greyhound bus lines, which provide bus connections to nearby cities with Amtrak stations. A private proposal to re-establish passenger service between Oklahoma City and Tulsa via a train called the ‘’Eastern Flyer’’ fell through in 2019. However, in early 2024, the Federal Railroad Administration released an interim report on its ongoing Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study regarding fifteen new or previously discontinued rail routes under consideration for federal funding, which included a proposed route from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, and on from Tulsa to St. Louis in one direction and Kansas City in another.

Tulsa has two static displays of antique steam railroad locomotives for free public viewing: the 1917 wood-burning Dierks Forest 207, a Baldwin 2-6-2 Prairie-type located at the Tulsa State Fairgrounds; and, the 1942 oil-burning Frisco Meteor 4500, a Baldwin 4-8-4 Northern-type at the Route 66 Historical Village at 3770 Southwest Blvd.

====Port of Catoosa====

 At the head of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa is an inland port in the United States and connects barge traffic from Tulsa to the Mississippi River via the Verdigris River and the Arkansas River. The facility is one of the largest riverports in the United States and contributes to one of the busiest waterways in the world via its course to the Gulf of Mexico.

===Medical facilities===
The Saint Francis Health System owns several hospitals with a central location at Saint Francis Hospital in the southern part of the city. The facility contains 700 doctors and 918 beds, and with more than 7,000 employees, the network is the second-largest healthcare employer in the state. The health system also operates a heart hospital, which was named by General Electric in 2004 one of the most advanced heart hospitals in the nation. St. John Medical Center, located in an 11-story midtown center, employs nearly 700 doctors. Other networks, such as Hillcrest Health System, operate a number of facilities of various sizes. Beginning in 2007, the city elected to renew a five-year contract with EMSA for ambulance service after a period spent contemplating a switch to the Tulsa Fire Department for the provision of such services.

<doc id="150971" wikidata="Q2608037" url="?curid=150971" title="Maud, Oklahoma">
<text>Maud is a city on the boundary between Pottawatomie and Seminole counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 867 by the 2020 United States census. The locale was named for Maud Stearns, a sister to the wives of two men who owned the first general store.

==History==
This community was established by 1890 on the dividing line between Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory. In 1890, a barbed-wire fence was built along the street now called Broadway from the North Canadian River to the Canadian River to keep the Native Americans out of Oklahoma Territory. However, the fence failed to prevent the illegal sale of alcohol to residents of Indian Territory.

A post office was established on April 16, 1896.

In January 1898, a mob lynched two Seminole teenagers, Lincoln McGeisey and Palmer Sampson, by burning them alive near this same post office, in retaliation for their alleged murder of a white woman. Newspapers reported that the charred bodies remained chained to an oak tree for several days after the mob murdered them. Unlike in most lynchings, some members of the mob were actually convicted of participating in the violence. When one of these men was released from the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth in 1906, a celebratory crowd welcomed him home to Maud.

A railroad station was built by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway in 1903. The first newspaper, the Maud Monitor, appeared in 1904, and lasted until about 1919. The city was formally incorporated on July 21, 1905. The 1910 census showed a population of 503.

Maud became a boom town in the early 1920s because oil was discovered nearby. The peak population was estimated at ten thousand. The boom was short-lived and the population was only 4,326 at the 1930 census.

<text>Catoosa is a city in Rogers and Wagoner counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 7,440 at the 2020 census compared to 7,159 at the 2010 census. 

==History==
The Cherokee Nation controlled the region during the 19th century. After the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad laid tracks in the early 1880s, the community became a cow town, with the establishment of William Halsell&#x27;s Bird Creek Ranch. In 1883, the Federal Government opened a post office here.

The name of the city is derived from the Cherokee language, phonetically pronounced &quot;Ga-du-si&quot; or &quot;Ga-tu-si&quot;. Various interpretations of this word exist, including: &quot;between two hills&quot;, &quot;on the hill&quot;, &quot;into the hills&quot;, and possibly signifying a prominent hill or place thereon.

Catoosa was home to Bluford &quot;Blue&quot; Duck, the infamous outlaw depicted in &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. He is buried in Dick Duck Cemetery located at the intersection of 193rd and Pine street.

The town grew from a population of 241 in 1900 to 410 by 1910. The local economy included a grain elevator, a cotton gin and mill, a marble works and some coal mines. By 1930, the population was back down to 264, but by 1960, was up to 638.

In 1971, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa opened and gave the town an economic boom. The port&#x27;s industrial park provided jobs for over 2,600 workers by the 21st century. , it had 70 businesses with over 4,000 workers. The port connects to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico via the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.

On the evening of April 24, 1993, the town was struck by an F4 tornado. Seven people were left dead in the tornado&#x27;s wake, with six of the fatalities at a truck stop and one in a trailer park. In the aftermath of the tornado, which caused an estimated $500,000 in damage, 100 National Guard troops were deployed by Governor David Walters.

<text>Collinsville is a city in Rogers and Tulsa counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, and a part of the Tulsa, Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named for Dr. A. H. Collins, an engineer and surveyor who first surveyed the land that became this community. The population was 7,881 by the 2020 United States census, a 40.6% increase over the figure of 5,606 according to the 2010 census, which itself was an increase of 37.5 percent over the figure of 4,077 recorded in 2000.

==History==
Dr. A. H. Collins, the town namesake, established a post office on May 28, 1897. Henry P. Cook was the first postmaster. Then it became known as either Collins or Collins Post Office. The name officially became Collinsville by June 1898 and it incorporated as a city in April 1899. The population in 1900 was 376.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, though its Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway subsidiary, routed its line from Kansas to Owasso, approximately one mile west of Collinsville in 1899, to avoid crossing an additional stream. An earlier community, known as Eli, had developed southeast but moved all their buildings closer to the railroad. The buildings were moved on rollers in 1899 and 1900.

Collinsville originally was located in Rogers County. In 1918, the residents voted to be annexed by Tulsa County, in order to be nearer a county seat. It was only north of Tulsa.
An abundant supply of sulfur-free coal lay near the surface, which attracted fifteen hundred to two thousand miners. Oil and gas production and zinc smelting boomed briefly during the first two decades of the 20th century. The local population swelled to around eight thousand people. But the population swiftly declined as these businesses ceased. By 1930, there were 2,249 residents. Since the 1920s, the economy has been based primarily on agriculture. Several dairies are located in Collinsville, many delivering products to Tulsa. In 1948, Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical University (now Oklahoma State University) named Collinsville &quot;the Dairy Capital of Oklahoma.&quot;

==Geography==
Collinsville is approximately 20 mi north of Tulsa, and lies within a triangle formed by the Caney River, Verdigris River and Bird Creek. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.0 square miles (15.5 km2), of which 5.9 square miles (15.4 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (1.17%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 5,606 people, 2,111 households, and 1,529 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 1,688 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 76.3% White, 1.2% African American, 12.2% Native American, 2.1% Asian (1.5% Hmong), 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.8% from other races, and 7.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.1% of the population.

There were 1,550 households, out of which 35.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.5% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.2% were non-families. 24.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 27.0% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 20.7% from 45 to 64, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $53,874 and the median income for a family was $57,235. The per capita income for the city was $22,661. About 7.3% of families and 5.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.4% of those under age 18 and 7.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
In its early years, Collinsville&#x27;s economy was largely based on coal mining. That industry declined during the 1920s and was replaced by agriculture as the mainstay of the local economy. The Sallee Family Dairy started up in 1912, with local deliveries by buggy. By 1926, Sallee was delivering by truck to Tulsa. There was also a milk producers&#x27; cooperative and a cheese factory in the 1930s.

==Government==
Collinsville has a home rule charter form of government.

==Media==
Collinsville has one newspaper, the &quot;Collinsville Times Star&quot;. Originally named the &quot;Collinsville Times&quot;, it began publication May 11, 1899. It is Tulsa County&#x27;s oldest newspaper and Collinsville&#x27;s oldest continuously operating business. The paper is published every Wednesday. It is owned, edited, and published by Bill Johnston, a 54-year veteran of the media business.

Collinsville news is also included in the Owasso newspaper, the &quot;Owasso Reporter&quot;. The paper is published every Wednesday.

Collinsville has a community website, Cvilleok.com.

Four months after the wrap in Collinsville on the film &quot;The Last Rodeo&quot;, Collinsville received a “film-friendly” certification from the Oklahoma Film + Music Office. This follows the production of other films in Collinsville including Mister Larry Visits Bigfoot, as well as approval in July of 2024 of an Historic Preservation District covering Collinsville’s photogenic downtown.

<text>Owasso is a city in Rogers and Tulsa Counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, and the largest northern suburb of Tulsa. The population was 39,328 persons as of the 2022 census estimate, compared to 28,915 at the 2010 census, a gain of 36 percent. Originally settled in 1881 in Indian Territory, the town was incorporated in 1904 just before Oklahoma statehood and was chartered as a city in 1972.

==History==
Owasso began as a settlement in 1881, located in the Cooweescoowee District of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory, near what is now 66th Street North and North 129th East Avenue. It was called Elm Creek and was named for Elm Creek, a tributary of Bird Creek. The first settler was H.T. (Tole) Richardson. In June 1893, plans began for a rail line to be extended south from Bartlesville to the cattle ranches in the vicinity of Bird Creek. At that time, already several residences, a blacksmith shop, and a general store were in the Elm Creek settlement. Preston Ballard, the owner of the general store, established a post office in the general store on February 10, 1898, and was appointed the first postmaster. The Joseph T. Barnes family moved to the settlement in 1897. Joseph and Luther Barnes bought the blacksmith shop in 1898. The first filling station was opened in 1902 by Donovan Ranta.

In 1897, Kansas, Oklahoma Central &amp; Southwestern Railway acquired right-of-way about northwest of the Elm Creek settlement, dammed a natural spring to form a lake as a water supply for the rail line, and built a depot about a mile south of the lake. The depot was torn down in 1942. Late in 1898, Joseph and Luther Barnes moved their blacksmith shop to the new community. The shop became a temporary home for the Joseph Barnes family. It was the first residence officially moved to the new depot community. In 1898, many of the residents and businesses moved from the Elm Creek settlement to the new community. Preston Ballard moved his post office and general store during that time. The new community became known as Elm Creek since the post office retained its name.

The railroad completed its line in 1899. Its parent company, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, took over the line and property. The first train came into Elm Creek on November 1, 1899. As the land around the end of this railroad developed, the Osage Indian word Owasso, meaning &quot;the end of the trail&quot; or &quot;turn around&quot;, was adopted to identify the area because the rail line ended in a turnaround &quot;Y&quot; near the depot. The name of the Elm Creek post office was officially changed to Owasso on January 24, 1900. The rail line was not extended into Tulsa until 1905.

A plat of the original townsite of Owasso, Cherokee Nation, I.T. was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on March 26, 1904, in connection with the town&#x27;s incorporation. That plat shows three streets running north and south and eight streets running east and west. The north-south streets were named Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri, and the east-west streets north of what is now Broadway were named for Union generals, while the east-west streets to the south were named for Confederate generals. These names were later changed; east-west streets are now identified by street numbers, and north-south streets are now named after trees. The original street names were changed to their present names around 1960.

By the time Oklahoma became a state on November 16, 1907, Owasso had a population of 379 within the town limits. The first newspaper was &quot;The Owasso Ledger&quot; which was first published on August 7, 1903, by U. P. Wardrip. The subscription price was $1.00 per year, paid in advance. The Pioneer Telephone and Telegraph Company was granted a franchise on February 6, 1905, for the town&#x27;s first telephone exchange. Until the first water tower was erected in 1924, with Spavinaw as the water source, water came into town in barrels from Owasso Lake and sold for $0.50 a barrel.

Owasso was incorporated as a city on September 28, 1972.

Owasso came to its significant attention on February 8th, 2024, when 16-year-old Nex Benedict was found dead after getting into a fight at a school.

<text>Bixby is a city in Tulsa and Wagoner counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma; it is a suburb of Tulsa. Its population was 28,609 at the 2020 census and 20,884 in the 2010 census, an increase of 36.99 percent In 2010, Bixby became the 19th largest city in Oklahoma. It is nicknamed &quot;The Garden Spot of Oklahoma&quot; for its rich agrarian heritage. Although it is one of the fastest-growing communities in Oklahoma, it remains a sod-growing center and a popular location for purchasing fresh vegetables. The per capita income of $36,257 is the highest in the Tulsa metropolitan area and is more than 50 percent higher than the state average.

==History==
 Alexander Posey, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, and his family settled in the area now known as Bixby in the late 1800s. He founded a community which was initially known as &quot;Posey on Posey Creek.&quot; It included two saloons, a blacksmith shop, and a general store. The town became a government townsite with a post office in 1895. Located in the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Indian Territory, Bixby was named in honor of Tams Bixby, a chairman of the Dawes Commission. The original townsite plat was approved by the Dawes Commission in 1902. Many settlers were attracted to the area by the rich, though sometimes swampy river bottom land. In 1904 the Midland Valley Railroad named for Midland, Arkansas, laid tracks and built a depot about 1/2 mile north of the original town of Bixby. The railroad created factions that briefly split Bixby into two towns. The new part of town was deliberately surveyed so that the new streets did not align with the existing ones. 

However, businesses in the original town soon moved to the new location and built permanent brick buildings there. Bixby incorporated as an independent, self-governing town in 1906, with a population of 400 and an area of . The first mayor, recorder and five aldermen were elected in February 1907. In 1911, a two-story brick schoolhouse was built on Main Street. Bixby Central Elementary is near the original site. A traffic bridge was built over the Arkansas River in 1911; for a time it was said to be the longest bridge west of the Mississippi River.

Fry, a community located north of the original townsite but later annexed by Bixby, served the surrounding trade area when the only way to get across the Arkansas River was by way of the Shellenberger Ferry. Fry&#x27;s post office operated from 1896 until 1909. The &quot;Bixby Bulletin&quot;, the town&#x27;s first newspaper, began publication in February 1905. It continued publication until 2005. A second paper, the &quot;Bixby Journal&quot; existed only from 1907 until 1910.

Bixby was impacted and enriched by the discovery of nearby natural gas deposits in 1905-1906 and oil fields in 1913, but farming remained the backbone of the community well into the 20th Century. Early farmers focused on production of cotton, wheat and alfalfa in the rich river bottom. During the 1930s, truck farming of vegetables slowly replaced those crops. In 1941, the city became an important regional center for shipping produce by railroads. At that time Bixby was christened with its nickname &quot;The Garden Spot of Oklahoma,&quot; a designation still carried on the town seal and public vehicles. Cantaloupes, potatoes, radishes, squash, turnips, spinach, and sweet corn were shipped from Bixby to places across the U.S. In time the majority of the truck farms were converted to the production of sod, typically Bermuda grass, or developed for residential and other purposes. Only a small percentage of Bixby residents now work in agriculture, but the town continues to celebrate its earthy roots annually in June with the &quot;Green Corn Festival.&quot;

Another point of history commemorated by Bixby is a visit to the area in 1832 by the famous American writer Washington Irving. Irving accompanied a U.S. Army exploration party on an excursion from Fort Gibson which is in the northern part of Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, west onto the prairie and the lands occupied by the Osage and Pawnee tribes. He described his adventure in his book &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot; (1835). He relates camping in a grove of large trees on the banks of the Arkansas River in what is present-day Bixby. The town has honored his visit by creating Washington Irving Park and Arboretum near the location. The park contains an amphitheatre stage patterned after the front facade of Irving&#x27;s home, Sunnyside, in Tarrytown, New York, as well as gates near the park entrance which are replicas of ones at Irving&#x27;s estate. A bronze statue of Washington Irving sits near the stage. Bixby Middle School drama students present a popular retelling of Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; in the park each October. The park is also the location of the heavily attended &quot;Bixby BBQ &amp; Music Festival&quot; each May and the Bixby &quot;Deutschesfest&quot; in September.

<text>Broken Arrow is a city in Tulsa and Wagoner counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It is the largest suburb of Tulsa. According to the 2020 census, Broken Arrow has a population of 113,540 residents and is the 4th most populous city in the state. The city is part of the Tulsa Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 1,023,988 residents.

The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad sold lots for the town site in 1902 and company secretary William S. Fears named it Broken Arrow. The city was named for a Creek community settled by Creek Native Americans who had been forced to relocate from Alabama to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears.

Although Broken Arrow was originally an agricultural community, its current economy is diverse. The city has the third-largest concentration of manufacturers in the state.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name comes from an old Creek community in Alabama. Members of that community were expelled from Alabama by the United States government, along the Trail of Tears in the 1830s. The Creek founded a new community in the Indian Territory and named it after their old settlement in Alabama. The town&#x27;s name in the Muscogee language was Rekackv (), meaning &quot;broken arrow&quot;. The new Creek settlement was located several miles south of present-day downtown Broken Arrow.

The community of Elam, located in present-day Broken Arrow near 145th East Avenue and 111th Street, began around 1901. It consisted of a cluster of stores, a cotton gin, and a few homes.

In 1902 the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad planned a railroad through the area and was granted town site privileges along the route. They sold three of the as-yet-unnamed sites to the Arkansas Valley Town Site Company. William S. Fears, secretary of that company, was allowed to choose and name one of the locations. He selected a site about southeast of Tulsa and about five miles north of the thlee-Kawtch-kuh settlement and named the new townsite Broken Arrow, after the Indian community. The MKT railroad, which was completed in 1903, ran through the middle of the city. It still exists today and is now owned by Union Pacific which currently uses it for freight.

For the first decades of Broken Arrow&#x27;s history, the town&#x27;s economy was based mainly on agriculture. The coal industry also played an important role, with several strip coal mines located near the city in the early 20th century. The city&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Broken Arrow Ledger&quot;, started within a couple of years of the city&#x27;s founding. Broken Arrow&#x27;s first school was built in 1904. The city did not grow much during the first half of the 1900s. During this time Broken Arrow&#x27;s main commercial center was along Main Street. Most of the city&#x27;s churches were also located on or near Main Street as well. A 1907 government census listed Broken Arrow&#x27;s population at 1,383.

The Haskell State School of Agriculture opened in the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma Opera House on November 15, 1909. The school closed in 1917 for lack of funding, and the building was then used as Broken Arrow High School. The building was razed in 1987. Only a marker remains at 808 East College Street in Broken Arrow. The front of cornerstone reads, &quot;Haskell State School / Of Agriculture / J. H. Esslinger Supt. / W. A. Etherton Archt. / Bucy &amp; Walker Contr.&quot; The side of cornerstone reads &quot;Laid by the Masonic Fraternity / May 25, A. D. 1910, A. L. 5810. / George Huddell G. M. / Erected by The State Board of Agriculture / J. P. Conners Pres. / B. C. Pittuck Dean.&quot;. The school is commemorated on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 1960s, Broken Arrow began to grow from a small town into a suburban city. The Broken Arrow Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 51) was constructed in the mid-1960s and connected the city with downtown Tulsa, fueling growth in Broken Arrow. The population swelled from a little above 11,000 in 1970 to more than 50,000 in 1990, and then more than 74,000 by the year 2000. During this time, the city was more of a bedroom community. In recent years, city leaders have pushed for more economic development to help keep more citizens of Broken Arrow working, shopping, and relaxing in town rather than going to other cities.

<text>Greenhorn is a nearly non-populated city in Baker and Grant counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. It straddles the Blue Mountain ridge, so that it is located in both Grant County and Baker County. As most of the city is situated in Baker County, and the early residents considered Baker City to be more convenient, for administrative purposes it is considered to be in Baker County.

As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 0, with 7 housing units. As of the 2010 census, the population was 0, with 10 housing units. The population had increased to 3 by 2020.

== History ==

Greenhorn was first populated in the 1860s as miners prospected for gold in the area. It was platted in 1904, though it lost two-thirds of its population between 1900 and 1910. The mining district was composed first of placer mines, but soon many lode gold mines developed. The city was incorporated in 1903 and had a population of 28 in 1910. It continued as a viable community until 1942 when gold mining was made illegal by Federal Public Law 208 during World War II.

In later years, the old Greenhorn Jail (dating to around 1910) was removed to Canyon City under suspicious circumstances. A court case ensued for its return, but because the city straddles the Blue Mountain ridge, the district attorneys of Baker County and Grant County could not even agree in which court house it should be held. The case was eventually heard by the Circuit Court for Grant County in Canyon City, Oregon. The jail remains in Canyon City, Oregon.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city is in the Greenhorn Mountains, a small range within the broader Blue Mountains, and is surrounded by the Malheur National Forest and Wallowa–Whitman National Forest.

At above sea level, Greenhorn is the highest incorporated city in Oregon. It is also unique in that the city was established on land that was originally patented from the United States for the purpose of platting the city (rather than being homesteaded by individuals). (See &quot;Town of Greenhorn v. Baker County&quot;, 596 F2D 349.)
== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2000, there were no people living in the city. The same was true in 2010. As of 2013, the &quot;Baker City Herald&quot; reported that Greenhorn had two &quot;year-round&quot; residents. The &quot;Herald&quot; reported at that time that the community had about 13 cabins and 20 part-time residents.

==Government==
As of 2015, Zack Koellermeier and Brad Poyser of Oregon City, Nathan Wright of La Grande, and Keith Rofinot of Tigard serve on the city council. Mayor Dale McLouth lives in Molalla.

<text>Albany ( ) is the county seat of Linn County, Oregon, and is the 11th most populous city in the state. Albany is located in the Willamette Valley at the confluence of the Calapooia River and the Willamette River in both Linn and Benton counties, just east of Corvallis and south of Salem. It is predominantly a farming and manufacturing city that settlers founded around 1848. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population of Albany, Oregon was 56,472.

Albany has a home rule charter, a council–manager government, and a full-time unelected city manager. The city provides the population with access to over 30 parks and trails, a senior center, and many cultural events such as the Northwest Art &amp; Air Festival, River Rhythms, Summer Sounds and Movies at Monteith. In addition to farming and manufacturing, the city&#x27;s economy depends on retail trade, health care, and social assistance. In recent years the city has worked to revive the downtown shopping area, with help from the Central Albany Revitalization Area.

==History==
In the historical era, the area of the Willamette Valley that makes up modern-day Albany was inhabited by one of the tribes of the Kalapuya, a Penutian-speaking, Native American people. The Kalapuya had named the area &quot;Takenah&quot;, a Kalapuyan word used to describe the deep pool at the confluence of the Calapooia and Willamette rivers. A variation of the place name can also be written as Tekenah.

The Kalapuya population in the valley was between 4,000 and 20,000 before contact with Europeans, but they suffered high mortality from new infectious diseases introduced shortly afterward. The tribes were decimated by a smallpox epidemic that raged through the Pacific Northwest in 1782–83. A malaria outbreak swept through the region between 1830 and 1833. It is estimated that as many as 90 percent of the Kalapuya population died during this period. That, coupled with the treaties signed during the 1850s by the Kalapuya to cede land to the United States, left the area nearly free for European Americans to settle.

===19th century===
Originally a farmer from Iowa, Abner Hackleman arrived as the first European American settler in 1845. Taking up a land claim for himself, Hackleman asked Hiram N. Smead to hold another for him until his son arrived from Iowa. In 1846, a year after arriving in Oregon, Hackleman died while returning to Iowa to fetch his family. In 1847 a pair of brothers, Walter and Thomas Monteith, settled in the area, after traveling by ox team along the Oregon Trail from their native state of New York. They were a family of early prominence in the area; in 1848, they bought a claim of from Hiram Smead for $400 and a horse; they plotted out for the town site. They named the city &quot;Albany&quot; after their hometown of Albany in New York. During the same period, Hackleman&#x27;s son Abram reached his father&#x27;s original land claim and built a log house in an oak grove still known as Hackleman&#x27;s Grove. He later built a house, which still stands at the corner of Fifth and Jackson. The small settlement that formed on the Hackleman land became known as the community of Takenah in 1849.
During this early period, the Monteith and Hackleman families were literally and politically on opposite sides of the fence. Residents in the Monteiths&#x27; portion of town were mainly Yankee merchants and professionals from the Upper Midwest and New England, who aligned with the Republican Party. They tended to sympathize with the Union during the Civil War. The residents in Hackleman&#x27;s portion of town to the east were made up mostly of working-class Democrats from the Upland South/Lower Midwest who were split between supporting the Union and the Confederacy. The two sides planted a hedge near Baker Street separating their sides of town.

With help from Samuel Althouse, the Monteiths built the first frame house in Albany in 1849. The Monteith House was considered the finest house in Oregon at the time. That same year the start of the California Gold Rush had caught the attention of the Monteith brothers, who provided supplies to the gold fields; their profits were seed money for several new businesses in Albany, including the general store. After the Monteiths developed these businesses, Albany became a major hub city in the Willamette Valley.

Albany&#x27;s first school was established in 1851 by the town&#x27;s first physician, R. C. Hill. The first school teacher was Eleanor B. Hackleman, wife of Abram Hackleman. It was not until 1855 that a building was specifically erected for use as a school. In 1852, the first steamboat, the &quot;Multnomah&quot;, arrived and the first flour mill was built.
On January 8, 1850, a U.S. post office was established in Albany, with John Burkhart appointed as the first U.S. Postmaster. The town was renamed as &quot;New Albany&quot; on November 4, 1850, but the name was changed back to Albany in 1853. In 1851, Albany was designated as the county seat, replacing Calapooia (near modern-day Brownsville and Sweet Home), and all court meetings were held there. The first Albany courthouse was built in 1852 on of land donated by the Monteiths to ensure Albany would remain the county seat. The new two-story octagonal courthouse was completed on April 26, 1853. The courthouse has since been replaced, but the new courthouse stands on the same site.

During 1853–1854, residents of the east side of Albany persuaded the Oregon Legislative Assembly to name both towns Takenah. Though &quot;Takenah&quot; meant &quot;deep pool,&quot; in reference to the confluence of the Calapooia and Willamette rivers, it was commonly translated as &quot;Hole in the Ground&quot;. Partially due to this translation, the legislature restored the name &quot;Albany&quot; to the town in 1855. Finally in 1864, 16 years after the Monteiths founded the town and 19 years after the first European Americans arrived, it became incorporated as a city.

In 1871, the trains first reached Albany, connecting it to other towns in the valley. The arrival of the first train was celebrated as the greatest event in Albany&#x27;s history. Albany businessmen raised $50,000 to ensure that the rails would be built through the city, instead of bypassing it a few miles eastward. The train brought the farmers&#x27; markets closer to the city, as stagecoaches and steamboats gave way to the railroad. The world&#x27;s longest wooden railroad drawbridge was built in 1888 for the Albany-Corvallis run. By 1910, 28 passenger trains departed daily from Albany going in five directions.

In 1872, the Santiam Ditch and Canal Company was organized, and a canal running from the Santiam near Lebanon was completed that autumn. The canal runs from the south side of Albany and divides at the corner of Vine and Eight streets, with one branch running down Vine Street and emptying into Calapooia Creek, with a drop of . The other runs down Eighth to Thurston Street.

===20th century===
In 1924 Pacific Power installed a turbine where the canal meets the river to generate electricity. In 1984 the city bought the water system from Pacific Power, and shut down the plant in 1991. By 2003 the city had approved a plan to restart the four megawatt-hour hydroelectric plant and in February 2009 the plant opened again. Albany was the headquarters for the Mountain States Power Company from its establishment in 1918 until its merger into Pacific Power &amp; Light (now PacifiCorp) in 1954.

In the 1940s, the city started the Albany World Championship Timber Carnival, which drew competitors from all over the world to participate in logging skills contests. The event took place over the four days of the Fourth of July weekend. Men and women would compete in climbing, chopping, bucking, and burling contests. In 2001 the carnival was cancelled because of smaller crowds and the state&#x27;s declining timber economy.

In 1916 Kuo-Ching Li, a Chinese-American engineer, founded Wah Chang Trading Corporation in New York State, but it was based in Albany. He developed it as an international tungsten ore and concentrate trading company, leading the company until his death in 1961. He served as president until 1960 and then board chairman.

The U.S. Bureau of Mines established Albany Research Center (ARC) on the former Albany College campus in 1942, focusing on the development of new metallurgical processes. First known as the Northwest Electro-development Facility, the site eventually produced titanium and zirconium, spearheaded by William Justin Kroll whom the bureau hired in 1945. The first zirconium strip was rolled out there in August 1946. In 1951, William Kroll joined the faculty of Oregon State College, ten miles away in Corvallis.

The ARC fostered the growth of a new rare metals industry in Albany, led by internationally recognized companies such as the Oregon Metallurgical Company, Oremet, and Wah Chang. In the 1970s, Albany attempted to extend its city limits to include a zirconium processing plant of Wah Chang Corporation in order to increase its industrial tax base. Wah Chang responded in 1974 by sponsoring a vote to incorporate the desired properties as Millersburg.

When the Bureau of Mines closed in 1996, the ARC was transferred to the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Fossil Energy. In 2005 the facility became part of the National Energy Technology Laboratory.

==Economy==

Albany calls itself the &quot;rare metals capital of the world&quot;, producing zirconium, hafnium and titanium. One of the major producers of these metals in Albany is ATI Specialty Alloys and Components (formerly ATI Wah Chang) which has a site that primarily focuses on the production of zirconium.

Albany and the surrounding communities are major exporters of grass seed. Other crops produced include corn, beans, mint, strawberries, and hazelnuts. Linn County is also referred to as the &quot;Grass Seed Capital of the World&quot;. Albany is the headquarters of Coastal Farm &amp; Ranch, a chain of farm supply stores in the Pacific Northwest.

The decline of the timber industry and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs has left Linn County with a relatively high unemployment rate. The Oregon Employment Department does not maintain unemployment statistics for cities. The losses in the timber industry in around Albany have led the city to a more diverse economic base for the city, led by retail trade, health care and social assistance, and manufacturing as the three leading aspects of the economy. Oregon Freeze Dry is a leading employer in the manufacturing sector of the Albany economy with its headquarters located in the city. The company employs over 300 people and was incorporated in 1963. The Albany facility is the company&#x27;s main research and development site in the industry, and has recently partnered with Seattle-based technology company EnerG2 to produce carbon electrode material, in a former distribution center of Oregon Freeze Dry by 2011 bringing a new green technology industry to Albany. Tec Laboratories has made Tecnu poison ivy cleanser and other topical medicines in Albany since 1977.

Albany is also home to the Albany Research Center, which is part of National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). They employ a staff of 120. Albany Research Center was founded in 1943, the laboratory specializes in life cycle research starting with the formulation, characterization, and/or melting of most metals, alloys, and ceramics; casting and fabrication, prototype development; and the recycle and remediation of waste streams associated with these processes.

The Heritage Mall, an enclosed shopping center, opened on November 2, 1988. The construction of a regional shopping center had been planned for a decade and included proposals to build a rival mall in Corvallis.

==Arts and culture==

===Annual cultural events===
The annual events in Albany include the Northwest Art and Air Festival, River Rhythms, Summer Sounds (formerly Mondays at Monteith), Veteran&#x27;s Day Parade, Albany Upstairs Downtown Wine Walk and the Craft Brew Smackdown.

The once popular Albany Timber Carnival ended in 2000. An attempt to revive the event in 2008 was unsuccessful.

The Albany Arts Festival was held from 1970 until the late 1980s.

===Museums and other points of interest===
Areas of interest include the Thomas and Walter Monteith House. Originally constructed near the Calapooia River, the Monteith house is one of the oldest buildings in Albany. It has been relocated twice, most recently to downtown Albany, where is serves as the Monteith House Museum and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Whitespires Church, another historically registered building, is the tallest building in town. The Albany Regional Museum features exhibits about Albany history and is housed in a historic building originally built by S.E. Young in 1887. Downtown Albany is a National Historic District, and features antique stores, restaurants, the Albany Civic Theater (one of the oldest civic theaters in Oregon, it has operated continuously since the opening of its first production on March 2, 1951), and one of the oldest Carnegie libraries still being used as a library. Since the early 2000s, a hand-carved carousel has been under construction at the Albany Historic Carousel and Museum.

Albany has four historic districts including the Albany Municipal Airport, Monteith Historic District, Hackleman Historic District, and the Albany Downtown Commercial Historic District. Albany&#x27;s historic districts include most of the housing styles built between 1840 and 1920, including Federal, Gothic Revival, American Farmhouse, Second Empire, Eastlake, Italianate, and Colonial Revival. Those historic districts were recognized as one of the best places to buy a historic home in the nation by This Old House online.

The station itself was constructed in 1909 for the Southern Pacific Railroad and is built of masonry. It is one of the oldest continuously operating passenger rail stations in the U.S. and has one of the best-equipped engine shops in the northwest. Southern Pacific 4449, a steam locomotive which resides at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center in Portland, occasionally visited the shop for repairs when it was residing at the Brooklyn Roundhouse in Portland (before 2012), as did several other locomotives stored at the now-demolished roundhouse.

<text>Milwaukie is a city mostly in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States; a very small portion of the city extends into Multnomah County. The population was 21,119 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1847 on the banks of the Willamette River, the city, known as the Dogwood City of the West, was incorporated in 1903 and is the birthplace of the Bing cherry. The city is now a suburb of Portland and also adjoins the unincorporated areas of Clackamas and Oak Grove.

==History==
The Clackamas people were the original inhabitants of the land upon which the city of Milwaukie now exists. Milwaukie was settled in 1847 and formally platted in 1849 as a rival to the upriver Oregon City by Lot Whitcomb, who named it for Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At the time, the Wisconsin city was also frequently spelled &quot;Milwaukie&quot; before the current spelling was adopted. Some accounts also state that the Oregon city used an alternate spelling to prevent confusion at the post office.

Whitcomb arrived in Oregon in 1848 and settled on a donation land claim, where he built a sawmill and a gristmill. Milwaukie rivaled Portland and Oregon City for a time, but Portland eventually became the bigger city because it had a deeper port. The first post office at Milwaukie was established in 1850, with Whitcomb as the first postmaster. The community was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 4, 1903, originally as the Town of Milwaukie.

The Oregon and California Railroad named their station there Milwaukee in 1870 and corrected it to Milwaukie in 1892. As the city center grew further from the railroad and a branch line was built across the Willamette to Oswego, Milwaukie station was replaced and renamed Lambert for Joseph H. Lambert, a pioneer orchardist who developed the Lambert cherry. The name of the station was changed to East Milwaukee in 1913 and corrected to East Milwaukie in 1916.

The Bing cherry, among other varieties, was developed in Milwaukie by Ah Bing, an orchard foreman employed by Seth Lewelling. A mural in the city commemorates Mr. Bing&#x27;s accomplishment.

==Geography==

== Housing ==
In 2015–2016, Milwaukie saw a boom in real estate. It was named the ninth hottest real estate market in 2016 by realtor.com. A big draw to the city was noticed right after the Orange Line from TriMet, a $1.4 billion project connecting the close-in suburb right to the heart of downtown Portland, finished in 2015. A year after the opening of the Orange Line, housing prices had risen 12.2% and city officials said there were no vacancies for retail storefronts in Milwaukie&#x27;s downtown area. In addition to the new Orange Line, Milwaukie finished a $2.2 million project to the city&#x27;s waterfront park. The city had a grand opening on May 1, 2015.

The city has one college campus, Clackamas Community College Harmony.

==Transportation==

===Public transit===

====Current====
Milwaukie is within the TriMet transit district and is served by several TriMet bus lines. TriMet established a transit center in downtown Milwaukie in 1981, and by 2000 was served by as many as 12 routes, using on-street stops around the intersection of Jackson Street and 21st Avenue, next to Milwaukie City Hall. Since 2010, the bus stops that previously comprised Milwaukie TC are no longer designated as a &quot;transit center&quot; by TriMet. In fall 2015, the focal point for rider transfers between routes shifted southward from the former transit-center location, with the opening of a new light rail station at the south end of downtown.

TriMet&#x27;s MAX Light Rail service was extended to Milwaukie on September 12, 2015. Construction of the MAX Orange Line, a light-rail connection between Portland and Milwaukie, began in 2011. Although this project had been planned for many years, it faced strong opposition by opponents of &quot;Portland Creep&quot;; in September 2012, opponents succeeded in passing a ballot initiative requiring that all Clackamas County spending on light rail be directly approved by the voters. The line was sufficiently complete by May 15, 2015, for 500 passengers to make an initial special run along its whole length. Regular passenger service began four months later.

====Past====

Streetcars began serving Milwaukie in August 1892, when the East Side Railway extended its service beyond the then-town of Sellwood. The company built a carbarn and workshop in downtown Milwaukie, on Jackson Street at River Road (now McLoughlin Blvd. at that location), which opened in December 1892. The following year, the company extended its line to Oregon City, and interurban service between Portland and Oregon City via Milwaukie began operating. During the several decades after 1900, a succession of other private companies, including the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company, operated the streetcar and interurban service to and through the town. All interurban service was discontinued in January 1958. At the time, the Portland–Milwaukie–Oregon City and Portland–Sellwood–Bellrose lines had been the last streetcar or interurban service operating in the Portland metropolitan area, and not until 1986 did interurban service return—in the form of MAX (light rail) between Portland and Gresham. Oregon Motor Stages, Inc., had provided some bus service through Milwaukie until 1954, when it abruptly ceased all operation. Replacement transit-bus service was introduced in 1955 by Intercity Buses, Inc., a member of a consortium of four bus companies collectively known as the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines, and Intercity expanded its service after the 1958 abandonment of the rail service. TriMet, a new government-owned public transit authority, was established in 1969, and in September 1970 it took over all of the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; companies. TriMet has been the primary provider of transit service in Milwaukie since that time.

===Former Amtrak service===
Amtrak passenger trains pass through Milwaukie without stopping. However, for a brief period in the early 1980s, an experimental Amtrak service named the &quot;Willamette Valley Express&quot; made a regular stop in Milwaukie, just east of the intersection of Harrison Street and Highway 224 (a location Amtrak referred to as East Milwaukie). The service, which ran twice a day in each direction and connected Portland with Eugene, was introduced on a trial basis in August 1980 and discontinued at the end of 1981.

==Government==

=== Federal and state government ===
In the United States House of Representatives, Milwaukie is in Oregon&#x27;s 5th congressional district, which is represented by Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer.

In the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Milwaukie is in the 21st Senate district, represented by Democrat Kathleen Taylor, and in the 41st House district, represented by Democrat Mark Gamba, a former mayor of the city.

<text>Tualatin ( ) is a city located primarily in Washington County in the U.S. state of Oregon. A small portion of the city is also located in neighboring Clackamas County. It is a southwestern suburb in the Portland Metropolitan Area that is located south of Tigard. The population was 27,942 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The name of the city is taken from the Tualatin River, which flows along most of the city&#x27;s northern boundary. It is probably a Native American word meaning &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;sluggish&quot; but possibly meaning &quot;treeless plain&quot; for the plain near the river or &quot;forked&quot; for its many tributaries. According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, a post office with the spelling &quot;Tualitin&quot; was established November 5, 1869, and the spelling changed to &quot;Tualatin&quot; in 1915.

In the 1850s, the settlement was first called &quot;Galbreath&quot; after its founder Samuel Galbreath. In 1853, Galbreath built the first bridge over the Tualatin river, and the town became known as &quot;Bridgeport&quot;. In the 1880s, John Sweek platted a town around the new railroad depot, and named the town &quot;Tualatin&quot;. It was incorporated as the City of Tualatin in 1913.

In 1962, a fossilized Mastodon (&quot;Mammut americanum)&quot; was excavated in what later became a Fred Meyer parking lot. It is on display in the lobby of Tualatin Public Library. In 1972 fossils were uncovered near Fanno Creek that were determined to be a partial skeleton of a Harlan&#x27;s Ground Sloth (&quot;Paramylodon harlani).&quot;

Built at the site of a former quarry, Bridgeport was designed to be reminiscent of an open-air European-style shopping experience. It features an 18-screen movie theater, several national and regional chain restaurants, and many chain retail stores.

Tualatin is also home to Nyberg Woods, a neighborhood and lifestyle center located at the conjunction of Interstate 5 and Nyberg road. Tualatin also harbors Nyberg Rivers, which opened in the fall of 2014 and is the third major retail project to be developed by CenterCal Properties in Tualatin. Following the construction of Bridgeport Village and Nyberg Woods, Nyberg Rivers contains approximately 300,000 square feet of retail, restaurant, fitness, and entertainment space.

There are many factories on the south side of town, including a large Lam Research plant that makes electrochemical deposition tools for manufacturing semiconductors.

<text>Wilsonville is a city in Clackamas and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. Founded with the name Boones Landing for the Boones Ferry that crossed the Willamette River, the community became Wilsonville in 1880. The city was incorporated in 1969 with a population of approximately 1,000. The population was 19,509 at the 2010 census and grew to 26,664 as of the 2020 census.

Located within the Portland metropolitan area, the city also includes the planned communities of Charbonneau on the south side of the river and Villebois on the western edge. Wilsonville is bisected by Interstate 5 and includes I-5&#x27;s Boone Bridge over the Willamette River. Public transportation is provided by the city-owned South Metro Area Regional Transit, which connects to the Portland-based TriMet through TriMet&#x27;s WES Commuter Rail and by bus at the Tualatin Park &amp; Ride. The public school districts are the West Linn-Wilsonville and Canby school districts, and the only traditional high school is Wilsonville High School. Clackamas Community College and Oregon Tech have satellite campuses in the city.

Wilsonville has a council-manager form of government and operates its own library, public works, and parks and recreation department. Fire and police protection are contracted out to other regional government agencies. The city is home to several technology companies including Siemens Digital Industries Software, along with Stream Global Services, the largest employer in the city. Wilsonville contains many distribution and manufacturing buildings adjacent to Interstate 5, such as regional distribution facilities for Coca-Cola and Rite Aid. Retail centers include Argyle Square on the north and the Town Center Shopping Center to the south. Media in Wilsonville consists of the Portland area broadcast stations, regional newspapers, and the local &quot;Wilsonville Spokesman&quot; newspaper.

==History==
Alphonso Boone, the grandson of Daniel Boone, settled in what would later become Wilsonville in 1846 and established the Boones Ferry across the Willamette River in 1847. The ferry gave rise to the community of &quot;Boones Landing&quot;, which eventually grew into Wilsonville. Originally, the area was part of what became Yamhill County, but was transferred to the current Clackamas County in 1855. The first post office was established in 1876 with the name &quot;Boones Ferry&quot;.

Wilsonville became the name of the community on June 3, 1880, named after the first postmaster, Charles Wilson. That same year the first school, Wilsonville Grade School, was opened as a single-room building. By 1890, the railroad had reached town and the community contained depot, several hotels, a saloon, a tavern, a bank, and several other commercial establishments. In 1897, the twelve school districts in the vicinity of Wilsonville up to Lake Oswego merged to create a single district. A railroad bridge was built across the river for the Oregon Electric Railway beginning in 1906. The bridge was completed the next year and service from Wilsonville south to Salem began in 1908.

A new Methodist church was built in the community in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.

In 1961, the Dammasch State Hospital mental hospital opened on the west side of the community. Gordon House, the only house in Oregon to be designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was built in 1963 near what became Charbonneau and moved to the Oregon Garden in 2001. Wilsonville was flooded in 1964 and the first fire station was built in 1966. Wilsonville was incorporated as a city on October 10, 1968, with a population of about 1,000. In 1971, the planned community of Charbonneau on the south side of the river was annexed into the city the year after development began.

Tektronix built a campus in the city beginning in 1973, which was later sold to Xerox. The following year Wilsonville&#x27;s city hall relocated from Tauchman House at what is now Boones Ferry Park to a trailer and the next year the first city manager was hired. A standalone post office was built in 1976 at Boones Ferry and Wilsonville roads, with city police protection added in 1979. In 1980, the city reached a population of 2,920, and in 1982 the library was opened. The next year, a new city hall was opened, replacing a trailer that had served as city hall since 1975.

In 1988, the city opened their first library building, which replaced the one-room library located in space leased from the school district. The population grew to 7,106 at the 1990 census, and in 1991 the Town Center Shopping Center along Wilsonville Road opened. Due to growth in the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the school board approved building a new high school to be located in Wilsonville in 1992.

Author Walt Morey owned an estate in Wilsonville and after his death in 1992, his widow sold the property to a developer. The housing development built on that property, Morey&#x27;s Landing, bears his name as does the children&#x27;s section of the Wilsonville Public Library. Walt Morey Park, a bear-themed park located in Morey&#x27;s Landing, contains a life-size 8-foot-tall wooden statue of Morey&#x27;s most famous literary creation, Gentle Ben.

Living Enrichment Center, a New Thought Church with as many as 3,000 members, was headquartered in Wilsonville from 1992 until 2004. The church closed that year after problems that including money laundering by the church leaders led to the bankrupting of the church.

In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital was closed by the state of Oregon, and the site was then proposed as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site to the north of the old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect on property values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital have been redeveloped as Villebois, a primarily residential planned community. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city&#x27;s history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.

The Wilsonville Public Library was expanded to nearly four times the size of the 1988 building with an expansion finished in 2002. Wilsonville Primary School was closed in June 2001, and later sold with the property and turned into a shopping center, anchored by an Albertsons supermarket. In September 2006, Wilsonville opened a new $9.9 million, two-story brick and steel city hall after a controversy concerning its location led to unsuccessful attempts to recall several elected officials in the city, including the mayor. In 2007, the old city hall building was turned into a new public works and police department.

During the Great Recession, Nike closed its distribution center in Wilsonville, projector maker InFocus moved its headquarters from the city, and retailer G.I. Joe&#x27;s that was headquartered there went out of business. In 2010, the Oregon Institute of Technology took over the InFocus building to house the school&#x27;s Portland area campus. A new shopping center named Old Town Square anchored by a Fred Meyer store opened in 2011 along Interstate 5 at Wilsonville Road, which also included a McMenamins location.

Lowrie Primary School in the West Linn-Wilsonville School District opened in 2012 in the Villebois part of the city. The Villebois Community Center in that area was completed in 2013. A fire in March 2019 destroyed 20 homes that were being built in the Villebois area. In 2021, Fry&#x27;s Electronics closed its store that had opened as Incredible Universe in 1992, while museum World of Speed and the local bowling alley also closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021, the city hit on June 28, 2021, during a heatwave, Wilsonville&#x27;s highest recorded temperature. The only theater in town, a nine-screen Regal Cinemas, closed in July 2023.

==Geography==

Wilsonville is located on the southern edge of the Portland metropolitan area, sitting at an elevation of above sea level.

<doc id="150986" wikidata="Q378065" url="?curid=150986" title="Charles Hatchett">
<text>Charles Hatchett FRS FRSE (2 January 1765 – 10 March 1847) was an English mineralogist and analytical chemist who discovered the element niobium, for which he proposed the name &quot;columbium&quot;.

Hatchett was elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1795,
and of the Royal Society in 1797. Hatchett was elected to the Literary Club in London in 1809 and became its treasurer in 1829.

==Life==
Charles Hatchett was born in Long Acre, London to John Hatchett (1729–1806), and Elizabeth Hatchett. John Hatchett was &quot;(one of) the coachbuilders of London of the greatest celebrity&quot;. He later became a magistrate in Hammersmith. Charles Hatchett attended a private school, Fountayne&#x27;s, in Marylebone Park, and was a self-taught mineralogist and analytical chemist.

On 24 March 1786, Charles Hatchett married Elizabeth Martha Collick (1756–1837) at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Their children included:
#John Charles Hatchett (bapt 27 January 1788 St Martin-in-the-Fields)
#His daughter, Anna Frederica Hatchett, married the chemist William Thomas Brande.

Following their marriage, Hatchett and his wife traveled extensively in Poland and Russia for 2 years before settling in Hammersmith. In 1790, Hatchett again had the opportunity to travel extensively, when his father sent him to deliver a coach to Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg. With an introduction from Sir Joseph Banks, he visited chemist Martin Klaproth, geologist and botanist Peter Pallas, Neapolitan mineralogist Andrea Savaresi, and other scientists.

In 1796 Hatchett took another long tour, this time through England and Scotland, where he visited geological sites, mines, and factories. His diary of this trip was edited by Arthur Raistrick and published in 1967 as &quot;The Hatchett diary: a tour through the counties of England and Scotland in 1796 visiting their mines and manufactories&quot;.

==Chemistry==
Charles Hatchett&#x27;s work on chemistry occurred mostly between 1796 and 1806, a ten-year period. In 1796, he published &quot;An analysis of the Corinthian molybdate of lead&quot;, resolving a dispute over the nature of the mineral. In 1797 he was elected a Fellow of The Royal Society, largely as a result of this work. In more than 20 additional papers, he addressed the chemistry of minerals, resins and natural products.
In 1800 Hatchett may have opened a small chemical works at Chiswick in London.

In 1798, Hatchett was asked by members of the Privy Council to work with Henry Cavendish and assess &quot;the state of the coins of the realm&quot; to ensure that they were not being adulterated. 
He produced a 152-page-long report in 1803. He concluded that &#x27;there was no important defect in the composition or quantity of the standard gold&#x27;.

Hatchett developed a collection of over 7000 minerals, which he sold to the British Museum in London in 1799. He agreed to organize the museum&#x27;s mineral collection, but retained the right to remove and analyze portions of some of the specimens.

In 1801, Hatchett analyzed a piece of columbite from the collection at the British Museum. Columbite turned out to be a very complex mineral, and Hachett discovered that it contained a &quot;new earth&quot; which implied the existence of a new element. Lavoisier had defined the term &quot;element&quot; a mere 13 years previously. Hatchett called this new element &quot;columbium&quot; (Cb) in honour of Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.
On 26 November of that year he announced his discovery before the Royal Society.

In 1802 Anders Gustaf Ekeberg (1767–1813) announced the discovery of another new element, &quot;tantalum&quot;. For many years, there was confusion over whether columbium and tantalum were the same. 
In 1846, German chemist Heinrich Rose argued that there were two additional elements in tantalite, which he named niobium and pelopium for the children of the Cyclops. Eventually, Rose&#x27;s niobium (atomic number 41) was found to be identical to Hatchett&#x27;s columbium. In 1949, the name &quot;niobium&quot; was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam.

==Publications==

*&quot;Analysis of Magnetical Pyrites&quot; (1804)
*&quot;Treatise on Spikenard of the Ancients&quot; (1836)

==Later life==
After his father&#x27;s death, Hatchett largely gave up his activities as a chemist. He inherited his father&#x27;s coach-making business and pursued interests in collecting books (including a First Folio) manuscripts, paintings, and musical instruments. His loss was lamented by colleagues such as Thomas Thomson (1773–1852), who wrote that Hatchett &quot;was an active chemist…but unfortunately this most amiable and accomplished man has been lost to science for more than a quarter of a century; the baneful effects of wealth, and cares of a lucrative and extensive business, having completely waned him from scientific pursuits&quot;.

Hatchett lived at Mount Clare, Roehampton from 1807 to 1819.
It has been described as &quot;a little estate built in a fine Italian style&quot; with nearby &quot;a very well-equipped laboratory&quot;. The house was designed by Sir Robert Taylor for George Clive, with modifications by the Italian architect Placido Columbani in 1780. The gardens were laid out by Capability Brown in 1774.

In 1818 Hatchett either bought back or chose to no longer lease out the house that had been built by his father in 1771, Belle Vue, 92 Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London. A grade II listed building, it has a large central portion with bay windows back and front, and two wings. It overlooks gardens and the River Thames. He lived there for the rest of his life. Elizabeth, his wife, predeceased him in 1837.

Hatchett himself died at Belle Vue House in 1847, and is buried at St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey, Slough,
the same church where his friend William Herschel is interred.

==Recognition==
Hatchett was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1798. In 1828, he was recognized by the Royal Institution. Hatchett, Humphry Davy, William Thomas Brande, William Hyde Wollaston, Michael Faraday and John Frederic Daniell received a gold medal for their discoveries in chemistry. The award was given by John Fuller, founder of the Institution&#x27;s Fullerian Chair of Chemistry.

In 1979, the Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração established the Charles Hatchett Award.
It is presented by the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (&quot;IOM3&quot;) (London), yearly, to a noted metallurgist. The award is given for &quot;the best research on the science and technology of niobium and its alloys&quot;. The medal is cast in pure niobium.

==Transportation==
Idanha served as the eastern terminus of a transcontinental railroad, proposed by Colonel T. Egenton Hogg, that terminated in Idanha because of a lack of funding. Idanha saw rail service until the 1950s, when the track was removed for development of Detroit Lake, situated over the historical roadbed of the former Oregon Pacific Railroad.

==Santiam Fire==
Idanha was one of the small cities in the Santiam Canyon impacted by a group of wildfires which converged and were later known collectively as the Santiam Fire. The Lionshead Wildfire had ignited on August 16, 2020, within the nearby Willamette National Forest. It continued burning in the wilderness area with limited intervention by firefighters due to the difficult terrain, slowly growing in size until September 7, 2020, when strong east winds reaching drove the wildfire east through the canyon in which the town of Idanha and several others are located. Chaotic evacuations were ordered during the night of September 7–8, 2020. The Idanha-Detroit Rural Fire Protection District, which serves the cities of Idanha and Detroit, was pivotal in notifying sleeping residents of the evacuations and attempting to manage numerous small fires which had sprung up due to electrical lines coming down in the strong wind, with limited success. Unfortunately the city of Detroit was almost entirely destroyed, and the fire department itself suffered the loss of their administrative office and two fire trucks. Over the coming days, the wildfire would converge with several others in the area and become known as the Santiam Wildfire, destroying 402,274 acres (162,795 ha), among the worst in Oregon&#x27;s history.

<doc id="150988" wikidata="Q2684596" url="?curid=150988" title="Mill City, Oregon">
<text>Mill City is a city in Linn and Marion counties in the U.S. state of Oregon on Oregon Route 22. The population was 1,971 at the 2020 census. It is on the North Santiam River, downstream from Detroit Lake.

The Linn County portion of Mill City is part of the Albany–Lebanon Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the Marion County portion is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The City of Mill City contracts through the Linn County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for local law enforcement, however, it does have its own Mill City Fire Department and other public works departments.

In September 2020, Mill City suffered extensive damage from the Santiam Fire.

==History==
The city was incorporated in 1941, and serves as the education hub of the Santiam Canyon. It was named and known for its various lumber mills, including Hammond Lumber Company and Santiam Lumber Company. Mill City is now home to two lumber mills, Frank Lumber Co. and Freres Lumber Plant 3.

One of the oldest and best-known landmarks in Mill City is the former railroad bridge, now a pedestrian bridge. The Phoenix Column Bridge, built by Phoenix Iron Works, was manufactured in 1888, moved to San Jose, California, then to Lake Oswego, Oregon, then to Mill City and installed in 1919. Abandoned by Southern Pacific Railroad around 1967, it is now a pedestrian and bike bridge. Current restoration efforts are being undertaken by the Save our Bridge Foundation.

In September 2020, the Beachie Creek Fire swept through the town. Mill City suffered heavy damage from the fire.

==Media==
The Mill City &quot;Logue&quot; was published by Al and Arlene Van Dahl from 1926 to 1933. In 1931, they started &quot;Western Stamp Collector&quot; as a supplement to the &quot;Logue&quot;. It grew so quickly that in 1933, they closed down the &quot;Logue&quot; and moved to Albany, Oregon. Al Van Dahl died in 1954. Arlene Van Dahl continued publishing the then semi-weekly, national newspaper until 1976 when she sold it to Jackson Newspapers. (Jackson Newspapers was sold to Capital Cities Communications, later Capital Cities/ABC, which dropped the word &quot;Western&quot; from the name and changed the publication schedule back to weekly. Capital Cities/ABC was sold to Disney Corp. in 1995. Krause Publications of Iola, Wisconsin, bought Van Dahl Publications, then publishing the &quot;Stamp Collector&quot; newspaper and the &quot;Stamp Wholesaler&quot; magazine, from Disney in 1996. &quot;Stamp Collector&quot; ceased publication in 2003.)

The Mill City &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the longest-running local newspaper serving the canyon from 1949 through 1998. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was owned and operated by George and Norma Long for 30 years from 1968 to their retirement in 1998 at which point the paper was sold and subsequently renamed. The Mill City &quot;Enterprise&quot; is currently being archived by the University of Oregon.

From 1998 until 2014, the Mill City &quot;Independent Press&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;) covered local news. It was owned by Phil Foster and then by Bill Downer, a former logger and former mayor of Mill City, and his wife Judy Downer.

The area is currently served by &quot;The Canyon Weekly&quot;, started in 2010 by Karen &amp; Tim Widmer and Michelle Gates.

==Geography and climate==
Mill City is located at above sea level in the Santiam Canyon and considered part of the foothills of the Cascade Range. Shaped by the North Santiam River, the canyon is a result of seasonal glacier melts from the southern face of Mt. Jefferson to the east and many tributaries scattered along the canyon, the largest being the Breitenbush River which meets the Santiam in Detroit, roughly east of Mill City. The looming canyon walls are the most noticeable feature in passing from Highway 22; however, look more like tall hills on the north and south sides of Mill City. Further into town two bridges allow crossing of the North Santiam River.

Mill City is surrounded by forests of evergreen trees. Most notably the Santiam State Forest to the south, forest land is otherwise privately owned, mostly by Weyerhaeuser but also local companies like Frank Lumber and Freres. The forests are primarily dominated by Douglas fir, but junipers and maple trees are also scattered throughout.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Prior to 2000, Mill City, Gates, Detroit, and Idanha were served by separate schools and districts; however, Mill City eventually became the education center for the Santiam Canyon with the closing of Gates Elementary School in 2012.

As of the 2019 school year, Mill City and the rest of the Santiam Canyon is home to Santiam Preschool/Early Childhood Center, Santiam Elementary School, Santiam Junior/Senior High School and Oregon Connections Academy. Mill City is served by the Santiam Canyon School District.

<text>Willamina is a city in Polk and Yamhill Counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. The population was 2,239 at the 2020 census.

The Yamhill County portion of Willamina is part of the Portland–Vancouver–Beaverton, Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Polk County portion is part of the Salem Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Willamina was named after Willamina Creek, which in turn was named for early settler Willamina Williams shortly after she fell off of her horse and into the creek. Williams was born Willamina Craig in 1817 in Ohio. She married James Maley in 1837 and the couple came to Oregon in 1845 with James&#x27; daughter. While looking for land to settle, the family came across a tributary of the South Yamhill River and named it for Mrs. Maley. James Maley died in 1847, and Willamina married Enos Williams in 1848. They settled in what is now Amity.

Willamina post office was established in 1855 on the James Brown land claim, about a mile east of present-day Willamina. The office moved in 1863 about two miles west to the Jeremiah Lamson land claim. In 1866, the office was moved and renamed to present-day Sheridan. In 1878, a new Willamina post office was established; it operated from December 1880 to March 1891 just over the county line in Polk County. A gristmill and sawmill were established in 1878. The townsite was platted in 1879 and Willamina incorporated in 1903. At that time the city had 200 residents.

==Geography==

==Economy==

Willamina experienced an economic boom in 1907, when a brick-making company, the Pacific Face Brick Company, moved from Newberg and opened the Willamina Clay Products plant. The Sheridan and Willamina Railroad was built to the city because of the brick plant, which ran for 82 years. Bricks made at Willamina Clay Products were used in the Portland Art Museum, Jackson Tower, and Lloyd Center in Portland, and the Yamhill County Courthouse. The brick plant closed in 1974; the buildings were razed in 1976. The red clay for the company&#x27;s products came from Newberg, the white clay from Willamina, and the buff clay from Buena Vista.

The other mainstay of the city&#x27;s economy is the timber industry, and when the Pacific Plywood Corporation opened a plant in 1939, the city&#x27;s population tripled. Willamina became known as &quot;The Little Town with the Big Payroll&quot;. As of 2002, the city&#x27;s largest employers were Spirit Mountain Casino in nearby Grand Ronde, Hampton Lumber Company, Willamina School District, Maben Trucking, and Eddy Trucking.

==Infrastructure==

===Rail===
The Sheridan and Willamina Railroad was founded in 1907 and became part of the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Willamina Branch in 1913.

<doc id="150996" wikidata="Q47664" url="?curid=150996" title="Catherine Zeta-Jones">
<text>Catherine Zeta-Jones (; born 25 September 1969) is a Welsh actress. Recognised for her versatility, she has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony Award. In 2010, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her film and humanitarian work.

Born and raised in Swansea, Zeta-Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the West End productions of the musicals &quot;Annie&quot; and &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;. She studied musical theatre at the Arts Educational Schools, London, and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film &quot;1001 Nights&quot; (1990), and went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991–1993). Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles. She established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) and the heist film &quot;Entrapment&quot; (1999).

Zeta-Jones received critical acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000) and Velma Kelly in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; (2003), the heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004), the comedy &quot;The Terminal&quot; (2004), and the romantic comedy &quot;No Reservations&quot; (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to the stage and played an aging actress in a Broadway production of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones worked intermittently in the subsequent decades, starring in the films &quot;Side Effects&quot; (2013), &quot;Red 2&quot; (2013) and &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (2016). She took on supporting roles in television, portraying Olivia de Havilland in &quot;Feud: Bette &amp; Joan&quot; (2017) and Morticia Addams in &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022–present).

Aside from acting, Zeta-Jones is a brand endorser and supports various charitable causes. Her struggle with depression and bipolar II disorder has been well documented by the media. She is married to actor Michael Douglas, with whom she has two children.

== Early life and initial stage career ==

Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on 25 September 1969 in Swansea, South Wales, to David Jones, the owner of a sweet factory, and his wife Patricia (née Fair), a seamstress. Her father is Welsh and her mother is of Irish Catholic descent. She was named after her grandmothers, Zeta Jones (derived from the name of a ship that her great-grandfather sailed on) and Catherine Fair. She has an older brother, David, and a younger brother, Lyndon, who worked as a sales representative before venturing into film production. She was raised in the Mumbles district of Swansea. Because Zeta-Jones was a hyperactive child, her mother sent her to the Hazel Johnson School of Dance when she was four years old. She was educated at Dumbarton House School, a private school in Swansea. The family came from a modest background, but their fortunes improved when they won £100,000 in a bingo competition, thus enabling them to pay for their daughter&#x27;s dance and ballet lessons.

Zeta-Jones participated in school stage shows from a young age and gained local media attention when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At age nine, Zeta-Jones was selected to play July, one of the orphan girls in the original West End production of the musical &quot;Annie&quot;, and in her early teens, she became a national tap dancing champion. In 1981, she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;. When she was fifteen, Zeta-Jones left school without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, &quot;I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted&quot;. She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in the Chiswick district of London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.

In 1987, a seventeen-year-old Zeta-Jones was picked as the second understudy for the lead actress in a West End production of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. During one of the performances, both the star and the first understudy were unavailable, and Zeta-Jones was asked to play the role of Peggy Sawyer—a chorus girl who becomes a star. The producer was impressed by her acting ability and allowed her to play the part for the following two years. Her next stage appearance was with the English National Opera at the London Coliseum in 1989 where she played Mae Jones in Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Street Scene&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1990–1996: Screen debut and career struggles ===
In 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca&#x27;s film &quot;1001 Nights&quot;. An adaptation of the Persian fable &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte). &quot;1001 Nights&quot; did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the film &quot;is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.&quot; Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; from 1991 to 1993. Adapted from H. E. Bates″ novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain. The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it. &quot;Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed. I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere&quot;, she remarked.

Following a brief appearance as Beatriz Enríquez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas″ television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in &quot;Splitting Heirs&quot; (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews of the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found her to be &quot;very funny&quot;. In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;, an adaptation of the 1878 novel of the same name by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen&#x27;s character in the television war drama &quot;The Cinder Path&quot;. She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic &quot;Catherine the Great&quot;. In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; found the miniseries to be &quot;brightly colored&quot; but &quot;wooden and hollow&quot;, though thought that Zeta-Jones &quot;imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making&quot;. She next appeared as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee&#x27;s character in &quot;Blue Juice&quot; (1995), publicised as Britain&#x27;s first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin dismissed as a &quot;superficial and predictable&quot; production.

Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles, stating: &quot;There was all this fuss about who I was and wasn&#x27;t dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again.&quot; She believed that her anonymity in America helped her obtain roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the henchwoman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries &quot;Titanic&quot; (1996) was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she played the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother who engages in an extramarital affair aboard the ill-fated RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

=== 1998–2000: Hollywood breakthrough and success ===

Steven Spielberg took notice of Zeta-Jones in &quot;Titanic&quot; and recommended her to Martin Campbell, who was directing &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) for Spielberg&#x27;s production company. Campbell cast her as the leading lady instead of Izabella Scorupco, who was his original choice for the part. Co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, the film tells the story of Zorro (Hopkins), a Spanish warrior (the film is set in Old California) who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones). She found similarities between her &quot;volatile&quot; Celtic personality and her Latin character&#x27;s temperament, and in preparation she learnt dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish. Filming action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the dry Mexican desert proved challenging for Zeta-Jones, but she found the experience &quot;worth suffering for&quot;. &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; was positively received by the critics and grossed over $250 million worldwide. The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance.

Zeta-Jones&#x27;s first release of 1999 was the heist film &quot;Entrapment&quot;, in which she starred opposite Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent on the lookout for an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to &quot;show off her slithery skills&quot;, and Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in &quot;The Haunting&quot;, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that &quot;Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a pretty face, and not an interesting one at that&quot;.

After taking the supporting part of the lead John Cusack&#x27;s former romantic interest in the comedy-drama &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000), Zeta-Jones starred in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000). In the ensemble thriller on drug abuse co-starring Michael Douglas and Benicio del Toro, she played Helena, the pregnant wife of a drug lord who takes over the business when her husband is arrested. Originally written as a mother of two, Soderbergh changed the part to that of a pregnant woman on Zeta-Jones&#x27;s suggestion to accommodate her own pregnancy. Highly profitable at the box office and critically acclaimed, &quot;Traffic&quot; was described by the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; as &quot;a remarkable achievement in filmmaking, a beautiful and brutal work&quot;. Edward Guthman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout among the cast and labelled her &quot;sensational&quot; in a scene in which Helena confronts a Tijuana dealer, adding that &quot;through sheer conviction, she electrifies a moment that could have been absurd&quot;. The ensemble of &quot;Traffic&quot; won the SAG Award for Outstanding Cast and Zeta-Jones was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.

=== 2001–2004: Established actress ===
The romantic comedy &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; was Zeta-Jones&#x27;s sole film release of 2001. She starred as a shrewd film star, opposite Julia Roberts who featured as her character&#x27;s under-confident sibling. The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly &quot;chilly and manipulative&quot; in her part. The following year, she starred as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), a film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name from director Rob Marshall. She based her character&#x27;s look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey the character&#x27;s &quot;flamboyance&quot; and &quot;desperation&quot; through &quot;little looks and nuances&quot;. The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; believed that Zeta-Jones had made &quot;a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess&quot;, and David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote that she has &quot;a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancingalthough she&#x27;s a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage&quot; and particularly praised her rendition of the song &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. &quot;Chicago&quot; grossed $306 million worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture. For her performance, she won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations.
Following the success of &quot;Chicago&quot;, Zeta-Jones voiced the part of Princess Marina in &quot;&quot; (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She was drawn to the project to give her young children an opportunity to &quot;hear [her] and get a sense of [her] on film&quot;, but the film proved to be a box office bomb. Also in 2003, Zeta-Jones starred alongside George Clooney in the Coen brothers″ black comedy &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;. A commercial success, the film saw her play the role of a serial divorcée who is drawn towards a divorce lawyer (Clooney). Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, the critic Damon Wise labelled the film a &quot;dazzling screwball comedy&quot; and felt that Zeta-Jones had shown &quot;an admirable facility for old-school quickfire patter&quot;. Other reviewers praised her onscreen chemistry with Clooney.

In 2004, Spielberg approached her to play an insecure air hostess in his comedy &quot;The Terminal&quot;, a film about a man (Tom Hanks) who is trapped at the JFK International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States. Spielberg was intent on her playing against type as a strong-willed woman, with a vulnerability in her character, but the critic A. O. Scott felt that it came across as using her for &quot;her looks rather than for the arch, self-mocking wit that is her secret weapon as a comic actress&quot;. Commercially, &quot;The Terminal&quot; performed well. She next worked with Soderbergh to film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;, a sequel to his heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), which also reunited her with stars Clooney, Pitt, and Roberts. The production, which was filmed in several European countries, saw Zeta-Jones play Isabel Lahiri, a Europol agent, and the love interest of Pitt&#x27;s character. Paul Clinton of CNN noted that her sex appeal benefited the film. Conversely, Ken Tucker of &quot;New York&quot; magazine argued that her character was redundant to the film&#x27;s plot. Despite dividing critics, the sequel grossed over $360 million globally.

=== 2005–2010: Decrease in workload and return to the stage ===
&quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; (2005), a sequel to &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, saw her reprise the role of Eléna opposite Banderas. Set ten years after the first film, the sequel follows Eléna struggling with married life. Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment. She did not have any film releases in 2006. A biopic of Harry Houdini, titled &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot; (2007), starring Guy Pearce as the escapologist Houdini, featured Zeta-Jones as a Scottish con artist who claims psychic powers. The unsuccessful production was given only a limited theatrical release.

In 2007, Zeta-Jones starred alongside Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin in the romantic comedy &quot;No Reservations&quot;, a remake of the German film &quot;Mostly Martha&quot; (2001). &quot;No Reservations&quot; tells the story of an ambitious chef (Zeta-Jones) whose life changes for the better when she takes in her young niece (Breslin) after her sister&#x27;s death. In preparation for her part, Zeta-Jones worked in the kitchen and waited on tables at New York&#x27;s Fiamma Osteria restaurant. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that Zeta-Jones &quot;shines as a character that finely balances off-putting reserve with sympathetic appeal&quot;, and Roger Ebert, despite disliking the film, did find her to be &quot;convincing&quot; in her role. With a global gross of $92 million, the film marked her final commercial success of the decade.

After &quot;No Reservations&quot;, Zeta-Jones significantly decreased her workload in the following five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a forty-year-old mother attracted to a younger man (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy &quot;The Rebound&quot;. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.

Zeta-Jones returned to the stage in 2009 with a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the complicated relations between a group of people (including characters played by Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of a summer. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the piece, explaining: &quot;There&#x27;s no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings, ... It&#x27;s not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging&quot;. She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the musical so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a &quot;quiet, reflective poignancy&quot; in her rendition of the song &quot;Send In the Clowns&quot;, but Emma Brockes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was more critical, remarking that &quot;with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [she] seems to be auditioning for stage school&quot;. For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

=== 2012–2016: Return to film ===
After a three-year sabbatical from acting, she made her screen comeback in &quot;Lay the Favorite&quot; (2012), a comedy co-starring Bruce Willis and Rebecca Hall, in which she played the jealous wife of a gambler (Willis). Reviews of the film were negative, and Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found Zeta-Jones to be &quot;far too shrill to amuse&quot;. In the ensemble musical comedy &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, co-starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston, Zeta-Jones played the part of a religiously conservative wife of a mayor. She was attracted to the idea of playing a &quot;nightmare of a woman&quot; and based the role on the politician Michele Bachmann; the film received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Her final release of 2012 was &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, a romantic comedy with Gerard Butler, which proved to be her third box office failure of the year.

In 2013, Zeta-Jones took on a leading role in the crime thriller &quot;Broken City&quot;, co-starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe. The film tells the story of a private detective (Wahlberg) who is hired by the mayor of New York City (Crowe) to spy on his wife (Zeta-Jones). The critic Todd McCarthy thought that Zeta-Jones &quot;looks like class itself and nicely underplays&quot;, and Liam Lacey of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; observed that the actress &quot;does a fair, if incongruous, impersonation of a forties vamp&quot;. As with her previous few projects, it was not widely seen and received poor reviews. This changed when Zeta-Jones collaborated with Soderbergh for the third time to film the critically acclaimed thriller &quot;Side Effects&quot; (2013). Co-starring Channing Tatum, Jude Law and Rooney Mara, the film saw her play a mysterious psychiatrist who recommends an antidepressant drug with serious side effects. Peter Travers, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called the film a &quot;hell of a thriller, twisty, terrific and packed with surprises&quot; and found Zeta-Jones to be &quot;dynamite&quot; in it.

In the action comedy &quot;Red 2&quot; (2013), which served as a sequel to the 2010 film &quot;Red&quot;, Zeta-Jones played a seductive Russian double agent, alongside Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker. She was drawn to the project, which follows the comic adventures of retired spies, for &quot;the action, the humour, [and] the tongue-in-cheek quality of it&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Justin Lowe stated that Zeta-Jones &quot;nicely pulls off Russian spy Katja&#x27;s mix of allure and menace&quot;, and with a worldwide gross of $148 million, &quot;Red 2&quot; emerged as her most widely seen film since &quot;No Reservations&quot;.

Following &quot;Red 2&quot;, Zeta-Jones took another sabbatical from acting, saying: &quot;If I&#x27;m going to leave my family for any length of time it had better be for a role that I haven&#x27;t played before, [otherwise] I would prefer to stay at home&quot;. She found such a part opposite Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of &quot;Variety&quot; considered the film to be an &quot;amiable but creaky resurrection&quot; of the sitcom, and added that while Zeta-Jones &quot;hits the required single note with some spirit&quot; she was &quot;generally underused&quot; in it.

=== 2017–present: Television and streaming ===

Zeta-Jones returned to television in 2017, portraying actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy&#x27;s anthology drama series &quot;Feud&quot;, subtitled &quot;Bette and Joan&quot;, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; found Zeta-Jones to be &quot;wonderfully cast&quot; and Sonia Saraiya of &quot;Variety&quot; credited her for providing &quot;the best turn in the show&quot;. Displeased with an &quot;unauthorized use of her name and identity&quot; in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of &quot;Feud&quot; for invasion of privacy and other personality rights. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a California appellate court.

In 2018, Zeta-Jones starred as the drug lord Griselda Blanco in the Lifetime television film &quot;Cocaine Godmother&quot;. Despite her character&#x27;s misdeeds, she was drawn to her character&#x27;s fortitude and ability to stand out in a male-dominated business. Writing for IndieWire, Hanh Nguyen criticised the decision to cast Zeta-Jones in the part of a Latino woman, adding that &quot;she&#x27;s not just unconvincing; she&#x27;s outlandish&quot;. She next played the lead role of Vicki Ellis, an unrelenting pageant coach, in the Facebook Watch comedy-drama series &quot;Queen America&quot;. To play a character who has bulimia, she drew on her teenage experiences of interacting with dancers who had eating disorders. In a positive review, Jen Chaney of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote that &quot;Zeta-Jones is always at her best when she&#x27;s fiery, and this part gives her plenty of opportunities to shift into beast mode&quot;.

In 2021, Zeta-Jones appeared in a recurring role in the second season of the Fox drama series &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;. She played Dr. Vivian Capshaw, a doctor, opposite Michael Sheen. The series was cancelled after its second season. She next took on a guest role as Morticia Addams in two episodes of the Netflix fantasy series &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022). Dave Nemetz of TVLine found her &quot;exquisitely well-cast&quot; in her small part. &quot;Wednesday&quot; emerged as the second most-watched English-language Netflix series within three weeks of release. She subsequently played the main antagonist of the Disney+ adventure series &quot;National Treasure: Edge of History&quot;. Joshua Alston of &quot;Variety&quot; found Zeta-Jones to be the &quot;best thing&quot; about the show, adding that &quot;her snarling villainy veers so close to camp that it sounds at times like she’s workshopping a comedic impression of her own voice&quot;. Her supporting performance earned her a nomination at the Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards.

Zeta-Jones will return to films with Cathy Yan&#x27;s independent film &quot;The Gallerist&quot;, co-starring Natalie Portman and Jenna Ortega. She will also executive produce and star in the Prime Video thriller series &quot;Kill Jackie&quot;, adapted from Nick Harkaway&#x27;s novel &quot;The Price You Pay&quot;, which will be filmed in her hometown of Swansea.

==Other ventures==

Aside from acting, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes. She is a patron of Swansea&#x27;s Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre. In 2001, she auctioned an outfit she wore in &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) to raise funds for AIDS patients in Africa. In 2005, she became the ambassador of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse. She has also given her support to other charitable organisations for children such as the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and the Noah&#x27;s Ark Appeal, among others. Zeta-Jones is also the founding host for &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund, and is one of the members of the Cinema for Peace Foundation.

Zeta-Jones briefly dabbled with a singing career in the early 1990s. In 1992, she provided her voice to the character of actress Jean Simmons in Jeff Wayne&#x27;s musical retelling of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, entitled &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of Spartacus&quot;. Three years later, she released her first single, &quot;In the Arms of Love&quot;, on Wayne&#x27;s Wow! Records. She sang &quot;True Love Ways&quot;, a duet with David Essex, in 1994.

Zeta-Jones has featured as an advertising spokeswoman for several brands and products. She was named the global ambassador for the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, Inc. in 2002. Also that year, she was signed on by the phone company T-Mobile for an estimated $10 million per year, making her the highest-paid celebrity endorser at the time. In 2017, Zeta-Jones launched her own line of home decoration products named Casa Zeta-Jones. Also that year, she featured in a theatrical production of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Monologues&quot;, in which she performed a monologue as a mathematically inclined young girl. The event raised funds for Dramatic Need, a charity that helps African children pursue a career in the arts.

==Media image==

Zeta-Jones&#x27;s beauty and sex appeal have been picked up by various media outlets, including &quot;People&quot; magazine, which placed her at number one on their &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; listing in 1998. She continued to feature on the list from 2000 to 2004. In 2003, &quot;Esquire&quot; labelled her &quot;the most beautiful woman on the planet&quot;. In 2011, she was named the most beautiful British woman by a poll conducted by the television network QVC. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Monarchy of the United Kingdom in 2010 for her film and charity work. In 2019, she was honoured with the Freedom of the City of Swansea.

The journalist Sheila Johnston of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in 2010, described Zeta-Jones as &quot;the ultimate self-made success&quot; who &quot;constantly made bold decisions, and scrubbed up very nicely into a luscious star who radiates a classic […] brand of big-screen glamour.&quot; Guy Adams of &quot;The Independent&quot; considers her personality to be &quot;self-effacing and energetic&quot; but takes note of her &quot;steely core&quot; in her off-screen persona. Zeta-Jones&#x27;s success in her early Hollywood films &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) and &quot;Entrapment&quot; (1999) relied predominantly on her sex appeal, but she was later appreciated for her versatility.

Zeta-Jones&#x27;s career graph and marriage to Douglas have been a subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show &quot;Star Stories&quot; (2006–2008) was entitled &quot;Catherine Zeta-Jones—Her Quest to Prove Herself ... And Also Find Love&quot;, about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, she remarked in a 2004 interview with &quot;USA Weekend&quot;: &quot;The biggest misconception of me is that I&#x27;m some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m very shy socially.&quot; Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, and the use of her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine, she sued a Nevada-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled &quot;Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography&quot;, but the publication was indefinitely postponed after her lawyers issued threats of legal action against both Goodwin and his publisher.

==Personal life==
The success of &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991–93) made Zeta-Jones a celebrity in Britain, and her personal life has since been chronicled by the media. Her relationships in the early 1990s with television personality John Leslie, singer David Essex, and pop star Mick Hucknall were heavily publicised by the British press. In the mid-1990s, she was briefly engaged to Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen. In a 1995 interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, she described her lifestyle thus: &quot;I drink, I swear, I like sex&quot;.
Zeta-Jones met American actor Michael Douglas, with whom she shares her birthday and who is twenty-five years her senior, at the Deauville American Film Festival in France in August 1998, after being introduced by Danny DeVito. They became engaged on 31 December 1999, and married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on 18 November 2000 after Douglas&#x27;s divorce was finalised. The high-profile ceremony, which cost an estimated £1.5 million, was labelled the &quot;wedding of the year&quot; by the BBC. They signed a £1 million deal with &quot;OK!&quot; magazine to release photographs of the event, and the rest of the press were not permitted to enter. In spite of this, journalists for &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine surreptitiously took pictures of the ceremony, and the couple successfully sued the publication for invasion of privacy. They have two children: son Dylan Michael (born August 2000) and daughter Carys Zeta (born April 2003). The family lived in Bermuda until 2009, and , live in rural New York state. They also have a coastal estate near Valldemossa, Mallorca.

In 2010, Douglas was diagnosed with tongue cancer and Zeta-Jones thus faced an emotionally turbulent time, saying: &quot;When you get sideswiped like that [with the illness] it&#x27;s an obvious trigger for your balance to be a little bit off – not sleeping, worry, stress.&quot; This trigger led to Zeta-Jones experiencing depression, and despite initial apprehension, she went public with her bipolar disorder diagnosis. She sought treatment by checking into hospital in 2011, and again in 2013. Owing to the stress of both their illnesses, the couple decided to live separately in 2013, though without taking legal action towards separation or divorce. They reconciled in 2014, with Douglas saying they were &quot;stronger than ever&quot;.

==Acting credits and awards==

Zeta-Jones&#x27;s films that have earned the most at the box office, , include:
For her role in &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), Zeta-Jones was awarded the Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has received two Golden Globe Award nominations: Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000) and Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical for &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002).

<text>Telford is a borough in Bucks and Montgomery counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The population was 4,872 at the time of the 2010 census. Of this, 2,665 were in Montgomery County, and 2,207 were in Bucks County.

== History ==
===Founding===
Originally inhabited by the Lenape people, the area surrounding Telford began to be settled in 1719 by Mennonites from the Palatinate of the Rhine. In 1857, the town known as County Line (the area had previously been known as Hendrick&#x27;s Blacksmith) changed its name to Telford after the North Pennsylvania Railroad Company (later absorbed into the Reading Railroad) named its new station there after civil engineer Thomas Telford.

===Incorporation as a borough===
The Borough of Telford was incorporated by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Bucks County of November 10, 1886. A decade later, The Borough of West Telford was incorporated by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Montgomery County of December 27, 1897. In 1934, the respective boroughs entered into an agreement for consolidation, and an election was held on this question on November 6, 1934. The voters of both boroughs approved the agreement, and on January 11, 1935, Governor Gifford Pinchot issued letters patent consolidating the two boroughs into the current Borough of Telford.

==Geography==
Telford is located at (40.324786, -75.328045), elevation .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km), all land.

==Transportation==

As of 2018 there were of public roads in Telford, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

No numbered highways serve Telford directly. Main thoroughfares traversing the town include Main Street and Church Road. State routes 309 and 563 are the closest state highways to Telford.

A rail line that was formerly the Reading Company&#x27;s Bethlehem Branch runs north-south through Telford connecting to Perkasie, Quakertown, and Bethlehem to the north and Souderton, Hatfield, and Lansdale to the south. The line was used by the SEPTA Bethlehem Line until 1981. The tracks are still used for the transport of freight between Lansdale and Quakertown, and beyond. The line is used for occasional scenic rail trips, and resumption of passenger service to Quakertown is being considered. Telford is also the via point location for Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad out of Lansdale and East Penn Railroad out of Quakertown. The Telford station is still standing, though remains vacant.

SEPTA Suburban Bus Route 132 starts in Telford and ends at the Montgomery Mall in Montgomeryville, serving Souderton, Hatfield, and Lansdale.

From 1901 to 1951, an interurban electric trolley line, Lehigh Valley Transit, known as the Liberty Bell Limited, ran from Telford north to Allentown (through Quakertown) and south (through Lansdale) to Philadelphia. During World War II, it carried a large number of passengers due to gas rationing, forcing a reduction in auto use, but after the war its business declined and in 1951, it abandoned rail and converted to bus operation.

<text>Ouse Washes is a linear biological Site of Special Scientific Interest stretching from near St Ives in Cambridgeshire to Downham Market in Norfolk, England. It is also a Ramsar internationally important wetland site, a Special Protection Area for birds, a Special Area of Conservation and a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. An area of between March and Ely is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire and another area near Chatteris is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust manages another area near Welney.

The site lies between the Old Bedford River in the north-west and the New Bedford River in the south-east. The Washes are a flood storage area and are often under water in the winter. It is internationally significant for wintering and breeding wildfowl and waders, especially teal, pintail, Eurasian wigeon, shoveler, pochard and Bewick&#x27;s swans. The site also has rich aquatic fauna and flora, and areas of unimproved grassland.
==History==
After the last glaciation between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago the sea level in eastern England was about lower than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea, and bringing the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line. Coastal woodland was drowned by the returning sea and slowly degraded to peat overlying deposits of marine clays and creating the Fens.

Prior to the seventeenth century the Fens of eastern England were tidal marshland. frequently flooded and suitable for little more than summer grazing. In 1630, King Charles I granted a drainage charter to the 4th Earl of Bedford and his Adventurers, who constructed the Old Bedford River between Earith, Cambridgeshire and Downham Market, Norfolk, to facilitate drainage of the large area that became known as the Bedford Level. The Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was engaged to complete the project and constructed the New Bedford River parallel to the old. The start of the works was interrupted by the English Civil War, but recommenced under Oliver Cromwell in 1649, and was completed in 1656.

==Water control==

The Ouse Washes are part of the system for controlling the flow of the Great Ouse when water levels in the river are high. In normal conditions, the waters of the Great Ouse run through the New Bedford River (or Hundred Foot Drain) to join the tidal stretch of the river at Welmore Lake Sluice, where another automatic system controls outflow. High water levels open the automatic sluice at Earith, thereby releasing water to the Old Bedford River, which eventually overflows onto the washland between the Bedford rivers, with the Welmore automatic sluice controlling outflow. When levels drop, the washes drain back into the Old Bedford River. 

The Environment Agency sets the trigger level for the sluices, allowing higher levels in the Great Ouse in summer than in winter.The enclosed area of washland runs from Earith northeast to Downham Market where it links via the New Bedford River to the tidal Great Ouse and hence to the sea. At capacity, the site can accommodate , although it only completely filled in 1947. 

The washland area between the rivers is long and about wide and acts as a floodplain during the winter and, increasingly, also in the summer. The area between the outer barrier banks of the two artificial rivers covers about . As the peat underlying the Fens has dried out through drainage, it has shrunk and lowered the level of the washlands, making flooding more frequent. The Washes and its banks have a total area of , and newly created wet grasslands adjacent to the washes increase the total area to . About 10% of the area is open water, but most of the habitat is grassland with reed canary-grass in the wettest locations, transitioning through reed sweet-grass to the creeping bent that dominates in the drier areas.

==Ownership and conservation==

The Ouse Washes are important as one of only two remaining large regularly flooded washlands in Britain, the other being the nearby Nene Washes in Cambridgeshire. When at Cambridge University, Peter Scott, who would become a naturalist and founder of what is now the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT) became a regular visitor to the washes, and in 1967 he purchased for £4000 to form the core of what is now WWT Welney Wetland Centre. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) also actively purchased large areas of land, and the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Naturalists&#x27; Trust (now the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire (WTBCN)) bought . 

By 2010, the three conservation bodies owned of the site. is held by other organisations, including the Fenland Wildfowlers Association (, the Spalding &amp; District Wildfowlers Association ( and private individuals. The wildfowling clubs work closely with the conservation bodies to protect breeding birds.

The Ouse Washes Landscape Partnership scheme (OWLP) was a £1 million, 3-year project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund which ran from 2014 to 2017. The scheme focused on the promotion of the area surrounding the Ouse Washes, the heart of the Cambridgeshire and Norfolk Fens, and on encouraging community engagement with the area&#x27;s diverse heritage. The area is mostly within of the SSSI but outside the barrier walls. A survey of the ditches showed that they were important for amphibians water voles, dragonflies and damselflies. More than 100 water beetle species included five for which the Fens are their national stronghold, and the 175 drain plants included eight of conservation concern.
===RSPB Ouse Washes===

RSPB Ouse Washes is a nature reserve, managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds at Welches Dam. It is signposted from Manea village which is east of Chatteris on the A142/A141 between Ely and March. The RSPB facilities also cover the area owned by WTBCN.

The reserve is on the western side of the washes, south of the A1101 road. Its unstaffed visitor centre is open from 9 am to 5 pm, the car park, toilets and the reserve itself are always open, but there is no shop. There are two birds hides south of the visitor centre, the nearer, from the centre, is wheelchair accessible, the further is . there are six hides north of the visitor centre, the furthest being from the centre. In wet conditions, the path along the bank can be very muddy.

===WWT Welney Wetland Centre===

The of the Welney Wetland Centre is one of ten wildfowl and wetland reserves managed by the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT). It lies north of the A1101 road where it crosses the washes. It has a visitor centre and café, and viewing facilities include an observatory with two wing hides. There is a further bird hide south of the observatory and four to the north. All the main hides are accessible except the third to the north. There are also some two-person hides accessed by steps. Road access to the reserve car park is via Hundred Foot Bank, Welney, Norfolk. 

There is an entry charge for non-members of the WWT. The visitor centre is open from 10 am to 4 pm, although the café closes at 3.30 pm. The centre received 29,372 visitors in 2018.

===Extensions===
Increased summer flooding led to declines in the numbers of breeding waders from the 1970s onwards, and to counteract this areas of former farmland adjacent to the washes were acquired and converted to wet grassland. The WWT&#x27;s Lady Fen is adjacent to the Welney Wetland Centre and was converted from farmland between 2007 and 2013. The RSPB, WWT and WTBCN have also modified land adjacent to the RSPB reserve. The eventual aim is to expand this to , although as of 2022 only had been acquired. The total additional area of the &quot;new&quot; meadows is .

==Flora and fauna==
===Birds===
====Breeding species====

The Ouse Washes are the most important site in England and Wales for breeding snipe, and also hold good populations of lapwings and redshanks and oystercatchers. Black-tailed godwits were found breeding in 1952, and reached a peak of 65 pairs by 1972, but flooding severely reduced breeding success until the extension projects enabled up to 19 pairs to breed. Corn crakes released on the Nene Washes from 2005 as part of a reintroduction scheme found the Ouse Washes more to their liking with up to seven calling males each year, and several spotted crakes also call in the spring. 

Breeding ducks include 15% of the UK&#x27;s garganey. Recent colonisers include the little egret (77 pairs in 2020), great white egret and bittern, while some former breeders including ruff and Savi&#x27;s warbler have been lost. Little gulls, black terns and black-winged stilts have occasionally bred. Waders breed on the extension areas at a density of about four pairs per hectare (two pairs per acre), 18 times the level on the main site. Hobbies, marsh harriers and barn owls all breed around the washes, as do yellow wagtails, corn buntings and tree sparrows, and kingfishers nest in artificial banks.

====Wintering birds====
The Ouse Washes hosts Bewick&#x27;s and whooper swans in winter, which feed on nearby farmland during the day, returning to the washes in the evening, where visitors can watch them being fed under floodlight near the visitor centre. More than 12,500 whooper swans wintered in 2021, about 5% of the world population. The number of Bewick&#x27;s swans reaching the UK has fallen dramatically in the current century, as milder winters encourage them to remain in continental Europe, but several hundred still visit the washes.

The washes are of international importance for six species of wintering ducks, notably more than 20,000 wigeon. High waters levels prevent wigeon grazing on grass, and the extension areas were designed with this species in mind, so that they could feed when the main site was flooded. Up to 40 tundra bean geese and 130 white-fronted geese visit annually. Gulls roost overnight, as do hen harriers, and common cranes also spend the night on the washes after foraging for maize stubble on the arable farmland. A paid of cranes bred successfully on Lady Fen in 2018.

====Migrants and rarities====
Large numbers of migrants may seek temporary refuge on the marshes, including 2 million sand martins (1968) 5,000 common snipe (1979), 500 ruffs (1989) and 130 red-breasted mergansers (1956). Major rarities recorded include a pied-billed grebe in 1968, a falcated duck, Britain&#x27;s first, in 1986, and a canvasback in 1997. More recent visitors have included a northern harrier in 2013, a Baikal teal in 2014, an isabelline wheatear in 2016 and a gull-billed tern in 2017. Scarce waders such as pectoral sandpiper, Temminck&#x27;s stint and red-necked phalarope are almost annual.

===Other animals===

Of the large mammals, Roe deer, water deer, badgers and otters are common on the washes, with brown hare on the adjacent grasslands and small numbers of water voles in the wet areas. Regularly recorded bats include soprano pipistrelle, noctule and Daubenton&#x27;s bat. The large fish population includes European eel and spined loach.

There is a rich invertebrate fauna, including tansy beetle, which here feeds on water mint rather than the normal tansy. Scarce insects include the variable damselfly, scarce chaser, wall brown and clouded yellow.

===Plants===
Apart from the grassland, there are small patches of trees and osier, but the main interest lies in rare aquatic plants such as greater water-parsnip and fringed water lily, although the diversity and numbers of such species has reduced due to nutrient deposition by floodwater. The areas neighbouring the washland, used for intensive arable farming for 50 years, have now been reseeded with grasses and associated plants such as meadow buttercup, tufted vetch, ribwort plantain. and flowering rush.

==Management and protection==

The washes are managed for traditional grazing and hay-making using professional livestock managers to determine a regime that minimises the amount of disturbance to the breeding waders and controls water levels within the washes. There are also &quot;scrapes&quot;, areas of bare mud situated so as to be readily visible to birdwatchers. The new areas outside the washes are kept wet through a closely spaced network of ditches filled from ground aquifers by submersible pumps, and protected by fox- and badger-proof fences.

It is anticipated that a combination of lower flows in the Great Ouse and higher sea water levels will make it harder to manage drainage, although more areas of shallow water might benefit potential colonising breeders including the glossy ibis, black-winged stilt and various heron and egret species.

Because of its importance to wildlife, the Ouse Washes is a Site of Special Scientific Interest a Ramsar internationally important wetland site, a Special Protection Area for birds, a Special Area of Conservation, and a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I.

<doc id="151001" wikidata="Q513656" url="?curid=151001" title="C-symmetry">
<text>In physics, charge conjugation is a transformation that switches all particles with their corresponding antiparticles, thus changing the sign of all charges: not only electric charge but also the charges relevant to other forces. The term C-symmetry is an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;charge conjugation symmetry&quot;, and is used in discussions of the symmetry of physical laws under charge-conjugation. Other important discrete symmetries are P-symmetry (parity) and T-symmetry (time reversal).

These discrete symmetries, C, P and T, are symmetries of the equations that describe the known fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, gravity, the strong and the weak interactions. Verifying whether some given mathematical equation correctly models nature requires giving physical interpretation not only to continuous symmetries, such as motion in time, but also to its discrete symmetries, and then determining whether nature adheres to these symmetries. Unlike the continuous symmetries, the interpretation of the discrete symmetries is a bit more intellectually demanding and confusing. An early surprise appeared in the 1950s, when Chien Shiung Wu demonstrated that the weak interaction violated P-symmetry. For several decades, it appeared that the combined symmetry CP was preserved, until CP-violating interactions were discovered. Both discoveries lead to Nobel Prizes.

The C-symmetry is particularly troublesome, physically, as the universe is primarily filled with matter, not anti-matter, whereas the naive C-symmetry of the physical laws suggests that there should be equal amounts of both. It is currently believed that CP-violation during the early universe can account for the &quot;excess&quot; matter, although the debate is not settled. Earlier textbooks on cosmology, predating the 1970s, routinely suggested that perhaps distant galaxies were made entirely of anti-matter, thus maintaining a net balance of zero in the universe.

This article focuses on exposing and articulating the C-symmetry of various important equations and theoretical systems, including the Dirac equation and the structure of quantum field theory. The various fundamental particles can be classified according to behavior under charge conjugation; this is described in the article on C-parity.

==Informal overview==
Charge conjugation occurs as a symmetry in three different but closely related settings: a symmetry of the (classical, non-quantized) solutions of several notable differential equations, including the Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation, a symmetry of the corresponding quantum fields, and in a general setting, a symmetry in (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry. In all three cases, the symmetry is ultimately revealed to be a symmetry under complex conjugation, although exactly what is being conjugated where can be at times obfuscated, depending on notation, coordinate choices and other factors.

=== In classical fields ===
The charge conjugation symmetry is interpreted as that of electrical charge, because in all three cases (classical, quantum and geometry), one can construct Noether currents that resemble those of classical electrodynamics. This arises because electrodynamics itself, via Maxwell&#x27;s equations, can be interpreted as a structure on a U(1) fiber bundle, the so-called circle bundle. This provides a geometric interpretation of electromagnetism: the electromagnetic potential formula_1 is interpreted as the gauge connection (the Ehresmann connection) on the circle bundle. This geometric interpretation then allows (literally almost) anything possessing a complex-number-valued structure to be coupled to the electromagnetic field, provided that this coupling is done in a gauge-invariant way. Gauge symmetry, in this geometric setting, is a statement that, as one moves around on the circle, the coupled object must also transform in a &quot;circular way&quot;, tracking in a corresponding fashion. More formally, one says that the equations must be gauge invariant under a change of local coordinate frames on the circle. For U(1), this is just the statement that the system is invariant under multiplication by a phase factor formula_2 that depends on the (space-time) coordinate formula_3 In this geometric setting, charge conjugation can be understood as the discrete symmetry formula_4 that performs complex conjugation, that reverses the sense of direction around the circle.

=== In quantum theory ===
In quantum field theory, charge conjugation can be understood as the exchange of particles with anti-particles. To understand this statement, one must have a minimal understanding of what quantum field theory is. In (vastly) simplified terms, it is a technique for performing calculations to obtain solutions for a system of coupled differential equations via perturbation theory. A key ingredient to this process is the quantum field, one for each of the (free, uncoupled) differential equations in the system. A quantum field is conventionally written as
:formula_5

where formula_6 is the momentum, formula_7 is a spin label, formula_8 is an auxiliary label for other states in the system. The formula_9 and formula_10 are creation and annihilation operators (ladder operators) and formula_11 are solutions to the (free, non-interacting, uncoupled) differential equation in question. The quantum field plays a central role because, in general, it is not known how to obtain exact solutions to the system of coupled differential questions. However, via perturbation theory, approximate solutions can be constructed as combinations of the free-field solutions. To perform this construction, one has to be able to extract and work with any one given free-field solution, on-demand, when required. The quantum field provides exactly this: it enumerates all possible free-field solutions in a vector space such that any one of them can be singled out at any given time, via the creation and annihilation operators. 

The creation and annihilation operators obey the canonical commutation relations, in that the one operator &quot;undoes&quot; what the other &quot;creates&quot;. This implies that any given solution formula_12 must be paired with its &quot;anti-solution&quot; formula_13 so that one undoes or cancels out the other. The pairing is to be performed so that all symmetries are preserved. As one is generally interested in Lorentz invariance, the quantum field contains an integral over all possible Lorentz coordinate frames, written above as an integral over all possible momenta (it is an integral over the fiber of the frame bundle). The pairing requires that a given formula_14 is associated with a formula_15 of the opposite momentum and energy. The quantum field is also a sum over all possible spin states; the dual pairing again matching opposite spins. Likewise for any other quantum numbers, these are also paired as opposites. There is a technical difficulty in carrying out this dual pairing: one must describe what it means for some given solution formula_16 to be &quot;dual to&quot; some other solution formula_17 and to describe it in such a way that it remains consistently dual when integrating over the fiber of the frame bundle, when integrating (summing) over the fiber that describes the spin, and when integrating (summing) over any other fibers that occur in the theory. 

When the fiber to be integrated over is the U(1) fiber of electromagnetism, the dual pairing is such that the direction (orientation) on the fiber is reversed. When the fiber to be integrated over is the SU(3) fiber of the color charge, the dual pairing again reverses orientation. This &quot;just works&quot; for SU(3) because it has two dual fundamental representations formula_18 and formula_19 which can be naturally paired. This prescription for a quantum field naturally generalizes to any situation where one can enumerate the continuous symmetries of the system, and define duals in a coherent, consistent fashion. The pairing ties together opposite charges in the fully abstract sense. In physics, a charge is associated with a generator of a continuous symmetry. Different charges are associated with different eigenspaces of the Casimir invariants of the universal enveloping algebra for those symmetries. This is the case for &quot;both&quot; the Lorentz symmetry of the underlying spacetime manifold, &quot;as well as&quot; the symmetries of any fibers in the fiber bundle posed above the spacetime manifold. Duality replaces the generator of the symmetry with minus the generator. Charge conjugation is thus associated with reflection along the line bundle or determinant bundle of the space of symmetries.

The above then is a sketch of the general idea of a quantum field in quantum field theory. The physical interpretation is that solutions formula_12 correspond to particles, and solutions formula_13 correspond to antiparticles, and so charge conjugation is a pairing of the two. This sketch also provides enough hints to indicate what charge conjugation might look like in a general geometric setting. There is no particular forced requirement to use perturbation theory, to construct quantum fields that will act as middle-men in a perturbative expansion. Charge conjugation can be given a general setting.

=== In geometry ===
For general Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, one has a tangent bundle, a cotangent bundle and a metric that ties the two together. There are several interesting things one can do, when presented with this situation. One is that the smooth structure allows differential equations to be posed on the manifold; the tangent and cotangent spaces provide enough structure to perform calculus on manifolds. Of key interest is the Laplacian, and, with a constant term, what amounts to the Klein–Gordon operator. Cotangent bundles, by their basic construction, are always symplectic manifolds. Symplectic manifolds have canonical coordinates formula_22 interpreted as position and momentum, obeying canonical commutation relations. This provides the core infrastructure to extend duality, and thus charge conjugation, to this general setting. 

A second interesting thing one can do is to construct a spin structure. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this is that it is a very recognizable generalization to a formula_23-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold of the conventional physics concept of spinors living on a (1,3)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The construction passes through a complexified Clifford algebra to build a Clifford bundle and a spin manifold. At the end of this construction, one obtains a system that is remarkably familiar, if one is already acquainted with Dirac spinors and the Dirac equation. Several analogies pass through to this general case. First, the spinors are the Weyl spinors, and they come in complex-conjugate pairs. They are naturally anti-commuting (this follows from the Clifford algebra), which is exactly what one wants to make contact with the Pauli exclusion principle. Another is the existence of a chiral element, analogous to the gamma matrix formula_24 which sorts these spinors into left and right-handed subspaces. The complexification is a key ingredient, and it provides &quot;electromagnetism&quot; in this generalized setting. The spinor bundle doesn&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; transform under the pseudo-orthogonal group formula_25, the generalization of the Lorentz group formula_26, but under a bigger group, the complexified spin group formula_27 It is bigger in that it is a double covering of formula_28 

The formula_29 piece can be identified with electromagnetism in several different ways. One way is that the Dirac operators on the spin manifold, when squared, contain a piece formula_30 with formula_31 arising from that part of the connection associated with the formula_29 piece. This is entirely analogous to what happens when one squares the ordinary Dirac equation in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. A second hint is that this formula_29 piece is associated with the determinant bundle of the spin structure, effectively tying together the left and right-handed spinors through complex conjugation.

What remains is to work through the discrete symmetries of the above construction. There are several that appear to generalize P-symmetry and T-symmetry. Identifying the formula_34 dimensions with time, and the formula_35 dimensions with space, one can reverse the tangent vectors in the formula_34 dimensional subspace to get time reversal, and flipping the direction of the formula_35 dimensions corresponds to parity. The C-symmetry can be identified with the reflection on the line bundle. To tie all of these together into a knot, one finally has the concept of transposition, in that elements of the Clifford algebra can be written in reversed (transposed) order. The net result is that not only do the conventional physics ideas of fields pass over to the general Riemannian setting, but also the ideas of the discrete symmetries.

There are two ways to react to this. One is to treat it as an interesting curiosity. The other is to realize that, in low dimensions (in low-dimensional spacetime) there are many &quot;accidental&quot; isomorphisms between various Lie groups and other assorted structures. Being able to examine them in a general setting disentangles these relationships, exposing more clearly &quot;where things come from&quot;.

==Charge conjugation for Dirac fields==
The laws of electromagnetism (both classical and quantum) are invariant under the exchange of electrical charges with their negatives. For the case of electrons and quarks, both of which are fundamental particle fermion fields, the single-particle field excitations are described by the Dirac equation

:formula_38

One wishes to find a charge-conjugate solution

:formula_39

A handful of algebraic manipulations are sufficient to obtain the second from the first. Standard expositions of the Dirac equation demonstrate a conjugate field formula_40 interpreted as an anti-particle field, satisfying the complex-transposed Dirac equation

:formula_41

Note that some but not all of the signs have flipped. Transposing this back again gives almost the desired form, provided that one can find a 4×4 matrix formula_42 that transposes the gamma matrices to insert the required sign-change:
:formula_43

The charge conjugate solution is then given by the involution
:formula_44

The 4×4 matrix formula_45 called the charge conjugation matrix, has an explicit form given in the article on gamma matrices. Curiously, this form is not representation-independent, but depends on the specific matrix representation chosen for the gamma group (the subgroup of the Clifford algebra capturing the algebraic properties of the gamma matrices). This matrix is representation dependent due to a subtle interplay involving the complexification of the spin group describing the Lorentz covariance of charged particles. The complex number formula_46 is an arbitrary phase factor formula_47 generally taken to be formula_48 

===Charge conjugation, chirality, helicity ===
The interplay between chirality and charge conjugation is a bit subtle, and requires articulation. It is often said that charge conjugation does not alter the chirality of particles. This is not the case for &quot;fields&quot;, the difference arising in the &quot;hole theory&quot; interpretation of particles, where an anti-particle is interpreted as the absence of a particle. This is articulated below.

Conventionally, formula_24 is used as the chirality operator. Under charge conjugation, it transforms as
:formula_50

and whether or not formula_51 equals formula_24 depends on the chosen representation for the gamma matrices. In the Dirac and chiral basis, one does have that formula_53, while formula_54 is obtained in the Majorana basis. A worked example follows.

====Weyl spinors====
For the case of massless Dirac spinor fields, chirality is equal to helicity for the positive energy solutions (and minus the helicity for negative energy solutions). One obtains this by writing the massless Dirac equation as
:formula_55

Multiplying by formula_56 one obtains
:formula_57

where formula_58 is the angular momentum operator and formula_59 is the totally antisymmetric tensor. This can be brought to a slightly more recognizable form by defining the 3D spin operator formula_60 taking a plane-wave state formula_61, applying the on-shell constraint that formula_62 and normalizing the momentum to be a 3D unit vector: formula_63 to write

:formula_64 

Examining the above, one concludes that angular momentum eigenstates (helicity eigenstates) correspond to eigenstates of the chiral operator. This allows the massless Dirac field to be cleanly split into a pair of Weyl spinors formula_65 and formula_66 each individually satisfying the Weyl equation, but with opposite energy:
:formula_67

and
:formula_68

Note the freedom one has to equate negative helicity with negative energy, and thus the anti-particle with the particle of opposite helicity. To be clear, the formula_7 here are the Pauli matrices, and formula_70 is the momentum operator.

====Charge conjugation in the chiral basis====
Taking the Weyl representation of the gamma matrices, one may write a (now taken to be massive) Dirac spinor as
:formula_71

The corresponding dual (anti-particle) field is
:formula_72

The charge-conjugate spinors are
:formula_73

where, as before, formula_46 is a phase factor that can be taken to be formula_48 Note that the left and right states are inter-changed. This can be restored with a parity transformation. Under parity, the Dirac spinor transforms as
:formula_76

Under combined charge and parity, one then has
:formula_77

Conventionally, one takes formula_78 globally. See however, the note below.

====Majorana condition====
The Majorana condition imposes a constraint between the field and its charge conjugate, namely that they must be equal: formula_79 This is perhaps best stated as the requirement that the Majorana spinor must be an eigenstate of the charge conjugation involution.

Doing so requires some notational care. In many texts discussing charge conjugation, the involution formula_80 is not given an explicit symbolic name, when applied to &quot;single-particle solutions&quot; of the Dirac equation. This is in contrast to the case when the &quot;quantized field&quot; is discussed, where a unitary operator formula_81 is defined (as done in a later section, below). For the present section, let the involution be named as formula_82 so that formula_83 Taking this to be a linear operator, one may consider its eigenstates. The Majorana condition singles out one such: formula_84 There are, however, two such eigenstates: formula_85 Continuing in the Weyl basis, as above, these eigenstates are
:formula_86

and
:formula_87

The Majorana spinor is conventionally taken as just the positive eigenstate, namely formula_88 The chiral operator formula_24 exchanges these two, in that
:formula_90

This is readily verified by direct substitution. Bear in mind that formula_91 &quot;does not have&quot; a 4×4 matrix representation! More precisely, there is no complex 4×4 matrix that can take a complex number to its complex conjugate; this inversion would require an 8×8 real matrix. The physical interpretation of complex conjugation as charge conjugation becomes clear when considering the complex conjugation of scalar fields, described in a subsequent section below.

The projectors onto the chiral eigenstates can be written as formula_92 and formula_93 and so the above translates to
:formula_94

This directly demonstrates that charge conjugation, applied to single-particle complex-number-valued solutions of the Dirac equation flips the chirality of the solution. The projectors onto the charge conjugation eigenspaces are formula_95 and formula_96

====Geometric interpretation====
The phase factor formula_97 can be given a geometric interpretation. It has been noted that, for massive Dirac spinors, the &quot;arbitrary&quot; phase factor formula_97 may depend on both the momentum, and the helicity (but not the chirality). This can be interpreted as saying that this phase may vary along the fiber of the spinor bundle, depending on the local choice of a coordinate frame. Put another way, a spinor field is a local section of the spinor bundle, and Lorentz boosts and rotations correspond to movements along the fibers of the corresponding frame bundle (again, just a choice of local coordinate frame). Examined in this way, this extra phase freedom can be interpreted as the phase arising from the electromagnetic field. For the Majorana spinors, the phase would be constrained to not vary under boosts and rotations.

===Charge conjugation for quantized fields===
The above describes charge conjugation for the single-particle solutions only. When the Dirac field is second-quantized, as in quantum field theory, the spinor and electromagnetic fields are described by operators. The charge conjugation involution then manifests as a unitary operator formula_81 (in calligraphic font) acting on the particle fields, expressed as

# formula_100
# formula_101
# formula_102

where the non-calligraphic formula_103 is the same 4×4 matrix given before.

===Charge reversal in electroweak theory===
Charge conjugation does not alter the chirality of particles. A left-handed neutrino would be taken by charge conjugation into a left-handed antineutrino, which does not interact in the Standard Model. This property is what is meant by the &quot;maximal violation&quot; of C-symmetry in the weak interaction.

Some postulated extensions of the Standard Model, like left-right models, restore this C-symmetry.

==Scalar fields==
The Dirac field has a &quot;hidden&quot; formula_29 gauge freedom, allowing it to couple directly to the electromagnetic field without any further modifications to the Dirac equation or the field itself. This is not the case for scalar fields, which must be explicitly &quot;complexified&quot; to couple to electromagnetism. This is done by &quot;tensoring in&quot; an additional factor of the complex plane formula_105 into the field, or constructing a Cartesian product with formula_29.

One very conventional technique is simply to start with two real scalar fields, formula_107 and formula_108 and create a linear combination

:formula_109

The charge conjugation involution is then the mapping formula_110 since this is sufficient to reverse the sign on the electromagnetic potential (since this complex number is being used to couple to it). For real scalar fields, charge conjugation is just the identity map: formula_111 and formula_112 and so, for the complexified field, charge conjugation is just formula_113 The &quot;mapsto&quot; arrow formula_114 is convenient for tracking &quot;what goes where&quot;; the equivalent older notation is simply to write formula_115 and formula_116 and formula_117

The above describes the conventional construction of a charged scalar field. It is also possible to introduce additional algebraic structure into the fields in other ways. In particular, one may define a &quot;real&quot; field behaving as formula_118. As it is real, it cannot couple to electromagnetism by itself, but, when complexified, would result in a charged field that transforms as formula_119 Because C-symmetry is a discrete symmetry, one has some freedom to play these kinds of algebraic games in the search for a theory that correctly models some given physical reality.

In physics literature, a transformation such as formula_120 might be written without any further explanation. The formal mathematical interpretation of this is that the field formula_107 is an element of formula_122 where formula_123 Thus, properly speaking, the field should be written as formula_124 which behaves under charge conjugation as formula_125 It is very tempting, but not quite formally correct to just multiply these out, to move around the location of this minus sign; this mostly &quot;just works&quot;, but a failure to track it properly will lead to confusion.

==Combination of charge and parity reversal==
It was believed for some time that C-symmetry could be combined with the parity-inversion transformation (see P-symmetry) to preserve a combined CP-symmetry. However, violations of this symmetry have been identified in the weak interactions (particularly in the kaons and B mesons). In the Standard Model, this CP violation is due to a single phase in the CKM matrix. If CP is combined with time reversal (T-symmetry), the resulting CPT-symmetry can be shown using only the Wightman axioms to be universally obeyed.

==In general settings==
The analog of charge conjugation can be defined for higher-dimensional gamma matrices, with an explicit construction for Weyl spinors given in the article on Weyl–Brauer matrices. Note, however, spinors as defined abstractly in the representation theory of Clifford algebras are not fields; rather, they should be thought of as existing on a zero-dimensional spacetime. 

The analog of T-symmetry follows from formula_126 as the T-conjugation operator for Dirac spinors. Spinors also have an inherent P-symmetry, obtained by reversing the direction of all of the basis vectors of the Clifford algebra from which the spinors are constructed. The relationship to the P and T symmetries for a fermion field on a spacetime manifold are a bit subtle, but can be roughly characterized as follows. When a spinor is constructed via a Clifford algebra, the construction requires a vector space on which to build. By convention, this vector space is the tangent space of the spacetime manifold at a given, fixed spacetime point (a single fiber in the tangent manifold). P and T operations applied to the spacetime manifold can then be understood as also flipping the coordinates of the tangent space as well; thus, the two are glued together. Flipping the parity or the direction of time in one also flips it in the other. This is a convention. One can become unglued by failing to propagate this connection.

This is done by taking the tangent space as a vector space, extending it to a tensor algebra, and then using an inner product on the vector space to define a Clifford algebra. Treating each such algebra as a fiber, one obtains a fiber bundle called the Clifford bundle. Under a change of basis of the tangent space, elements of the Clifford algebra transform according to the spin group. Building a principle fiber bundle with the spin group as the fiber results in a spin structure.

All that is missing in the above paragraphs are the spinors themselves. These require the &quot;complexification&quot; of the tangent manifold: tensoring it with the complex plane. Once this is done, the Weyl spinors can be constructed. These have the form
:formula_127

where the formula_128 are the basis vectors for the vector space formula_129, the tangent space at point formula_130 in the spacetime manifold formula_131 The Weyl spinors, together with their complex conjugates span the tangent space, in the sense that
:formula_132

The alternating algebra formula_133 is called the spinor space, it is where the spinors live, as well as products of spinors (thus, objects with higher spin values, including vectors and tensors).
