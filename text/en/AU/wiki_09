<doc id="148453" wikidata="Q289149" url="?curid=148453" title="Étienne François de Choiseul, Duke of Choiseul">
<text>Étienne François de Choiseul, Duke of Choiseul, KOHS, OGF (28 June 17198 May 1785) was a French Army officer, diplomat and statesman. From 1758 to 1761 and again from 1766 to 1770, he served as Foreign Minister of France and had a strong influence on France&#x27;s global strategy throughout the period. Choiseul is closely associated with France&#x27;s defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War and subsequent efforts to rebuild French prestige.

==Biography==
===Rise===
The eldest son of François Joseph de Choiseul, marquis de Stainville (1700–1770), Étienne François was born in Nancy in the Duchy of Lorraine where his father was one of the leading advisors to the Duke of Lorraine who ruled an independent French-speaking state with close cultural and political links with France. At birth, he bore the title of comte de Stainville. In 1737, Francis Stephen of Lorraine (the future Holy Roman Emperor Francis I) was pressured into giving up Lorraine and becoming ruler of Tuscany in Italy. Realising that continued loyalty to the House of Lorraine would limit his opportunities, Étienne François transferred his allegiance to France.

After gaining experience during the Austro-Turkish War, the comte de Stainville entered the French army, and during the War of the Austrian Succession served in Bohemia (1741) and in Italy (1744), where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Coni. He was also present at the Battle of Dettingen in Germany and carried news of the French defeat there to Paris. He had been appalled by what he had witnessed of the French forces at Dettingen, particularly what he later described as their &quot;indifference and ignorance&quot;, and his experiences motivated his later reforms of the French military.

From 1745 to 1748, he was with the army in the Low Countries and was present at the sieges of Mons, Charleroi and Maastricht. He attained the rank of lieutenant-general and, in 1750, married Louise Honorine Crozat, daughter of Louis François Crozat, marquis du Châtel (died 1750), who brought her husband her share of the large fortune of her grandfather Antoine Crozat as well as his brother Pierre&#x27;s grand Hôtel de Crozat on the rue de Richelieu, and proved a most devoted wife.
Choiseul gained the favour of Madame de Pompadour by procuring for her letters that King Louis XV had written to his cousin&#x27;s wife, Charlotte-Rosalie de Romanet, comtesse de Choiseul-Baupré, with whom the king had formerly had an intrigue; and after a short time as bailli of the Vosges, he was given the appointment of ambassador to Rome in 1753, where he was entrusted with the negotiations concerning the disturbances called forth by the papal bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;. He acquitted himself skillfully in this task, and, in 1757, his patroness obtained his transfer to Vienna, where he was instructed to cement the new alliance between France and Austria. He was one of the principal authors of the Second Treaty of Versailles, signed in May 1757, which pledged the two states to a combined war in Germany against Prussia.

===Chief Minister===
====Seven Years&#x27; War====

His success in Vienna opened the way to a larger career in 1758, when he supplanted Cardinal de Bernis as minister for foreign affairs and so largely had the direction of French foreign and military policy during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1759, he planned an ambitious invasion of Britain which was halted by French naval defeats at the Battle of Lagos and the Battle of Quiberon Bay. His other major plan to achieve victory in 1759 was an attack on Hanover, which was thwarted by the French defeat at the Battle of Minden. Between 1759 and 1762, further French moves into Germany were unsuccessful, including the Battle of Vellinghausen.
He was then made a peer of France and created &quot;duc de Choiseul&quot;. Although from 1761 to 1766, his cousin César Gabriel de Choiseul, &quot;duc de Praslin&quot;, was minister for foreign affairs, Choiseul continued to control the policy of France until 1770 and held most of the other important offices of state at the time. As author of the Pacte de Famille, he sought to retrieve the disastrous results of the alliance with Austria by an alliance with the Spanish House of Bourbon, but his action came too late. His vigorous policy in other departments of state was not, however, fruitless.

Coming to power during the demoralization after the defeats of Rossbach and Krefeld, by boldness and energy he reformed and strengthened both army and navy, and, although too late to prevent the loss of Canada and India, he developed French colonies in the Antilles and San Domingo. His management of home affairs in general satisfied the &quot;philosophes&quot;. He allowed the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; to be published and brought about the banishment of the Jesuits and the temporary abolition of the order by Pope Clement XIV.

====Rebuilding French power====
In the years following the Treaty of Paris of 1763, Choiseul attempted to rebuild the French military. Alarmed by the British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the upset in the European balance of power that followed, he tried to secure continued Spanish support for a future war of revenge against Britain and drew up a number of plans for an invasion of Britain. In an effort to compensate for French territorial losses, he added Corsica and Lorraine to the crown of France. He directed the French conquest of Corsica. He also oversaw a failed scheme to settle Guiana. By the late 1760s Choiseul was concerned by the growing strength of Russia around the Baltic Sea fearing that Britain was behind it. He believed they were planning a &quot;northern league&quot; against France. To counter this he hoped to depose or severely weaken the power of Catherine the Great by encouraging the Ottoman Empire to attack Russia.

However, Choiseul&#x27;s fall was caused by his action against the Jesuits and by his support of their opponent La Chalotais, and of the provincial &quot;parlements&quot;. After the death of Madame de Pompadour in 1764, his enemies, incorporating the King&#x27;s new mistress, Madame du Barry, in their plots, and the chancellor Maupeou, were too strong for him. He had supported his sister Béatrix de Choiseul-Stainville, in her attempt to succeed Madame de Pompadour as the king&#x27;s mistress, which placed him in opposition to Madame du Barry. In an attempt to boost the Austrian alliance, Choiseul was an advocate of the marriage between the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and the archduchess Marie Antoinette, a daughter of the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa and the Emperor Francis I. Choiseul considered the marriage a personal triumph and believed it would cement his position of power.

In 1770, a dispute between Britain and Spain over the Falkland Islands threatened to flare into open warfare. As part of his long-term strategy to overturn what he perceived as British hegemony, Choiseul strongly supported Spain and mobilised the French military in preparation for war. Louis XV, who sought peace after the wars that had dominated much of his reign, was angry when he discovered that. At the height of the Falkland Crisis in 1770, Choiseul was dismissed and ordered to retire to his country estate, the Château de Chanteloup. The crisis was then settled peacefully by Britain and Spain.

===Retirement===

The intrigues against him had, however, increased his popularity, which was already great, and, during his retirement, which lasted until 1774, he lived in the greatest affluence and was visited by many eminent figures. He was succeeded as Chief Minister by Emmanuel-Armand de Richelieu, duc d&#x27;Aiguillon whose foreign policy was similar to that of Choiseul. D&#x27;Aiguillon favoured a more absolute monarchy than Choiseul did, and was strongly connected to the faction grouped around Madame Du Barry. Choiseul enjoyed widespread popularity and many people came to bid him farewell, as a gesture of support, as he prepared to leave Paris for his Chanteloup estate. In 1771, he participated in the unsuccessful attempt to arrange a secret marriage between the king and Albertine-Elisabeth Pater in order to depose Madame du Barry.

Greatly to Choiseul&#x27;s disappointment, Louis XVI did not restore him to his former position although the king allowed him to come back to Paris in 1774. Choiseul died in his private residence, the &quot;Hôtel Delaunay&quot;, in Paris, on 8 May 1785 and was buried in Chanteloup. He left a huge accumulation of debts, which was scrupulously discharged by his widow. Choiseul&#x27;s widow, a woman &quot;in whom industrious malice could not find an imperfection&quot;, lived in retirement until her death, on 3 December 1801.

==Assessment==
Choiseul possessed both ability and diligence, and though lacking in tenacity, he showed foresight and liberality in his direction of affairs. In appearance he was a short, ill-featured man, with a ruddy countenance and a sturdy frame. His &quot;Mémoires&quot; were written during his exile in Chanteloup, and are merely detached notes upon different questions.

English writer Horace Walpole, in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, gives a vivid description of the duke&#x27;s character, accuses him of having caused the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), as a revenge on Tsarina Catherine II and says of his foreign policy: &quot;he would project and determine the ruin of a country, but could not meditate a little mischief or a narrow benefit... He dissipated the nation&#x27;s wealth and his own; but did not repair the latter by plunder of the former&quot;. In reference to Choiseul&#x27;s private life, Walpole asserts that &quot;gallantry without delicacy was his constant pursuit&quot;.

==Art collection==
Choiseul was interested in music, theatre, and art. He created one of the most important collections of paintings in France and was a generous patron of many French artists. The items in his collection are known with some accuracy because of two important visual records: first, a snuffbox, often referred to as the &#x27;Choiseul box&#x27;, with five miniature paintings (1770–1771) by Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe, depicting the interior of his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Choiseul on the Rue de Richelieu; and second, a 1771 catalog of his collection with engravings created by Pierre-François Basan.

Choiseul&#x27;s collection of paintings mainly consisted of Dutch, Flemish, and French pictures, and included eight works by Rembrandt (for example, the &quot;Finding of Moses&quot;, Philadelphia Museum of Art), Jacob van Ruisdael&#x27;s &quot;Shore at Egmond aan Zee&quot; (National Gallery, London), Gerard ter Borch&#x27;s &quot;Woman Playing a Theorbo to Two Men&quot; (National Gallery, London), Philips Wouwerman&#x27;s &quot;Stag Hunt&quot; (Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg), Claude Lorrain&#x27;s &quot;Mercury and Io&quot; (National Gallery, Dublin), Louis Le Nain&#x27;s &quot;Forge&quot; (Louvre, Paris), Jean-Baptiste Greuze&#x27;s &quot;Girl with a Dog&quot; (Upton House, Warwickshire) and &quot;Sacrifice to Love&quot; (Wallace Collection, London), Joseph Vernet&#x27;s &quot;Rock Arch&quot; (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nîmes), Hubert Robert&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian Palace by the Sea&quot; (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dunkirk) and Joseph-Marie Vien&#x27;s &quot;Greek Girl at the Bath&quot; (Museo de Arte, Ponce).

Choiseul also owned a large number of engraved views of France (including works by Claude Chastillon, Israel Silvestre, Albert Flamen, and Reinier Nooms) and one of the most famous pieces of French furniture of the 18th century, a desk later owned by Talleyrand, Franz von Wolff-Metternich, and Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild, that has been attributed to the &quot;ébéniste&quot; Antoine Gaudreau and the bronze-chaser Jacques Caffieri.

==Commemoration and popular culture==
Choiseul Island, the largest island of the Solomon Islands is named after him.

Choiseul Sound, a major inlet on East Falkland is named after him.

Choiseul appears in the 1934 film &quot;Madame du Barry&quot; where he is played by Henry O&#x27;Neill.

Choiseul appears in the 2006 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, directed by Sophia Coppola, where he is played by Jean-Christophe Bouvet.

<doc id="148456" wikidata="Q208357" url="?curid=148456" title="Lucky Luciano">
<text>Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano ( ; ; born Salvatore Lucania ; November 24, 1897 – January 26, 1962) was an Italian-born gangster who operated mainly in the United States. He started his criminal career in the Five Points Gang and was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate. Luciano is considered the father of the Italian-American Mafia for the establishment of the Commission in 1931, after he abolished the boss of bosses title held by Salvatore Maranzano following the Castellammarese War. He was also the first official boss of the modern Genovese crime family.

In 1936, Luciano was tried and convicted for compulsory prostitution and running a prostitution racket after years of investigation by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey. Although he was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison, an agreement was struck with the U.S. Department of the Navy through his Jewish Mob associate, Meyer Lansky, to provide naval intelligence during World War II. In 1946, for his alleged wartime cooperation, Luciano&#x27;s sentence was commuted on the condition that he be deported to Italy. Luciano died in Italy on January 26, 1962, and his body was permitted to be transported back to the United States for burial.

==Early life==

Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano was born Salvatore Lucania on November 24, 1897, in Lercara Friddi, Sicily, Italy. His parents, Antonio Lucania and Rosalia Caffarella, had four other children: Giuseppe (born 1885); Bartolomeo (born 1890); Filippa, or &quot;Fanny&quot; (born 1901); and Concetta (born 1903).

Luciano&#x27;s father, who worked in a sulfur mine, was very ambitious and persistent in eventually moving to the United States. In &quot;The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano: The Mafia Story in His Own Words&quot;, a purported semi-autobiography that was published after his death, Luciano described how his father always purchased a new Palermo-based steamship company calendar each year and would save money for the boat trip by keeping a jar under his bed. He also mentions in the book that his father was too proud to ask for money, so instead his mother was given money in secret by Luciano&#x27;s cousin, Rotolo, who also lived in Lercara Friddi. Although the book has largely been regarded as accurate, there are numerous problems that point to the possibility that it is in fact fraudulent. The book was based on conversations that Luciano supposedly had with Hollywood producer Martin Gosch in the years before Luciano&#x27;s death. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported shortly before the book&#x27;s publication, the book quotes Luciano talking about events that occurred years after his death, repeats errors from previously published books on the American Mafia and describes Luciano&#x27;s participation in meetings that occurred when he was in jail.

In 1906, when Luciano was eight years old, his family emigrated to the U.S. They settled in New York City, in the borough of Manhattan on its Lower East Side, a popular destination for Italian immigrants during the period. At age 14, Luciano dropped out of school and started a job delivering hats, earning $7 per week. After winning $244 in a dice game, Luciano quit his job and began earning money on the street. That same year, Luciano&#x27;s parents sent him to the Brooklyn Truancy School.

As a teenager, Luciano started his own gang and became a member of the old Five Points Gang. Unlike other street gangs, whose business was petty crime, Luciano offered protection to Jewish youngsters from Italian and Irish gangs for ten cents per week. He began learning the pimping trade in the years around World War I. Luciano met Meyer Lansky as a teenager when Luciano attempted to extort Lansky for protection money on his walk home from school. Luciano respected the younger boy&#x27;s defiant responses to his threats, and the two formed a lasting partnership.

It is not clear how Luciano earned the nickname &quot;Lucky&quot;. It may have come from surviving a severe beating and throat-slashing by three men in 1929 as the result of his refusal to work for another crime boss. The nickname may also be attributed to his luck at gambling, or to a simple mispronunciation of his last name. It is also not clear how his surname came to be rendered &quot;Luciano&quot;, and this too may have been the result of persistent misspellings by newspapers. From 1916 to 1936, Luciano was arrested 25 times on charges including assault, illegal gambling, blackmail, and robbery but spent no time in prison.

==Prohibition and the early 1920s==
On January 17, 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution took effect and Prohibition was enforced for the next thirteen years. The amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Since the demand for alcohol continued, the resulting black market for alcoholic beverages provided criminals with an additional source of income. By 1920, Luciano had met many future Mafia leaders, including Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, the latter a longtime friend and future business partner, through the Five Points Gang. That same year, Lower Manhattan crime boss Joe Masseria recruited Luciano as one of his gunmen. Around that same time, Luciano and his close associates started working for gambler Arnold Rothstein, who immediately saw the potential financial windfall from Prohibition and educated Luciano on running bootleg alcohol as a business. Luciano, Costello and Genovese started their own bootlegging operation with financing from Rothstein.

Rothstein served as a mentor for Luciano; among other things, he taught how to move in high society and to dress stylishly. Rothstein employed Jack Diamond as a bodyguard and an enforcer; Luciano often worked with Diamond. He started selling heroin smuggled in from Montreal. In 1923, Luciano was caught in a sting selling heroin to undercover agents. Although he saw no jail time, being outed as a drug peddler damaged his reputation among his high-class associates and customers. To salvage his reputation, Luciano bought 200 expensive seats to the Jack Dempsey–Luis Firpo boxing match in The Bronx and distributed them to top gangsters and politicians. Rothstein took Luciano on a shopping trip to Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store in Manhattan to buy expensive clothes for the fight. The strategy worked, and Luciano&#x27;s reputation was saved. By 1925, Luciano was grossing over $12 million per year, and made a personal income of about $4 million per year from running illegal gambling and bootlegging operations in New York that also extended into Philadelphia. In 1927, he started living at the Barbizon-Plaza hotel; living under the alias Charles Lane, he lived for a number of years.

==Rise to power and the late 1920s==
Luciano soon became a top aide in Masseria&#x27;s criminal organization. In contrast to Rothstein, Masseria was uneducated, with poor manners and limited managerial skills. By the late 1920s, his main rival was Sicilian-born boss Salvatore Maranzano of the Castellammarese clan. After Gaetano Reina, one of Masseria&#x27;s lieutenants, switched sides to Maranzano, Masseria ordered Luciano to arrange Reina&#x27;s murder. After the murder took place on February 26, 1930, the rivalry between Masseria and Maranzano escalated into the bloody Castellammarese War. Masseria and Maranzano were &quot;Mustache Petes&quot;: older, traditional Mafia bosses who had started their criminal careers in Italy. They believed in upholding the supposed &quot;Old World Mafia&quot; principles of &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;respect&quot;, and &quot;dignity&quot;. These bosses refused to work with non-Italians and were skeptical of working with non-Sicilians. Some of the most conservative bosses worked with only those men with roots in their own Sicilian village. In contrast, Luciano was willing to work with not only Italians, but also Jewish and Irish gangsters, as long as there was money to be made. Luciano was shocked to hear traditional Sicilian &quot;mafiosi&quot; lecture him about his dealings with close friend Costello, whom they called &quot;the dirty Calabrian&quot;.

Luciano soon began cultivating ties with other younger mobsters who had been born in Italy but began their criminal careers in the U.S. and chafed at their bosses&#x27; conservatism. Luciano wanted to use lessons he learned from Rothstein to turn their gang activities into full-blown criminal enterprises. As the war progressed, this group came to include future mob leaders such as Costello, Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, Joe Bonanno, Carlo Gambino, Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano and Tommy Lucchese. They believed that their bosses&#x27; greed and conservatism were keeping them poor while the Irish and Jewish gangs got rich. Luciano&#x27;s vision was to form a national crime syndicate in which the Italian, Jewish, and Irish gangs could pool their resources and turn organized crime into a lucrative business for all – an organization he founded after a conference was hosted in Atlantic City by Luciano, Lansky, Costello, and Johnny Torrio in May 1929. In October 1929, Luciano was forced into a limousine at gunpoint by three men, beaten and stabbed, and strung up by his hands from a beam in a warehouse in Staten Island. He survived the ordeal, but was forever marked with a scar and droopy eye. The identity of his abductors was never established. When picked up by the police after the assault, Luciano said that he had no idea who did it. In 1953, Luciano told an interviewer that it was the police who kidnapped and beat him in an attempt to find Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond. Another story was that Maranzano ordered the attack.

===Power play===

By early 1931, the Castellammarese War had turned against Masseria, and Luciano saw an opportunity to switch allegiance. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer Masseria&#x27;s death in return for receiving his rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command. Adonis had joined the Masseria faction, and when Masseria heard about Luciano&#x27;s betrayal he approached Adonis about killing Luciano; however, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot.

On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a Coney Island restaurant in Brooklyn. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to go to the bathroom, at which point gunmenreportedly Anastasia, Genovese, Adonis and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegelentered the restaurant. Ciro Terranova drove the getaway car but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive and had to be shoved out of the driver&#x27;s seat by Siegel. With Maranzano&#x27;s blessing, Luciano took over Masseria&#x27;s gang and became Maranzano&#x27;s lieutenant, ending the Castellammarese War.

With Masseria gone, Maranzano reorganized the Italian-American gangs in New York City into Five Families headed by Luciano, Profaci, Gagliano, Vincent Mangano and himself. Maranzano called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). Maranzano also whittled down the rival families&#x27; rackets in favor of his own. Luciano appeared to accept these changes but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that he was even greedier and more hidebound than Masseria had been.

By September 1931, Maranzano realized Luciano was a threat, and hired Vincent Coll, an Irish gangster, to kill him; however, Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. On September 10, Maranzano ordered Luciano, Genovese and Costello to come to his office at the Helmsley Building in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to act first. He sent to Maranzano&#x27;s office Lucchese and four Jewish gangsters, secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel, whose faces were unknown to Maranzano&#x27;s people. Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano&#x27;s bodyguards. Lucchese identified Maranzano to the other two gangsters, who proceeded to stab the boss multiple times before shooting him. This assassination was the first of what would later be fabled as the &quot;Night of the Sicilian Vespers&quot;.

Several days later, on September 13, the corpses of two Maranzano allies, Samuel Monaco and Louis Russo, were retrieved from Newark Bay, showing evidence of torture. Meanwhile, Joseph Siragusa, leader of the Pittsburgh crime family, was shot to death in his home. The October 15 disappearance of Joe Ardizonne, head of the Los Angeles crime family, would later be regarded as part of this alleged plan to quickly eliminate the Mustache Petes; the idea of an organized mass purge, directed by Luciano, has been debunked as a myth.

==Reorganizing Cosa Nostra and the Commission==
With the death of Maranzano, Luciano became the dominant crime boss in the U.S. He had reached the pinnacle of the underworld, setting policies and directing activities along with the other Mafia bosses. His own crime family controlled lucrative criminal rackets in New York City such as illegal gambling, extortion, bookmaking, loansharking, and drug trafficking. He became very influential in labor union activities and controlled the Manhattan Waterfront, garbage hauling, construction, Garment District businesses, and trucking. Although there would have been few objections had Luciano declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;, he chose to abolish the title, believing the position created trouble between the families and made himself a target for another ambitious challenger. Instead, Luciano chose to quietly maintain control by forging unofficial alliances with other bosses; at the same time, Luciano did not discard all of Maranzano&#x27;s changes as he believed that the ceremony of becoming a &quot;made man&quot; in a crime family was a Sicilian anachronism. Genovese ultimately persuaded Luciano to keep the ceremony, arguing that young people needed rituals to promote obedience to the family. Luciano remained committed to &quot;omertà&quot;, the oath of silence, to protect the families from legal prosecution. In addition, he kept Maranzano&#x27;s structure of five crime families in New York.

Luciano elevated his most trusted Italian associates to high-level positions in what was now the Luciano crime family. Genovese became underboss and Costello &quot;consigliere&quot;. Adonis, Michael &quot;Trigger Mike&quot; Coppola, Anthony Strollo, Willie Moretti and Anthony Carfano all served as &quot;caporegimes&quot;. Because Lansky and Siegel were non-Italians, neither man could hold official positions within any Mafia family; however, Lansky was a top advisor to Luciano and Siegel a trusted associate. Later in 1931, Luciano called a meeting in Chicago with various bosses, where he proposed a Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime. Designed to settle all disputes and decide which families controlled which territories, the Commission has been called Luciano&#x27;s greatest innovation. His goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission.

The Commission was originally composed of representatives of the five families of New York, the Buffalo crime family and the Chicago Outfit; later, the crime families of Philadelphia and Detroit were added, with smaller families being formally represented by a Commission family. The Commission also provided representation for Jewish criminal organizations in New York. The group&#x27;s first test came in 1935, when it ordered Dutch Schultz to drop his plans to murder Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Luciano argued that such an assassination would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown; the national crime syndicate had enacted a hard and fast rule stating that law enforcement and prosecutors were not to be harmed. An enraged Schultz said he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting. Later, Anastasia approached Luciano with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey&#x27;s apartment building on Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the news, the Commission held a discreet meeting to discuss the matter. After six hours of deliberations, the Commission ordered Lepke Buchalter to eliminate Schultz. On October 23, 1935, before he could kill Dewey, Schultz was shot in a tavern in Newark, New Jersey, and succumbed to his injuries the following day.

==Prosecution for pandering==
During the early 1930s, Luciano&#x27;s crime family started taking over small-scale prostitution operations in New York City. In June 1935, New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman appointed Dewey, a United States Attorney, as a special prosecutor to combat organized crime in the city. Dewey&#x27;s assistant district attorney, Eunice Carter, led an investigation that connected Luciano to this prostitution network. Carter began to build a case of prostitution racketeering founded on evidence from interviews with prostitutes and wiretaps.

On February 2, 1936, Dewey authorized a raid on 200 brothels in Manhattan and Brooklyn, earning him nationwide recognition as a major &quot;gangbuster.&quot; He took measures to prevent police corruption from impeding the raids: he assigned 160 police officers outside of the New York City Police Department&#x27;s (NYPD) vice squad to conduct the raids, and the officers were instructed to wait on street corners until they received their orders, minutes before the raids were to begin. Sixteen men and 87 women were arrested; however, unlike previous vice raids the arrestees were not released, but taken to Dewey&#x27;s offices where Judge Philip J. McCook set minimum bails of US$10,000, far beyond their means to pay. Carter had built trust with a number of the arrested prostitutes and madams, some of whom reported being beaten and abused by &quot;mafiosi&quot;. She convinced many to testify rather than serve additional jail time. By mid-March, several defendants had implicated Luciano. Three of the prostitutes identified Luciano as the ringleader to whom associates David Betillo and Thomas Pennochio ultimately reported.

In late March 1936, after receiving a tip on his imminent arrest, Luciano fled to Hot Springs, Arkansas. A New York detective in Hot Springs on a different assignment spotted Luciano and notified Dewey. On April 3, Luciano was arrested in Hot Springs on a criminal warrant from New York charging him with 90 counts of compulsory prostitution. Luciano&#x27;s lawyers in Arkansas began a fierce legal battle against extradition. On April 6, Owney Madden, one-time owner of the Cotton Club, offered a $50,000 bribe to Arkansas Attorney General Carl E. Bailey to facilitate Luciano&#x27;s case: however, Bailey refused the bribe and immediately reported it. On April 17, after all of Luciano&#x27;s legal options had been exhausted, Arkansas authorities handed him to three NYPD detectives for transport by train back to New York for trial. When the train reached St. Louis, Missouri, the detectives and Luciano changed trains. During this switchover, they were guarded by 20 local policemen to prevent a mob rescue attempt. The party arrived in New York on April 18, and Luciano was arraigned and jailed the following day after failing to post the US$350,000 bond set by McCook.

On May 11, 1936, Luciano&#x27;s pandering trial began. Dewey personally prosecuted the case that Carter had begun against Luciano and twelve co-defendants. He accused Luciano of being part of a massive prostitution ring known as &quot;the bonding combination&quot;. He also exposed Luciano for lying on the witness stand through direct quizzing and records of telephone calls; Luciano could not explain why his federal income tax records claimed he made only $22,000 a year, while he was obviously a wealthy man. Dewey ruthlessly pressed Luciano on his long arrest record and his relationships with well-known gangsters such as Masseria, Terranova and Buchalter. On June 7, Luciano and his remaining eight co-defendants each were convicted on 62 counts of compulsory prostitution. On June 18, Luciano was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in state prison.

In his book &quot;Five Families&quot;, longtime &quot;New York Times&quot; organized-crime columnist Selwyn Raab wrote that a number of scholars have questioned whether Luciano was directly involved in the bonding combination. According to Raab, there was evidence that Luciano profited from prostitution and several members of his family ran a protection racket that ensnared many of New York&#x27;s madams and brothel keepers; however, he wrote that several Mafia and legal scholars believed that it would have been out of character for a crime boss of Luciano&#x27;s stature to be directly involved in a prostitution ring. Raab wrote that the evidence Dewey presented against Luciano was &quot;astonishingly thin&quot; and argued that it would have been more appropriate to charge Luciano with extortion. Raab believed that Luciano&#x27;s defense team, led by attorney George Morton Levy, erred in allowing him to take the stand in his own defense, opening the door for Dewey to attack his credibility on cross-examination.

All four of the prostitutes who directly implicated Luciano in the bonding combinationNancy Presser, Mildred Harris, Thelma Jordan and Florence &quot;Cokey Flo&quot; Brownrecanted their testimony after the trial, and at least two of Luciano&#x27;s contemporaries have denied that he was ever part of the combination. In her memoirs, New York society madam Polly Adler wrote that if Luciano had been involved with the combination, she would have known about it. Bonanno, the last surviving contemporary of Luciano&#x27;s who was not in prison, also denied that Luciano was directly involved in prostitution in his book &quot;A Man of Honor&quot;. Bonanno believed that several of Luciano&#x27;s soldiers used his name to intimidate brothel keepers into paying for protection and argued that Dewey built his case &quot;not so much against Luciano as against Luciano&#x27;s name&quot;. Key witnesses at Luciano&#x27;s trial testified that he was involved with prostitution racketeering and frequently discussed the sex industry business, once describing it as &quot;the same as the A&amp;P stores are, a large syndicate&quot; and &quot;the same as chain stores&quot;, and ordering an underling to &quot;[g]o ahead and crack the joint&quot; when a brothel fell behind in its kickbacks. One witness testified that Luciano, working out of his Waldorf-Astoria suite, personally hired him to collect from bookers and madams.

===Prison===
Luciano continued to run his crime family from prison, relaying his orders through acting boss Genovese. In 1937 Genovese fled to Naples to avoid an impending murder indictment in New York, so Luciano appointed his &quot;consigliere&quot;, Costello, as the new acting boss and the overseer of Luciano&#x27;s interests. Luciano was first imprisoned at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York. Later in 1936, authorities moved him to Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, a remote facility far away from New York City. At Clinton, Betillo prepared special dishes for Luciano in a kitchen set aside by authorities. Luciano was assigned a job in the prison laundry. Luciano used his influence to help get the materials to build a church at the prison, which became famous for being one of the only freestanding churches in the New York State correctional system and also for the fact that on the church&#x27;s altar are two of the original doors from the &quot;Victoria&quot;, the ship of Ferdinand Magellan. Luciano&#x27;s legal appeals continued until October 10, 1938, when the United States Supreme Court refused to review his case. At this point, Luciano stepped down as family boss and Costello formally replaced him.

==World War II, freedom, and deportation==
During World War II, the U.S. government struck a secret deal with the imprisoned Luciano. In 1942, the Office of Naval Intelligence was concerned about German and Italian agents entering the country through the New York waterfront. They were also worried about sabotage in these facilities. Knowing that the Mafia controlled the waterfront, the U.S. Department of the Navy contacted Lansky about a deal with Luciano. To facilitate negotiations, Luciano was transferred to Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock, New York, which was much closer to New York City.

The Navy, the State of New York and Luciano reached a deal: in exchange for a commutation of his sentence, Luciano promised the complete assistance of his organization in providing intelligence to the Navy. Anastasia, a Luciano ally who controlled the docks, allegedly promised no dockworker strikes during the war. In preparation for the 1943 allied invasion of Sicily, Luciano allegedly provided the U.S. military with Sicilian Mafia contacts. This collaboration between the Navy and the Mafia became known as Operation Underworld.

The value of Luciano&#x27;s contribution to the war effort is highly debated. In 1947, the naval officer in charge of Operation Underworld discounted the value of his wartime aid. A 1954 report ordered by now-Governor Dewey stated that Luciano provided many valuable services to Naval Intelligence. The enemy threat to the docks, Luciano allegedly said, was manufactured by the sinking of the SS &quot;Normandie&quot; in New York Harbor, supposedly directed by Anastasia&#x27;s brother, Anthony Anastasio; however, the official investigation of the ship sinking found no evidence of sabotage.

On January 3, 1946, as a presumed reward for his alleged wartime cooperation, Dewey reluctantly commuted Luciano&#x27;s pandering sentence on condition that he not resist deportation to Italy. Luciano accepted the deal, although he still maintained that he was a U.S. citizen and not subject to deportation. On February 2, 1946, two federal immigration agents transported Luciano from Sing Sing prison to Ellis Island in New York Harbor for deportation proceedings. On February 9, the night before his departure, Luciano shared a spaghetti dinner on his freighter with Anastasia and five other guests. On February 10, Luciano&#x27;s ship sailed from Brooklyn for Italy. On February 28, after a 17-day voyage, the ship arrived in Naples. On arrival, Luciano told reporters he would probably reside in Sicily.

==Havana Conference==

In October 1946, Luciano secretly relocated to the Cuban capital of Havana, first taking a freighter from Naples to Caracas, Venezuela, then a flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before flying to Mexico City and doubling back to Caracas, where he took a private plane to Camagüey, Cuba, finally arriving on October 29. He was then driven to Havana, where he moved into an estate in the Miramar section of the city. Luciano wanted to move closer to the U.S. so that he could resume control over American Mafia operations and eventually return home. He was already established as a major investor in Cuban gambling and hotel projects. Lansky suggested Luciano and Siegel invest a half-million dollars to fund Luciano&#x27;s casinos. Lansky delivered the money to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was guaranteed US$3- or US$5 million annually.

In 1946, Lansky called a meeting of the heads of the major crime families in Havana that December, dubbed the Havana Conference. The ostensible reason was to see singer Frank Sinatra perform; however, the real reason was to discuss mob business, with Luciano in attendance. The three topics under discussion were: the heroin trade, Cuban gambling and what to do about Siegel and his floundering Flamingo Hotel project in Las Vegas. The Conference took place at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba and lasted a little more than a week. During the conference, on December 20, Luciano had a private meeting with Genovese in Luciano&#x27;s hotel suite. The year before, the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division had shipped Genovese from Italy to New York to face trial on his 1934 murder charge.

In June 1946, the charges were dismissed, which left Genovese free to return to mob business. Unlike Costello, Luciano had never trusted Genovese. In the meeting, Genovese tried to convince Luciano to become a titular &quot;boss of bosses&quot; and let Genovese run everything. Luciano calmly rejected Genovese&#x27;s suggestion, saying: &quot;There is no Boss of Bosses. I turned it down in front of everybody. If I ever change my mind, I will take the title. But it won&#x27;t be up to you. Right now, you work for me, and I ain&#x27;t in the mood to retire. Don&#x27;t you ever let me hear this again, or I&#x27;ll lose my temper.&quot;

Soon after the conference began, the U.S. government learned that Luciano was in Cuba. Luciano had been publicly fraternizing with Sinatra as well as visiting numerous nightclubs, so his presence was no secret in Havana. The U.S. started putting pressure on the Cuban government to expel him; on February 21, 1947, Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger notified the Cubans that the U.S. would block all shipment of narcotic prescription drugs while Luciano remained in the country. Two days later, the Cuban government announced that Luciano was in custody and would be deported to Italy within 48 hours.

==Operating in Italy==

Luciano was placed on a freighter bound for Genoa. After his secret trip to Cuba, Luciano spent the rest of his life in Italy under tight police surveillance. When he arrived in Genoa on April 11, 1947, Italian police arrested him and sent him to a jail in Palermo. On May 11, a regional commission in Palermo warned Luciano to stay out of trouble and released him.

In early July 1949, police in Rome arrested Luciano on suspicion of involvement in the shipping of narcotics to New York. On July 15, after a week in jail, police released Luciano without filing any charges. The authorities also permanently banned him from visiting Rome. On June 9, 1951, Luciano was questioned by Naples police on suspicion of illegally bringing $57,000 in cash and a new American car into Italy. After 20 hours of questioning, police released Luciano without any charges.

In 1952, the Italian government revoked Luciano&#x27;s passport after complaints from U.S. and Canadian law enforcement officials. On November 1, 1954, an Italian judicial commission in Naples applied strict limits on Luciano for two years. He was required to report to the police every Sunday, to stay home every night and not to leave Naples without police permission. The commission cited Luciano&#x27;s alleged involvement in the narcotics trade as the reason for these restrictions.

==American power struggle==
By 1957, Genovese felt strong enough to move against Luciano and his acting boss, Costello. He was aided in this move by Gambino, now the Anastasia family&#x27;s underboss. On May 2, following Genovese&#x27;s orders, Vincent Gigante ambushed Costello in the lobby of his Central Park apartment building, The Majestic. Gigante called out, &quot;This is for you, Frank&quot;, and as Costello turned, shot him in the head. After firing his weapon, Gigante quickly left, thinking he had killed Costello; however, the bullet had only grazed Costello&#x27;s head and he was not seriously injured. Although Costello refused to cooperate with police, Gigante was arrested for attempted murder. He was acquitted at trial, thanking Costello in the courtroom after the verdict. Costello was allowed to retire after conceding control of what is today called the Genovese crime family to Genovese. Luciano was powerless to stop these events.

On October 25, 1957, Genovese and Gambino successfully arranged the murder of Anastasia, another Luciano ally. The following month, Genovese called a meeting of bosses in Apalachin, New York, to approve his takeover of the Genovese family and to establish his national power. Instead, the Apalachin Meeting turned into a fiasco when law enforcement became aware of the meeting and conducted a raid. Over 65 high-ranking mobsters were arrested, and the Mafia was subjected to publicity and numerous grand jury summonses. The enraged mobsters blamed Genovese for the disaster, opening a window of opportunity for Genovese&#x27;s opponents. Luciano allegedly attended a meeting at a hotel in Palermo to discuss heroin trade as part of the French Connection. After this meeting, Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. Sent to prison for fifteen years, Genovese tried to run his crime family from prison until his death in 1969.

==Personal life and death==
In 1929, Luciano met Gay Orlova, a featured dancer in one of Broadway&#x27;s leading nightclubs, Hollywood. They were inseparable until he went to prison but were never married. In early 1948, he met Igea Lissoni, a Milanese &quot;ballerina&quot; 20 years his junior, whom he later described as the love of his life. In the summer, Lissoni moved in with him. Although some reports said the couple married in 1949, others state that they only exchanged rings. Luciano and Lissoni lived together in Luciano&#x27;s house in Naples. He continued to have affairs with other women, resulting in many arguments with Lissoni during which he physically struck her. In 1959, Lissoni died of breast cancer. Luciano never had children. He once provided his reasons for that: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want no son of mine to go through life as the son of Luciano, the gangster. That&#x27;s one thing I still hate Dewey for, making me a gangster in the eyes of the world.&quot;

On January 26, 1962, Luciano died of a heart attack at Naples Airport. He had gone there to meet with American producer Martin Gosch about a film based on his life. To avoid antagonizing other Mafia members, Luciano had previously refused to authorize a film, but reportedly relented after the death of Lissoni. After the meeting with Gosch, Luciano had a heart attack and died, unaware that Italian drug agents had followed him to the airport in anticipation of arresting him on drug smuggling charges. Three days later, 300 people attended a funeral service for Luciano in Naples. His body was conveyed along the streets of Naples in a horse-drawn hearse. With the permission of the U.S. government, Luciano&#x27;s relatives took his body back to New York for burial. He was buried in Saint John Cemetery,in Middle Village, Queens. More than 2,000 mourners attended his funeral. Gambino, Luciano&#x27;s longtime friend, gave his eulogy.

==Legacy==
In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; characterized Luciano as the &quot;criminal mastermind&quot; among the top 20 most influential builders and titans of the 20th century.

<doc id="148457" wikidata="Q151075" url="?curid=148457" title="Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Francis I (Francis Stephen; ; ; ; 8 December 1708 – 18 August 1765) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1745 to 1765, Archduke of Austria from 1740 to 1765, Duke of Lorraine and Bar from 1729 to 1737, and Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1737 to 1765. He became the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, and Tuscany through his marriage to his second cousin Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Emperor Charles VI. Francis was the last non-Habsburg monarch of the Empire. The couple were the founders of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, and their marriage produced sixteen children. 

Francis was the oldest surviving son of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and the French princess Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans. Duke Leopold died in 1729 and was succeeded by his son. In 1736, Francis married Maria Theresa. In 1738, he left the Duchy of Lorraine and Bar for the deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, as one of the terms ending the War of the Polish Succession. Following the death of his father-in-law, Charles VI, in 1740, Francis and Maria Theresa became the rulers of the Habsburg domains. Maria Theresa gave her husband responsibility for the empire&#x27;s financial affairs, which he handled well. Francis died in 1765 and was succeeded by their son, Joseph II, who co-ruled Austria alongside Maria Theresa.

==Early life==
Francis was born in Lunéville, Lorraine (now in France), the fourth and oldest surviving son of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and his wife Princess Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans. He was connected with the Habsburgs through his grandmother Eleonore, daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III. He was very close to his brother Charles and sister Anne Charlotte.

Emperor Charles VI favoured the family, who, besides being his cousins, had served the house of Habsburg with distinction. He had designed to marry his daughter Maria Theresa to Francis&#x27; older brother Leopold Clement. On Leopold Clement&#x27;s death, Charles adopted the younger brother as his future son-in-law. Francis was brought up in Vienna with Maria Theresa with the understanding that they were to be married, and a real affection arose between them.

At the age of 15, when he was brought to Vienna, he was established in the Silesian Duchy of Teschen, which had been mediatised and granted to his father by the Emperor in 1722. Francis succeeded his father as Duke of Lorraine in 1729. In 1731 he was initiated into freemasonry (Grand Lodge of England) by John Theophilus Desaguliers at a specially convened lodge in The Hague at the house of the British Ambassador, Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. During a subsequent visit to England, Francis was made a Master Mason at another specially convened lodge at Houghton Hall, the Norfolk estate of British Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

Maria Theresa arranged for Francis to become &quot;Lord Lieutenant&quot; (locumtenens) of Hungary in 1732. He was not excited about this position, but Maria Theresa wanted him closer to her. In June 1732 he agreed to go to the Hungarian capital, Pressburg (today&#x27;s Bratislava).

When the War of the Polish Succession broke out in 1733, France used it as an opportunity to seize Lorraine, since France&#x27;s chief minister, Cardinal Fleury, was concerned that, as a Habsburg possession, it would bring Austrian power too close to France.

A preliminary peace was concluded in October 1735 and ratified in the Treaty of Vienna in November 1738. Under its terms, Stanisław I, the father-in-law of King Louis XV and the losing claimant to the Polish throne, received Lorraine, while Francis, in compensation for his loss, was made heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which he would inherit in 1737.

In March 1736, the Emperor persuaded Francis, his future son-in-law, to secretly exchange Lorraine for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. France had demanded that Maria Theresa&#x27;s fiancé surrender his ancestral Duchy of Lorraine to accommodate the deposed King of Poland. The Emperor considered other possibilities (such as marrying her to the future Charles III of Spain) before announcing the engagement of the couple. If something were to go wrong, Francis would become governor of the Austrian Netherlands.

Elisabeth of Parma had also wanted the Grand Duchy of Tuscany for her son Charles III of Spain; Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici was childless and was related to Elisabeth via her great-grandmother Margherita de&#x27; Medici. As a result, Elisabeth&#x27;s sons could claim by right of being a descendant of Margherita.

Although fighting stopped after the preliminary peace, the final peace settlement had to wait until the death of Gian Gastone in 1737, to allow the territorial exchanges provided for by the peace settlement to go into effect.

On 31 January 1736, Francis agreed to marry Maria Theresa. He hesitated three times (and laid down the feather before signing). Especially his mother Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans and his brother Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine were against the loss of Lorraine. On 1 February, Maria Theresa sent Francis a letter: she would withdraw from her future reign, when a male successor for her father appeared.

==Marriage==
Francis and Maria Theresa married on 12 February 1736 in the Augustinian Church, Vienna. The wedding was held on 14 February 1736. The (secret) treaty between the Emperor and Francis was signed on 4 May 1736. On 5 January 1737, instruments of cession were signed at Pontremoli between Spain and the Empire, with Spain ceding Parma, Piacenza and Tuscany to the Holy Roman Empire and the Empire recognizing Don Carlos of Spain as King of Naples and Sicily. On 10 January, the Spanish troops began their withdrawal from Tuscany, and were replaced by 6,000 Austrians. On 24 January 1737 Francis received Tuscany from his father-in-law. Until then, Maria Theresa was Duchess of Lorraine.

Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, who died on 9 July 1737, was the second cousin of Francis (Gian Gastone and Francis&#x27; father Leopold were both great-grandchildren of Francis II, Duke of Lorraine), who also had Medici blood through his maternal great-great-grandmother Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen consort of France and Navarre. In June 1737 Francis went to Hungary again to fight against the Turks. In October 1738 he was back in Vienna. On 17 December 1738 the couple travelled south, accompanied by his brother Charles to visit Florence for three months. They arrived on 20 January 1739.

In 1744 Francis&#x27; brother Charles married a younger sister of Maria Theresa, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. In 1744 Charles became governor of the Austrian Netherlands, a post he held until his death in 1780.

==Reign==

In the Treaty of Füssen, Maria Theresa secured his election as Emperor, which took place on 13 September 1745, and his coronation as emperor took place at the Imperial Cathedral of Saint Bartholomew in Frankfurt am Main on 4 October 1745. Francis succeeded Charles VII, and Maria Theresa made him co-regent of her hereditary dominions.

Francis was well content to leave the wielding of power to his able wife. He had a natural fund of good sense and brilliant business capacity and was a useful assistant to Maria Theresa in the laborious task of governing the complicated Austrian dominions, but he was not active in politics or diplomacy. However, his wife left him in charge of the financial affairs, which he managed well until his death. Heavily indebted and on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Habsburg monarchy was in a better financial condition than France or Great Britain in the 1780s. He also took a great interest in the natural sciences.

Francis was a serial adulterer; many of his affairs well-known and indiscreet, notably one with Princess Maria Wilhelmina of Auersperg, who was thirty years his junior. This particular affair was remarked upon in the letters and journals of visitors to the court and in those of his children.

He died suddenly in his carriage while returning from the opera at Innsbruck on 18 August 1765. He is buried in tomb number 55 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

Maria Theresa and Francis I had sixteen children, amongst them the last pre-revolutionary queen consort of France, their youngest daughter, Marie Antoinette (1755–1793). Francis was succeeded as Emperor by his eldest son, Joseph II, and as Grand Duke of Tuscany by his younger son, Peter Leopold (later Emperor Leopold II). Maria Theresa retained the government of her dominions until her own death in 1780.

<doc id="148461" wikidata="Q313749" url="?curid=148461" title="Jon Anderson">
<text>Jon Anderson (born John Roy Anderson, 25 October 1944) is a British and American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former lead singer of the progressive rock band Yes, which he formed in 1968 with bassist Chris Squire. Renowned for his alto tenor range, he was a member of the band across three tenures until 2004, and was also the singer of the Yes-linked projects Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. Anderson became an American citizen in 2009 with dual citizenship.

Anderson is also noted for his solo career and collaborations with other artists, including Vangelis as Jon and Vangelis, Roine Stolt as Anderson/Stolt, and Jean-Luc Ponty as the Anderson Ponty Band. He has also appeared on albums by King Crimson, Toto, Lawrence Gowan, Tangerine Dream, Iron Butterfly, Milton Nascimento, Battles, Mike Oldfield and Kitaro.

Anderson released his first solo album, &quot;Olias of Sunhillow&quot;, in 1976, while still a member of Yes, and subsequently released 14 more albums as a solo artist. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes.

==Early life==
John Roy Anderson was born on 25 October 1944 in Accrington, Lancashire, England. His father Albert was from Glasgow, Scotland, and served in the army in the entertainment division and later worked as a salesman; his mother Kathleen was of Irish and French ancestry and worked in a cotton mill, cotton being the biggest export from Lancashire at the time. Together they became county champions in ballroom dancing, winning several awards. Anderson said they named him after an English singer who toured as &quot;John Roy the Melody Boy&quot; and the Scottish name Royston. Anderson grew up on Norfolk Street with brothers Tony and Stuart, and sister Joy. He is the third youngest. As a youngster, Anderson became a fan of several musicians, including Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, the Everly Brothers, and Jon Hendricks.

Anderson attended St. John&#x27;s School where he organised daily football matches during lunch break. He was not a strong academic, and remembered he &quot;was always getting into trouble for messing around and singing too loud&quot;. There, he made a tentative start to a musical career, playing the washboard in Little John&#x27;s Skiffle Group who performed songs by Lonnie Donegan, among others. At fifteen, Anderson left school after his father became ill and took up work on a farm, as a lorry driver transporting bricks, and as a milkman to help support the family. A keen football fan, he tried to pursue a career at Accrington Stanley F.C., but at tall, he was turned down because of his frail constitution. He remained a fan of the club, and was a ball boy and mascot for the team for one year.

==Career==
===1962–1968: The Warriors and early singles===
Anderson had no particular desire to become a singer at first until his brother Tony took up singing and joined the Warriors, a local group also known as the Electric Warriors. After one of the backing vocalists left the group, Anderson filled in the position, and found music more enjoyable and a better choice for money than manual labour. The group performed mainly cover songs from several artists, including the Beatles, and performed across Lancashire and the club circuit in Germany for over a year. Anderson is heard on their first two recorded songs, &quot;You Came Along&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Blue&quot;, released in 1965. After the Warriors split in Germany in late 1967, the band returned to England while Anderson stayed behind. He briefly became singer in the Gentle Party, a band from Bolton who were in Germany.

After returning to London in March 1968, Anderson met Jack Barrie, owner of the La Chasse drinking club in Soho who befriended the rest of the Warriors after they had relocated to the city. With no money or accommodation, Barrie allowed Anderson and Warriors keyboardist and vocalist Brian Chatton to stay with him. Anderson helped out by working at La Chasse; during this time he got talking to Paul Korda, a producer for EMI Records who took him on to sing several demos. During the search for material to record, Barrie got in touch with Elton John and Bernie Taupin of DJM Records to put some music together, but felt Anderson did not like much of it. Meanwhile, Anderson travelled to the Netherlands to join Les Cruches, a band he met in London, but promptly returned when he found out some of his demos were to be released as singles by Parlophone Records. Released under his pseudonym Hans Christian, the first, an orchestrated cover of &quot;Never My Love&quot; by the Association with &quot;All of the Time&quot; on its B-side, received a positive reception from &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and Chris Welch for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; who wrote in March 1968, &quot;A blockbuster of a hit from a young fairy tale teller with an emotion packed voice.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s second single, &quot;(The Autobiography of) Mississippi Hobo&quot;/&quot;Sonata of Love&quot;, was released two months later; neither song was successful. Barrie and Korda then took Anderson to see local group the Gun and together rehearsed for well received gigs at the UFO and Marquee clubs in London, the latter as an opener for the Who, which led to several gig offers. However, the rest of the group believed they could reach success without a lead vocalist and sacked Anderson.

===1968–1980: Forming Yes and start of solo career===
In May 1968, Barrie introduced Anderson to Chris Squire, bassist of the London-based rock band Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop, which had previously included guitarist Peter Banks. The two talked, and found they shared common musical interests such as Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the idea of vocal harmonies. In the following days, they developed &quot;Sweetness&quot;, a song later recorded on the first Yes album. Anderson found himself on lead vocals for some Mabel Greer gigs afterwards, and talks of the formation of a new, full-time band developed. In June 1968, Anderson and Squire hired Bill Bruford to replace founding drummer Robert Hagger, and Anderson secured £500 from John Roberts, owner of a paper manufacturer, to rent space in The Lucky Horseshoe cafe in Soho so a new, full-time band could rehearse. At their conclusion a month later, a line-up of Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Banks, who replaced a departing Clive Bayley, and keyboardist Tony Kaye, who Anderson met in Leicester four years prior, was formed. They then renamed themselves Yes, originally Banks&#x27; idea. Anderson&#x27;s first gig with Yes followed on 3 August 1968 at a youth camp in East Mersea in Essex.
Although the band had no formal leader, Anderson served as its main motivating force in their early days, doing most of the hustling for gigs and originating most of their songs. He played a key role in initiating their more ambitious artistic ideas, serving as the main instigator of some of the band&#x27;s more popular songs, including &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;, and &quot;Awaken&quot;, and the concept behind their double concept album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973).

Despite his initial lack of instrumental skills, Anderson was strongly involved in the selection of successive Yes members chosen for their musicality – guitarist Steve Howe (who replaced Banks in 1970), Kaye&#x27;s successive replacements Rick Wakeman and Patrick Moraz, and drummer Alan White, who replaced Bruford in 1972.

Ambitious and nicknamed &quot;Napoleon&quot; by the rest of the band, Anderson was also fond of sonic and psychological creative experiments, and in so doing contributed to occasionally conflicted relationships within the band and with management. An example of this was his original desire to record &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; in the middle of the woods. When the band voted to record in a studio, he decided to arrange hay and animal cut-outs all over the floor to create atmosphere. Anderson described the album&#x27;s supporting tour as one of the low points of his career, as a portion of the audience and the band were unhappy with the album.

In addition to Yes, Anderson appeared as a guest singer on &quot;Lizard&quot; by King Crimson for &quot;Prince Rupert Awakes&quot;, the first part of their 23-minute title track recorded in 1970. He was chosen for the part as the desired vocal range was unattainable by the group&#x27;s then-lead vocalist, Gordon Haskell. In 1974, Anderson co-wrote &quot;Pearly Gates&quot; with Iron Butterfly drummer Ron Bushy on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Scorching Beauty&quot;. This was followed by his first collaboration with Greek musician Vangelis, singing on &quot;So Long Ago, So Clear&quot;, the last section of &quot;Heaven and Hell Part I&quot; on his 1975 album &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.

In August 1975, Yes took an extended break for each member to release a studio album. Anderson chose a concept album, &quot;Olias of Sunhillow&quot;, about an alien race of four tribes and their journey to a new planet as theirs is under threat from destruction. Olias, one of the three main characters, builds the Moorglade Mover, an aircraft formed of living organisms to transport everyone to their new home. Anderson gained inspiration from science fiction and fantasy novels, works by J. R. R. Tolkien, &quot;The Initiation of the World&quot; by Vera Stanley Alder, and the art work from Yes&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot;. He recorded the music from his garage in six months, learning to play all instruments himself, including several types of drum, stringed, and percussion instruments associated with world or ethnic music, which took up as many as 120 track recordings in its original form. Anderson found the experience a valuable one in learning about music. Atlantic Records released the album in July 1976, and it reached number 8 in the UK and number 47 in the US.

Between 1976 and 1979, Anderson recorded &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;Tormato&quot; with Yes and completed their supporting tours. In February 1979, he reconvened with Vangelis to start recording as Jon and Vangelis. Their first album, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, was recorded in a matter of weeks with minimal preconceived ideas which Anderson found to be a refreshing experience. Released in January 1980, &quot;Short Stories&quot; went to number 4 in the UK. In 1979, Anderson played the harp on &quot;Flamants Roses&quot; on Vangelis&#x27;s album &quot;Opéra sauvage&quot; and wrote music for Ursprung, an act for a three-part modern ballet named Underground Rumours performed by the Scottish Ballet company, that also featured music by Ian Anderson. The choreographer was Royston Maldoom and the lighting designer was David Hersey.

In October 1979, Anderson travelled to Paris to record a new Yes album with producer Roy Thomas Baker. Progress staggered early into the sessions following disputes over the band&#x27;s musical direction. Material prepared by Anderson and Wakeman was not met with enthusiasm by their bandmates, who started to put down tracks without them. These appeared on the Yes album &quot;Drama&quot;. &quot;Very quickly&quot;, recalled Anderson, &quot;the mood changed from enthusiasm to frustration and then complete confusion&quot;. Matters failed to improve when they reconvened in February 1980, and Anderson and Wakeman left in the following month. They were replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoffrey Downes of the Buggles.

===1980–1990: Solo career, return to Yes, and ABWH===
Anderson acquired Jannis Zographos as his new manager, who also handled Vangelis. He continued his collaboration with Vangelis by singing on &quot;Suffocation&quot; and &quot;See You Later&quot; for Vangelis&#x27;s album &quot;See You Later&quot;, released in 1980. After he secured a recording deal with Virgin Records, Anderson retreated to southern France to write material for a solo album. His proposals for albums based on the Russian-French artist Marc Chagall and the book &quot;A True Fairy Tale&quot; by Daphne Charters were not enthusiastically received by the label&#x27;s management, who lost interest and requested their advance back. Anderson spent much of 1980 recording a collection of songs for &quot;Song of Seven&quot; with a group of musicians he named the New Life Band, which Atlantic agreed to release. When it was put out in November, it reached number 38 in the UK and number 143 in the US. Anderson completed his first solo tour with the band, performing a mix of solo and Yes material in Germany and England.

In 1981, Anderson played on Wakeman&#x27;s concept album &quot;1984&quot; and released his second album with Vangelis in July 1981, &quot;The Friends of Mr Cairo&quot;. The album produced two singles, &quot;I&#x27;ll Find My Way Home&quot; and &quot;State of Independence&quot;; the latter became a hit for Donna Summer in 1982. The album was also notable for the title track, which was an ode to classic Hollywood gangster films of the 1930s and 1940s with voice impressions of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and James Stewart which paid homage to &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941). In 1982, Anderson released &quot;Animation&quot;, and in 1983 appeared on &quot;In High Places&quot; from &quot;Crises&quot; by Mike Oldfield.

In early 1983, Anderson was contacted by Phil Carson of Atlantic Records who suggested that he hear a tape of demos that Cinema, a new group formed of Squire, White, Kaye, and guitarist Trevor Rabin, with Horn as producer, had developed for a new album. Anderson was invited to sing lead vocals on the album and join the group, which he accepted. Cinema then changed their name to Yes, and &quot;90125&quot;, released in November 1983, became Yes&#x27;s best selling album. In 1987, the group released its successor, &quot;Big Generator&quot;.

Anderson appeared on the song &quot;Cage of Freedom&quot; from the 1984 soundtrack for a re-release of the Fritz Lang film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. In 1985, his song &quot;This Time It Was Really Right&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. He also sang &quot;Silver Train&quot; and &quot;Christie&quot; on the soundtrack to &quot;Scream for Help&quot; by John Paul Jones. Along with Tangerine Dream, he appeared on the song &quot;Loved by the Sun&quot; for &quot;Legend&quot; (1985). Anderson released a Christmas-themed solo album, &quot;3 Ships&quot; (1985). &quot;&quot; (1986) features two songs sung by Anderson. In early 1986, Anderson recorded a single with Mike Oldfield (&quot;Shine&quot;) and later shot a video with him in Barbados. During this year, he recorded some demo tracks that would later be reworked. He and Vangelis also started writing new songs and recording demos for another album. Though the album was not made, they performed live together on 6 November 1986. The last three years of the 1980s saw Anderson sing on &quot;Moonlight Desires&quot; on Gowan&#x27;s album &quot;Great Dirty World&quot; (1987), record his fifth solo album &quot;In the City of Angels&quot;, sing on &quot;Stop Loving You&quot; on the Toto album &quot;The Seventh One&quot; (1988), and record an album that would later be released as &quot;The Lost Tapes of Opio&quot;. He also sang on the songs &quot;Within the Lost World&quot; and &quot;Far Far Cry&quot; for the Jonathan Elias album &quot;Requiem for the Americas&quot;.

In 1988, after Yes&#x27; &quot;Big Generator&quot; tour, Anderson reunited with Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe to form Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH) with bassist Tony Levin. They recorded one album and supported it with a successful world tour.

===1990–2004: Return to Yes and solo career===
In 1990, after the ABWH tour, a series of business deals caused ABWH to reunite with the then-current members of Yes, who had been out of the public eye while searching for a new lead singer. The resulting eight-man band assumed the name Yes, and the album &quot;Union&quot; (1991) was assembled from various pieces of an in-progress second ABWH album, as well as recordings that Yes had been working on without Anderson. A successful tour followed.

Jon and Vangelis released their fourth album, &quot;Page of Life&quot;, in 1991. In 1992 Anderson appeared on Kitaro&#x27;s album &quot;Dream&quot;, adding both lyrics and vocals to three songs: &quot;Lady of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Island of Life&quot; and &quot;Agreement&quot;. He also toured South America with a band that included his daughters, Deborah and Jade. He appeared on the song &quot;Along the Amazon&quot; which he co-wrote for violinist Charlie Bisharat&#x27;s album of the same name. In 1993, Anderson started work on &quot;Change We Must&quot;, his seventh solo album, featuring a mixture of original and orchestrated versions of songs he had sung with Yes, Vangelis, and his solo career. It was released in October 1994 on EMI and Angel Records.

From 1992 to 1994, Anderson recorded the Yes album &quot;Talk&quot; (1994). &quot;Walls&quot;, written by Rabin and Roger Hodgson, reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In July 1994, Anderson released &quot;Deseo&quot;, a solo album of Latino-influenced music. There were plans to release a live album called &quot;The Best of South America&quot;, but it was not released due to management issues (though some copies were already released by &quot;Yes Magazine&quot;). Anderson sang on the 7th Level children&#x27;s video game &quot;Tuneland&quot;. Also, his son Damion released a single called &quot;Close 2 the Hype&quot;, which featured him and Jon on vocals.

In August 1995, Anderson relocated to San Luis Obispo in California. His eighth studio album, &quot;Angels Embrace&quot;, was released on 26 September 1995 on the Higher Octave Music label. His first primarily instrumental album, it displays Anderson performing ambient music with assistance from Steve Katz and Keith Heffner on keyboards and his two daughters on vocals. Anderson followed this with &quot;Toltec&quot;, a concept album released on 30 January 1996 on Windham Hill Records that tells the story of Toltec, &quot;a Native American concept of a group of people who have been all over the Earth, existing within different cultures throughout the centuries&quot;. The album was meant to be released in 1993 as &quot;The Power of Silence&quot;, minus the sound effects and narration added later, but it was cancelled following issues with Geffen Records.
In the mid-1990s, Anderson had planned to tour and record in China, but abandoned the idea in favour of writing and recording new music with Yes after Wakeman and Howe rejoined the band. Anderson&#x27;s move to San Luis Obispo influenced the decision for Yes to record their three-night stint at the town&#x27;s Fremont Theater in March 1996, as part of their subsequent studio and live album sets &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; and &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot;, released in 1996 and 1997, respectively. On 12 May 1996, Anderson performed an 80-minute set at a Mother&#x27;s Day concert in Paso Robles, California, formed of Yes, Jon and Vangelis, and solo material. Anderson&#x27;s next album, &quot;Lost Tapes of Opio&quot;, was released in 1996 on audio cassette through his Opio Foundation. Formed of songs recorded since the 1980s, proceeds from the release were donated to UNICEF.

In 1997, Anderson released the Celtic-influenced &quot;The Promise Ring&quot; with his second wife, Jane Luttenburger, sharing vocals. The album is a live recording of music performed by them and members of the Froggin&#x27; Peach Orchestra, the name given to a group of 28 musicians based in the Frog &amp; Peach pub in San Luis Obispo. During their honeymoon in 1997, Anderson and Luttenburger recorded &quot;Earthmotherearth&quot; which was followed by &quot;The More You Know&quot; in 1998, recorded in Paris with French artist Francis Jocky. It was Anderson&#x27;s last studio release for 13 years. Anderson appeared on the song &quot;The Only Thing I Need&quot; by act 4Him in 1999; it was recorded for &quot;Streams&quot;, a multi-group album. Steve Howe&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Portraits of Bob Dylan&quot; also featured a cover of the Bob Dylan song &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; with Anderson&#x27;s vocals. He also recorded with the Fellowship on their album &quot;In Elven Lands&quot;, inspired by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien.

In 2000, Anderson had started work on a sequel album to &quot;Olias of Sunhillow&quot; named &quot;The Songs of Zamran: Son of Olias&quot;. Development on the project slowed since then; in 2011, he reasoned the delay as it spans up to three hours in length, of which he has written the majority of it, but needs additional time &quot;to figure out how to recreate it correctly&quot;. Anderson expressed a wish of putting out an interactive album with &quot;an app that allows people to go on a journey, [to] choose a new journey every time they open it up, and hear it in a different way every time&quot;.

In September 2004, Yes wrapped their 35th Anniversary Tour and they entered a four-and-a-half year hiatus. In the tour&#x27;s last week, Anderson was suffering from stress, asthma, bronchitis, and exhaustion.

===2004–2009: Resuming solo career===

In 2004, Anderson appeared with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra of Cleveland and returned in 2010 for a second performance. A show broadcast from Washington, D.C., on satellite radio was released on a DVD called &quot;Tour of the Universe&quot; in 2005. This release coincided with the release of Anderson&#x27;s single &quot;State of Independence&quot;.

In 2006, Anderson performed &quot;Roundabout&quot; with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Later that year, Anderson and Wakeman toured the UK.

In 2007, Anderson sang on &quot;Culture of Ascent&quot; by Glass Hammer, and appeared as part of a vocal ensemble on &quot;Repentance&quot; on &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; by Dream Theater. Also in 2007, Anderson toured as part of the Paul Green School of Rock Music.

In 2008, Anderson released &quot;From Me to You&quot;, an ambient album of his vocals with birdsong, which was added to &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Sadness of Flowing&quot; which he co-wrote for Peter Machajdík&#x27;s album &quot;Namah&quot; and he made similar contributions to a re-mastering of Tommy Zvoncheck&#x27;s album &quot;ZKG&quot;.

In May 2008, during plans for a Yes tour to commemorate the band&#x27;s fortieth anniversary, Anderson suffered an asthma attack, and was diagnosed with respiratory failure. In 2009, Anderson had regained enough strength to complete a solo European tour named Have Guitar, Will Travel. This was followed by a North American leg through 2010. A sample of Anderson&#x27;s vocals from Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;In High Places&quot; is prominently featured on &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; by Kanye West.

===2010–2023: Solo work, collaborations, Yes feat. ARW and tours===
In 2010, Anderson and Wakeman resumed touring as Anderson/Wakeman and released their first collaborative album, &quot;The Living Tree&quot;. In June 2011, Anderson released his fourteenth solo album &quot;Survival &amp; Other Stories&quot;. He invited people to submit music to him online and used them as the basis for the new material. In October 2011, Anderson released a single-track EP entitled &quot;Open&quot;, a 20-minute piece with a group of additional musicians including orchestral arrangements and a choir. In 2012, Anderson continued work on a sequel to &quot;Olias of Sunhillow&quot;. In January 2013, he announced that the project is named &quot;The Songs of Zamran: Son of Olias&quot;.

In 2013, Anderson performed solo shows worldwide, including Australia, North America, Europe, and Iceland, followed by a North and South American tour from February 2014. Later in 2014, a charity single featuring Anderson and Matt Malley entitled &quot;The Family Circle&quot; was released.

From 2014 to 2016, Anderson collaborated on a recording and touring project with violinist and composer Jean-Luc Ponty named Anderson Ponty Band. He announced the project in July 2014, with the intent on releasing an album of original songs and music the two had written in their own careers with new arrangements. Ponty stated: &quot;The idea is to keep our musical personalities and the original sounds, but the production will be more modern&quot;. The pair toured with a backing band from 2014 to 2016 and released a live album and DVD, &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot;.

During his time collaborating with Ponty, Anderson was also working on a studio album with Swedish guitarist and songwriter Roine Stolt. Their album &quot;Invention of Knowledge&quot; was released in 2016, and features various members of Stolt&#x27;s band the Flower Kings as additional musicians.
In January 2016, Anderson announced the formation of Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman, a new group formed together with Trevor Rabin and Rick Wakeman, with the intention to tour and record new material. They completed two concert tours and a live album release in September 2018. A studio album of new material was attempted but not completed. The group had disbanded by 2020.

In April 2017, Yes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Anderson sang &quot;Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; at the ceremony. Anderson released his solo album &quot;1000 Hands: Chapter One&quot; in March 2019. He had started it almost 30 years prior and named the album accordingly due to the many musicians that play on it, including Steve Howe, Jean-Luc Ponty, Chick Corea, and Billy Cobham. 

In December 2018, Anderson released a video for a new song, &quot;Love Is Everything&quot;, to promote &quot;1000 Hands&quot;, though it did not appear on the album.

On 30 June 2021, Anderson announced a Summer 2021 11-city tour of US theaters with the Paul Green Rock Academy that kicked off 30 July in Patchogue, New York, and wrapped up 20 August in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

Backed by The Band Geeks, Anderson toured in Spring 2023 under the title &quot;Yes Epics and Classics&quot; with a setlist devoted to early 1970s Yes material. About Yes, Anderson told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: He also expressed his wish for a Yes reunion and stated that he was feeling in a very creative mode all the time and that he had a lot of music due to come out over the coming five years as he was then finishing four projects.

=== 2024–present: &quot;True&quot;, &quot;Live - Perpetual Change&quot; and touring ===

The tour with The Band Geeks continued in spring/summer 2024 with the words &quot;and more&quot; appended to the tour title &quot;Yes Epics and Classics tour&quot;, and with new songs performed on the tour side-by-side with Yes material. 

Anderson confirmed in May 2024 the forthcoming release of a new 9-track solo album entitled &quot;True&quot;, recorded with The Band Geeks (with whom he had been touring America since 2023) and co-produced, engineered, and mixed by Band Geek bassist and musical director Richie Castellano. &quot;True&quot; was released on 23 August 2024 through Frontiers Records. The album contains some longer-form works, including the nine-minute &quot;Counties And Countries&quot; and the sixteen-minute &quot;Once Upon A Dream&quot;. It was preceded by two singles: &quot;Shine On&quot; which was released with an accompanying video on 13 June 2024 and &quot;True Messenger&quot; which was released with an accompanying video on 29 July 2024.

On 12 December 2024, it was announced that a live album entitled &quot;Live - Perpetual Change&quot; would be released on 14 March 2025 in various formats (CD/DVD, vinyl and Blu-ray). Composed entirely of tracks from Yes&#x27;s classic seventies era, it was recorded and filmed with The Band Geeks at the The Arcada Theater, St. Charles, Illinois in May 2023.

==Musical style==
It is a commonly held misconception that Anderson sings falsetto, a vocal technique which naturally produces high, airy notes by using only the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords; however, this is not the case. Anderson&#x27;s normal singing/speaking voice is naturally above the tenor range. In a 2008 interview with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Anderson stated, &quot;I&#x27;m an alto tenor and I can sing certain high notes, but I could never sing falsetto, so I go and hit them high.&quot;

According to Anderson&#x27;s web site, he is also responsible for most of the mystically themed lyrics and concepts which are part of many Yes releases. The lyrics are frequently inspired by various books Anderson has enjoyed, from Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; to Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Siddhartha&quot;. A footnote in Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; inspired an entire double album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973). Recurring themes include environmentalism, pacifism and sun worship.&quot; Anderson has said elsewhere that his lyrics are designed less with literary intent than to add tone and texture to the music, and his works often make use of assonances and emphasis on open vowels to this effect.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Anderson married Jennifer Baker on 22 December 1969; they divorced in 1995. They have three children: Deborah (born 1970), Damion (b. 1972) and Jade (b. 1980). Deborah is a photographer and sang on her father&#x27;s solo album &quot;Song of Seven&quot; (1980), &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot; (1989), and &quot;Angel Milk&quot; (2005) by the French electronica band Télépopmusik. Damion is a musician and spoke the final lines on the Yes song &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot; on &quot;Tormato&quot; (1978) when he was six years old. He released the EP &quot;Close to the Hype&quot; (1994) with his father. Jade&#x27;s birth is celebrated in her father&#x27;s song &quot;Animation&quot; on his album of the same name. She sang backing vocals on many of his later albums and released a solo album in Japan.

In 1997, Anderson married American Jane Luttenberger. Yes drummer Alan White was his best man at the ceremony. In 2009, Anderson became an American citizen.

His goddaughter was Ariane Forster, better known as Ari Up, lead singer of the Slits.

He is a supporter of Manchester United Football Club.

===Health and spirituality===
Anderson was a smoker in the 1960s and 1970s and once tried cocaine, but &quot;didn&#x27;t like it.&quot; He now lives a healthier lifestyle, particularly in his later life, with vitamin supplements and meditation. In the mid-1970s, Anderson became a vegetarian, as did most members of Yes; however, in an interview he stated, &quot;I was a veggie for a while, but again I grew out of that. But I do eat very healthy.&quot; In a 16 August 2006 interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Anderson said he eats meat, mostly fish, on occasion. In the interview, he also stated he had a spiritual adviser that &quot;helped him see into the fourth dimension&quot;. Before live performances, he often meditates in a tent with crystals and dreamcatchers, a practice he started in the 1980s. Anderson&#x27;s religious beliefs are syncretic and varied, including respect for the Divine Mother Audrey Kitagawa.

On 13 May 2008, Anderson suffered a severe asthma attack which required a stay in hospital. According to Yes&#x27; website, he was later &quot;at home and resting comfortably.&quot; Yes&#x27; planned summer 2008 tour was subsequently cancelled, with the press release saying, &quot;Jon Anderson was admitted to the hospital last month after suffering a severe asthma attack. He was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and was told by doctors to rest and not work for a period of at least six months.&quot; Further health problems continued through 2008, resulting in Yes permanently replacing Anderson with vocalists Benoît David (2009–2012) and Jon Davison (2012–present). In September 2008, Anderson wrote that he&#x27;s &quot;so much better...so grateful and so blessed...I look forward to 2009 for the &quot;Great Work&quot; to come.&quot; He started singing again in early 2009. He returned to touring (solo) that year, performing along with Peter Machajdík and an ensemble of Slovakian musicians on Tribute To Freedom, an event to commemorate the fall of the Iron Curtain in former Czechoslovakia at Devin Castle near Bratislava, Slovakia, and continued touring in 2010 and the autumn of 2011, with Rick Wakeman for a UK tour (2010) and the eastern US (2011).

<text>Stanisław I Leszczyński (; ; 20 October 1677 – 23 February 1766), also Anglicized and Latinized as Stanislaus I, was twice King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and at various times Prince of Deux-Ponts, Duke of Bar and Duke of Lorraine.

During the Great Northern War, multiple candidates had emerged after the death of John III Sobieski for the elective kingship of Poland (which also included the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as part of the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth). Backed by powerful neighbors in Russia and Austria, the Sejm elected Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony to succeed John III in 1697 as August II. Russia&#x27;s primary antagonist in the Great Northern War, Sweden had supported Stanisław Leszczyński for the throne, and after defeating a combined army of Saxon and Polish-Lithuanian forces, deposed August II and installed Leszczyński as Stanisław I in 1704.

In 1709, Charles XII of Sweden, Stanisław&#x27;s main supporter, suffered a defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Poltava, and was subsequently driven into exile in the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Augustus II returned to the throne, and while Charles served his exile in the Ottoman Empire, Stanisław accepted the rule of the tiny state of Palatine Zweibrücken, a small state of the Holy Roman Empire which was in personal union with Sweden and located near the region of Alsace. After Charles&#x27;s death in 1719, he moved to nearby Wissembourg in Alsace. In 1725, his daughter Marie Leszczyńska married Louis XV of France.

The death of Augustus II sparked the War of the Polish Succession in 1733. As had happened on the death of John III Sobieski, foreign intrigue and influence plagued the Sejm election. Despite the presence of Russian troops in the country, the Sejm, with support of the French, elected Stanisław to succeed Augustus II, while the Russians encouraged a group of break-away nobles to hold their own election, selecting instead Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, son of Augustus II, to the kingship. War broke out almost immediately, evolving into a proxy war between the Bourbon and Habsburg dynasties and their supporters, with the Bourbon faction led by France and Spain, with their allies Sardinia and Sweden, while the Habsburg faction was led by Austria and their allies Russia, Prussia, and Saxony. After two years of fighting across the entire continent, a ceasefire was declared in 1735. Stanislaus officially abdicated in January 1736, and the Peace of Vienna was promulgated in 1738, whereby Augustus III was officially recognized as King of Poland, and Stanisław was compensated for losing the throne a second time with the duchies of Bar and Lorraine, both of which were nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time.

While Duke of Lorraine, Stanisław lived out his remaining years at a country estate in Lunéville, and actively ruled Lorraine and Bar, sponsoring numerous public works projects. Nearby, Nancy, the historic capital of Lorraine, has a &quot;Place Stanislas&quot; (Stanisław Square) named in his honour, much of which was developed during his reign. He also took up political philosophy, engaging in discourse with other Enlightenment figures such as Jean Jacques Rousseau, and wrote philosophical treatises in his native Polish, making him a figure within the Polish Enlightenment. When he died in 1766, his titles passed to his son-in-law, Louis XV. His retaking of the Polish throne in 1733 formed the backdrop for &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;, an opera by composer Giuseppe Verdi and librettist Felice Romani, which premiered in 1840.

==Early life==
Born in Lwów (now Lviv) in 1677, he was the son of Rafał Leszczyński, voivode of Poznań Voivodeship, and Princess Anna Katarzyna Jabłonowska. He married Katarzyna Opalińska, by whom he had a daughter, Maria, who became Queen of France as wife of Louis XV. In 1697, as Cup-bearer of Poland, he signed the confirmation of the articles of election of Augustus II the Strong. In 1703 he joined the Lithuanian Confederation, which the Sapiehas with the aid of Sweden had formed against Augustus.

==King for the first time==

The following year, Stanisław was selected by Charles XII of Sweden after a successful Swedish invasion of Poland, to supersede Augustus II, who was hostile towards the Swedes. Leszczyński was a young man of blameless antecedents, respectable talents, and came from an ancient family, but certainly without sufficient force of character or political influence to sustain himself on so unstable a throne.

Nevertheless, with the assistance of a bribing fund and an army corps, the Swedes succeeded in procuring his election by a scratch assembly of half a dozen castellans and a few score of noblemen on 12 July 1704. A few months later, Stanisław was forced by a sudden inroad of Augustus II to seek refuge in the Swedish camp, but finally on 24 September 1705, he was crowned king with great splendor. Charles himself supplied his nominee with a new crown and scepter &quot;in lieu&quot; of the ancient Polish regalia, which had been carried off to Saxony by Augustus. During this time the king of Sweden sent Peter Estenberg to King Stanislaw to act as an ambassador and correspondence secretary. The Polish king&#x27;s first act was to cement an alliance with Charles XII whereby the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth engaged to assist Sweden against the Russian tsar. Stanisław did what he could to assist his patron. Thus, he induced Ivan Mazepa, the Cossack hetman, to desert Peter the Great at the most critical period of the Great Northern War between Russia and Sweden, and Stanisław placed a small army corps at the disposal of the Swedes and was beaten in Battle of Koniecpol. However, Stanisław depended so entirely on the success of Charles&#x27; arms that after the Battle of Poltava (1709), his authority vanished as a dream at the first touch of reality. Stanisław then resided in the town of Rydzyna.

==First loss of throne==
The vast majority of Poles hastened to repudiate Stanisław and make their peace with Augustus. Henceforth a mere pensioner of Charles XII, Stanisław accompanied Krassow&#x27;s army corps in its retreat to Swedish Pomerania. On the restoration of Augustus, Stanisław abdicated the Polish Crown (though he retained the royal title) in exchange for the little Principality of Palatine Zweibrücken. In 1716, an assassination was attempted by a Saxon officer, Lacroix, but Stanisław was saved by Stanisław Poniatowski (father of the future king Stanisław II August). Forced to leave Deux-Ponts in 1719 after the death of Charles XII in whose name he was Count Palatine, Stanisław Leszczyński then resided at Wissembourg in Alsace. In 1725, he had the satisfaction of seeing his daughter Maria become queen consort of Louis XV of France. From 1725 to 1733, Stanisław lived at the Château de Chambord.

==King for a second time==
 
Stanislaw&#x27;s son-in-law Louis XV supported his claims to the Polish throne after the death of Augustus II the Strong in 1733, which led to the War of the Polish Succession. On 11 September 1733, Stanisław himself arrived at Warsaw, having traveled night and day through central Europe disguised as a coachman. On the following day, despite many protests, Stanisław was duly elected King of Poland for the second time. However, Russia was opposed to any nominee of France and Sweden. Russia protested against his election at once, in favor of the new Elector of Saxony, son of the late king, as being the candidate of her Austrian ally.

On 30 June 1734, a Russian army of 20,000 under Peter Lacy, after proclaiming Frederick Augustus II of Saxony as king in Warsaw, proceeded to besiege Stanisław at Danzig, where he was entrenched with his partisans (including the Primate and the French and Swedish ministers) to await the relief that had been promised by France.

The siege began in October 1734. On 17 March 1735, Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich superseded Peter Lacy, and on 20 May 1735 the long-expected French fleet appeared and disembarked 2,400 men on Westerplatte. A week later, this little army gallantly attempted to force the Russian entrenchments, but was finally compelled to surrender. This was the first time that France and Russia had met as foes in the field. On 30 June 1735, Danzig capitulated unconditionally, after sustaining a siege of 135 days which cost the Russians 8,000 men.

Disguised as a peasant, Stanisław had contrived to escape two days before. He reappeared at Königsberg (where he briefly met the future King Frederick the Great of Prussia), whence he issued a manifesto to his partisans which resulted in the formation of a confederation on his behalf, and the despatch of a Polish envoy to Paris to urge France to invade Saxony with at least 40,000 men. In Ukraine too, Count Nicholas Potocki kept on foot to support Stanisław a motley host of 50,000 men, which was ultimately scattered by the Russians.

==Duke of Lorraine and of Bar==
On 26 January 1736, Stanisław again abdicated the throne but received in compensation the duchies of Lorraine and of Bar, which was to revert to France on his death. In 1738, he sold his estates of Rydzyna and Leszno to Count (later Prince) Alexander Joseph Sułkowski. He settled at Lunéville where he held court at the Château de Lunéville, which became a centre of the arts and culture, drawing a number of personalities of the enlightenment including Madame Émilie du Châtelet. In Nancy in 1750 he founded both the Académie de Stanislas and Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy, and devoted himself for the rest of his life to science and philanthropy, engaging most notably in controversy with Rousseau. He also published &quot;Głos wolny wolność ubezpieczający&quot;, one of the most important political treatises of the Polish Enlightenment. 

His court painter was André Joly.

==Death==

Stanisław was still alive when his great-great-granddaughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, was born in 1762. In his last years, his close friend, the Hungarian-born Marshal of France Ladislas Ignace de Bercheny lived on his estate to provide company.

Leszczyński died aged 88 in 1766 as a result of serious burns – his silk attire had caught fire from a spark while the King was asleep near the fireplace in his palace in Lunéville on 5 February. He was medically treated for several days but died of wounds on 23 February. He was the longest living Polish king.

Originally buried in the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy, following the French Revolution his remains were brought back to Poland and buried in the royal tomb of the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków.

==Children==

# Anna (25 May 1699 – 20 June 1717) died unmarried and childless.
# Maria (23 June 1703 – 24 June 1768) married Louis XV of France and had issue.
His wife also suffered many miscarriages.

==Ancestry==
==Play and opera==
Loosely based on an incident of King Stanisław&#x27;s life are the play &quot;Le faux Stanislas&quot; written by the Frenchman Alexandre Vincent Pineu-Duval in 1808, transformed into the opera &quot;Un giorno di regno, ossia Il finto Stanislao&quot; (&quot;A One-Day Reign, or The Pretend Stanislaus&quot;, but often translated into English as &quot;King for a Day&quot;) by Giuseppe Verdi, to an Italian libretto written in 1818 by Felice Romani.

<text>Second City Television, commonly shortened to SCTV and later known as SCTV Network and SCTV Channel, is a Canadian television sketch comedy show about a fictional television station that ran intermittently between 1976 and 1984. It was created as an offshoot from Toronto&#x27;s Second City troupe. It moved to American television, where it aired on NBC from 1981 to 1983.

== Premise ==
The show&#x27;s premise is the broadcast day of a fictitious TV station (later network) in the town of Melonville. Melonville&#x27;s location is left unspecified; the earliest episodes imply it is in Canada, but most later episodes place it in the U.S.

A typical episode of &quot;SCTV&quot; presents a compendium of programming seen on the station throughout its broadcast day. A given episode could contain SCTV news broadcasts, sitcoms, dramas, movies, talk shows, children&#x27;s shows, advertising send-ups hawking fictitious products, and game shows. Several &quot;shows&quot; are seen regularly on SCTV, including &quot;SCTV News&quot;; soap opera &quot;The Days of the Week&quot;; late-night movie features &quot;Monster Chiller Horror Theater&quot; and &quot;Dialing For Dollars&quot;; and &quot;Great White North&quot; (a show centered around two Canadian &#x27;hosers&#x27;), among others. Many other SCTV shows are seen only once, such as the game show &quot;Shoot at the Stars,&quot; in which celebrities are literally shot at like targets, or full-blown movie spoofs such as &quot;Play It Again, Bob,&quot; in which Woody Allen (Rick Moranis) tries to get Bob Hope (Dave Thomas) to star in his next film. Episodes also feature a range of SCTV-produced promotions (for imaginary future shows) and commercials, such as spots for &quot;Al Peck&#x27;s Used Fruit&quot; or &quot;Shower in a Briefcase&quot;, or a public service announcement that helpfully describes &quot;Seven Signs You May Already Be Dead&quot;.

Also seen fairly frequently, particularly in later episodes, are behind-the-scenes plots focusing on life at the station/network. These often feature Guy Caballero (Joe Flaherty), SCTV&#x27;s cheap, tyrannical owner and president who, despite being perfectly ambulatory, uses a wheelchair to earn &quot;respect&quot; (i.e., sympathy) from employees and viewers. Also seen regularly are weaselly, sweating station manager Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Green (Harold Ramis), succeeded in the position by flamboyant, leopard-skin clad, foul-mouthed Mrs. Edith Prickley (Andrea Martin); vain variety star Johnny LaRue (John Candy); washed-up entertainers such as singer Lola Heatherton (Catherine O&#x27;Hara) and comedian Bobby Bittman (Eugene Levy); news anchors Floyd Robertson (Flaherty) and Earl Camembert (Levy), talk-show host Sammy Maudlin (Flaherty), cult-stardom-destined and beer-addled brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie (Moranis and Thomas), and many others.

The small cast, typically six to eight members at any given time, play a wide variety of other station roles ranging from program hosts to commercial spokespersons. They also impersonate numerous popular celebrities appearing on the station&#x27;s programming.

== History ==
=== Show creation ===
There is much dispute as to who actually created the &quot;SCTV&quot; series. The show itself bears no &quot;created by&quot; credit, although it gives &quot;developed by&quot; credits to Bernard Sahlins and Andrew Alexander.

In 1974, Andrew Alexander bought the Canadian rights to &quot;The Second City&quot; for one dollar, and in 1976, he was the producer of Toronto&#x27;s stage show, and was looking to expand his company into TV. He called together the current cast of the stage show (including Candy, Flaherty, Thomas, and Levy) to discuss a format for a Second City TV series. Also in attendance at the meeting were Second City veterans Harold Ramis, Sheldon Patinkin, and Del Close, along with business partner Bernard Sahlins.

According to Dave Thomas&#x27;s account in &quot;SCTV: Behind The Scenes&quot;, various ideas were batted around, then — and here is where meeting attendees remember things differently — either Close or Patinkin came up with the idea of presenting programming from the world&#x27;s smallest TV station. The cast immediately jumped on the idea as a workable model for presenting a virtually unlimited range of characters, sketches, and ideas, while still having a central premise that tied everything together. From there, the actual content of the show (the characters, the situations, the Melonville setting, etc.) was all the work of the cast, with contributions from Alexander and Sahlins.

Alexander remained as producer and executive producer throughout SCTV&#x27;s run. Sahlins stayed for the first two seasons as a producer. Patinkin was a first-season writer and &quot;de facto&quot; editor and post-production supervisor. Close had no further involvement with the series.

=== Seasons 1 and 2: 1976–79 ===
&quot;SCTV&quot; was initially produced in 1976 at the studios of the Global Television Network in Toronto, then a small regional network of stations in southern Ontario. For the first six episodes, new episodes were seen once a month. For the next seven episodes (beginning in February 1977, and continuing through the spring of 1977) new episodes were increased in frequency to biweekly. In September 1977, Global ordered 13 additional episodes, which were seen once a week from September through December.

These irregularly scheduled 26 episodes (produced over a period of 15 months) were considered one &quot;season&quot; for syndication purposes. All of the original cast except Harold Ramis was from the Toronto branch of The Second City theatre improvisation troupe; Ramis was a Second City veteran, but with the Chicago troupe.

The original &quot;SCTV&quot; cast consisted of John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Harold Ramis, and Dave Thomas. All also served as writers on the show, although Martin and O&#x27;Hara did not receive writing credits on the first four episodes. Ramis served as &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s original head writer, but only appeared on-screen as a regular during the first season (spread out over two years) and in a few select episodes in the second season before his main character, station manager Moe Greene, was written out. Ramis and Flaherty also served as associate producers. Sahlins produced the show; Global staffer Milad Bessada produced and directed the first 13 episodes. George Bloomfield became director as of episode 14.

With the exception of Ramis, every cast member of SCTV worked as a regular performer on another Canadian TV show concurrently with the first year of SCTV. Several (Flaherty, Candy, Thomas, and Martin) also worked together as regulars on &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot;, which premiered the same week as &quot;SCTV&quot; on the Canada-wide CTV Television Network and in U.S. syndication. &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot; also featured future &quot;SCTV&quot; cast member Martin Short, but did not use any of the &quot;SCTV&quot; cast as writers. It folded after a single season. Martin, Flaherty, and Levy were also cast members of the short-lived comedy/variety series &quot;The Sunshine Hour&quot;, which finished its run less than a month before &quot;SCTV&quot; premiered (and while the first &quot;SCTV&quot; episode was being filmed).

During the first season, Levy was also doing double duty; in addition to his work on SCTV, he was also a cast member of the CBC sketch comedy series &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;, which aired weekly from October 1976 through January 1977. At the same time SCTV debuted, Candy and O&#x27;Hara became regular cast members of the CBC comedy series &quot;Coming Up Rosie&quot;. This gave Candy the distinction of appearing as a regular on &quot;three&quot; TV series simultaneously, on three different Canadian networks.

For the second season (1978–79), &quot;SCTV&quot; became a weekly series on Global, and was seen in syndication throughout Canada and parts of the United States. After episode three of the second season, Ramis was no longer in the cast, but continued to receive credit as the show&#x27;s head writer for most of the season.

=== Season 3: 1980–81 ===
In 1980, one year after the Toronto Global television station dropped SCTV due to high production costs, show producer Andrew Alexander negotiated a deal to produce SCTV at CITV facilities, with Edmonton, Alberta broadcaster Charles Allard, owner of the independent station CITV-TV and the Allarcom studios.

Candy, O&#x27;Hara, and Ramis dropped out at this point, and Dave Thomas was promoted to head writer. Added to the cast (and writing room) were Tony Rosato, Robin Duke, and Rick Moranis. Moranis, a friend of Dave Thomas, then known as a radio personality in Canada, was the only cast member not to have come from the ranks of The Second City. John Blanchard became the series director.

This season of the show was seen in Canada on the CBC, and in scattered U.S. markets in syndication.

=== Seasons 4 and 5: 1981–83 ===
In May 1981, NBC picked up &quot;SCTV&quot; in a 90-minute format as a presumably inexpensive replacement for the canceled Friday music/variety show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, enabling the show to air nationwide in the United States. This occurred mainly because that network had practically no time to prepare and develop a new American-produced program in the light of &quot;Midnight Special&quot; producer Dick Ebersol&#x27;s emergency return to &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; which he co-created with Lorne Michaels in 1975, in an effort to save it from cancellation, an effort that was successful. &quot;SCTV&quot; thus functioned as a solution to a serious scheduling bind for NBC, but, as things turned out, it was a temporary fix that only lasted two years.

Less than two months after season three ended, &quot;SCTV&quot; was back on the air for season four, airing first as &quot;SCTV Network 90&quot;, then as simply &quot;SCTV Network,&quot; late Friday nights (early Saturday mornings), airing at 12:30 a.m./11:30 p.m. Central. For this iteration, Rosato and Duke dropped out (ending up as cast members of &quot;SNL&quot; during its rebuilding years following Jean Doumanian&#x27;s stint as producer [see above]), and Candy and O&#x27;Hara returned. Because of the rush to generate material for the 90-minute format, several early season-four episodes consisted partially or entirely of sketches broadcast during seasons one to three. Ramis, Duke, and Rosato appeared in many of these sketches, uncredited and usually as extras or bit players (sketches in which they played a focal character were not featured in these repeats).

Season four (25 episodes) was broadcast irregularly from May 1981 to July 1982. Beginning in January 1982, production of the series returned to Toronto for the remainder of its run, ending the year-and-a-half stay in Edmonton.

Writer/performer Martin Short joined the cast at the end of season four, taping three episodes before O&#x27;Hara, Thomas, and Moranis left; one of those episodes was aired as the season-four finale in July 1982; the other two were held for the start of season five (14 episodes), which began in October 1982. For the remaining 12 episodes of season five, the cast of Candy, Flaherty, Levy, Martin, and Short was augmented by supporting players John Hemphill and Mary Charlotte Wilcox, neither of whom became an official cast member. Also, during season five, Ramis and O&#x27;Hara returned for one episode each as guest stars.

The last original &quot;SCTV&quot; episode for NBC was broadcast in March 1983, with reruns continuing through June. For both seasons four and five, the show continued to air on the CBC in Canada as only an hour in length, edited down from the 90-minute NBC broadcasts.

The 90-minute NBC episodes were released in a series of DVD sets in 2004 and 2005, and selected sketches are also available in 90-minute collections.

=== Season 6: 1983–84 ===
In the fall of 1983, NBC wanted the late Friday-night time slot for the new &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot;; &quot;SCTV,&quot; despite its unexpected popularity among younger U.S. audiences, was not a high priority with the network and essentially acted as a placeholder for two years while NBC reevaluated its late-night programming strategies. &quot;SCTV&quot; was offered a slot on early Sunday evenings by NBC (presumably 7 p.m./6 Central), but because the producers would have had to alter the show&#x27;s content to appeal to &quot;family&quot; audiences (per a 1975 amendment to the Prime Time Access Rule), as well as face CBS&#x27;s dominant &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (against which several NBC shows had failed since the 1981 cancellation of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;), they declined.

Instead, for its final season, the show moved to the premium cable channels Superchannel in Canada and Cinemax in the United States, changing the name slightly to &quot;SCTV Channel&quot;. The running time was now 45 minutes, and new episodes (18 in total) were seen on alternating weeks from November 1983 to July 1984. For this final season, the cast consisted solely of Flaherty, Levy, Martin, and Short, although Candy, Thomas, and O&#x27;Hara all made guest appearances. Writer/performers Hemphill and Wilcox once again appeared semi-regularly.

After the show went out of production, several &quot;SCTV&quot; characters continued to make appearances on Cinemax, with Flaherty reprising his roles as Count Floyd and Guy Caballero during free preview weekends in 1987 and 1988, and Bobby Bittman appearing in a standalone special chronicling his life and career under the &quot;Cinemax Comedy Experiment&quot; banner.

=== &quot;The Best of SCTV&quot; 1988 ===
On September 5, 1988, ABC aired a one-time special called &quot;The Best of SCTV&quot;. In the special, Flaherty and Martin returned as Caballero and Prickley. The two presented a look back at &quot;SCTV&quot; (using flashbacks) as they tried to convince the FCC to renew their license. A slightly different version aired in Canada, wherein the pair make their arguments to the CRTC; this necessitated a few changes to certain lines of dialogue and on-screen text, but the show content was otherwise identical. This special was ordered during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike and was not repeated.

=== Packaging into different lengths ===
The earliest three seasons, in Canada, were 30 minutes. NBC broadcast two seasons of 90-minute programs, including at the beginning material from the Canadian seasons. Some of these 90-minute shows were abbreviated to 60 minutes for the Canadian market. After the end of the NBC seasons, the material was repackaged into 30-minute shows.

==Reception==
&quot;SCTV&quot; received mostly positive reviews. Following the first episode, Margaret Daly of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote, &quot;Global TV may have just pulled off the comedy coup of this season ... the concept is as clever as the loony company members.&quot; During its first season, Dennis Braithwaite of the &quot;Star&quot; wrote that &quot;SCTV&quot; was &quot;delightfully funny and inventive&quot; and &quot;the best satire seen regularly on North American television. No, I haven&#x27;t forgotten NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.&quot; After it premiered on network TV in the US, &quot;Newsday&quot;&#x27;s Marvin Kitman wrote, &quot;The premiere episode was quite simply the most superb half hour comedy…in a long time.&quot; &quot;&quot;SCTV&quot; is witty, grown-up, inventive and uproariously funny,&quot; Gary Deeb wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

== Awards ==
During its network run on NBC, the show garnered 15 Emmy nominations (often with multiple episodes competing against each other).

In 1982, the episode &quot;Moral Majority&quot; won an Emmy Award for Writing for a Variety or Music Program. During Joe Flaherty&#x27;s acceptance speech, award presenter Milton Berle repeatedly interrupted with sarcastic retorts of &quot;That&#x27;s funny&quot;. Flaherty then turned to Berle and said, &quot;Sorry, Uncle Miltie...go to sleep&quot; (a parody of Berle&#x27;s famous closing line to children at the end of his &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; programs, &quot;Listen to your Uncle Miltie and go to bed&quot;). A flustered Berle simply replied, &quot;What?&quot; The incident became comedy fodder for &quot;SCTV&quot;, as the next season contained a bit where Flaherty beats up a Berle lookalike while shouting, &quot;You&#x27;ll never ruin another acceptance speech, Uncle Miltie!&quot;

In 1983, the episode &quot;Sweeps Week&quot; won the award again.

In 2002, &quot;SCTV&quot; was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

== Features ==
&quot;SCTV&quot; parody shows include a parody of the Western drama &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, &quot;retitled &quot;Grizzly Abrams&quot;, which depicts the burly wilderness hero as the owner of a wild tortoise that takes weeks to lead police to the skeletal remains of its master, trapped beneath a fallen log.

&quot;Battle of the PBS Stars&quot; is a parody of ABC television&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; athletic competitions that pitted performers against each other in running and swimming events. &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s version features a team of public television stars captained by William F. Buckley Jr. (played by Flaherty) vs. a team led by Carl Sagan (played by Thomas), with confrontations that include Fred Rogers of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; fame (played by Short) in a boxing match with chef Julia Child (played by Candy).

&quot;The People&#x27;s Global Golden Choice Awards&quot; sends up award shows in which the industry honours itself. Presenters include stars ranging from Elizabeth Taylor (played by O&#x27;Hara) to Jack Klugman (Flaherty) reading off the nominees in each category, with &quot;SCTV&quot; chief Guy Caballero secretly having conspired to guarantee that every award goes to his own network&#x27;s stars.

Some of &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s most memorable sketches involve parodies of low-budget late-night advertisements, such as &quot;Al Peck&#x27;s Used Fruit&quot; (enticing viewers to visit by offering free tickets to &quot;Circus Lupus&quot;, the Circus of the Wolves; mocked-up photos depict wolves forming a pyramid and jumping through flaming hoops). Equally memorable are the faux-inept ads for local businesses such as &quot;Phil&#x27;s Nails&quot;, &quot;Chet Vet the Dead Pet Remover&quot;, and &quot;Tex and Edna Boil&#x27;s Prairie Warehouse and Curio Emporium.&quot;

=== Sketches and characters ===
Popular sketches and recurring characters include:

* &quot;Mailbag&quot;, &quot;SCTV&quot;″s take on a &quot;vox populi&quot; segment where near-apoplectic host Bill Needle (Thomas) answers viewer mail. The show&#x27;s length is continually cut until Needle is down to mere seconds of airtime. Needle appears frequently in &quot;SCTV&quot; shows that were canceled after one episode.
* &quot;Farm Film Report&quot; or &quot;Farm Film Celebrity Blow-Up&quot;: Two hicks named Big Jim McBob (Flaherty) and Billy Sol Hurok (Candy) (a spoof of Billie Sol Estes and Sol Hurok) interview celebrities and ultimately encourage them to blow up (creating the catch-phrase &quot;blow&#x27;d up good, blow&#x27;d up &quot;real&quot; good!&quot;). Exploding guests include Dustin Hoffman, David Steinberg (both played by Short), Bernadette Peters (Martin), Meryl Streep, Brooke Shields ( both played by O&#x27;Hara), and a lispy Neil Sedaka (Levy).
* &quot;Polynesiantown&quot; is a parody of modern-day film noir. In its attempt to emulate the movie &quot;Chinatown&quot;, this extended one-shot sketch ends with a crane shot that pushes the show so over budget that the sketch&#x27;s producers get in trouble with the network. The show&#x27;s writers incorporate this behind-the-scenes drama into the show&#x27;s long-term continuity, sending the career of actor/producer/superstar Johnny LaRue (Candy) into a tailspin as a result of this budget mishap.
* &quot;The Sammy Maudlin Show&quot;: Flaherty is the Afro-coiffed, knee-slapping, overly effusive host welcoming a panel of &quot;stars&quot; who do nothing but heap lavish praise on each other and applaud their pointless profundities. The sketch originated as a parody of Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s short-lived talk show &quot;Sammy and Company&quot;. John Candy played the Ed McMahon-style sidekick/sycophant William B. Williams, named for the actual sidekick on &quot;Sammy and Company&quot;, radio personality William B. Williams. Eugene Levy portrayed egomaniacal funnyman Bobby Bittman, with his repeated catchphrase &quot;How are ya?&quot;. Bittman&#x27;s younger brother, Skip Bittman, played by Moranis, eventually appeared on &quot;Maudlin&quot;, as well. Andrea Martin parodied Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft with &quot;real terrific&quot; combo-character Lorna Minnelli; Catherine O&#x27;Hara also portrayed a character that combined two personalities, Lola Heatherton, based on Joey Heatherton and Lola Falana.
* &quot;The Days of the Week&quot; is a soap-opera spoof, with the continuing saga of terminally ill rock star Clay Collins (Moranis) trying to marry slutty fiancée Sue Ellen Alison (O&#x27;Hara) in the few days left to him by his tactless doctor Elliot Sabian (Levy). A second plot hatched by corrupt doctor Wainwright (Candy) has small-time criminal Rocco (Flaherty) conning the wealthy Violet McKay (O&#x27;Hara) into accepting him as her long-lost son Billy, though Rocco is so inept that he mistakes Mojo the maid (Martin) for his mother. A third story has the suave swindler Harrington (Thomas) trying to seduce the suicidally depressed May Matlock (Martin) out of the land she owns. It is the only recurring segment throughout the series without a laugh track. The title is a parody of the title of one of the most famous soap operas, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.
* &quot;Mel&#x27;s Rock Pile&quot; is a knockoff of the Citytv dance show &quot;Boogie&quot; and closely resembles &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;. It is hosted by &quot;Rockin&#x27; Mel&quot; Slirrup (Levy), a nervous, bespectacled nerd who plays lame pop songs for surly in-studio teen guests. One memorable episode of &quot;Mel&#x27;s Rock Pile&quot; features an appearance by Sex Pistols-type band &quot;The Queen Haters&quot;, featuring the entire Short-era cast in perfect &#x27;80s punk-band mode. Another features Thomas as Richard Harris, performing &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; live in the studio, complete with lengthy instrumental breaks. As Harris dances jerkily behind the microphone and his backing vocalist sits reading a book, Mel awkwardly tries to fill the otherwise-idle time in various ways such as talking with spectators and sending the show to a commercial. Once the song finally ends, a spectator throws a brick at Harris and hits him in the chest.
* Martin Short&#x27;s Jackie Rogers Jr. is an earnestly smarmy albino Las Vegas headliner with a grating, lisping laugh in a manner similar to Sammy Davis Jr. Rogers is partial to sequinned jumpsuits, Jack Jones-style song standards, and &quot;eligible ladies&quot;. Later, Rogers runs for political office, but drops out of the race when he realizes it is cramping his showbiz lifestyle. His father, Jackie Rogers Sr., (also played by Short) was a vaudeville star who fell on hard times after a child welfare officer took away the children he used in his act (including his own son). After his agent finds him boxing and urges him to get back into singing, Rogers Sr. sets up a comeback special called &quot;Jackie Rogers Sr.: Swinging With Nature&quot;. Unfortunately, Rogers Sr. died when a cougar attacked him during one of his musical numbers. Jackie Rogers Jr., like Ed Grimley, was later seen on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when Short was hired there as a cast member.
* Short&#x27;s somewhat unclassifiable uber-nerd Ed Grimley (later featured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when Short became a regular) is an SCTV fixture, appearing on numerous assorted shows, commercials, promos, and &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; dramas. His hair is styled using an upside-down funnel, and he plays the triangle, for which he took lessons. Grimley has an obsession with the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and host Pat Sajak. The &quot;SNL&quot; version of the character is the same, except the sketches have Grimley getting involved in weird situations: meeting a perpetually unlucky man (played by Ringo Starr), being targeted by the Devil (played by Jon Lovitz), and having a near-death experience where his guardian angel (played by special guest host Chevy Chase) will not let him go to Heaven because he needs to get a life. As of 2012, Grimley is the only &quot;SNL&quot; and &quot;SCTV&quot; character to have his own children&#x27;s cartoon show: &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot; from 1988.
* &quot;Half-Wits&quot; and &quot;High-Q&quot; are parodies of quiz shows &quot;College Bowl&quot; and &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; hosted by a highly irritable Alex Trebek approximation named Alex Trebel (Levy). Over a decade later, Levy gave Norm Macdonald permission to borrow the basic premise for the &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; Will Ferrell likewise played an irritable, exasperated Trebek.
* &quot;The 5 Neat Guys&quot;, an absurdly clean-cut, &#x27;50s-style vocal group (&quot;à la&quot; The Four Freshmen), are portrayed by Candy, Flaherty (as the drunk one), Levy, Moranis, and Thomas. The &quot;5&quot; sing songs such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Hickey on My Shoulder&quot;, &quot;Pimples and Pockmarks&quot;, and other unmemorable tunes. Several of their songs contrast with their squeaky-clean image, however, such as &quot;She Does It&quot;, &quot;Nancy Has the Largest Breasts in Town&quot;, and &quot;Who Made the Egg Salad Sandwiches?&quot;.
*Connie Franklin is a caricature of Connie Francis portrayed by Andrea Martin. Franklin appears on the &quot;Sammy Maudlin Show&quot; and also in a parody of mail-order record commercials. Her songs are universally depressing; one contains the lyrics, &quot;I&#x27;m losing my hearing, I&#x27;ve lost sight in one eye. I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t hear you, did you really say goodbye?&quot;
* Another Martin Short character, talk-show host Brock Linehan, is a parody of real-life Canadian interviewer Brian Linehan. Linehan was famous for his meticulous interview preparation, often uncovering details that even his interview guests had forgotten about, which Short satirizes by going in the opposite direction. On &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s version of the Linehan show, called &quot;Stars in One&quot;, all the research compiled about any particular episode&#x27;s guest is totally wrong, making for unhappy guests and a frustrated, uneasy host.
* Harry, the Guy with the Snake on his Face (Candy), runs Melonville&#x27;s adult book and X-rated video stores.
* &quot;Video deejay&quot; Gerry Todd (Moranis) hosts an all-night &quot;televised-radio&quot; type of video show. Moranis&#x27;s turtleneck-sporting, smooth-talking, radio-personality parody, complete with casually pronounced &quot;vuddeeo&quot;, presages the first group of MTV VJs.
* Mayor Tommy Shanks (Candy) is Melonville&#x27;s &quot;easygoing&quot; (i.e., corrupt) mayor, a man prone to sudden fits of rage and physical violence who still gives regular fireside chats on &quot;SCTV&quot;, while feeding treats to a stuffed dog that sits motionless by his side. Throwing out one &quot;non sequitur&quot; after another, Shanks manages to convey absolutely nothing of relevance during his broadcasts. Eventually, he succumbs to mental illness and is institutionalized. While still in the institution, he runs for reelection with the campaign slogan &quot;Get me outta here!&quot; and wins by a landslide. Some sources erroneously claim the character is named after Edmonton jazz musician (and future senator) Tommy Banks, but the character antedates &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s move to Edmonton by two years (first being referenced in the Toronto-shot episode 2.8 &quot;The Mirthmakers/Happy Endings&quot;, aired 4 November 1978) and does not resemble Banks.
* &quot;SCTV News&quot; (later &quot;Nightline Melonville&quot;), anchored by Flaherty as mostly professional (but alcoholic) newscaster Floyd Robertson and Levy as geeky, clueless Earl Camembert, a model of oblivious self-importance. The members of the SCTV news team are named after Canadian news anchors Lloyd Robertson and Earl Cameron, respectively, but otherwise bear no resemblance to their real-life counterparts (Camembert was in fact based on American newsman Irv Weinstein). Unlike the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; news parody &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, which typically uses actual news headlines as setups for more satirical humour, &quot;SCTV News&quot; uses more absurdist humour, with news stories often focusing on events in Melonville. Another source of humour for this segment is the contrast between the hapless Camembert (whose name is inexplicably pronounced &quot;Canenbare&quot;) and the more respected Robertson, who usually ends up playing straight man to Camembert&#x27;s antics. A running gag involves the news team&#x27;s tendency to give the hard news items to Robertson (such as the latest earthquake to hit the tiny nation of Togoland) and the trivial or poorly prepared stories to his co-anchor (such as a fire at a doily factory).
* &quot;Monster Chiller Horror Theatre&quot;: This fright-film showcase is hosted by Flaherty&#x27;s character Count Floyd — a &quot;vampire&quot; who mysteriously howls like a wolf. Floyd is unable to pick genuinely scary movies, and at times has to introduce movies he has never seen, about whose content he has no clue. The show features laughably non-frightening Z movies like &quot;Dr. Tongue&#x27;s 3-D House of Stewardesses&quot;, &quot;3-D House of Beef&quot;, and &quot;Tip O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 3-D House of Representatives&quot;; 3-D movies are burlesqued. Many of the movies feature &quot;mad scientist&quot; Dr. Tongue (Candy) and his hunchback assistant Bruno, played by Woody Tobias Jr. (Levy). As revealed in his first appearance, Count Floyd is actually &quot;SCTV News&quot; anchorman Floyd Robertson working a second job. This character note was then ignored for several years before being picked up again as a plot thread toward the end of the show&#x27;s run. Floyd&#x27;s double duty is a comic homage to the early days of television, where the kiddie-show hosts at smaller TV stations were often members of the local news staff in costume.
* &quot;Mrs. Falbo&#x27;s Tiny Town&quot; is an educational television show parody. Wanda Falbo (Martin) talks to the children viewers about different things as her visit to Melonville Maximum Security Prison and even introduced the kids to G. Gordon Liddy (Thomas). She is assisted by Mr. Messenger (Candy). Wanda Falbo was later featured in segments of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1989 to 2000, where she worked as the Word Fairy.
* The Shmenge Brothers (Candy and Levy) are the leaders of a polka band from the fictional Eastern European country of Leutonia, called The Happy Wanderers. Based upon Czechoslovakian-born, Edmonton-based polka cable show host Gaby Haas, the Shmenges appear during seasons three and four. Like Bob and Doug McKenzie, the Shmenges were breakout characters and their popularity resulted in the HBO special &quot;The Last Polka&quot; (a parody of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;). In one episode, the Shmenges perform a memorable tribute to composer John Williams. The band&#x27;s name is based on the Friedrich-Wilhelm Möller song &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;, which is frequently performed by polka artists. The hosts make a point of thanking the hostesses, in each episode, for the cabbage rolls and coffee provided. Later, Candy played another polka clarinetist in &quot;Home Alone&quot;, which also starred O&#x27;Hara.
* Harvey K-Tel is portrayed by Thomas. K-Tel, a parody of rapid-fire, mail-order commercial announcers, speaks in a rapid patter both on and off the air. The character&#x27;s name is derived both from Canadian mail-order commercial company K-tel and actor Harvey Keitel.
* The famous CCCP1-Russian television episode has SCTV taken over by Soviet programming. At first, nothing seems out of the ordinary at the station; on the air, Levy plays Perry Como in a promo for &quot;Still Alive&quot;, a TV special in which Como&#x27;s trademark relaxed style is taken to ludicrous extremes as the singer performs most of the disco-inspired set lying down (at one point performing &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; curled up in bed). Then, after &quot;The Great White North&quot;, and during a live broadcast of &quot;Caesar&quot; featuring Bobby Bittman, SCTV experiences a broadcast signal intrusion as a Soviet propaganda channel&#x27;s signal overtakes SCTV&#x27;s. The station calls itself &quot;three-C-P-one&quot;, referring to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is abbreviated USSR in English, but CCCP in Cyrillic. The &quot;shows&quot; are Russian-themed spoofs: &quot;Tibor&#x27;s Tractor&quot;, a situation comedy about a talking tractor similar to &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;—only with the voice of Nikita Khrushchev; a game show, &quot;What Fits into Russia?&quot;, in which the host mocks other countries by comparing them to USSR&#x27;s massive size; &quot;Upo-Scrabblenyk&quot;, a crossword game show where ridiculously long words are considered abbreviations; and &quot;Hey, Giorgy&quot;, a sitcom about &quot;everybody&#x27;s favorite Cossack&quot; modeled on the Canadian TV series &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, with the memorable line &quot;Uzbeks drank my battery fluid!&quot;, uttered when Moranis&#x27;s Lada will not start outside an alehouse. (Popping the hood reveals the old-style battery&#x27;s six cells sporting bendy straws.) The CCCP1 episode is shot with a &quot;new Soviet mini-cam&quot;, a massive electronic device the size of a small car that has to be dragged around by three technicians, and burns up early in the show. The piece makes it clear on several occasions that CCCP&#x27;s enemy is the Uzbeks, a reflection of the Soviet Union&#x27;s ongoing struggle with Uzbek nationalism. At one point, Guy Caballero attempts to get parent network NBC to address the intrusion, only for Fred Silverman to inquire if the Soviet programs are ratings hits.
* A &quot;Jazz Singer&quot; parody reverses the story by having musical guest Al Jarreau play a popular jazz singer who wants to become a cantor (&quot;hazzan&quot;). His father is a disapproving pop-music impresario played by Levy&#x27;s befuddled Sid Dithers. Dithers, four feet tall and cross-eyed behind Coke-bottle glasses, speaks with a thick early vaudeville-style Yiddish accent (&quot;San Fransishky? So how did you came: did you drove, or did you flew?&quot;). The payoff of this parody makes for a classic SCTV moment: Jarreau has become a synagogue cantor, fulfilling his dream against his father&#x27;s wishes, and he wonders if his father will ever speak to him again, until, during the service, he is interrupted by a disco-clad Dithers standing in the doorway in dancing shoes, spangled jacket, and corn-rowed hair.
* &quot;Tex &amp; Edna Boil&#x27;s Organ Emporium&quot; (or &quot;Prairie Warehouse and Curio Emporium&quot;) is a series of parodies of local car-dealer TV ads with Tex and Edna (Thomas and Martin) imploring viewers to &quot;Come on down!&quot; to buy their wares.
* &quot;Thursday Night Live&quot; is an atrociously low-budget ripoff of &quot;Fridays&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; created by Guy Caballero, who wants to go hip by making this show. It is a long collage of uncontrollable laughter and hooting from the rowdy audience, and many unconvincing samplings of profanity and corny drug jokes. The guest host is Earl Camembert, who during the monologue, does a bad impression of Steve Martin, saying, &quot;Well, I beg your pardon!&quot;
* &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; is a satire of the 1974 Irwin Allen film, with each cast member playing multiple roles, trying to escape &quot;the world&#x27;s thinnest, tallest building&quot; after it catches on fire. Martin is at this point the only female cast member, so they are forced to use doubles when two women appear in the same shot. As Dr. Tongue, Candy actually says, &quot;You take the Edith Prickley double and I&#x27;ll take the other girl and get out of here&quot;, acknowledging the fake as a wink to the audience. Also a nuclear reactor is on the top of the building, with a spinning restaurant above it.
* &quot;Doorway to Hell&quot; with &quot;Lin Ye Tang&quot; (Dave Thomas) is a program similar to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

=== Bob and Doug McKenzie ===

Ironically, the most popular sketch in the program&#x27;s eight-year history was intended as throw-away filler. Bob and Doug McKenzie, the dim-witted, beer-chugging, and back bacon-eating brothers in a recurring Canadian-themed sketch called &quot;Great White North&quot;, were initially developed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as a sardonic response to the CBC network&#x27;s request that the show feature two minutes of &quot;identifiably Canadian content&quot; in every episode. The two-minute length reflects the fact that American shows were two minutes shorter than Canadian ones (to allow more commercials), leaving two minutes needing content for the Canadian market. The Bob and Doug McKenzie segments first appeared in 1980 at the start of season three and continued in every episode until Thomas and Moranis left the series.

The characters ultimately became icons of the very Canadian culture they parodied, spinning off albums, a feature film (&quot;Strange Brew&quot;), commercials, and numerous TV and film cameos. Bob and Doug helped popularize the stereotypical Canadian trait of adding &quot;eh&quot; to the end of sentences, a facet of Canadian life often gently ridiculed in American shows featuring Canadian characters. Lines from the sketch, such as &quot;Take off, you hoser!&quot;, became part of North American popular culture. Thomas later revealed in his 1996 book &quot;SCTV: Behind the Scenes&quot; that the other members of the cast grew envious and bitter at the immense financial and popular success of the Bob and Doug McKenzie albums, ultimately leading to Thomas and Moranis leaving the show in 1982. Flaherty and Candy accused Thomas of using his position as head writer to increase the visibility of Bob and Doug, though the original segments were largely unscripted. An &quot;SCTV&quot; episode even poked fun at the duo&#x27;s popularity. Guy Caballero declared that they had become SCTV&#x27;s top celebrities, supplanting Johnny LaRue. This led to the pair being given a Bob and Doug &quot;special&quot; with Tony Bennett as their guest, which wound up being a disaster.

Moranis and Thomas recreated Bob and Doug in the form of a pair of moose in the animated feature &quot;Brother Bear&quot; from Disney. During Canadian rock band Rush&#x27;s 2007 Snakes And Arrows tour, Moranis and Thomas reprised their Bob and Doug Mackenzie roles in an introductory clip projected on the rear screen for the song &quot;The Larger Bowl&quot;. Previously, Rush used Flaherty as Count Floyd to introduce their song &quot;The Weapon&quot; during their 1984 &quot;Grace Under Pressure Tour&quot;. Rush vocalist Geddy Lee sang the chorus on the hit single &quot;Take Off&quot; from the 1982 Mercury Records album &quot;The Great White North&quot; by Bob and Doug McKenzie. On March 27, 1982, &quot;Take Off&quot; reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is the highest-charting single of Lee&#x27;s career; Lee was an elementary-school classmate of Moranis as a child.

=== Special guests and musical guests ===
Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson were the show&#x27;s first guest stars.

The show&#x27;s NBC years brought with them a network edict to include musical guests (in part because of their use on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which NBC executives considered the model for &quot;SCTV&quot;, despite their being very different shows). At first, the &quot;SCTV&quot; cast, writers, and producers resisted special guests, on the theory that famous people wouldn&#x27;t just &quot;drop into&quot; the Melonville studios, but they soon discovered that by working these guests into different shows-within-shows they could keep the premise going while also giving guest stars something more to do than show up and sing a song.

As a result, Dr. John became a featured player in the movie &quot;Polynesiantown&quot;, John Mellencamp (at the time, known as John Cougar) was Mister Hyde to Ed Grimley&#x27;s Doctor Jekyll in &quot;The Nutty Lab Assistant&quot;, Natalie Cole was transformed into a zombie by a glowing cabbage in &quot;Zontar&quot;, and the Boomtown Rats were both blown up on &quot;Farm Film Celebrity Blow Up&quot; and starred in the &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; parody &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;. James Ingram appeared on &quot;3-D House of Beef&quot;, and violinist Eugene Fodor in &quot;New York Rhapsody&quot;. Hall &amp; Oates appeared on a &quot;Sammy Maudlin Show&quot; segment promoting a new film called &quot;Chariots of Eggs&quot;, a parody of both &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;Personal Best&quot;, and showed scenes from the faux movie as clips. Canadian singer-songwriter Ian Thomas (the real-life brother of cast member Dave Thomas) was the &quot;topic&quot; on a &quot;Great White North&quot; sketch. Carl Perkins, Jimmy Buffett, Joe Walsh, The Tubes, and Plasmatics also appeared on the &quot;Fishin&#x27; Musician&quot;, hosted by Gil Fisher (Candy).

This, along with &quot;SCTV&quot;&#x27;s cult status, led to the show&#x27;s celebrity fans clamouring to appear. Tony Bennett credited his appearance on Bob and Doug McKenzie&#x27;s variety-show debacle &quot;The Great White North Palace&quot; for triggering a significant career comeback. Carol Burnett did an ad for the show in which an alarm clock goes off next to her bed, she rises up suddenly and advises those who couldn&#x27;t stay up late enough (the NBC version aired from 12:30 to 2 a.m.) to go to bed, get some sleep, then wake up to watch the show. Burnett later briefly appeared in a climactic courtroom episode of &quot;The Days of the Week&quot;.

Former Chicago Second City player, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member, and film actor Bill Murray also guest-starred on a &quot;Days of the Week&quot; installment as a photography buff scrambling to make it to the wedding of singer-songwriter Clay Collins (Rick Moranis) and town slut Sue-Ellen Allison (Catherine O&#x27;Hara) in time to take pictures of the event. In the same episode, he played two other roles: Johnny LaRue&#x27;s biggest fan, who is subsequently hired to be LaRue&#x27;s bodyguard (and who pushes his homemade LaRue T-shirts whenever possible), and Joe DiMaggio in a commercial for DiMaggio&#x27;s restaurant, where he offered a free meal to anyone who could strike him out. (The strikeout challenges then took place in the middle of the dining room, with many patrons injured by speeding baseballs.)

Robin Williams guest-starred in a sketch called &quot;Bowery Boys in the Band&quot; in which his Leo Gorcey-like character tries to hide a gay lifestyle from his Huntz Hall-inspired pal (played by Short). Williams also mimicked actor John Houseman eloquently reading the Melonville telephone book.

In a rare acting role, singer Crystal Gayle guest-starred in a January 1983 episode in the sketch &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, a spoof of the 1976 film version of the movie, playing an up-and-coming singer trying to make it big under the tutelage of her boyfriend and mentor Kris Kristofferson (played by Flaherty).

Canadian actors, including Jayne Eastwood, Dara Forward, Monica Parker, and Peter Wildman, appeared on the show occasionally as guests. Catherine O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s sister, singer-songwriter Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, also appeared in a bit part in the episode &quot;Broads Behind Bars&quot;. William B. Davis, still a decade away from his signature role as The X-Files&#x27; &quot;Smoking Man&quot;, also has a bit role in one 1983 episode.

=== Laugh track ===
The laugh track used in early episodes was recorded using audience reactions during live performances in the Second City theatre.

== Syndication and music rights ==
SCTV had a 90-minute format, unique for a dramatic or comedy series, but more common on talk shows. Such shows are typically hard to fit into an ordinary commercial television schedule, and the market was limited. The original 90-minute shows were never rebroadcast in their entirety.

Instead, in 1984, after production on the series ended, the &quot;Second City Television&quot; syndicated half-hour episodes and &quot;SCTV Network&quot; 90-minute episodes were reedited into half-hour shows by Blair Entertainment (formerly Rhodes Productions, which distributed &quot;SCTV&quot; in the U.S. during its original run) for a revised syndicated package, which consisted of 156 reedited half-hours. In 1990, a separate package of 26 half-hours (edited from the pay-TV &quot;SCTV Channel&quot; episodes) aired on The Comedy Channel (and later Comedy Central) in the United States. Like the original syndicated series, the U.S. and Canadian versions of the 1984 package differed, with the Canadian half-hours a couple of minutes longer; the running order of episodes also differed between the two countries. By the late 1990s, the reedited &quot;SCTV Channel&quot; episodes were added to the regular SCTV syndicated package; three additional half-hours (all from the 1980–1981 season) were restored to the package, knocking the episode count up to 185 half-hours. By this time, distribution rights had passed to WIC Entertainment, which bought Allarcom in the late 1980s (WIC also distributed &quot;SCTV&quot; in the U.S. after Blair Entertainment shut down in 1992); distribution subsequently passed to Fireworks Entertainment after its then-parent company, CanWest, purchased WIC&#x27;s television stations and production/distribution assets in 1999.

The syndication package was picked up by NBC following the cancellation of its late-night talk show &quot;Later&quot; on January 18, 2001, but to retain continuity with the latter, it was aired with an introduction voiced by &quot;Friday Night&quot; and occasional &quot;Later&quot; substitute host Rita Sever and was known as &quot;Later Presents: SCTV&quot;. It aired until &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; took over the time slot on January 4, 2002, from Monday to Thursday; &quot;Late Friday&quot; (which also had a title change the same week &quot;SCTV&quot; was picked up) aired on Fridays. Once again, as had been the case during the 1981–83 run, &quot;SCTV&quot; amounted to placeholding schedule filler.

For years, &quot;SCTV&quot; was unavailable on videotape or DVD (apart from one compilation, &quot;The Best of John Candy on SCTV&quot;), or in any form except these reedited half-hour programs. Due to difficulty obtaining music rights for DVD releases, Shout! Factory edited music in certain sketches or even left out sketches like &quot;Stairways to Heaven.&quot; Dave Thomas acknowledged: &quot;We were true guerrilla TV in that when we wanted background music we just lifted it from wherever we wanted. Consequently, today, to release the shows on home video, it would cost millions to clear the music.&quot;

==Home media==
Sony Music Entertainment has released some of &quot;SCTV&quot; on DVD in Region 1. All episodes from Season 4 and 5 (which aired on NBC) have been released in 4 volumes, and a &quot;best-of&quot; DVD features episodes from Seasons 2 and 3.

Other Releases
* &quot;Christmas with SCTV&quot;: Released October 4, 2005 (Two Christmas-themed episodes from 1981 and 1982)
* &quot;SCTV – Best of The Early Years&quot;: Released October 24, 2006 (15 selected episodes from Seasons 2 and 3)

== Stage reunions ==
On May 5 and 6, 2008 most of the cast reunited for a charity event, &#x27;The Benefit of Laughter&#x27;, at the Second City Theatre in Toronto. Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Andrea Martin, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Robin Duke, and Joe Flaherty took part; Dave Thomas reportedly bowed out due to illness. The event was a fundraiser for The Alumni Fund, which helps support former Second City cast and crew members facing health or financial difficulties. The performances have not been released.

In 2017, several members of the troupe, alongside members of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, performed at a benefit show for Spinal Cord Injury Ontario, after Jake Thomas, the son of Dave Thomas&#x27;s brother Ian, was injured in a snowmobiling accident.

== &quot;SCTV Golden Classics&quot; 2010 ==
To honor the 50th anniversary of The Second City, SCTV Golden Classics aired nationwide in the United States on public television stations beginning March 2010 featuring some memorable sketches from the comedy television series.

== Film ==
Although &quot;SCTV&quot; was never directly adapted as a film, the characters of Bob and Doug McKenzie, popularized on the series, were featured in their own film, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Strange Brew&quot;. A sequel was planned in the late 1990s but never produced.

== Reunion special ==

In April 2018, Netflix announced that Martin Scorsese would direct an original comedy special exploring the legacy of the show. In May 2018, it was announced the special would be titled &quot;An Afternoon with SCTV&quot; and air on CTV in Canada and Netflix worldwide.

, the reunion special still has not aired, seemingly due to Scorsese&#x27;s many commitments.

<text>Air Force One is the official air traffic control-designated call sign for a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the president of the United States. The term is commonly used to denote U.S. Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president, and as a metonym for the primary presidential aircraft, VC-25, although it can be used to refer to any Air Force aircraft the president travels on.

The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the president arose during World War II when military advisors in the War Department were concerned about the risk of using commercial airlines for presidential travel. In 1944, a C-54 Skymaster was converted for use as the first purpose-built presidential aircraft. Dubbed the &quot;Sacred Cow&quot; and operated by the Army Air Force, it carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman.

The &quot;Air Force One&quot; call sign was created in 1954, after a Lockheed Constellation carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same flight number. Since the introduction of &quot;SAM 26000&quot; in 1962, the primary presidential aircraft has carried the distinctive livery designed by Raymond Loewy.

Other aircraft designated as Air Force One have included another Lockheed Constellation, &quot;Columbine III;&quot; three Boeing 707s, introduced in the 1960s and 1970s; and the current Boeing VC-25As. Since 1990, the presidential fleet has consisted of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B (VC-25A) aircraft. The USAF has ordered two Boeing 747-8s to serve as the next presidential aircraft, designated VC-25Bs and expected to enter service no earlier than 2026.

From time to time, presidents have invited other world leaders to travel with them on Air Force One. In 1973, President Nixon invited Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev to fly with him to California from Washington, D.C. In 1983, President Reagan and Queen Elizabeth II toured the U.S. West Coast aboard the aircraft. In 2012, President Obama took British Prime Minister David Cameron to a basketball game in Ohio.

==History==
===20th century===
On 11 October 1910, Theodore Roosevelt became the first US president to fly in an aircraft, an early Wright Flyer from Kinloch Field near St. Louis, Missouri. He was no longer in office at the time, having been succeeded by William Howard Taft. The record-making occasion was a brief overflight of the crowd at a county fair but was nonetheless the beginning of presidential air travel.

====First presidential aircraft====


Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to fly in an aircraft while in office. The first aircraft obtained specifically for presidential travel was a Douglas Dolphin amphibian modified with luxury upholstery for four passengers and a small separate sleeping compartment. Designated RD-2 by the US Navy, it was delivered in 1933 and based at the naval base at Anacostia in Washington, D.C. The aircraft remained in service as a presidential transport from 1939.

During World War II, German submarines operating in the Atlantic Ocean made air travel the preferred method of VIP transatlantic transportation. In 1943, Roosevelt traveled to the Casablanca Conference in Morocco on the &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;, a Pan Am-crewed Boeing 314 flying boat, on a flight that covered 5,500 miles (8,890 km) in three legs.

Concerned about relying upon commercial airlines to transport the president, officials of the United States Army Air Forces, the predecessor of the US Air Force, ordered the conversion of a military aircraft to accommodate the special needs of the commander-in-chief. In 1943, a C-87A transport, number 41-24159, was modified to carry President Franklin D. Roosevelt on international trips. But after a review of the C-87&#x27;s controversial safety record, the Secret Service flatly refused to approve the aircraft for presidential carriage. The C-87, a derivative of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber, also carried more militaristic associations than aircraft designed for transport. The aircraft, named &quot;Guess Where II,&quot; was used to transport senior members of the Roosevelt administration on various trips. In March 1944, it flew Eleanor Roosevelt on a goodwill tour of several Latin American countries. The C-87 was scrapped in 1945.

The Secret Service subsequently reconfigured a Douglas C-54 Skymaster for presidential transport duty. The VC-54C aircraft, nicknamed the &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;, included a sleeping area, radiotelephone, and retractable battery-powered elevator to lift Roosevelt in his wheelchair. The VC-54C flew President Roosevelt only once, to the Yalta Conference in February 1945.

The National Security Act of 1947, the legislation that created the US Air Force, was signed by President Harry S. Truman aboard the VC-54C. He replaced the VC-54C in 1947 with a modified C-118 Liftmaster, calling it the &quot;Independence&quot; after his Missouri hometown. It was given a distinctive exterior, as its nose was painted like the head of a bald eagle. The plane included a stateroom in the aft fuselage and a main cabin that could seat 24 passengers or could be made up into 12 sleeper berths. It is now housed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

Eisenhower introduced four propeller-driven aircraft to presidential service. This group included two Lockheed C-121 Constellations: aircraft &quot;Columbine II&quot; (VC-121A 48-610) and &quot;Columbine III&quot; (VC-121E 53-7885). They were named by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower for the columbine, official state flower of her adopted home state of Colorado. Two Aero Commanders were also added to the fleet.

&quot;Columbine II&quot; is the first plane to bear the call sign Air Force One, it was Lockheed Constellation configured for VIP travel and replaced an earlier Constellation called &quot;Columbine.&quot; This designation for the US Air Force aircraft carrying the incumbent president was established after a 1954 incident in which a commercial flight, Eastern Air Lines 8610, crossed paths with Air Force 8610, which was carrying President Eisenhower. Initially used informally, the designation became official in 1962.

====Boeing 707s and entry to jet age====
Toward the end of Eisenhower&#x27;s second term, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles commented that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and other senior Soviet officials had begun using the technologically advanced Tupolev Tu-114 aircraft for their travels, and it was no longer dignified for the president to fly in a propeller-driven aircraft. This paved the way for the Air Force&#x27;s initial procurement of three Boeing 707-120 (VC-137A) jet aircraft, designated &quot;SAM (Special Air Missions) 970, 971&quot; and &quot;972&quot;.

The high-speed jet technology built into these aircraft enabled presidents from Eisenhower through Nixon to travel long distances more quickly for face-to-face meetings with world leaders. Then-Vice President Richard Nixon first used a VC-137A on his visit to Russia in July 1959 for the Kitchen Debates. The following month, Eisenhower became the first president to fly via jet airplane when he used &quot;SAM 970&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Queenie&quot;, to meet German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. During Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;Flight to Peace&quot; goodwill tour in December 1959, he visited 11 Asian nations, flying in 19 days, twice as fast as he could have covered that distance in one of the &quot;Columbines&quot;.

&quot;SAM 970&quot; to &quot;SAM 972&quot; would be removed from the presidential role with the early-1960s arrival of the specially built VC-137C designated &quot;SAM 26000&quot;. The older planes would be repainted in the Loewy secondary livery designed for Air Force Two and other non-presidential VIP aircraft. &quot;SAM 970&quot; is now on display at The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. &quot;SAM 971&quot;, best remembered for returning the Americans held during the Iran hostage crisis in 1981, is on display at the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona. &quot;SAM 972&quot; was scrapped in October 1996.

====Loewy&#x27;s livery design====

The new VC-137C was not yet modified for presidential service when John F. Kennedy took office in 1961. On the recommendation of his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, he contacted the French-born American industrial designer Raymond Loewy for help in designing new livery and interiors for the VC-137C.

Loewy, who had seen &quot;SAM 970&quot;, complained to a friend in the White House that it &quot;had a garish orange nose and looked too much like a military plane&quot;, Air Force One historian and former Smithsonian curator Von Hardesty told CNN. He offered Kennedy his design consultation services free of charge.

Kennedy chose a red-and-gold design from one of Loewy&#x27;s initial concept sketches, and asked him to render the design all in blue. Loewy also drew inspiration from the first printed copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, suggesting the widely spaced and upper case &quot;United States of America&quot; legend in Caslon typeface. He chose to expose the polished aluminum fuselage on the bottom side and used two blues, steel blue associated with the early republic and the presidency, and a more contemporary water blue to represent an America both rooted in the past and flying inexorably into the future. The presidential seal was added to both sides of the fuselage near the nose and a large American flag was painted on the tail. Loewy&#x27;s work won immediate praise from the president and the press. The cheatline suggested a sleek and horizontal image that mirrored America&#x27;s Jet Age optimism and prosperity of the era, and today signifies its legacy and tradition.

Loewy&#x27;s VC-137C livery was adapted for the larger VC-25A when it entered service in 1990, and the secondary variation (without the darker blue cheatline and cap over the cockpit) is still in use on USAF C-40, C-37, C-32, and C-20 aircraft in standard (non-presidential) VIP configurations. The presidential paint scheme can also be seen on Union Pacific 4141, the locomotive used in George H. W. Bush&#x27;s funeral train.

====SAM 26000====

Under John F. Kennedy, presidential air travel entered the jet age. Although he could use the Eisenhower-era jets for trips to Canada, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom, when he came into office, his primary aircraft domestically was still a prop powered Douglas VC-118A Liftmaster. In October 1962, the modified long-range Boeing VC-137C Stratoliner &quot;SAM 26000&quot;, featuring livery designed by Loewy would be delivered, and immediately became an important element of the Kennedy administration&#x27;s brand.

&quot;SAM 26000&quot; was in service from 1962 to 1998, serving Presidents Kennedy to Clinton. On 22 November 1963, &quot;SAM 26000&quot; carried President Kennedy to Dallas, Texas, where it served as the backdrop as the Kennedys greeted well-wishers at Dallas&#x27;s Love Field. Later that afternoon, Kennedy was assassinated, and Vice President Lyndon Johnson assumed the office of president. He took the oath of office aboard &quot;SAM 26000&quot; before departing to Washington, D.C. Later, in January 1973, &quot;SAM 26000&quot; took Johnson&#x27;s body home to Texas after his state funeral in Washington.

Johnson used &quot;SAM 26000&quot; to travel extensively domestically and to visit troops in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. &quot;SAM 26000&quot; served President Nixon on several groundbreaking overseas voyages, including his famous visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in February 1972 and his trip to the Soviet Union later that year, both firsts for an American president. Nixon dubbed the plane the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; in honor of the forthcoming bicentennial of the United States; that logo was painted on both sides of the plane&#x27;s nose.

====SAM 27000====

SAM 26000 was replaced in December 1972 by another VC-137C, &quot;Special Air Mission 27000&quot;, although SAM 26000 was relegated to non-presidential VIP status (and repainted without the darker blue cap and cheatline), it served as a backup to &quot;SAM 27000&quot; until it was finally retired in 1998.

In June 1974, while President Nixon was on his way to a scheduled stop in Syria, Syrian fighter jets intercepted Air Force One to act as escorts. The crew was not informed in advance, so took evasive action including a dive.

After announcing his intention to resign the presidency, Nixon boarded &quot;SAM 27000&quot; (with call sign &quot;Air Force One&quot;) to travel to California. Colonel Ralph Albertazzie, then pilot of Air Force One, recounted that after Gerald Ford was sworn in as president, the plane had to be redesignated as &quot;SAM 27000&quot;, indicating no president was on board the aircraft. Over Jefferson City, Missouri, Albertazzie radioed: &quot;Kansas City, this was Air Force One. Will you change our call sign to Sierra Alpha Mike (SAM) 27000?&quot; Back came the reply: &quot;Roger, Sierra Alpha Mike 27000. Good luck to the President.&quot;

====Boeing VC-25A====

Though Ronald Reagan&#x27;s two terms as president saw no major changes to Air Force One, the manufacture of the presidential aircraft version of the 747 began during his presidency. The USAF issued a Request For Proposal in 1985 for two wide-body aircraft with a minimum of three engines and an unrefueled range of 6,000 miles (9,700 km). Boeing with the 747 and McDonnell Douglas with the DC-10 submitted proposals, and the Reagan Administration ordered two identical 747s to replace the aging 707 VC-137 variants he used. The interior designs, drawn up by First Lady Nancy Reagan, were reminiscent of the American Southwest.

===21st century===

When President George W. Bush left office in January 2009, he flew to Texas in a VC-25 that used call sign SAM 28000, as it did not carry the current president of the United States. Similar arrangements were made for former presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. President Donald Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago estate aboard Air Force One on the final day of his first presidency in January 2021.

After the deaths of former Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, VC-25 aircraft flew their remains to their home states of Michigan and California, respectively.

On 27 April 2009, a low-flying VC-25 circled New York City for a photo-op and training exercise, alarming many New Yorkers.

During Joe Biden&#x27;s 2023 visit to Ukraine, the Air Force One call sign was not used for the C-32 aircraft he flew to Poland; to increase secrecy, the call sign was &quot;SAM060&quot;.

====Logistical support====
When flying with the President, Air Force One rarely flies alone. It is often accompanied by a fleet of aircraft that can include the back-up VC-25, cargo aircraft, and tankers. In such cases, up to half a dozen cargo aircraft, such as the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III or the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, precede AF1 by a couple days or more, bringing the presidential limousine and Sikorsky VH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, along with Secret Service personnel and several hundred maintenance crew. Longer trips are accompanied by tankers, such as the McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender, to limit the need to stop for fuel and ensure that AF1 does not take fuel from an unvetted source.

The support aircraft will often use several airports in a region to minimize the impact to one particular airport, and Secret Service may also preposition a Gulfstream C-37B or Boeing E-4 in a neighboring region for backup.

In addition to the President, staff, and flight crew, a VC-25A can carry 102 guests in typical domestic business-class seats. The back-up VC-25 typically flies with 14 crew, two pilots, six flight crew, two cooks, and four flight attendants. When transporting the President, the primary VC-25A has three cooks and 15 flight attendants, 20 or more Secret Service agents, and some 40 members of the presidential press pool. During international state visits, another aircraft may be chartered to accommodate another 150 or more journalists and security personnel.

====11 September attacks====

On 11 September 2001, George W. Bush was interrupted as he attended an event at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, after an airplane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. He took off on a VC-25 from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport piloted by Colonel Mark Tillman, the senior pilot of Air Force One that day.

Some time later, air traffic controllers warned Tillman that a passenger jet was nearby and not responding to radio calls. Tillman recalls: &quot;As we got over Gainesville, Florida, we got the word from Jacksonville Center. They said, &#x27;Air Force One you have traffic behind you and basically above you that is descending into you, we are not in contact with them – they have shut their responder off.&#x27; And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point. We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorists were at that point.&quot; Tillman then flew Air Force One over the Gulf of Mexico in order, he later said, to test whether the other aircraft would follow. The other jet continued on its route, and Tillman said that it was later explained to him that an airliner had lost its transponder, which normally broadcasts an electronic identification signal, and that the pilots on board neglected to switch to another radio frequency.

Later, Tillman received a warning of an imminent attack on Air Force One. &quot;We got word from the vice president and the staff that &#x27;Angel was next,&#x27; indicating the classified call sign for Air Force One. Once we got into the Gulf [of Mexico] and they passed to us that &#x27;Angel was next,&#x27; at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us.&quot; At this point, Tillman said that the plan to fly the president back to Washington, D.C., was aborted due to concerns that Air Force One would be attacked at Andrews Air Force Base. Instead, Tillman landed at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, where the president made a speech. After these stops, the president was returned to Washington, D.C.

The next day, officials at the White House and the Justice Department explained that President Bush did this because there was &quot;specific and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were also intended targets&quot;. The White House could not confirm evidence of a threat to Air Force One, and investigation found the original claim to be a result of miscommunication.

==Planned replacement==
===VC-25B===

The VC-25As are to be replaced as the cost of maintaining the aging systems on their 30-year-old airframes and less efficient GE-CF6 engines has begun to surpass the cost of acquiring a new aircraft. On 28 January 2015, the Air Force announced that the Boeing 747-8 would be the next presidential aircraft. The US Government Accountability Office estimated the total cost at $3.2 billion, and the US Air Force&#x27;s budget for the program is projected to be nearly $4 billion. In December 2016, Boeing was on contract for preliminary development worth $170 million (~$ in ). 

During his first presidency, Donald Trump renegotiated aspects of the contract with Boeing, and threatened to cancel the program if the overall cost exceeded $4 billion. In an effort to cut costs, the Air Force contracted to purchase two completed but undelivered Transaero 747-8 intercontinental aircraft from Boeing in 2017.

The following year, Boeing struck a deal with Trump to adorn the new planes with a &quot;patriotic color scheme&quot; featuring a deep red stripe down the middle of the aircraft and a dark blue underbelly. Plagued by multiple delays, and the rising cost of the aircraft, this color scheme was scrapped, and a modernized version of the classic &quot;Air Force One&quot; design was made public in March 2023. The first VC-25B is scheduled to be delivered in 2027, while the second will come the following year.

===Supersonic aircraft===
In September 2020, the US Air Force announced several Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate contracts signed with aircraft manufacturers to begin development of a supersonic aircraft that could function as Air Force One. Contracts have been signed with Exosonic, Hermeus, and Boom.

==Other presidential aircraft==
During the Johnson Administration, the United States Air Force acquired a Beechcraft King Air B90 which was designated VC-6A (66-7943). The aircraft was used to transport President Johnson between Bergstrom Air Force Base and his family ranch near Johnson City, Texas, and was used at least once to transport the President to Princeton, New Jersey. It was referred to as &quot;Lady Bird&#x27;s airplane&quot; and later in its service life featured a basic color scheme similar to civilian aircraft. When the President was aboard, the aircraft used the call sign Air Force One.

United Airlines is the only commercial airline to have operated &quot;Executive One&quot;, the call sign given to a civilian flight on which the US president is aboard. On 26 December 1973, President Richard Nixon and his family flew as commercial passengers on a United DC-10 from Washington Dulles to Los Angeles International Airport. His staff explained that this was done to conserve fuel by not having to fly the usual Boeing 707 Air Force aircraft.
In November 1999, President Bill Clinton flew from Ankara, Turkey, to Cengiz Topel Naval Air Station outside Izmit, Turkey, aboard a marked C-20C (Gulfstream III) using the call sign &quot;Air Force One&quot;, escorted by three F-16s.

On 8 March 2000, President Clinton flew to Pakistan aboard an unmarked Gulfstream III while another aircraft with the call sign &quot;Air Force One&quot; flew on the same route a few minutes later. This diversion was reported by several US press outlets.

On 1 May 2003, President George W. Bush flew in the co-pilot seat of a Sea Control Squadron Thirty-Five (VS-35) S-3B Viking from Naval Air Station North Island, California to the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; off the California coast, where Bush delivered his &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; speech. During the flight, the aircraft used the call sign of &quot;Navy One&quot; for the first time. This aircraft is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

Barack Obama used the Gulfstream C-37 variant on a personal trip in 2009 to visit the production of August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot; in New York.

Several Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIs typically accompany the president whenever he travels, carrying the presidential limousines and other support vehicles, and have been rumored to have discreetly transported presidents and vice presidents in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan without using the &quot;Air Force One&quot; call sign.
Since 1998, the president has occasionally flown aboard an Air Force C-32, a narrow-body jet based on the Boeing 757 airliner. The Air Force bought four C-32s in 1996 to fly the president to airports whose runways were too small to accommodate the larger VC-25, or as emergency backup. Today, these aircraft are used to fly vice presidents and other senior officials. The C-32 has also been used by Presidents when use of the VC-25 could present operational risks. For example in 2023 when President Biden traveled to Ukraine via Poland using the C-32 to avoid the publicity of the VC-25.

In the 2010s, the Air Force acquired a second set of four 757s for presidential transport, assigning them tail numbers 90015, 90016, 90017, and 90018. Service officials do not acknowledge that these aircraft exist, although they are routinely photographed in presidential service.

Vice presidents have used a VC-25 on longer trips, using the &quot;Air Force Two&quot; call sign.

The president regularly flies in helicopters (call sign Marine One) operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.

==Aircraft on display==

A Lockheed JetStar used by Lyndon Johnson during his presidency is on display at the LBJ Ranch (now the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park) in Stonewall, Texas. The ranch&#x27;s runway was too small to accommodate the Boeing 707, so President Johnson would fly it to Bergstrom AFB in Austin, then transfer to the smaller JetStar for the short flight to the ranch. Another JetStar used during the Johnson presidency is on display at the Hill Aerospace Museum which uncovered presidential markings on the plane while stripping the paint for restoration.

A McDonnell Douglas VC-9C used by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton is on display at Castle Air Museum in Atwater, California, next to the former Castle Air Force Base. Another VC-9C has been at Air Mobility Command Museum in Dover, Delaware, since 2011.

VC-137B &quot;SAM 970&quot;, used from 1959 to 1962 as Air Force One and until 1996 in the presidential fleet, is on display at The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

==In popular culture==

A fictionalized version of Air Force One is depicted in the 1997 feature film &quot;Air Force One&quot;. The cabin was built to scale and is as accurate as the production designers could possibly make it. &quot;There weren’t any blueprints or floor plans available, so we had to watch CNN to see what the inside looked like,&quot; said the film’s director Wolfgang Petersen.

<doc id="148483" wikidata="Q133040" url="?curid=148483" title="Alberto Fujimori">
<text>Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto (26 July 1938 – 11 September 2024) was a Peruvian politician, professor, engineer, who served as the 54th president of the Republic of Peru from 1990 to 2000. Born in Lima, Fujimori was the country&#x27;s first president of Japanese descent, and was as an agronomist and university rector before entering politics. 

Fujimori emerged as a politician during the midst of the Internal conflict in Peru, the Peruvian Lost Decade, and the ensuing violence caused by the far-left gurella group Shining Path. During his presidential tenureship, Fujimori implemented a series of military reforms and responded to the Shining Path with repressive and lethal force, successfully halting the group&#x27;s actions. Fujimori&#x27;s neoliberal political ideology of Fujimorism, and his economic policy rescued Peru&#x27;s economy and transformed its governance in the midst of its internal conflict. 

In 1992, during his first presidential term, Fujimori, with the support of the National Intelligence Service and the Peruvian Armed Forces adopted Plan Verde and carried out a self-coup against the Peruvian legislature and judiciary. Fujimori dissolved the Peruvian congress and supreme court, effectively making him a de-facto dictator of Peru. The coup was criticized by Peruvian politicians, intellectuals and journalists, but was well received by the country&#x27;s private business sector and a substantial part of the public. Following the coup d&#x27;état, Fujimori drafted a new constitution in 1993, which was approved in a referendum, and was elected as president for a second term in 1995 and controversially for a third term in 2000. 

Fujimori&#x27;s tenurship is marked by severe authoritarian measures, excessive use of propaganda, entrenched political corruption, multiple cases of extrajudicial killings, and human rights violations. Under the provisions of Plan Verde, Fujimori targeted members of Peru&#x27;s indigenous community and subjected them to forced sterilizations. 

In 2000 following his third term election, Fujimori was facing mounting allegations of widespread corruption and crimes against humanity, in his government. Subsequently Fujimori fled to Japan, where he submitted his presidential resignation via fax. Peru&#x27;s congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting to remove him from office on the grounds that he was &quot;permanently morally disabled.&quot; While in Japan, Peru issued multiple criminal charges against him, stemming from the corruption and human rights abuses that occurred during his government. Peru requested Fujimori&#x27;s extradition from Japan, which was refused by the Japanese government due to Fujimori being a Japanese citizen, and Japanese laws stipulating against extraditing its citizens. In 2005, while Fujimori was visiting Santiago, Chile, he was arrested by the Carabineros de Chile by the request of Peru, and extradited to Lima to face charges in 2007. 

Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison, but was pardoned by president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017, and was offically released in December 2023.

==Early life, education, and career==
Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto was born on July 26, 1938 in the Miraflores district of Lima, Peru to Japanese parents Naoichi Fujimori (né Minami) and Mutsue Inomoto. His parents were originally from Kumamoto Prefecture and immigrated to Peru in 1934 Fujimori&#x27;s parents were Buddhists, but he was baptized and raised Catholic. Aside from Spanish, he also spoke Japanese, the primary language in his childhood home.

Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Señora de la Merced and La Rectora School. In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La Gran Unidad Escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima. Fujimori pursued his undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1957, graduating first in his class in 1961 with a degree in agricultural engineering. He briefly lectured in mathematics at the university before moving to France to study in physics at the University of Strasbourg. In 1969, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee through a Ford Foundation scholarship.

In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the National Agrarian University offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the A position that he held twice. He also hosted a TV show called &quot;Concertando&quot; from 1988 to 1989, on Peru&#x27;s state-owned network, Canal 7.

=== Birthplace disputation ===
In July 1997, the news magazine &quot;Caretas&quot; alleged that Fujimori was born in Japan, in his father&#x27;s hometown of Kawachi, Kumamoto Prefecture. Because the Constitution of Peru requires the president to have been born in Peru, this would have made Fujimori ineligible to be president. The magazine, which had been sued for libel by Vladimiro Montesinos seven years earlier, reported that Fujimori&#x27;s birth and baptismal certificates might have been altered. &quot;Caretas&quot; also alleged that Fujimori&#x27;s mother declared having two children when she entered Peru; Fujimori was the second of four children. &quot;Caretas″s&quot; contentions were hotly contested in the Peruvian media; the magazine &quot;Sí&quot; described the allegations as &quot;pathetic&quot; and &quot;a dark page for [Peruvian] journalism&quot;. Latin American scholars Cynthia McClintock and Fabián Vallas note that the issue appeared to have died down among Peruvians after the Japanese government announced in 2000 that &quot;Fujimori&#x27;s parents had registered his birth in the Japanese Embassy in Lima&quot;. The Japanese government determined that he was also a Japanese citizen because of his parents&#x27; registration in the koseki.

==Presidency (1990–2000)==

=== First term ===
==== 1990 general election ====

During the first presidency of Alan García, the economy had entered a period of hyperinflation and the political system was in crisis due to the country&#x27;s internal conflict, leaving Peru in &quot;economic and political chaos&quot;. The armed forces grew frustrated with the inability of the García administration to handle the nation&#x27;s crises and began to draft &quot;Plan Verde&quot; as a plan to overthrow his government. According to Rospigliosi, lawyer and friend of Fujimori, Vladimiro Montesinos was not initially involved with the &quot;Plan Verde&quot;, but his ability to resolve issues for the military resulted with the armed forces tasking Montesinos with implementing the plan with Fujimori, Both General and Montesinos were responsible for the relationship between the armed forces and Fujimori. Mario Vargas Llosa, Fujimori&#x27;s final opponent in the election, later reported that United States Ambassador to Peru, Anthony C. E. Quainton, personally told him that allegedly leaked documents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) purportedly being supportive of Fujimori&#x27;s candidacy were authentic. Rendón writes that the United States supported Fujimori because of his relationship with Montesinos, who had previously been charged with spying on the Peruvian military for the CIA.

During the second round of elections, Fujimori originally received support from left-wing groups and those close to the García government, exploiting the popular distrust of the existing Peruvian political establishment and the uncertainty about the proposed neoliberal economic reforms of his opponent, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa. Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a dark horse candidate under the banner of Cambio 90 defeating Vargas Llosa in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president Alan García and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party (APRA).

During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed &quot;&quot;el chino&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;the Chinese guy&quot; or &quot;the Chinaman&quot;; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called &quot;chino&quot; in Peru, as elsewhere in Spanish-speaking Latin America, both derogatorily and affectionately. Although he was of Japanese heritage, Fujimori suggested that he was always pleased by the nickname, which he perceived as a term of affection. With his election victory, he became the third person of East Asian descent to serve as presidency of a South American state, after President Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henk Chin A Sen of Suriname.

==== Economic shock ====
According to news magazine &quot;Oiga&quot;, the armed forces finalized plans on 18 June 1990 involving multiple scenarios for a coup d&#x27;état to be executed on 27 July 1990, the day prior to Fujimori&#x27;s inauguration. The magazine noted that in one of the scenarios, titled &quot;Negotiation and agreement with Fujimori. Bases of negotiation: concept of directed Democracy and Market Economy&quot;, Fujimori was to be directed on accepting the military&#x27;s plan at least 24 hours before his inauguration. Fernando Rospigliosi states &quot;an understanding was established between Fujimori, Montesinos and some of the military officers&quot; involved in the &quot;Plan Verde&quot; prior to Fujimori&#x27;s inauguration. Montesinos and SIN officials ultimately assumed the armed forces&#x27; position in the plan, placing SIN operatives into military leadership roles. Fujimori went on to adopt many of the policies outlined in the &quot;Plan Verde&quot;. Fujimori was sworn in as president on 28 July 1990, allegedly his 52nd birthday.

After taking office, Fujimori abandoned the economic platform he promoted during his campaign, adopting more aggressive neoliberal policies than those espoused by Vargas Llosa, his opponent in the election. During his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as the &quot;Fujishock&quot;. It was Fujimori&#x27;s stated objective to pacify the nation and restore economic balance. This program bore little resemblance to his campaign platform and was in fact more drastic than anything Vargas Llosa had proposed. Hernando de Soto, the founder of one of the first neoliberal organizations in Latin America, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), began to receive assistance from the U.S. government under Ronald Reagan, with the National Endowment for Democracy&#x27;s Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) providing his ILD with funding and education for advertising campaigns. Between 1988 and 1995, de Soto and the ILD were mainly responsible for some four hundred initiatives, laws, and regulations that led to significant changes in Peru&#x27;s economic system. Under Fujimori, de Soto served as &quot;the President&#x27;s personal representative&quot;, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing de Soto as an &quot;overseas salesman&quot; for Fujimori in 1990, writing that he had represented the government when meeting with creditors and United States representatives. Others dubbed de Soto as the &quot;informal president&quot; for Fujimori. De Soto proved to be influential to Fujimori, who began to repeat de Soto&#x27;s advocacy for deregulating the Peruvian economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was content with Peru&#x27;s measures, and guaranteed loan funding for Peru. Inflation rapidly began to fall and foreign investment capital flooded in.
Nonetheless, the &quot;Fujishock&quot; restored Peru to the global economy, though not without immediate social cost; international business participated in crony capitalism with the government. The privatization campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country&#x27;s troubled currency, the inti, with the nuevo sol. Fujimori&#x27;s initiative relaxed private sector price controls, drastically reduced government subsidies and government employment, eliminated all exchange controls, and also reduced restrictions on investment, imports, and capital. Tariffs were radically simplified, the minimum wage was immediately quadrupled, and the government established a US$400 million poverty relief fund. The latter seemed to anticipate the economic agony to come: the price of electricity quintupled, water prices rose eightfold, and gasoline prices 3,000%.

==== Military regime ====
During Fujimori&#x27;s first term in office, APRA, Vargas Llosa&#x27;s party, and the Democratic Front remained in control of both chambers of Congress—then composed of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate—hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty combating the Shining Path due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, the Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; in the same poll, the president&#x27;s approval stood at 42%.

Fujimori and his military handlers had planned for a coup during his preceding two years in office. In response to the political deadlock, Fujimori, with the support of the military, carried out a self-coup on 5 April 1992, Congress was shut down by the military, the constitution was suspended and the judiciary was dissolved. Without political obstacles, the military was able to implement the objectives outlined in Plan Verde while Fujimori served as president to project an image that Peru was supporting a liberal democracy. Vladimiro Montesinos would go on to adopt the actual function of Peru&#x27;s government.

The coup was well received by the public, with Fujimori&#x27;s approval rating jumping significantly in the wake of the coup. Fujimori often cited this public support in defending the coup, which he characterized as &quot;not a negation of real democracy, but on the contrary... a search for an authentic transformation to assure a legitimate and effective democracy&quot;. Fujimori believed that Peruvian democracy had been nothing more than &quot;a deceptive formality—a façade&quot;. He claimed the coup was necessary to break with the deeply entrenched special interests that were hindering him from rescuing Peru from the chaotic state in which García had left it.

Fujimori&#x27;s coup was immediately met with near-unanimous condemnation from the international community. The Organization of American States (OAS) denounced the coup and demanded a return to &quot;representative democracy&quot;, despite Fujimori&#x27;s claim that the coup represented a &quot;popular uprising&quot;. Foreign ministers of OAS member states reiterated this condemnation of the &quot;autogolpe&quot;. They proposed an urgent effort to promote the reestablishment of &quot;the democratic institutional order&quot; in Peru. Negotiations between the OAS, the government, and opposition groups initially led Fujimori to propose a referendum to ratify the auto-coup, but the OAS rejected this. Fujimori then proposed scheduling elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), which would draft a new constitution to be ratified by a national referendum. Despite a lack of consensus among political forces in Peru regarding this proposal, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; OAS meeting of ministers nevertheless endorsed this scenario in mid-May. Elections for the Democratic Constituent Congress were held on 22 November 1992.

Various states individually condemned the coup. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations, and Argentina withdrew its ambassador. Chile joined Argentina in requesting Peru&#x27;s suspension from the Organization of American States. International lenders delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States, Germany, and Spain suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Peru. Fujimori, in turn, later received most of the participants of the November 1992 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt as political asylees, who had fled to Peru after its failure.

Peru–United States relations earlier in Fujimori&#x27;s presidency had been dominated by questions of coca eradication and Fujimori&#x27;s initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military&#x27;s eradication efforts in the lowlands. Fujimori&#x27;s &quot;autogolpe&quot; became a major obstacle to relations, as the United States immediately suspended all military and economic aid, with exceptions for counter-narcotic and humanitarian funds. Two weeks after the self-coup, the George H. W. Bush administration changed its position and officially recognized Fujimori as the legitimate leader of Peru, partly because he was willing to implement economic austerity measures, but also because of his adamant opposition to the Shining Path.

On 13 November 1992, General attempted to overthrow Fujimori in a failed military coup. Salinas asserted that his intentions were to turn Fujimori over to be tried for violating the constitution.

=== Second term ===

The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His main opponent, former UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, won only 21 percent of the vote. Fujimori&#x27;s supporters won comfortable majority in the new unicameral Congress. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the military and police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.

During his second term, Fujimori and Ecuadorian President Sixto Durán Ballén signed a peace agreement over a border dispute that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some issues with Chile, Peru&#x27;s southern neighbor, which had been unresolved since the 1929 Treaty of Lima.

The 1995 election was the turning point in Fujimori&#x27;s career. Peruvians began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press. Before he was sworn in for a second term, he stripped two universities of their autonomy and reshuffled the national electoral board. This led his opponents to call him &quot;Chinochet&quot;, a reference to his previous nickname and to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Modeling his rule after Pinochet, Fujimori reportedly enjoyed this nickname.

According to a poll by the Peruvian Research and Marketing Company conducted in 1997, 40.6% of Lima residents considered President Fujimori an authoritarian.

In addition to the fate of democracy under Fujimori, Peruvians were becoming increasingly interested in the myriad allegations of criminality that involved Fujimori and his chief of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), Vladimiro Montesinos. Using SIN, Fujimori gained control of the majority of the armed forces, with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; stating that &quot;[i]n no other country in Latin America did a president have so much control over the armed forces&quot;.

A 2002 report by Health Minister Fernando Carbone later suggested that Fujimori was involved in the forced sterilizations of up to 300,000 indigenous women between 1996 and 2000, as part of a population control program. A 2004 World Bank publication said that in this period Montesinos&#x27;s abuse of the power Fujimori granted him &quot;led to a steady and systematic undermining of the rule of law&quot;.

===Third term, flight to Japan and resignation===
By the arrival of the new millennium, Alberto Fujimori became increasingly authoritarian, strengthening collaboration with Vladimiro Montesinos and the National Intelligence Service. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of &quot;authentic interpretation&quot; which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000. A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed. In late 1999, Fujimori announced that he would run for a third term. The electoral authorities, which were politically sympathetic to Fujimori, accepted his argument that the two-term restriction did not apply to him, as it was enacted while he was already in office.

Exit polls showed Fujimori fell short of the 50% required to avoid an electoral runoff, but the first official results showed him with 49.6% of the vote, just short of outright victory. Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.9%—20,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. As voting is mandatory in Peru, Fujimori&#x27;s primary opponent, Alejandro Toledo, called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing &quot;No to fraud!&quot; on them. The OAS electoral observation mission pulled out of the country, saying that the process would be neither free nor fair.

In the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the total votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 37.0% of the total votes cast in the first round to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round. The large percentage of invalid votes in the election suggests widespread dissatisfaction with the electoral process among voters.

Although Fujimori won the runoff with only a bare majority (but 3/4 valid votes), rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace. As a conciliatory gesture, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate Federico Salas as prime minister. Opposition parties in Congress refused to support this move, and Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving Vladimiro Montesinos broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station Canal N broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri to defect to Fujimori&#x27;s Peru 2000 party. The video was originally presented at press conference by Fernando Olivera and Luis Iberico of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front); many other similar videos were released in the following weeks.

Fujimori&#x27;s support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections, in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. 

On 19 November, government ministers presented their resignations en bloc. Fujimori&#x27;s first vice president, Francisco Tudela, had broken with Fujimori and resigned a few days earlier. This left second vice president Ricardo Márquez Flores as next in line for the presidency. Congress refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; Márquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April 2001 elections.

==Post-presidency (2000–2024)==

=== Summary ===
In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan. He maintained a self-imposed exile until his arrest while visiting Chile in November 2005. He was extradited to face criminal charges in Peru on 22 September 2007. In December 2007, Fujimori was convicted of ordering an illegal search and seizure and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the decision on appeal. In April 2009, Fujimori was convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for his role in kidnappings and murders by the Grupo Colina death squad during his government&#x27;s battle against the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in the 1990s. Specifically, he was found guilty of murder, bodily harm and two cases of kidnapping. The verdict marked the first time that an elected head of state was tried and convicted of human rights violations.

In July 2009, Fujimori was sentenced to years imprisonment for embezzlement after he admitted to giving US$15 million from the Peruvian treasury to Montesinos. Two months later, he pleaded guilty in a fourth trial to bribery and received an additional six-year term. Transparency International determined the money embezzled by the Fujimori government—about US$600 million or about US$ million in 2021—to be the seventh-most for a head of government active within 1984–2004. Under Peruvian law, all the resultant sentences must run concurrently; thus, the maximum length of imprisonment remained 25 years.

In December 2017, Fujimori was pardoned by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, shortly after Fujimori&#x27;s son, Congressman Kenji Fujimori, helped President Kuczynski survive an impeachment vote. The pardon was overturned by the Supreme Court on 3 October 2018, and Fujimori was sent back to prison in January 2019. The Constitutional Court of Peru in a 4–3 ruling on 17 March 2022 reinstated the pardon. On 8 April 2022, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights overruled the Constitutional Court and ordered Peru not to release Fujimori. The Constitutional Court ordered on 5 December 2023 that he be immediately released.

===Resignation, arrest, and trial===

On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to Brunei to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On 16 November, Valentín Paniagua took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential resignation via fax. Congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting on 22 November 62–9 to remove Fujimori from office on the grounds that he was &quot;permanently morally disabled&quot;. After Congress rejected Fujimori&#x27;s faxed resignation, they relieved Fujimori of his duties as president and banned him from Peruvian politics for a decade. 

Alejandro Toledo, who assumed the presidency in 2001, spearheaded the criminal case against Fujimori. He arranged meetings with the Supreme Court, tax authorities, and other powers in Peru to &quot;coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan&quot;. His vehemence in this matter at times compromised Peruvian law: forcing the judiciary and legislative system to keep guilty sentences without hearing Fujimori&#x27;s defense; not providing Fujimori with representation when Fujimori was tried &quot;in absentia&quot;; and expelling pro-Fujimori congressmen from the parliament without proof of the accusations against them. Those expulsions were later reversed by the judiciary.

Congress authorized charges against Fujimori in August 2001. Fujimori was alleged to be a coauthor, along with Vladimiro Montesinos, of the death-squad killings at Barrios Altos in 1991 and La Cantuta in 1992, respectively. At the behest of Peruvian authorities, in March 2003 Interpol issued an arrest order for Fujimori on charges that included murder, kidnapping, and crimes against humanity.

In September 2003, Fujimori and several of his ministers were denounced for crimes against humanity, for allegedly having overseen forced sterilizations during his regime. In November, Congress approved an investigation of Fujimori&#x27;s involvement in the airdrop of Kalashnikov rifles into the Colombian jungle in 1999 and 2000 for guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Fujimori maintained he had no knowledge of the arms-trading, and blamed Montesinos. By approving the charges, Congress lifted the immunity granted to Fujimori as a former president, so that he could be criminally charged and prosecuted.

Congress also voted to support charges against Fujimori for the detention and disappearance of 67 students from the central Andean city of Huancayo and the disappearance of several residents from the northern coastal town of Chimbote during the 1990s. It also approved charges that Fujimori mismanaged millions of dollars from Japanese charities, suggesting that the millions of dollars in his bank account were far too much to have been accumulated legally.

In 2004, the Special Prosecutor established to investigate Fujimori released a report alleging that the Fujimori administration had obtained US$2 billion though graft. Most of this money came from Vladimiro Montesinos&#x27;s web of corruption. The Special Prosecutor&#x27;s figure of two billion dollars is considerably higher than the one arrived at by Transparency International, an NGO that studies corruption. Transparency International listed Fujimori as having embezzled an estimated US$600 million or about $ million in 2021, which would rank seventh in the list of money embezzled by heads of government active within 1984–2004.

Fujimori dismissed the judicial proceedings underway against him as &quot;politically motivated&quot;, citing Toledo&#x27;s involvement. Fujimori established a new political party in Peru, &quot;Sí Cumple&quot;, working from Japan. He hoped to participate in the 2006 presidential elections, but in February 2004, the Constitutional Court dismissed this possibility, because the ex-president was specifically barred by Congress from holding any office for ten years. Fujimori saw the decision as unconstitutional, as did his supporters such as former congress members Luz Salgado, Martha Chávez and Fernán Altuve, who argued it was a &quot;political&quot; maneuver and that the only body with the authority to determine the matter was the National Elections Jury (JNE). Valentín Paniagua disagreed, suggesting that the Constitutional Court finding was binding and that &quot;no further debate is possible&quot;.

Fujimori&#x27;s &quot;Sí Cumple&quot; (roughly translated, &quot;He Keeps His Word&quot;) received more than 10% in many country-level polls, contending with APRA for the second-place slot, but did not participate in the 2006 elections after its participation in the Alliance for the Future (initially thought as &quot;Alliance Sí Cumple&quot;) had not been allowed.

Fujimori remained in self-imposed exile in Japan, where he resided with his friend, the Catholic novelist Ayako Sono. Several senior Japanese politicians supported Fujimori, partly because of his decisive action in ending the 1996–97 Japanese embassy crisis. Peru had requested Fujimori&#x27;s extradition from Japan, which was refused by the Japanese government due to Fujimori being a Japanese citizen, and Japanese laws stipulating against extraditing its citizens. 

By March 2005, it appeared that Peru had all but abandoned its efforts to extradite Fujimori from Japan. In September of that year, Fujimori obtained a new Peruvian passport in Tokyo and announced his intention to run in the upcoming 2006 national election. 

Fujimori arrived in Chile in November 2005, but hours after his arrival there he was arrested following a arrest warrant issued by a Chilean judge, Peru then requested his extradition. While under house arrest in Chile, Fujimori announced plans to run in Japan&#x27;s Upper House elections in July 2007 for the far-right People&#x27;s New Party. Fujimori was extradited from Chile to Peru in September 2007.

On 7 April 2009, a three-judge panel convicted Fujimori on charges of human rights abuses, declaring that the &quot;charges against him have been proven beyond all reasonable doubt&quot;. The panel found him guilty of ordering the Grupo Colina death squad to commit the November 1991 Barrios Altos massacre and the July 1992 La Cantuta massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 25 people, as well as for taking part in the kidnappings of opposition journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer Ampudia. As of 2009 Fujimori&#x27;s conviction is the only instance of a democratically elected head of state being tried and convicted of human rights abuses in his own country. Later on 7 April, the court sentenced Fujimori to 25 years in prison. Likewise, the Court found him guilty of aggravated kidnapping, under the aggravating circumstance of cruel treatment, with respect to journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer Ampudia. The Special Criminal Chamber determined that the sentence was to expire on 10 February 2032. On 2 January 2010, the sentence to 25 years in prison for human rights violations was confirmed.

He faced a third trial in July 2009 over allegations that he illegally gave US$15 million in state funds to Vladimiro Montesinos, former head of the National Intelligence Service, during the two months prior to his fall from power. Fujimori admitted paying the money to Montesinos but claimed that he had later paid back the money to the state. On 20 July, the court found him guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to a further years in prison.

A fourth trial took place in September 2009 in Lima. Fujimori was accused of using Montesinos to bribe and tap the phones of journalists, businessmen and opposition politicians—evidence of which led to the collapse of his government in 2000. Fujimori admitted the charges but claimed that the charges were made to damage his daughter&#x27;s presidential election campaign. The prosecution asked the court to sentence Fujimori to eight years imprisonment with a fine of US$1.6 million plus US$1 million in compensation to ten people whose phones were bugged. Fujimori pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment on 30 September 2009.

===Pardon requests and release===
Press reports in late 2012 indicated that Fujimori was suffering from tongue cancer and other medical problems. His family asked President Ollanta Humala for a pardon. President Humala rejected a pardon in 2013, saying that Fujimori&#x27;s condition was not serious enough to warrant it. In July 2016, with three days left in his term, President Humala said that there was insufficient time to evaluate a second request to pardon Fujimori, leaving the decision to his successor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. On 24 December 2017, President Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds. Kuczynski&#x27;s office stated that the hospitalized 79-year-old Fujimori had a &quot;progressive, degenerative and incurable disease&quot;. The pardon kicked off at least two days of protests and led at least three congressmen to resign from Kuczynski&#x27;s party. A spokesman for Popular Force alleged there was a pact that, in exchange for the pardon, Popular Force members helped Kuczynski fight ongoing impeachment proceedings.

On 20 February 2018, the National Criminal Chamber ruled that it did not apply the resolution that granted Fujimori the right of grace for humanitarian reasons. Therefore, the former president had to face the process for the Pativilca Case with a simple appearance. On 3 October 2018, the Peruvian Supreme Court reversed Fujimori&#x27;s pardon and ordered his return to prison. He was rushed to a hospital and returned to prison on 23 January 2019. His pardon was formally annulled on 13 February 2019.

The Constitutional Court, in a 4–3 ruling on 17 March 2022, reinstated the pardon, though it was not clear if or when he might be released. Those ruling in approval of Fujimori&#x27;s release argued that a pardon, no matter how unconstitutional it may be, can be issued by the President of Peru and that previous rulings annulling the pardon were &quot;subjective&quot;. Constitutional Court judges ruling in favor of releasing Fujimori ignored the Inter-American Court of Human Rights&#x27; opinion that criticized Kuczynski&#x27;s reported pardon pact with Fujimori&#x27;s son and pointed out that the disease cited in the pardon was possibly diagnosed by Fujimori&#x27;s personal doctor, not an independent physician.

On 8 April 2022, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights overruled the Constitutional Court and ordered Peru not to release Fujimori.

On 5 December 2023, he was ordered to be released immediately following an order by the Constitutional Court. This followed a previous order by the court that mandated the decision in the hands of a lower court in Ica, which returned the case to the Constitutional Court citing lack of authority. The following day, he was released from Barbadillo Prison in Lima, after spending 16 years in prison, whereupon he was met by his children Keiko and Kenji as well as a crowd of supporters.

=== Forced sterilizations trial ===
In May 2023, the Supreme Court of Chile ordered Fujimori to testify regarding forced sterilizations that occurred between 1996 and 2000 during his government, with Chile attempting to decide if they would expand extradition charges against Fujimori to include the sterilizations, which would allow him to be prosecuted in Peru. On 19 May 2023, Fujimori participated in a video call from Barbadillo Prison with justice officials in Chile defending his actions regarding sterilizations.

=== 2026 general election ===
Two months before his death, on 14 July 2024, Keiko Fujimori announced her father&#x27;s candidacy for the 2026 Peruvian general election, despite his legal impediments and difficulties related to old age and poor health.

== Personal life, illness, and death ==
In 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife Susana Higuchi in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title First Lady in August 1994, appointing their eldest daughter Keiko as first lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a &quot;tyrant&quot; and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.

In 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also Japanese Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, and a son, Kenji, who followed him into politics and were both elected to Congress.

For some years before his death, Fujimori had gastrointestinal issues, heart problems and cancer. He was in prison for several years following his presidency and was released on humanitarian grounds in December 2023. He was diagnosed with tongue cancer in early 2024. He made his last public appearance at a hospital after undergoing a CT scan on 4 September 2024.

On 11 September, several Fujimorist members of congress wearing black, along with a priest, arrived at the home of Fujimori&#x27;s daughter Keiko in Lima&#x27;s San Borja District, amid reports that his health was failing. Subsequently, his doctor Alejandro Aguinaga told the press that he was &quot;fighting&quot; for his life and requested that visits be restricted. Congressperson Luisa María Cuculiza said that Fujimori&#x27;s decline in health took her by surprise and that she had spoken with him five days earlier during which she noted his lucidity. , a spokesperson for the Popular Force, added that Fujimori was going through a &quot;difficult time&quot;. Fujimori&#x27;s lawyer, Elio Riera, briefly disconnected from a virtual meeting over concerns for his health.

Fujimori died at around 18:00 (UTC−05:00). A statement released by another doctor, José Carlos Gutiérrez, stated that Fujimori had trouble breathing on 9 September, lost consciousness on 10 September, and died from complications of tongue cancer. Keiko Fujimori later confirmed her father&#x27;s death on social media.

=== State funeral and burial ===
The Peruvian government declared three days of mourning and granted him a state funeral. The Peruvian Congress and other public buildings lowered their flags to half-mast in his honor. Fujimori&#x27;s remains were brought to lie in state at the Museo de la Nación in the Ministry of Culture on 12 September. Thousands of Fujimori supporters arrived from various regions of the country to the wake, carrying portraits and making speeches in his honor. Due to the large number of attendees, the Ministry of Culture announced that access to the wake would be extended until midnight, and that the following day, the doors of the Nasca Room would be open from 6 in the morning until midnight.

From 12 to 14 September 2024, his lie in state at Peru&#x27;s Ministry of Culture headquarters. Fujimori&#x27;s state funeral was then held on 14 September 2024 at Lima&#x27;s National Theatre. His funeral was attended by the incumbent president, Dina Boluarte, who offered a salute, and Keiko spoke during the funeral in front of a large portrait of her father. Fujimori was buried at Campo Fe Cemetery in Huachipa, Lima.

=== Reactions ===
President Dina Boluarte did not comment directly on his death, although her administration expressed its condolences to his family. Former presidents Francisco Sagasti, Manuel Merino, Martín Vizcarra and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski also conveyed their condolences, as well as prime minister Gustavo Adrianzén.

Supporters also gathered at Fujimori&#x27;s house to mourn his death. His death in his native Peru drew mixed reactions; congressperson Sigrid Bazán commented that Fujimori was a &quot;dictator, assassin and corrupt&quot; and that &quot;his legacy of corruptions, violations of human rights and authoritarianism&quot; would persist beyond his death.

International media described him following his death as an &quot;authoritarian&quot; who was &quot;divisive&quot;, and whose &quot;heavy handed&quot; tactics &quot;created a negative legacy&quot; in Peru that frustrated his eldest daughter&#x27;s attempts to be elected to the presidency. Former president of Colombia Álvaro Uribe Vélez expressed his condolences and praised his administration, saying he &quot;rescued Peru from many problems&quot;. Jamil Mahuad, former President of Ecuador, praised Fujimori and stated that he regretted &quot;the loss of a friend&quot;. Yoshimasa Hayashi, Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, expressed his condolences to Fujimori&#x27;s family, citing his role in resolving the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. At the same time, he acknowledged that Fujimori had been &quot;evaluated in various ways&quot; in part due to his human rights abuse cases.

== Political actions ==

=== Economic Policy ===
Fujimori’s tenure is perhaps best defined by his dramatic economic stabilization program, colloquially known as the &quot;Fujishock&quot;, which produced significant, quantifiable improvements in Peru’s economic indicators. Prior to his reforms, the country suffered from hyperinflation that, at its peak, approached levels as high as 7,500% annually, while fiscal deficits were estimated to be in the range of 8–9% of GDP, and exports were roughly US$4 billion. Following the implementation of stringent fiscal and monetary policies, deregulation, and sweeping privatizations, inflation was slashed to single-digit levels (approximately 7–10% by 1994) and fiscal deficits were reduced to around 2–3% of GDP.

In addition to these macroeconomic achievements, real GDP growth stabilized at an average of about 3–4% per annum during the mid-1990s, and export values soared from about US$4 billion in 1990 to over US$11 billion by 1997. One of the hallmarks of his administration was the privatization program, through which approximately 230–250 state-owned enterprises were sold, generating an estimated US$2.5–3 billion in capital inflows. This aggressive liberalization not only bolstered investor confidence but also helped increase foreign direct investment (FDI) to roughly 1.5–2% of GDP by the late 1990s.

While these policies are widely credited with restoring macroeconomic stability and jumpstarting growth in a previously battered economy, they also contributed to heightened income inequality and social disparities. This is an enduring point of contention among economists and policy analysts. Critics argue that the rapid privatizations and deregulation, though successful in attracting capital, undermined public sector services and exacerbated regional imbalances. Nonetheless, the data support the conclusion that Fujimori’s economic interventions achieved a rapid and measurable turnaround in key economic indicators, laying the groundwork for subsequent decades of growth in Peru.

=== Corruption ===
Fujimori was accused of a series of offences, including embezzlement of public funds, abuse of power, and corruption during almost 10 years as president (1990–2000), especially when he gained greater control after the self-coup. The network operated as a kleptocracy in three spheres: business, politics, and the military.

With multimillion-dollar annual expenditures in 1992 (five billion dollars in public spending plus another five billion in state enterprises), part of the funds were diverted to political and military institutions. According to the National Anti-Corruption Initiative (INA) in 2001, they corresponded to 30–35% of the average budget expenditure in each year, and 4% of the average annual GDP during the same period.

One of those responsible for maintaining an image of apparent honesty and government approval was Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), who systematically bribed politicians, judges, and the media. That criminal network also involved authorities of his government; furthermore, due to privatisation and the arrival of foreign capital, companies close to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance were allowed to use state money for public works tenders, as in the cases of AeroPerú, JJC Contratistas Generales (of the Camet Dickmann family), and the Banco de Crédito.

Although in 1999 the opposition made a public denunciation that ended in the resignation of five ministers, this network was later revealed in 2000, just before the president resigned, when the Swiss embassy in Peru informed the Minister of Justice Alberto Bustamante and the attorney general José Ugaz of more than US$40 million coming from Montesinos, in which he was denounced for &quot;illicit enrichment to the detriment of the Peruvian state&quot;. Ugaz was in charge of the investigation until 2002.

According to Transparency International in 2004, Fujimori was listed as the seventh most corrupt former leader in history.

====Counterterrorism efforts====

When Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was dominated by the Maoist insurgent group Sendero Luminoso (&quot;Shining Path&quot;), and the Marxist–Leninist group Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru&#x27;s district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, over the course of which over 100 officials had been killed by the Shining Path in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru&#x27;s courts lacked a justice of the peace due to Shining Path intimidation. Labor union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.

By the early 1990s, some parts of the country were under the control of the insurgents, in territories known as &quot;zonas liberadas&quot; (&quot;liberated zones&quot;), where inhabitants lived under the rule of these groups and paid them taxes. When the Shining Path arrived in Lima, it organized &quot;paros armados&quot; (&quot;armed strikes&quot;), which were enforced by killings and other forms of violence. The leadership of the Shining Path largely consisted of university students and teachers. Two previous governments, those of Fernando Belaúnde Terry and Alan García, at first neglected the threat posed by the Shining Path, then launched an unsuccessful military campaign to eradicate it, undermining public faith in the state and precipitating an exodus of elites.

According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Shining Path guerrilla attacks claimed an estimated 12,500 lives during the organization&#x27;s active phase. On 16 July 1992, the Tarata bombing, in which several car bombs exploded in Miraflores, Lima&#x27;s wealthiest district, killed over 40 people; the bombings were characterized by one commentator as an &quot;offensive to challenge President Alberto Fujimori&quot;. The bombing at Tarata was followed up with a &quot;weeklong wave of car bombings ... Bombs hit banks, hotels, schools, restaurants, police stations, and shops ... [G]uerrillas bombed two rail bridges from the Andes, cutting off some of Peru&#x27;s largest copper mines from coastal ports.&quot;

Fujimori earned credit for ending the Shining Path insurgency. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an open trial wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families. At the same time, Fujimori&#x27;s government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as &quot;rondas campesinas&quot; (&quot;peasant patrols&quot;).

Insurgent activity was in decline by the end of 1992, and Fujimori took credit for this abatement, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DIRCOTE led to the capture of the leaders from↔ MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán&#x27;s capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even noted that he specially ordered Guzmán&#x27;s prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.

Critics charge that to achieve the defeat of the Shining Path, the military engaged in widespread human rights abuses, and that the majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published on 28 August 2003, noted that the armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents.
The Japanese embassy hostage crisis began on 17 December 1996, when fourteen MRTA militants seized the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of prison conditions in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the &quot;Emerretistas&quot; gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants&#x27; demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.

On 22 April 1997, a team of military commandos, in the operation codenamed &quot;Chavín de Huantar&quot;, raided the building. One hostage, two military commandos, and all 14 MRTA insurgents were killed in the operation. Images of President Fujimori at the ambassador&#x27;s residence during and after the military operation, surrounded by soldiers and liberated dignitaries, and walking among the corpses of the insurgents, were widely televised. The conclusion of the four-month-long standoff was used by Fujimori and his supporters to bolster his image as tough on terrorism.

====Human rights violations====
Several organizations criticized Fujimori&#x27;s methods against the Shining Path and the MRTA. Amnesty International said &quot;the widespread and systematic nature of human rights violations committed during the government of former head of state Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) in Peru constitute crimes against humanity under international law&quot;. The 1992 La Cantuta massacre and the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre by members of the &quot;Grupo Colina&quot; death squad, made up solely of members of the armed forces, were among the crimes that Peru cited in its request to Japan for his extradition in 2003.

The success of the military operation in the Japanese embassy hostage crisis was tainted by subsequent allegations that at least three and possibly eight of the insurgents were summarily executed by the commandos after surrendering. In 2002, the case was taken up by public prosecutors, but the Supreme Court ruled that the military tribunals had jurisdiction. A military court later absolved them of guilt, and the &quot;Chavín de Huantar&quot; soldiers led the 2004 military parade. In 2003, MRTA family members lodged a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) accusing the Peruvian state of human rights violations, in that the MRTA insurgents had been denied the &quot;right to life, the right to judicial guarantees and the right to judicial protection&quot;. Although the IACHR&#x27;s ruling did not directly implicate Fujimori, it did fault the Peruvian state for its complicity in the La Cantuta massacre.

====Forced sterilizations====
Reportedly following socioeconomic objectives calling for the &quot;total extermination&quot; of &quot;culturally backward and economically impoverished groups&quot; determined by the Peruvian military in the &quot;Plan Verde&quot;, from 1996 to 2000, the Fujimori government oversaw a massive forced sterilization campaign known as the National Program for Reproductive Health and Family Planning (PNSRPF).

According to Back and Zavala, the plan was an example of ethnic cleansing as it targeted indigenous and rural women. The United Nations and other international aid agencies supported this campaign. USAID provided funding and training until it was exposed by objections by churches and human rights groups. The Nippon Foundation, headed by Ayako Sono, a Japanese novelist and personal friend of Fujimori, supported it as well.

In the four-year &quot;Plan Verde&quot; period, over 215,000 people, mostly women, entirely indigenous, were forced or threatened into sterilization and 16,547 men were forced to undergo vasectomies during these years, most of them without a proper anesthetist, in contrast to 80,385 sterilizations and 2,795 vasectomies over the previous three years. Some scholars argue that these policies and acts were genocidal.

=== Economics ===

Fujimori was credited by many Peruvians with bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation during the first García administration.

Neoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial &quot;orthodox&quot; phase (1990–92) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a &quot;pragmatic&quot; phase (1993–98) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final &quot;watered-down&quot; phase (1999–2000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their clientelist policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.

High growth during Fujimori&#x27;s first term petered out during his second term. The 1997–98 El Niño event had a tremendous impact on the Peruvian economy during the late 1990s and exacerbated a recession during that time. Nevertheless, total GDP growth between 1992 and 2001, inclusive, was 44.60%, that is, 3.76% per annum; total GDP per capita growth between 1991 and 2001, inclusive, was 30.78%, that is, 2.47% per annum. Also, studies by INEI, the national statistics bureau show that the number of Peruvians living in poverty increased dramatically (from 41.6% to more than 70%) during Alan García&#x27;s term, but decreased greatly (from more than 70% to 54%) during Fujimori&#x27;s term. Furthermore, FAO reported Peru reduced undernourishment by about 29% from 1990 to 1992 to 1997–99.

Peru was reintegrated into the global economic system, and began to attract foreign investment. The mass selloff of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephone, mobile telephone, and internet services, respectively. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company at a cost of US$607 for a residential line. Peru&#x27;s physical land-based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000, and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line: the average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization). Privatization also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea Gas Project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.

===Criticism===
Fujimori has been described as a dictator. His government was permeated by a network of corruption organized by his associate Montesinos. Fujimori&#x27;s style of government has also been described as &quot;populist authoritarianism&quot;. Numerous governments and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, welcomed the extradition of Fujimori to face human rights charges. As early as 1991, Fujimori had himself vocally denounced what he called &quot;pseudo-human rights organizations&quot; such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for allegedly failing to criticize the insurgencies targeting civilian populations throughout Peru against which his government was struggling.

Some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years actually reflects a greater rate of extraction of nonrenewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country. Peru&#x27;s mining legislation, they claim, has served as a role model for other countries that wish to become more mining-friendly.

The sole instance of organized labor&#x27;s success in impeding reforms, namely the teachers&#x27; union resistance to education reform, was based on traditional methods of organization and resistance: strikes and street demonstrations.

In the 2004 &quot;Global Corruption Report&quot;, Fujimori was named one of the World&#x27;s Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed seventh and he was said to have amassed $600 million, but despite years of incarceration and investigation, none of these supposed stolen funds have ever been located in any bank account anywhere in the world.

===Support===

Fujimori did have support within Peru. The Universidad de Lima March 2003 poll, taken while he was in Japan, found a 41% approval rating for his administration. A poll conducted in March 2005 by the Instituto de Desarrollo e Investigación de Ciencias Económicas (IDICE) indicated that 12.1% of the respondents intended to vote for Fujimori in the 2006 presidential election. A poll conducted on 25 November 2005, by the Universidad de Lima indicated a high approval (45.6%) rating of the Fujimori period between 1990 and 2000, attributed to his counterinsurgency efforts (53%). In a 2007 University of Lima survey of 600 Peruvians in Lima and the port of Callao, 82.6% agreed that the former president should be extradited from Chile to stand trial in Peru.

In the 2006 congressional elections, his daughter Keiko was elected to the congress with the highest vote count. She came in second place in the 2011 Peruvian presidential election with 23.2% of the vote, and lost the June runoff against Ollanta Humala. She again ran for president in the 2016 election, narrowly losing the runoff to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, and again in the 2021 election, losing the runoff to Pedro Castillo.

<doc id="148487" wikidata="Q869360" url="?curid=148487" title="Scytale">
<text>In cryptography, a scytale (; also transliterated skytale, &quot;skutálē&quot; &quot;baton, cylinder&quot;, also &quot;skútalon&quot;) is a tool used to perform a transposition cipher, consisting of a cylinder with a strip of parchment wound around it on which is written a message. The ancient Greeks, and the Spartans in particular, are said to have used this cipher to communicate during military campaigns.

The recipient uses a rod of the same diameter on which the parchment is wrapped to read the message.

==Encrypting==

Suppose the rod allows one to write four letters around in a circle and five letters down the side of it.
The plaintext could be: &quot;I am hurt very badly help&quot;.

To encrypt, one simply writes across the leather:

so the ciphertext becomes, &quot;Iryyatbhmvaehedlurlp&quot; after unwinding.

==Decrypting==

To decrypt, all one must do is wrap the leather strip around the rod and read across. 
An example ciphertext is: &quot;Iryyatbhmvaehedlurlp&quot;
Every fourth letter will appear on the same line. After the re-insertion of spaces, the plaintext becomes: &quot;I am hurt very badly help&quot;.

==History==

From indirect evidence, the scytale was first mentioned by the Greek poet Archilochus, who lived in the 7th century BC. Other Greek and Roman writers during the following centuries also mentioned it; however, it was not until Apollonius of Rhodes (middle of the 3rd century BC) that a clear indication of its use as a cryptographic device appeared. A description of how it operated is not known from before Plutarch (50–120 AD):

Due to difficulties in reconciling the description of Plutarch with the earlier accounts, and circumstantial evidence such as the cryptographic weakness of the device, several authors have suggested that the scytale was used for conveying messages in plaintext and that Plutarch&#x27;s description is mythological.

==Message authentication hypothesis==
An alternative hypothesis is that the scytale was used for message authentication rather than encryption. Only if the sender wrote the message around a scytale of the same diameter as the receiver&#x27;s would the receiver be able to read it. It would therefore be difficult for enemy spies to inject false messages into the communication between two commanders.

Nonetheless, any person intercepting a scytale message, and having heard about the method, could with little difficulty find out the rod size needed (a kind of brute-force attack); once knowing that, it would be easy to supplant the sender and forge new messages.

<text>The premier of China, officially the Premier of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, is the head of government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and leader of the State Council. This post was established in 1911 near the end of the Qing dynasty, but the current post dates to 1954, five years after the establishment of the PRC. The premier is the third-highest ranking official in China&#x27;s political system after the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (party leader) and the president (state representative), and holds the highest rank in the civil service of the central government.

The premier presides over the plenary and executive meetings of the State Council, and assumes overall leadership over the State Council&#x27;s work. The premier also signs administrative regulations passed by the State Council and signs the orders approving the appointment and removal of deputy-ministerial level officials of the State Council, as well as chief executives of Hong Kong and of Macau. The premier is assisted by four vice premiers and state councillors in their duties. In China&#x27;s political system, the premier has generally thought to be the one responsible for managing the economy.

The premier is constitutionally elected by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), and responsible to it and its Standing Committee. The premier serves for a five-year term, renewable once consecutively. Every premier has been a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee since the PRC&#x27;s founding in 1949, except during brief transition periods. The incumbent premier is Li Qiang, who took office on 11 March 2023, succeeding Li Keqiang.

== History ==
In the early 1900s, the Qing dynasty government began implementing constitutional reform in China in order to prevent a revolution. The reforms included the Outline of the Imperial Constitution passed in 1908, which ordered that elections for provincial assemblies must be held within a year. In May 1911, the government replaced the Grand Council with a thirteen-member cabinet, led by Prince Qing, who was appointed Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet. However, the cabinet included nine Manchus, seven of whom were members of the imperial clan. This &quot;Princes&#x27; Cabinet&quot; was unpopular among the people and was viewed as a reactionary measure, being described at one point as &quot;the old Grand Council under the name of a cabinet, autocracy under the name of constitutionalism.&quot;

When the Wuchang Uprising broke out in November 1911, the imperial court summoned the general Yuan Shikai to command the Beiyang Army and put down the revolution. He was named Prime Minister on 2 November 1911, shortly after Prince Qing stepped down. He remained in that office until March 1912, when he negotiated with Empress Dowager Longyu the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor. However, the post was briefly revived in July 1917 during Zhang Xun&#x27;s attempt to restore the Qing monarchy, but he only held it for several days before Beijing was retaken by Republican forces. 

Following the collapse of the Qing, the premier of the Republic of China was created as Premier of the Cabinet () in 1912. It was changed to the Secretary of State () in 1914 and Premier of State Council () in 1916 in the Beiyang Government. In 1928, the Kuomintang (KMT) Government established the Executive Yuan and Tan Yankai served as the first president of the Executive Yuan. It was formalized in 1947 after the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed. The post was abolished in Mainland China, but continued on Taiwan since 1949.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The PRC post was initially established by Organic Law of the Central People&#x27;s Government, passed by the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in 29 September 1949, as the premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People&#x27;s Government. Zhou Enlai was appointed as premier immediately after the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1 October 1949. With the adoption of a constitution in 1954, the post was renamed into the premier of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Since the 1980s, there has been a division of responsibilities between the premier and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary wherein the premier is responsible for the economy and the technical details of implementing government policy while the general secretary gathers the political support necessary for government policy. However, this was seen by observers to be overturned under the leadership of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, who has centralized power around himself, and has taken responsibility over areas that were traditionally the domain of the premier, including the economy.

The premier was historically chosen within the CCP through deliberations by incumbent Politburo members and retired CCP Politburo members as part of the process of determining membership in the incoming new CCP Politburo Standing Committee. Under this informal process, the eventual future premier is initially chosen as a vice premier before assuming the position of premier during a subsequent round of leadership transitions. This changed under Xi, with his ally and current premier Li Qiang never having served as vice premier.

== Selection ==
Officially, the premier is appointed by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the president. The NPC also has the power to remove the premier and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote. In practice, the premier is chosen within the CCP leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.

The length of the premier&#x27;s term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the premier is restricted to two consecutive terms. Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the premier&#x27;s appointment. Since 2018, the premier is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.

== Powers and duties ==
The premier is the highest administrative position in the government of China. The premier heads the State Council and is responsible for organizing and administering the Chinese civil bureaucracy. For example, the premier is tasked with planning and implementing national economic and social development and the state budget. The premier has always been a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The premier&#x27;s duties includes overseeing the various ministries, departments, commissions and statutory agencies. The premier can also propose the establishment, merger or dissolution of ministries, which would then be decided upon by the NPC or its Standing Committee. The premier officially nominated the candidates for vice premiers, state councillors, ministerial offices and the secretary-general of the State Council for appointment by the NPC. The vice premiers assist the premier in their duties. The first-ranked vice premier acts in the premier&#x27;s capacity in their absence.

The premier chairs the plenary and executive meetings of the State Council. The executive meetings include the premier, vice premiers, state councillors and the secretary-general of the State Council, and are held two or three times a month, and can be held in any time if necessary. The State Council has the authority to issue proposals to the NPC and its Standing Committee, which must be approved by the premier. It can also draft or abolish administrative regulations, which are then signed into order and promulgated by the premier. The premier delivers a government work report at the annual session of the NPC. The premier also signs the order approving the appointments or removals of State Council officials at the deputy-ministerial level, as well as the Chief Executive of Hong Kong and the Chief Executive of Macau.

The premier does not have command authority over the armed forces, but is generally the head of the National Defense Mobilization Commission which is a department of the armed forces. The State Council has the authority to impose martial law in subdivisions below the provincial-level administrative divisions, which the premier then proclaims in an order; premier Li Peng once used the authority to impose martial law in parts of Beijing and to order the military crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.

<text>Video poker is a casino game based on five-card draw poker. It is played on a computerized console similar in size to a slot machine.

==History== 
Video poker first became commercially viable when it became economical to combine a television-like monitor with a solid state central processing unit. The earliest models appeared at the same time as the first personal computers were produced, in the mid-1970s, although they were primitive by today&#x27;s standards.

Video poker became more firmly established when SIRCOMA, which stood for Si Redd&#x27;s Coin Machines (and which evolved over time to become International Game Technology), introduced Draw Poker in 1979. Throughout the 1980s video poker became increasingly popular in casinos, as people found the devices less intimidating than playing table games. Today, video poker enjoys a prominent place on the gaming floors of many casinos. The game is especially popular with Las Vegas locals, who tend to patronize locals casinos off the Las Vegas Strip. These local casinos often offer lower-denomination machines or better odds.

A few people who are skilled in calculating odds have become professional video poker players.

==The game==

After inserting money (or a bar-coded paper ticket with credit) into the machine, play begins by placing a bet of one or more credits and pressing the &quot;deal&quot; button. The player is then given 5 cards (like five-card draw) and has the opportunity to discard one or more of them in exchange for new ones drawn from the same virtual deck. After the draw, the machine pays out if the hand or hands played match one of the winning combinations, which are posted in the pay table. Unlike the table version, the player may discard all 5 of their original cards if they so choose.

Pay tables allocate the payouts for hands and are based on how rare they are, the game variation, and the decision of the game operator. A typical pay table starts with a minimum hand of a pair of jacks, which pays even money. All the other hand combinations in video poker are the same as in table poker, including such hands as two pair, three of a kind, straight (a sequence of 5 cards of consecutive value), flush (any 5 cards of the same suit), full house (a pair and a three of a kind), four of a kind (four cards of the same value), straight flush (5 consecutive cards of the same suit) and royal flush (a Ten, a Jack, a Queen, a King and an Ace of the same suit).

Some machines offer progressive jackpots or other unique bonuses, spurring players to both play more coins and to play more frequently.

==Regulation==
Video poker machines in casinos in the United States are regulated by state or Indian gaming agencies. These agencies typically require that the machines deal random card sequences using a virtual deck of cards. This is based on a Nevada Gaming Commission regulation later adopted by other states with a gaming authority. Video poker machines are tested to ensure compliance with this requirement before being offered to the public.

==Variations==

Video poker variations include Deuces Wild, where a two serves as a wild card; Joker&#x27;s Wild, where a joker serves as a wild card; Anything&#x27;s Wild, where the player selects any card (by rank) to act as the wild card before the hand is dealt; pay schedule modification, where four aces with a four or smaller kicker pays an enhanced amount (these games usually have some adjective in the title such as &quot;bonus&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, or &quot;triple&quot;); and multi-play poker, where the player starts with a base hand, and each additional played hand draws from a different set of cards with the base hand. (Multi-play games are offered in &quot;Triple Play&quot;, &quot;Five Play&quot;, &quot;Ten Play&quot;, &quot;Fifty Play&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Play&quot; versions.)

Additionally, side bets have been added to the game where for a fee, the player may receive some sort of benefit. Popular examples include Super Times Pay, Double Super Times Pay, Hot Roll, Dice Fever, and Atomic Fever, where the player has a chance of receiving a factor which multiplies all winnings in a hand, Ultimate X, where for double the bet the player gets a factor based on the strength of the final hand which is applied to the next hand, and Super Draw 6, where for double the bet the player will receive a sixth card which can be used to have five card hands easier to make and make special six card hands with its own pay table.

A version common in the early days of video poker, but rarely found today, is &quot;Pick a Pair&quot; where the player is presented two up cards and chooses between two pairs of three cards, one of which is face up and the other face down.

In games without a wild card, a player on average will receive four-of-a-kind hand approximately once every 500 hands, while a player may play tens of thousands of hands before a royal flush, which usually has the highest payout.

Video poker games online are now available in the US in 3 different states: New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. Players in all three states are able to enjoy fully regulated online video poker games provided that they are physically present in the respective state, of legal age to gamble and can validate their identity.

==Full pay games==
When modern video poker games first appeared, the highest-paying common variant of a particular game was called &quot;full-pay&quot;. Game variants returning a lower payback percentage were termed &quot;short-pay&quot;. Though the term full-pay is still in use, many game variants return more. Payback percentage expresses the long-term expected value of the player&#x27;s wager as a percentage if the game is played perfectly. A payback percentage of 99 percent, for example, indicates that for each $100 wagered, in the long run, the player would expect to lose $1 if they played every hand in the optimal way. Full-pay Jacks or Better, for example, offers a payback percentage of 99.54%. Some payback percentages on full-pay games are often close to or over 100 percent.

Casinos do not usually advertise payback percentages, leaving it up to the player to identify which video poker machines offer the best schedules.

The payoff schedules for most video poker machines are configured with a pay schedule that pays proportionally more for certain hands (such as a royal flush) when the maximum number of credits (typically 5 coins) is bet. Therefore, players who do not play with the maximum number of credits at a time are playing with a lower theoretical return.

===Jacks or Better===

&quot;Jacks or Better,&quot; sometimes called &quot;Draw Poker,&quot; is the most common variation of video poker. Payoffs begin at a pair of jacks. Full pay Jacks or Better is also known as 9/6 Jacks or Better since the payoff for a full house is 9 times the bet, and the payoff for a flush is 6 times the bet. Sometimes, 10/6 and 9/7 versions of Jacks or Better can be found as promotions.

===Bally&#x27;s All American===
Bally Technologies All American video poker is based on Jacks or Better with an increased payout for flushes, straights and straight flushes, but reduced payout for full houses and two pairs (8–8–8–3–1 versus 9–6–4–3–2). The full pay version (quads return 50 bets), once common but now rare, is one of the highest return versions of video poker offered, but the play strategy is very complex and mastered by few. IGT&#x27;s version of the game is called USA Poker.

===Tens or Better===
&quot;Tens or Better&quot; is a variation of 6/5 Jacks or Better. The minimum paying hand is a pair of tens, rather than a pair of Jacks. Strategy is similar between the two games, in spite of the very different full house and flush payouts.

===Joker&#x27;s Wild===
&quot;Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, as the name implies, adds a joker to the mix. The joker is fully wild and substitutes to make stronger hands. The inclusion of the wild joker also adds another winning hand in 5-of-a-kind. The game&#x27;s name inspired a game show of the same name. The full pay version of Joker Two Pair or better (6–7–8), once common but now rare, is one of the highest return versions of video poker offered, but the play strategy is very complex and mastered by few.

===Deuces Wild===
&quot;Deuces Wild&quot; is a variation of video poker in which all twos are wild. (Wild cards substitute for any other card in the deck in order to make a better poker hand). In Deuces Wild, the payout for a four of a kind makes up approximately ⅓ of the payback percentage of the game, and a four of a kind occurs on average approximately every fifteen hands. Deuces Wild can be found with pay schedules that offer a theoretical return as high as 100.8 percent, when played with perfect strategy. This full-pay version is found only in Nevada. It is also available with other pay schedules that have lesser theoretical returns:

Variations are available that pay different amounts for the quad &quot;deuces&quot;, such as Double Deuces (2000), Loose Deuces (2500), Triple Deuces (3000), and Royal Deuces (4000). Full pay Loose Deuces (25–17–10), once common but now rare, is one of the highest return versions of video poker offered.

===Sigma Flush Attack===
Sigma Flush Attack is a combination of video poker and a banking slot, in this case what is being banked is flushes. After 3,4, or 5 flushes (varies by machine), the machine switches into &quot;flush attack mode&quot; in which the next flush pays 100 or 125 credits instead of the more usual 30 credits of 9–6 Jacks or Better. Some of these machines are linked, which means players can simply wait for someone else to put the bank in flush attack mode, or alternately with non-linked machines a player can play after observing a previous player hit flushes but not enough to trigger the flush attack, a practice called &quot;vulturing&quot;. The higher payoff of the flush attack represents one of the higher overlays of video poker. These machines, once common, are now relatively rare.

===Bonus Poker===
&quot;Bonus Poker&quot; is a video poker game based on Jacks or Better, but Bonus Poker offers a higher payout percentage for four of a kind. The full-pay version of this game returns 90.9%. (3)
The game has multiple versions featuring different bonus payouts based on the ranking of the four of a kind.

===Double Bonus===
&quot;Double Bonus&quot; video poker is a variation of Jacks or Better with a bonus payout for four aces. This variation offers up to a theoretical return of 100.2 percent, when played with perfect strategy — however, this % is only on a &quot;10/7&quot; version video poker game (10/7 being the payouts for a full house and a flush). There are many other video poker varieties of 10/6, 9/6, etc. that have slightly lower than the most generous 10/7 version payout. Although the full-pay version has a theoretically-positive return, few play well enough to capitalize on it. Double Bonus is a complex game.(4)

It is also available with other pay schedules that have lesser theoretical returns:

===Double Double Bonus===
&quot;Double Double Bonus&quot; video poker is a variation of Jacks or Better which offers bonus payoffs for different four of a kinds, as seen in the payout table below. Full pay Double Double Bonus can be found with pay schedules that offer up to a theoretical return of 100.1 percent, when played with perfect strategy. It is also available with other pay schedules that have lesser theoretical returns:

==Low pay video poker games==
Often casinos choose to use pay tables which reduce the maximum payout percentage as compared to other commonly available game variants. This increases the house edge, but generally reduces net revenue for the casino as players experience less &quot;play time&quot; on the machine, busting out of their buy-in at an earlier point. Casinos that reduce paytables generally have to increase promotions to compensate and attract customers.

===9/5 Jacks or Better===

9/5 Jacks or Better is a low pay version of the game. The payout for making a Flush is cut from 6x your bet to 5x your bet, but all other payouts remain the same. This reduces the maximum payout percentage to 98.45% for players betting five coins per hand to receive the Royal Flush bonus.

===8/6 Jacks or Better===

8/6 Jacks or Better is another often used pay table for Jacks or Better games. The payout for making a Full House is cut from 9x your bet to 8x your bet, while all other payouts remain the same as in a full pay game. This reduces the maximum payout percentage to 98.39% for players betting five coins per hand to receive the Royal Flush bonus.

===8/5 Jacks or Better===

8/5 Jacks or Better cuts the Full House payout from 9x your bet to 8x your bet, and also cuts the Flush payout from 6x your bet to 5x your bet. All other payouts remain the same as in a full pay game. This reduces the maximum payout percentage to 97.30% for players betting five coins per hand to receive the Royal Flush bonus. A common promotion used by casinos to encourage play on this tight paytable was to add a 2% progressive meter to the royal flush.

===7/5 Jacks or Better===

7/5 Jacks or Better cuts the Full House payout from 9x your bet to 7x your bet, and also cuts the Flush payout from 6x your bet to 5x your bet. All other payouts remain the same as in a full pay game. This reduces the maximum payout percentage to 96.15% for players betting five coins per hand to receive the Royal Flush bonus.

===6/5 Jacks or Better===

6/5 Jacks or Better cuts the Full House payout from 9x your bet to 6x your bet, and also cuts the Flush payout from 6x your bet to 5x your bet. All other payouts remain the same as in a full pay game. This reduces the maximum payout percentage to 95.00% for players betting five coins per hand to receive the Royal Flush bonus.

===Progressive jackpot games===
Other kinds of video poker only have positive theoretical returns when the progressive jackpot is high enough. Many establishments advertise with a billboard when the progressive jackpot is high enough. Otherwise sub-optimal games like &quot;8/5 jacks or better&quot; can become positive expectation when the jackpot is large enough.

<doc id="148536" wikidata="Q8105" url="?curid=148536" title="1906 Intercalated Games">
<text>The 1906 Intercalated Games or 1906 Olympic Games (), held from 22 April 1906 to 2 May 1906, was an international multi-sport event that was celebrated in Athens, Greece. They were at the time considered to be Olympic Games and were referred to as the &quot;Second International Olympic Games in Athens&quot; by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). However, the medals that were distributed to the participants during these games were later not officially recognised by the IOC and are not displayed with the collection of Olympic medals at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The 1906 games are noted for their influence on the Olympic tradition and the records broken during these games are recorded in history, but are no longer considered part of the Olympic records. 894 athletes from 20 nations competed in this competition. The idea behind the Intercalated games was to have an Olympics in Greece every four years, but this would be the first and last. The idea was not pursued further and is sometimes called the &quot;forgotten games&quot; in the context of the Olympics. The next Olympic Games would be the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, and the next time the Olympic Games would return to Greece was 98 years later in 2004 also in Athens.

==Intercalated Games==
The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of &quot;International Olympic Games&quot; halfway between what is now known as the Games of the Olympiad. This proposed series of Games, in the Olympic Games cycle, was always to be held in Athens and was to have equal status with the international Games. However, the only such Games were held in 1906.

One reason for the games in 1906 was to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the 1896 games.

The first Intercalated Games had been scheduled by the International Olympic Committee in 1901 as part of a new schedule, where every four years, in between the internationally organised Games, there would be Intermediate Games held in Athens.

This was a compromise; after the successful Games of Athens 1896, the Greeks suggested they could organise the games every four years. Since they had the accommodation and had proven they could hold well-organised games, they received substantial public support. However, Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee, opposed this, as he had intended for the first Games to be in Paris in 1900. After Paris had lost the première Olympics, De Coubertin did not want the games to be permanently hosted elsewhere. 

The 1900 Games were overshadowed by the Exposition Universelle, whose organising committee disagreed with De Coubertin&#x27;s ideas to such an extent that he resigned. The organisation of the 1900 Games was haphazard by today&#x27;s standards, and although some events, such as archery, drew widespread attention, many others were poorly attended. Historians&#x27; opinions still differ over which events should be considered &quot;Olympic&quot;.
Consequently, the IOC supported the Greek idea by granting them a second series of quadrennial games in between the first series. All of the games would be International Olympic Games: the difference was that half of them would follow De Coubertin&#x27;s idea of &quot;organisation internationale&quot;, while the other half would follow the Greeks&#x27; idea of a permanent home with the Committee of the Olympic Games, as it was then known, as experienced organisers. 

This was a departure from the ancient schedule, but it was expected that, if the ancient Greeks could keep a four-year schedule, the modern Olympic Movement could keep a two-year schedule. As 1902 was now too close to be logistically workable, and Greece was experiencing political and economic difficulties, the 2nd Olympic Games in Athens were scheduled for 1906, and the IOC as a whole gave Greece full support for the organisation.

The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri were overshadowed by the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and their organisation was even worse than that of Paris 1900, while travel difficulties meant that only 20% of the athletes were non-American; of these, half were Canadian.

It was clear the Olympic Movement was in a dire situation and desperately needed to recapture the spirit of Athens 1896. It also needed to do so quickly, as to those who did not participate in St. Louis, 1908 was a gap of eight years, by which time there would be little, if any, goodwill left for the Games. 

To make matters worse, Rome, the proposed host for 1908, was also planning an exhibition at the same time as the Games, which had been responsible for the failures of Paris and St. Louis.

To the IOC, the 1906 Athens Games being just around the corner would have been a lifeline. While De Coubertin still opposed the idea and did not do anything more than his function required of him, the IOC as a whole gave the Greek organising committee full support for the organisation.

==Improvements==
The 1906 Games were quite successful: unlike the Games of 1900, 1904 or 1908, they were not stretched out over several months, and unlike 1900 and 1904, they were not overshadowed by an international exposition. Their crisp implementation was most likely instrumental in the continued existence of the Games.

Contemporary publications praised the Games:

These Games were the first to have:
* All athlete registration going through their NOCs.
* The Opening of the Games as a separate event: an event at which the athletes marched into the stadium in national teams, each following its national flag.
* An Olympic Village (at the Zappeion). 
* A formal Closing Ceremony.
* The raising of national flags for the medalists.

These, along with various other changes, are now accepted as tradition.

== Games ==
The Games were held from 22 April to 2 May 1906, in Athens, Greece. They took place in the Panathenaic Stadium, which had already hosted the 1896 Games and the earlier Zappas Olympics of 1870 and 1875. The games excluded several disciplines that had occurred during the past two games; it was unclear whether they ought to have been part of the Olympic Games. Added to the program were the javelin throw and the pentathlon.

The 1906 games are noted for their opening and closing ceremonies, which initiated this tradition. The official Olympic website notes there was no opening ceremony with parade of athletes, in the 1896, 1900, and 1904 games, and notes the 1906 games as the genesis of the idea, but the 1908 Summer games is the first still recognized Olympics with the opening parade of athletes which was more organized. The 1908 games introduced the tradition of the host coming in as the last in the parade also.

=== Opening ===
These were the first games to include an opening ceremony with athletes marching into the stadium as national teams behind their flags. King George I officially opened the games.
=== Highlights ===

* There were only two standing jump events in Athens, but Ray Ewry successfully defended his titles in both of them, bringing his total up to 8 gold medals. In 1908 he would successfully defend them one last time for a total of 10 Olympic titles, a feat unparalleled until 2008 when Michael Phelps pushed his Olympic gold medal total to 14.
* Paul Pilgrim won both the 400 and 800 metres, a feat that was first repeated during Montreal 1976 by Alberto Juantorena.
* Canadian Billy Sherring lived in Greece for two months, to adjust to the local conditions. His efforts paid off as he unexpectedly won the Marathon. Prince George accompanied him on the final lap.
* Finland made its Olympic debut, and immediately won a gold medal, as Verner Järvinen won the Discus (Greek style) event.
* Peter O&#x27;Connor of Ireland won gold in the hop, step and jump (triple jump) and silver in the long jump. In protest at being put on the British team, O&#x27;Connor scaled the flagpole and hoisted the Irish flag, while the pole was guarded by Irish and American athletes and supporters.
* Martin Sheridan of the Irish American Athletic Club, competing for the U.S. team, won gold in the 16-pound Shot put and the Freestyle Discus throw and silver in the Standing high jump, Standing long jump and Stone throw. He scored the greatest number of points of any athlete at the Games. For his accomplishments he was presented with a ceremonial javelin by King Georgios I. This javelin is still on display in a local pub near Sheridan&#x27;s hometown in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland.

=== Closing ceremony ===

Six thousand schoolchildren took part in the first ever Olympic closing ceremony.

== Participating nations ==
854 athletes, 848 men and 6 women, from 20 countries, competed at the 1906 Intercalated Games.


== The Games ==
78 events in 14 disciplines, comprising 12 sports, were part of the 1906 Games.

Pistol dueling was an unofficial event.

==Medal count==
These medals were distributed but are no longer recognised by the International Olympic Committee.

===Notes===

*The mixed team medals are for two Belgians and one Greek in the Coxed Pairs 1 mile rowing event and for the football team of Smyrna (see below).
* In the football tournament, the silver medal for the team from Smyrna was won by a mixed team of footballers from various nationalities (English, French and Armenian), while the bronze medal for the team from Thessalonica was won by ethnic Greeks who competed for Greece, despite both cities being Ottoman possessions at the time.
*Egypt and Turkey (Ottoman Empire) were the only countries that competed but did not win medals.

==Decline of the Intercalated Games==
The Greeks were, despite their best efforts, unable to keep the schedule for 1910. While there had been serious political tensions in the Balkans, the modern Greeks found out their ancient ancestors were right: a two-year interval was too short. There had been effectively a gap of six years before Athens 1906, due to the predominantly American nature of the 1904 St. Louis Games, but Athens 1910 would have left a gap of two years after the 1908 London Games, which would have made it virtually impossible to prepare.

With Athens 1910 being a failure, the faith in the Intercalated Games diminished: as a result, plans for Athens 1914 got even less support before the outbreak of World War I, meaning any further Intercalated Games had to wait until after the war, which ended in 1918. 

Since it had been twelve years since Athens 1906, and in any case, the next possible event would have been in 1922 – sixteen years after the first – the idea of Intercalated Games was given up entirely.

===Downgrading===
Since the 2nd International Olympic Games in Athens had become an exception, the personal views of various IOC chairmen caused the IOC to retroactively downgrade the 1906 Games, and their explanation for the Games became that they had been a 10th anniversary celebration. 

Also, more stress was placed on the continuing sequence of four-year Olympiads, and the Games of 1906 did not fit into this. Hence, the IOC currently does not recognise Athens 1906 as Olympic Games, and does not regard any events occurring there (such as the setting of new records or the winning of medals) as official.

Despite this, the success of Athens 1906 may have been what kept the Olympics alive after the failures of 1900 and 1904. As the next Games are always built on the successes of the last, the innovations of Athens were used again in London, and eventually became Olympic tradition. 

In fact, the influence of the First Intercalated Games pervades the Olympics, with the holding of the Games concentrated in a small time period in a small area returning to the first games, while some later games lasted for months. (see also 1896 Summer Olympics, which lasted 11 days; see also List of Olympic Games host cities)

In the 21st century the 1906 Olympics are sometimes called the &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;forgotten&quot; games. Despite its exclusion from other games, it was noted as a well organized, dignified event, full pageantry, and for introducing the almost theatrical opening closing ceremonies, which was further refined by the 1908 games.

== Postcards for the 1906 Olympics ==
A number of postcards, then at its peak, were published by various printhouses. The following were printed in Corfu, Greece, by the Aspiotis brothers.

<text>A general officer is an officer of high rank in the armies, and in some nations&#x27; air and space forces, marines or naval infantry.

In some usages, the term &quot;general officer&quot; refers to a rank above colonel.

The adjective &quot;general&quot; had been affixed to officer designations since the late medieval period to indicate relative superiority or an extended jurisdiction.

== French Revolutionary system ==


== Arab system ==

== Other variations ==
Other nomenclatures for general officers include the titles and ranks:
* Adjutant general
* Commandant-general
* Inspector general
* General-in-chief
* General of the Army (which is distinct from the title army general)
* General of the Air Force (USAF only)
* General of the Armies of the United States (of America), a title created for General John J. Pershing, and subsequently granted posthumously to George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant
* (&quot;general admiral&quot;) (German Navy)
* Air general and aviation general
* Wing general and group general
* (, a Serb/Slovenian/Macedonian rank immediately inferior to colonel general, and roughly equivalent to Commonwealth/US major general)
* Director general (a common administrative term sometimes used as an appointment in military services)
* Director general of national defence (most senior rank in the Mexican Armed Forces)
* Controller general (general officer rank in the French National Police)
* Prefect general (the most senior rank of the Argentine Naval Prefecture)
* Master-General of the Ordnance (very senior British military position)
* Police General (most senior rank of the Philippine National Police)
* Commissioner (highest rank of the Bureau of Immigration)
* (Police General), the highest rank in the Indonesian National Police

In addition to militarily educated generals, there are also generals in medicine and engineering. The rank of the most senior chaplain, (chaplain general), is also usually considered to be a general officer rank.

==Specific rank of general==
In the old European system, a general, without prefix or suffix (and sometimes referred to informally as a &quot;full general&quot;), is usually the most senior type of general, above lieutenant general and directly below field marshal as a four-star rank (NATO OF-9).

Usually it is the most senior peacetime rank, with more senior ranks (for example, field marshal, marshal of the air force, fleet admiral) being used only in wartime or as honorary titles.

In some armies, however, the rank of captain general, general of the army, army general or colonel general occupied or occupies this position. Depending on circumstances and the army in question, these ranks may be considered to be equivalent to a &quot;full&quot; general or to a field marshal five-star rank (NATO OF-10).

The rank of general came about as a &quot;captain-general&quot;, the captain of an army in general (i.e., the whole army). The rank of captain-general began appearing around the time of the organisation of professional armies in the 17th century. In most countries &quot;captain-general&quot; contracted to just &quot;general&quot;.

===General ranks by country===
The following articles deal with the rank of general, or its equivalent, as it is or was employed in the militaries of those countries:
* General (Australia)
* General (Bangladesh)
* General (Canada)
* (China) – People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and Republic of China (ROC/Taiwan)
* General (Denmark), 
* General (Estonia), 
* General (Finland), 
* General (Germany), 
* (Greece)
* General (India)
* (North and South Korea)
* General (Nigeria)
* General (Pakistan)
* General (Poland), 
* General (Sri Lanka)
* General (Sweden), 
* General (Switzerland)
* General (United Kingdom)
* General (United States)
* General (Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army)

====Army generals&#x27; insignia====
====Air force generals&#x27; insignia====
====Naval infantry generals&#x27; insignia====
==Air force and naval equivalents==
Some countries (such as the United States) use the general officer ranks for both the army and the air force, as well as their marine corps; other states only use the general officer ranks for the army, while in the air force they use air officers as the equivalent of general officers. They use the air force rank of air chief marshal as the equivalent of the specific army rank of general. This latter group includes the British Royal Air Force and many current and former Commonwealth air forces—e.g. Royal Australian Air Force, Indian Air Force, Royal New Zealand Air Force, Nigerian Air Force, Pakistan Air Force, etc.

In most navies, flag officers are the equivalent of general officers, and the naval rank of admiral is equivalent to the specific army rank of general. A noteworthy historical exception was the Cromwellian naval rank &quot;general at sea&quot;. In recent years in the American service there is a tendency to use &quot;flag officer&quot; and &quot;flag rank&quot; to refer to generals and admirals of the services collectively.

<doc id="148540" wikidata="Q189965" url="?curid=148540" title="Whitesnake">
<text>Whitesnake are an English rock band formed in London in 1978. The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.

Following the EP &quot;Snakebite&quot; in 1978, Whitesnake released the albums &quot;Trouble&quot; (1978) and &quot;Lovehunter&quot; (1979), which included the live staples &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Love in the Heart of the City&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Shadow of the Blues&quot;. Whitesnake soon began to make a name for themselves across the UK, Europe and Japan, with their subsequent albums &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; (1980), &quot;Live... in the Heart of the City&quot; (1980), &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; (1981) and &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; (1982) all reaching the top ten on the UK Albums Chart. By the mid-1980s, Coverdale had set his sights on North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label Geffen Records, Whitesnake released &quot;Slide It In&quot; in 1984, featuring the singles &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t No Stranger&quot; and &quot;Slow an&#x27; Easy&quot;, which furthered the band&#x27;s exposure through heavy airplay on MTV. In 1987, Whitesnake released their eponymous album &quot;1987&quot;, their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the United States and spawning the hit singles &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot; and &quot;Still of the Night&quot;. Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles glam metal scene.

After releasing &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; in 1989, Coverdale decided to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions related to the release of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1994) and &quot;Restless Heart&quot; (1997), Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; (2008), &quot;Forevermore&quot; (2011), &quot;The Purple Album&quot; (2015), &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; (2019) and toured extensively around the world.

Whitesnake&#x27;s early sound has been characterised by critics as blues rock, but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake&#x27;s lyrics, which make frequent use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the 1988 Brit Awards. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets, while their songs and albums have appeared on many &quot;best of&quot; lists by outlets, such as VH1 and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation, &quot;Snakebite&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; (1976–1978) ===
In March 1976, singer David Coverdale left the English hard rock group Deep Purple. He had joined the band three years prior and recorded three successful albums with them. After leaving Deep Purple, Coverdale released his solo album &quot;White Snake&quot; in February 1977. His second solo album &quot;Northwinds&quot; was released in March 1978. Both combined elements of blues, soul and funk, as Coverdale had wanted to distance himself from the hard rock sound synonymous with Deep Purple. Both records featured former Snafu guitarist Micky Moody, whom Coverdale had known since the late 1960s. Moody was the first to join Coverdale&#x27;s backing band, which he began assembling in London. As stated by Coverdale, &quot;Whitesnake were actually formed to promote &quot;Northwinds&quot; on a one-off promotional tour&quot;. Moody suggested bringing in a second guitarist, with the spot ultimately going to Bernie Marsden, formerly of UFO and Paice Ashton Lord. With his help, the band were able to recruit bassist Neil Murray, who had played with Marsden in Cozy Powell&#x27;s Hammer. The group&#x27;s initial line-up was rounded out by drummer Dave &quot;Duck&quot; Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnson, who had played together in Streetwalkers. Other early candidates for the band were drummers Cozy Powell and Dave Holland, as well as guitarist Mel Galley.
The band, dubbed David Coverdale&#x27;s Whitesnake, played their first show at Lincoln Technical College on 3 March 1978. Their live debut had originally been scheduled for 23 February at the Sky Bird Club in Nottingham, but the show was cancelled. Coverdale had originally wanted the group to be simply called Whitesnake, but was forced to use his own name as it still carried some clout as the former lead singer of Deep Purple. In a 2009 interview with &quot;Metro&quot;, Coverdale jokingly stated that the name &quot;Whitesnake&quot; was a euphemism for his penis. In fact, it came from the song of the same name found on his first solo album.

After completing a small UK club tour, the band adjourned to a rehearsal place in London&#x27;s West End to begin writing new songs. They soon caught the attention of EMI International&#x27;s Robbie Dennis, who wanted to sign the group. According to Bernie Marsden, however, his higher-ups were not ready to commit to a full album. Thus, the band entered London&#x27;s Central Recorders Studio in April 1978 to record an EP. By this point, original keyboardist Brian Johnston had been replaced by Pete Solley. Martin Birch, who had worked with Coverdale during his time in Deep Purple, was chosen to produce.
The resulting record, &quot;Snakebite&quot;, was released in June 1978. In Europe, the EP was combined with four tracks from Coverdale&#x27;s &quot;Northwinds&quot; to make up a full-length album. &quot;Snakebite&quot; contained a slowed down cover of Bobby Bland&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Love in the Heart of the City&quot;, which had originally been used by the band to audition bass players. While the song was only included because the group were short on songs, the track would later become a popular live staple at Whitesnake concerts, with Coverdale calling it &quot;the national anthem of the Whitesnake choir&quot;, referring to the band&#x27;s audience. When &quot;Snakebite&quot; reached number 61 on the UK Singles Chart, the band were duly signed to EMI proper.

In July 1978, the band (now known simply as Whitesnake) entered Central Recorders in London to begin work on their first proper studio album with Martin Birch once again producing. The recording and mixing only took ten days. Towards the end of the sessions, Pete Solley&#x27;s keyboard parts were completely replaced by Coverdale&#x27;s former Deep Purple bandmate Jon Lord, who agreed to join Whitesnake after much coaxing from Coverdale. Colin Towns and Tony Ashton had also been approached, having previously played with fellow Deep Purple offshoots the Ian Gillan Band and Paice Ashton Lord, respectively.

Whitesnake&#x27;s debut album &quot;Trouble&quot; was released in October 1978, and it reached number 50 on the UK Albums Chart. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia stated: &quot;A few unexpected oddities throw the album off-balance here and there, [...] but all things considered, it is easy to understand why &quot;Trouble&quot; turned out to be the first step in a long, and very successful career.&quot; The release of &quot;Trouble&quot; was followed by an 18-date UK tour, beginning on 26 October 1978. The final show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London was recorded and released in Japan as &quot;Live at Hammersmith&quot;. According to Coverdale, this was done to appease Japanese promoters who allegedly refused to book Whitesnake without some kind of a live recording.

=== &quot;Lovehunter&quot; and &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; (1979–1980) ===
Whitesnake embarked on their first continental European tour on 9 February 1979 in Germany. In April, they began recording their second album at Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire, where Coverdale had previously worked with Deep Purple. Martin Birch returned to produce and the band employed the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio to record. Bernie Marsden later described the resulting record as a &quot;transition album&quot;, where the band really began to &quot;blossom&quot; and find their footing. The album also included the live staple &quot;Walking in the Shadow of the Blues&quot;, which Coverdale felt &quot;really summed up my musical approach of the time&quot;.

Before the record&#x27;s release, drummer Dave &quot;Duck&quot; Dowle was replaced by Ian Paice, Coverdale and Lord&#x27;s former Deep Purple bandmate. There is some contention as to the nature of Dowle&#x27;s departure. Coverdale has maintained that Dowle&#x27;s lacking performance on the album and unwillingness to &quot;take constructive criticism&quot; led to his firing. Bernie Marsden, meanwhile, asserted that Dowle left because he didn&#x27;t like being at Clearwell Castle and away from his family. The idea of Paice re-recording Dowle&#x27;s drum parts was considered, but ultimately rejected by the band&#x27;s management due to the alleged cost. Paice&#x27;s addition also spurred speculation from the British music press about Coverdale mounting a Deep Purple reunion, which he denied. Coverdale later remarked how Paice joining the band felt like &quot;truly the beginning of Whitesnake&quot;, where all the members were &quot;performing at [their] absolute best&quot; and &quot;inspiring the best out of each other&quot;.

&quot;Lovehunter&quot;, Whitesnake&#x27;s second album, was released in October 1979, and it reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Sounds&quot; gave the record a positive review, while AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia was more mixed, commending many of the songs, but criticizing the band&#x27;s studio performance as &quot;strangely tame&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art, depicting a naked woman straddling a giant serpent, caused some controversy when the record was released. Whitesnake had already received criticism from the British music press for their alleged sexist lyrics. The cover art for &quot;Lovehunter&quot;, done by artist Chris Achilleos, was reportedly commissioned to &quot;just piss [the critics] off even more&quot;. In North America, a sticker was placed on the cover to hide the woman&#x27;s buttocks, while in Argentina the cover art was modified so that the woman wore a chain-mail bikini. Nevertheless, Whitesnake began a supporting tour for &quot;Lovehunter&quot; on 11 October 1979 in the UK, followed by dates in Europe.
After completing the supporting tour for &quot;Lovehunter&quot;, Whitesnake promptly started work on their third album at Ridge Farm Studios, with Martin Birch once again producing. The resulting record, &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;, was released on 31 May 1980, and it reached number six on the UK Albums Chart. It also became the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the US, where it reached number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Its success was helped by the lead single &quot;Fool for Your Loving&quot;, which reached number 13 and number 53 in the UK and the US, respectively. Geoff Barton, writing for &quot;Sounds&quot;, gave &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; a positive review, awarding it four stars out of five. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic commended the band&#x27;s growing consistency, but still described the production as &quot;flat&quot;. Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden later named &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; their favourite Whitesnake album. In the UK, the record was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 100,000 copies. 

In support of &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;, Whitesnake toured the US for the first time supporting Jethro Tull. Later that year, they supported AC/DC in Europe. With the benefit of a hit single, Whitesnake&#x27;s audience in the UK began to grow. Thus, the band recorded and released the double live album &quot;Live... in the Heart of the City&quot;. The record combined new material recorded in June 1980 at the Hammersmith Odeon with the previously released &quot;Live at Hammersmith&quot; album. &quot;Live... in the Heart of the City&quot; proved to be an even bigger success than &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;, reaching number five in the UK. It would later go platinum, with sales of over 300,000 copies. In North America, the album was released as a single record version, excluding the live material from 1978.

=== &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; and &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; (1981–1982) ===
In early 1981, Whitesnake began recording their fourth studio album with producer Martin Birch at Ringo Starr&#x27;s Startling Studios in Ascot, Berkshire. After the success of &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; and &quot;Live... in the Heart of the City&quot;, Whitesnake were riding high with the atmosphere in the studio being described by Coverdale as &quot;great&quot; and &quot;positive&quot;. The resulting record, &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot;, was released on 6 April 1981. Charting in seven countries, it gave the group their highest ever UK chart position at number two. That same year, the album was certified gold. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart Again&quot; also charted at number seventeen in the UK. &quot;Circus&quot; magazine gave the album a positive review, which proclaimed: &quot;[Whitesnake] has made its claim to rock history with &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot;, which even stands ahead of classic hard rock in the Free mold.&quot; Coverdale later named the record his favorite album of the band&#x27;s early years, stating: &quot;Even though we had some great songs on each album, I don&#x27;t feel that we came as close as we did on [&quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot;], as far as consistency is concerned.&quot;
Whitesnake kicked off the supporting tour for &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; on 14 April 1981 in Germany. During the tour, the band performed five nights at the Hammersmith Odeon and eight dates in Japan. They also played the US in July, supporting Judas Priest with Iron Maiden. At the 1981 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, Whitesnake were direct support for headliners AC/DC. The supporting tour for &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; lasted approximately five months.

In late 1981, Coverdale retreated to a small villa in southern Portugal to begin writing the band&#x27;s next album. After returning to England, he and the rest of Whitesnake gathered at Nomis Studios in London to begin rehearsals. However, as Coverdale would later explain: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t that &#x27;spark&#x27; that was usually in attendance. It felt more of an effort to be there.&quot; Micky Moody later stated that by the end of 1981, the band had become tired, partially from &quot;too many late nights, too much partying&quot;. In an effort to lift their collective spirits, Whitesnake returned to Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire, where they had recorded &quot;Lovehunter&quot;. Though morale still remained low, the band were able to record the basic tracks for their next album. Guy Bidmead replaced producer Martin Birch, who was reportedly too ill to work at the time (Birch did eventually return when recording moved to Britannia Row.). This exacerbated the band&#x27;s ever worsening mental state.

To make matters worse, the band were experiencing financial troubles with Moody recalling: &quot;We weren&#x27;t making nowhere near the kind of money we should have been making. Whitesnake always seemed to be in debt, and I thought &#x27;What is this?, we&#x27;re playing in some of the biggest places and we&#x27;re still being told we&#x27;re in debt, where is all the money going?&#x27;.&quot; Eventually, Moody became fed up with the situation and left Whitesnake in December 1981. The remaining band members blamed the group&#x27;s management company Seabreeze, headed by Deep Purple&#x27;s former manager John Coletta, for their financial state. According to Bernie Marsden, the band set up a meeting to fire Coletta, but Coverdale failed to show. Instead, Marsden, Neil Murray and Ian Paice were informed that Whitesnake had been put on hold and that they had been fired. Marsden later remarked that &quot;David [Coverdale] decided he would be king of Whitesnake&quot;.

According to Coverdale, his decision to put the band on hold stemmed from his daughter contracting bacterial meningitis. This purportedly gave him the courage to cut ties with Coletta. Coverdale ended up buying himself out of his contracts, which reportedly cost him over a million dollars. As for the firing of Marsden, Murray and Paice, Coverdale felt they lacked the needed enthusiasm to keep working in Whitesnake. Coverdale stated that it was &quot;a business decision, not personal&quot;.

After waiting for his daughter to recuperate and severing ties with the band&#x27;s management, record companies and publishers, Coverdale began putting Whitesnake back together. Micky Moody and Jon Lord agreed to return, while guitarist Mel Galley, bassist Colin Hodgkinson and drummer Cozy Powell were brought in as new members. Coverdale completed the band&#x27;s new record with Martin Birch in October 1982 at Battery Studios in London, with the majority of the album having already been recorded with Marsden, Murray, Paice, Moody and Lord before the hiatus. &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; was released on 15 November 1982. It reached number nine in the UK and charted in eight additional countries. In the UK, the record was certified silver. Chas de Whalley, writing for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, gave the album a lukewarm review. Save for two tracks (&quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;), he characterised the rest of the record as generally mediocre. Conversely, AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia, in a retrospective review, hailed &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; as Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;best album yet&quot;.

By the time &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; was released, Coverdale had signed a new recording contract with American label Geffen Records, who would handle all future Whitesnake releases in North America. In Europe, the band remained with Liberty (a subsidiary of EMI), while in Japan, they signed with Sony. A&amp;R executive John Kalodner, who had been a long-time fan of Coverdale&#x27;s, convinced David Geffen to sign the group. Meeting Geffen and Kalodner had a major impact on Coverdale and his future vision for Whitesnake. He explained: &quot;I&#x27;d been surrounded by a mentality if you make five pounds profit let&#x27;s go to the pub. Whereas David Geffen said to me &#x27;If you can make five dollars profit, why not 50? If 50, why not 500? Why not 50,000, why not five million?&#x27;&quot; Coverdale soon set his sights on breaking through in North America with Kalodner advising him. Meanwhile, Whitesnake began a supporting for &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; on 10 December 1982 in the UK.

=== &quot;Slide It In&quot; (1983–1984) ===

Whitesnake toured across Europe and Japan in early 1983, before starting rehearsals for their next album at Jon Lord&#x27;s house in Oxfordshire. At this time, Coverdale began steering Whitesnake&#x27;s music more towards hard rock, which was emphasised by the additions of Mel Galley and Cozy Powell, whose past projects included Trapeze and Rainbow, respectively. Majority of Whitesnake&#x27;s next album was co-written by Coverdale and Galley, while Micky Moody contributed to only one song. Whitesnake began recording their sixth album at Musicland Studios in Munich with producer Eddie Kramer, who had come recommended by John Kalodner.

In August 1983, Whitesnake headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England. The show was filmed and later released as the band&#x27;s first long-form video, titled &quot;Whitesnake Commandos&quot;. The band also premiered the new single &quot;Guilty of Love&quot;, which was released to coincide with the festival. The entire album had originally been slated for release three weeks prior to the Donington show, but failed to meet the deadline. The band were having problems adapting to Eddie Kramer&#x27;s style of producing, particularly his method of mixing the record. Eventually things came to a head and Kramer was let go. Coverdale then rehired Martin Birch to complete the album. A new release date for the record was set for mid-November with a supporting tour scheduled to start in December.

As Whitesnake finished up a European tour in October 1983, Micky Moody left the group. He later attributed his departure to a growing dissatisfaction working in the band, particularly with Coverdale: &quot;Me and David weren&#x27;t friends and co-writers anymore. [...] David was a guy who five, six years earlier was my best friend. Now he acted as if I wasn&#x27;t there.&quot; Moody also felt uncomfortable with the level of influence he felt John Kalodner was having on the band. As he explained: &quot;I never wanted to be a great big star. [...] I found it difficult to be a rock star, I really did.&quot; Colin Hodgkinson was also let go in late 1983, only to be replaced by his predecessor Neil Murray. Coverdale later explained the decision to rehire Murray by simply stating: &quot;I&#x27;d missed his playing&quot;. Towards the end of 1983, Jon Lord also informed Coverdale of his intention to leave the band, but Coverdale convinced him to stay until the supporting tour for their next album was over. With the line-up changes and troubled production of the album, both the record and its accompanying tour were delayed until early 1984.


According to Coverdale, John Kalodner had convinced him that in order for the band to achieve their full potential, they needed a &quot;guitar hero&quot; that could match Coverdale as a frontman. Therefore, to replace Moody, Coverdale initially looked to Michael Schenker and Adrian Vandenberg. Schenker claims he turned down the offer to join Whitesnake, while Coverdale insists he decided to pass on Schenker. Vandenberg declined the offer to join as well, due to the success he was having with his own band at the time. Coverdale then approached Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes, whom he had met when Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy played some of the same festivals in Europe. Sykes was initially reluctant to join, wanting instead to continue working with Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott, but after several more offers and Lynott&#x27;s blessing he accepted. John Sykes and Neil Murray were officially confirmed as members of Whitesnake in January 1984.

&quot;Slide It In&quot;, Whitesnake&#x27;s sixth studio album, was released on 30 January 1984. On the UK Albums Chart, it reached number nine. The album&#x27;s highest chart position was in Finland, where it reached number four. &quot;Slide It In&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with the production being a common complaint. Dave Dickson, writing for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, called the record &quot;the best thing Whitesnake have yet committed to vinyl&quot;, while &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Jim Reid was highly critical of the lyrical content. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia, in a retrospective review, called &quot;Slide It In&quot; &quot;an even greater triumph&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous works, whereas Garry Bushell of &quot;Sounds&quot; gave the album a particularly scathing review, in which he likened Coverdale&#x27;s voice to that of a &quot;dying dog&quot;.
Whitesnake&#x27;s new line-up made their live debut in Dublin on 17 February 1984. During a tour stop in Germany, Mel Galley broke his arm leaping on top of a parked car. He sustained nerve damage, leaving him unable to play guitar. As a result, Galley was forced to leave Whitesnake. By April 1984, a reunion of Deep Purple&#x27;s Mark II line-up had become imminent, which led to Jon Lord also leaving. He played his final show with Whitesnake on 16 April 1984. That same day, Geffen Records released &quot;Slide It In&quot; in North America. Kalodner had been unimpressed by Martin Birch&#x27;s work on the album and had demanded a complete remix for the American market. Though initially reluctant, Coverdale agreed after a trip to Geffen&#x27;s offices in Los Angeles, where he came to the conclusion that Whitesnake&#x27;s studio approach had become &quot;dated&quot; by American standards. Keith Olsen was brought on board to remix &quot;Slide It In&quot;, while John Sykes and Neil Murray were tasked with re-recording Micky Moody and Colin Hodgkinson&#x27;s parts, respectively. The remixed version of &quot;Slide It In&quot; reached number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. By 1986, the album had sold over 500,000 copies in the US. Critical reception was also positive, with Pete Bishop of &quot;The Pittsburg Press&quot; calling the album &quot;muscular, melodic and musical all together&quot;. 

With the band now left as a four-piece (with Richard Bailey providing keyboards off-stage), Whitesnake supported Dio for several shows in the US, after which they toured Japan as a part of the Super Rock &#x27;84 festival. Later that year, Whitesnake embarked on a six-week North American tour supporting Quiet Riot. To further the band&#x27;s reach in America, Whitesnake shot two music videos for the singles &quot;Slow an&#x27; Easy&quot; and &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t No Stranger&quot;, respectively. Both songs reached the Top Tracks chart in the US. In an effort to take America more seriously, Coverdale also relocated to the US.

=== &quot;1987&quot; (1985–1988) ===
The supporting tour for &quot;Slide It In&quot; came to an end in January 1985, when Whitesnake played two shows at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil. After the tour ended, Cozy Powell parted ways with the band. According to Coverdale, his relationship with Powell had deteriorated increasingly over the course of the tour. After the final show, Coverdale flew to Los Angeles to inform Geffen Records he was letting the rest of the band go. Coverdale was persuaded to keep Sykes involved (as Geffen felt they formed a &quot;strong image together&quot;), while also changing his mind about Murray. Powell, however, was fired. According to Murray, Powell&#x27;s departure was the result of financial disputes. Coverdale would later state that Powell didn&#x27;t feel like the offer he got for his involvement was &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Coverdale and Sykes retreated to the South of France in early 1985 to begin writing the band&#x27;s next album. The sessions proved fruitful and they were joined by Murray, who helped with the arrangements. The new material saw Whitesnake moving further away from their bluesier roots in favour of a more American hard rock sound. John Kalodner also convinced Coverdale to re-record two songs from the &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; album, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot;, which he thought had great potential with better production and arranging. With new material ready, the band then began searching for a new drummer. A reported sixty drummers auditioned for the group, with prolific session drummer Aynsley Dunbar eventually being chosen. Former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Tommy Aldridge was also offered the spot, but an equally satisfactory agreement couldn&#x27;t be reached. Drummer Carmine Appice claimed to have turned down the position due to commitments with his own band King Kobra. Appice would later join Sykes in Blue Murder.

The band began tracking their new record at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver with producer Mike Stone. By early 1986, much of the album had been recorded. When it came time for Coverdale to record his vocals though, he noticed his voice was unusually nasal and off-pitch. After consulting several specialists, it was revealed that Coverdale had contracted a severe sinus infection. After receiving some antibiotics, Coverdale flew to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to resume recording. However, the infection resurfaced which caused Coverdale&#x27;s septum to collapse. He required surgery, followed by a six-month rehabilitation period. Sykes has disputed this, claiming Coverdale was just suffering from nerves and that he used &quot;every excuse possible&quot; not to record his vocals. After recovering from surgery, Coverdale, by his own account, did develop a &quot;mental block&quot; that prevented him from singing. Following some failed sessions with Ron Nevison, Coverdale was finally able to record his vocals with producer Keith Olsen. By late 1986, production on the record was mostly finished. Keyboards were provided by Don Airey and Bill Cuomo, while Adrian Vandenberg was brought in to do some guitar overdubs. Additional guitar parts were also provided by Dann Huff.

By the time the album was finished, Coverdale was the sole remaining member of Whitesnake. &quot;It was a band in disarray...&quot; observed keyboardist Don Airey. &quot;David was four million dollars in debt; didn&#x27;t know if he was coming or going.&quot; Coverdale has claimed that Sykes and Mike Stone were fired after they began conspiring against him by booking studio time and making decisions without his involvement. Stone allegedly suggested bringing in someone else to record Coverdale&#x27;s vocals while he was recovering from surgery. Sykes has denied this, instead claiming that he and other members were systematically fired as soon as they finished recording their parts. Murray and Dunbar had stopped receiving their wages in April 1986, at which point Dunbar immediately left Whitesnake. Murray was still officially a member of the group until January 1987, when he heard Coverdale was putting together a new line-up.
With the help of John Kalodner, Coverdale recruited Adrian Vandenberg and Tommy Aldridge, as well as guitarist Vivian Campbell (formerly of Dio) and bassist Rudy Sarzo (formerly of Quiet Riot) to the band. This new line-up would appear in all the promotional materials for the forthcoming album. Whitesnake also adopted a new image, akin to glam metal bands of the time, in order to appeal more to American audiences. When asked about the band&#x27;s makeover, Coverdale responded: &quot;I&#x27;m competing with people like Jon Bon Jovi. I&#x27;ve gotta look the part.&quot;

&quot;1987&quot; (titled &quot;Whitesnake&quot; in United States and &quot;Serpens Albus&quot; in Japan) was released on 30 March 1987 in Europe and 7 April in North America. It peaked at number eight in the UK, while in the US it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In total, the record charted in 14 countries and quickly became the most commercially successful of the band&#x27;s career, selling over eight million copies in the US alone. Its success also boosted &quot;Slide It In&quot;″s sales to over two million copies in the US. The singles &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot; reached number one and two, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the UK, both reached number nine. The record&#x27;s success was helped by the heavy airplay Whitesnake received on MTV, courtesy of a trilogy of music videos featuring actress and Coverdale&#x27;s future wife Tawny Kitaen. The album was generally well received by critics, though reviews in the UK were less favourable, with Coverdale being accused of &quot;selling out&quot; to America, which he strongly denied. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s J. D. Considine praised the band&#x27;s ability to present old ideas in new and interesting ways, while AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey, in a retrospective review, touted the album as the band&#x27;s best.

The new Whitesnake line-up made their live debut following the record&#x27;s release at the Texxas Jam festival in June 1987. They then toured the US supporting Mötley Crüe on their Girls, Girls, Girls Tour. Beginning on 30 October 1987, Whitesnake embarked on a headlining arena tour, which was temporarily interrupted in April 1988, when Coverdale had a herniated disc removed from his lower back. At the 1988 Brit Awards, the band were nominated for Best British Group, while the album &quot;1987&quot; was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the American Music Awards. 

When the supporting tour for &quot;1987&quot; ended in August 1988, Coverdale informed the rest of the band that the next album would be written by him and Adrian Vandenberg, who had established a fruitful working relationship together. After approximately a month of writing, the band regrouped at Lake Tahoe for three weeks of rehearsals. In December 1988, Vivian Campbell parted ways with the band. The official reason given was &quot;musical differences&quot;. However, Campbell later revealed that his departure was partially due to a falling out between his wife and Tawny Kitaen. This resulted in Campbell&#x27;s wife being barred from the band&#x27;s tour. In addition to this, Vandenberg had made it known that he wanted to be the sole guitarist in Whitesnake, which also played into Campbell&#x27;s departure.

=== &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; (1989–1990) ===
Whitesnake began recording their eighth studio album in January 1989. Bruce Fairbairn was initially chosen to produce, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. The band then hired both Keith Olsen and Mike Clink to produce the record. Coverdale later explained the decision to hire two producers, citing pressure to follow-up the band&#x27;s previous record: &quot;I brought them both in... Just that decision alone tells me I was in fear of failing...&quot; 

During the recording process, Adrian Vandenberg sustained an injury to his wrists while performing some playing exercises. Despite consulting a doctor and significant rest, the injury persisted, leaving Vandenberg unable to play the guitar properly. It wasn&#x27;t until 2003 that he learned the injury was the result of nerve damage sustained in a 1980 car accident. Vandenberg&#x27;s injury caused significant delays to the album, which had originally been slated for release in June–July 1989. Ultimately, Coverdale was forced to find another guitar player to finish the record. He opted to recruit former Frank Zappa and David Lee Roth guitarist Steve Vai, whom he had seen in the 1986 film &quot;Crossroads&quot; a few years earlier. According to Coverdale, he had originally wanted to recruit Vai back then, but John Sykes ultimately rejected the idea. Vai officially joined Whitesnake in March 1989. Vandenberg, meanwhile, was given time to recuperate while Vai recorded the album. Vandenberg is still minimally featured on the finished record.

The lead single from the band&#x27;s new album was a re-recorded version of &quot;Fool for Your Loving&quot;, originally found on 1980&#x27;s &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;. Coverdale had been reluctant to re-record the song, let alone release it as the first single, but Geffen Records hoped to repeat the success of &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; with another older track. Coverdale later admitted it to regretting the decision. &quot;Fool for Your Loving&quot; only peaked at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It fared better on the Album Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number two. The second single &quot;The Deeper the Love&quot; also stalled at number 28 on the Hot 100, while on the Album Rock Tracks chart it reached number four.
&quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; was released on 7 November 1989 in the US, followed by a worldwide release on 13 November. It reached number ten on the UK Albums Chart, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The record also charted in twelve additional countries. &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; was certified platinum in the US and has sold approximately four million copies worldwide by August 1990. As the previous record sold more than twice that in the US alone, &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; was considered a commercial disappointment.

Malcolm Dome, writing for &quot;Raw&quot;, described &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; as &quot;an album full of generally good songs that rarely sinks below the level of adequacy, but only occasionally explodes&quot;. The combination of Whitesnake and Steve Vai was also met with some criticism, with Thom Jurek, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, describing the pairing as &quot;questionable&quot;. Coverdale himself would later admit to having mixed feelings about the record, though he has since learned to enjoy and accept it as a part of Whitesnake&#x27;s catalogue.

In February 1990, Whitesnake embarked on the Liquor &amp; Poker World Tour, during which the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington for a second time (the show was later released as a live album). The final tour date was on 26 September 1990 at the Budokan in Tokyo. After the show, Coverdale informed the rest of the band that he would be taking an extended break, effectively disbanding Whitesnake. He encouraged the band members to accept any outside offers for work. Coverdale&#x27;s decision to put Whitesnake on hold was largely due to exhaustion. Despite the success the band had achieved, he felt unfulfilled. He had also become disillusioned with the band&#x27;s glam image. Coupled with his ongoing divorce from Tawny Kitaen, Coverdale wanted to &quot;take stock and review&quot; to see if he still wanted to continue in the music business.

After Whitesnake disbanded, Steve Vai continued his solo career, having already released his second solo album while on tour with Whitesnake. Vandenberg, Sarzo and Aldridge would go to form the band Manic Eden, who released one album in 1994. Coverdale resurfaced in 1993, when he and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page released an album together.

=== &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Restless Heart&quot; (1994–1997) ===
On 4 July 1994, EMI released &quot;Whitesnake&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; in Europe. In the US, it was released on 19 July by Geffen Records. The record proved to be a success, reaching number four on the UK Albums Chart. It would later be certified gold in the UK and platinum in the US. Prior to the record&#x27;s release, Coverdale had been planning a European solo tour with a backing band he likened to Joe Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot;. Because of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;&#x27; success, Coverdale was instead asked by EMI to tour as Whitesnake. Though reluctant, Coverdale eventually agreed, seeing it as an opportunity to just have fun and play live.

Adrian Vandenberg agreed to rejoin Whitesnake as he and Coverdale were already working on new music together. Vandenberg asked Rudy Sarzo to rejoin as well as they were both still playing in Manic Eden at the time. Sarzo accepted and recommended Ratt guitarist Warren DeMartini to the band. The line-up was then rounded out by keyboardist Paul Mirkovich and drummer Denny Carmassi, the latter of whom had played on the &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; album. The tour began in Europe on 20 June 1994, followed by several UK dates beginning in July. In October, the band toured in Japan and Australia.

After completing the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; tour, Whitesnake were dropped by Geffen Records. Coverdale then resumed writing with Adrian Vandenberg on what was to be a solo album. Joining them in the studio were Denny Carmassi, as well as bassist Guy Pratt and keyboardist Brett Tuggle. As the record was being finished, the new higher-ups at EMI demanded it be released under the Whitesnake moniker. Coverdale objected, as he felt the record was stylistically too different from the band. Eventually a compromise was reached, and Coverdale agreed to release the album under the name &quot;David Coverdale &amp; Whitesnake&quot;. As a result of the name change, the guitars and drums on the album were brought up in the mix, something Coverdale later expressed disappointment over.

&quot;Restless Heart&quot; was released on 26 March 1997 in Japan, followed by a European release on 26 May. The record only reached number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, but peaked number three on UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart. It charted in nine additional countries as well, with its highest chart position being in Sweden at number five. The single &quot;Too Many Tears&quot; only reached number 46 on the UK Singles Chart, but on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Chart it reached number five and charted for 34 weeks. &quot;Restless Heart&quot; didn&#x27;t receive a US release, being available only as an import. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; called the album &quot;nice, but harmless&quot;, and ultimately deemed it &quot;a mean disappointment&quot; as potentially the last Whitesnake album. Jerry Ewing, writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, described it as a &quot;curio&quot; in the band&#x27;s discography, falling somewhere between a Whitesnake album and a David Coverdale solo record.

The supporting tour for &quot;Restless Heart&quot; was billed as Whitesnake&#x27;s farewell tour, as Coverdale wanted to explore other musical avenues. Pratt and Tuggle were replaced by Tony Franklin and Derek Hilland, respectively, while Steve Farris was recruited as a second guitarist. Before the start of the tour, Coverdale and Vandenberg played several acoustic shows in Europe and Japan. One of these shows was later released as the live album &quot;Starkers in Tokyo&quot;. The Last Hurrah tour began in September 1997 and ended in South America that December. After the band&#x27;s disbandment, Coverdale resumed his solo career, releasing the album &quot;Into the Light&quot; in 2000. Vandenberg, meanwhile, began a second career as a painter in order to spend more time with his daughter, who was born in 1999.

=== Reformation and &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; (2003–2009) ===

In October 2002, David Coverdale announced plans to reform Whitesnake to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2003. The new line-up was confirmed in December; Coverdale would be joined by drummer Tommy Aldridge, guitarists Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach, as well as bassist Marco Mendoza and keyboardist Timothy Drury.

Talks had taken place between Coverdale and John Sykes about a possible reunion, but Coverdale ultimately felt that they had been their &quot;own bosses&quot; too long for a reunion to work. Sykes, meanwhile, claimed that after recommending Mendoza and Aldridge for the band (though Aldridge had already been in the band years earlier), he never heard back from Coverdale. Adrian Vandenberg was also asked to rejoin, but declined in order to spend time with his daughter and focus on his painting. He has since made numerous guest appearances at the band&#x27;s concerts.

On 29 January 2003, Whitesnake began a co-headlining tour of the US with the Scorpions. Afterwards, the band toured across Europe, playing several shows with Gary Moore in the UK. Whitesnake then returned to the US to take part in the Rock Never Stops Tour with Warrant, Kip Winger and Slaughter, before embarking on a Japanese tour in September. The reformation was initially planned to last only a few months, but Coverdale ultimately decided to keep the band active. No immediate plans were put in place for a new studio album, with Coverdale citing his dissatisfaction with the music industry as a contributing factor.

Whitesnake continued to tour in late 2004, playing several shows across Europe and the UK. Their London concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in October was also filmed and in 2006 released as &quot;Live... In the Still of the Night&quot;. It was later certified gold in the UK and received the award for &quot;DVD of the Year&quot; at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. In April 2005, Whitesnake parted ways with Marco Mendoza due to scheduling conflicts with Mendoza&#x27;s other projects. Session musician Uriah Duffy was announced as his replacement the following month. Whitesnake then embarked on another US tour, followed by a South American leg. In May 2006, the band played several shows in Japan, which were then followed by festival dates in Europe.
In August 2006, Whitesnake signed a European recording contract with Steamhammer/SPV. The band then released the live album &quot;Live... in the Shadow of the Blues&quot;, which contained four new songs written by Coverdale and guitarist Doug Aldrich. Coverdale&#x27;s change of heart regarding new music stemmed from a need for &quot;new meat to bite into&quot; in order keep touring interesting. Preliminary work on a new Whitesnake album began in early 2007, with Coverdale and Aldrich spending considerable time writing together and refining their joint ideas. A release date was originally set for summer 2007, but the album was later pushed back to October 2007 and then May 2008. Regarding the delays, Coverdale stated: &quot;The recording of this album was constantly compromised by interruptions. [...] Also, to be honest, there was no real rush for us to finish the project quickly.&quot; In December 2007, Chris Frazier was announced as Whitesnake&#x27;s new drummer. Tommy Aldridge reportedly left to pursue other musical projects.

&quot;Good to Be Bad&quot;, Whitesnake&#x27;s tenth studio album, was released on 18 April 2008 in Germany, 21 April in the rest of Europe, and on 22 April in North America. Produced by Coverdale, Aldrich and Michael McIntyre, the record reached number seven on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart. In the US, it only reached number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but it did peak at number eight on the Top Independent Albums chart. In total, &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; charted in 19 countries and has sold over 700,000 copies worldwide by 2011. Writing for IGN, Jim Kaz gave the album a favourable review, in which he stated: &quot;A few faux-pa&#x27;s aside &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; has enough shining, mega-rock moments to endear itself to fans old and new.&quot; It later received the Classic Rock Award for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.

&quot;Good to Be Bad&quot;″s release was preceded by several shows in Australia and New Zealand, after which Whitesnake toured South America, followed by a UK co-headlining tour with Def Leppard. They also played select shows together in Central Europe. In October, Whitesnake teamed up with Def Leppard again for two co-headlining shows in Japan. The following November, Whitesnake played several shows in Germany with Alice Cooper. The band also performed in Israel and Cyprus. Following several European festival dates, Whitesnake embarked on a US co-headlining tour with Judas Priest in July 2009. On 11 August, however, Whitesnake were forced to cut their concert in Denver short, after Coverdale experienced severe pain in his vocal cords. After consulting a specialist, he was revealed to be suffering from severe vocal fold edema and a left vocal fold vascular lesion. As a result, Whitesnake canceled their remaining tour dates.

=== &quot;Forevermore&quot; and &quot;The Purple Album&quot; (2010–2017) ===
The band took a break from touring in 2010 to concentrate on writing a new album. They also signed a new recording contract with Frontiers Records. In June, Uriah Duffy and Chris Frazier left Whitesnake, with latter being replaced by former Billy Idol and Foreigner drummer Brian Tichy. Michael Devin, formerly of Lynch Mob, was revealed as the band&#x27;s new bassist the following August. In September, Timothy Drury announced his departure to pursue a solo career.

&quot;Forevermore&quot;, Whitesnake&#x27;s eleventh studio album, was released on 25 March 2011 in Europe, followed by a North American release on 29 March. Once again produced by Coverdale, Aldrich and Michael McIntyre at Lake Tahoe, &quot;Forevermore&quot; reached number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 2 on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart. It reached number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while on the Independent Albums chart it peaked at number ten. The record&#x27;s highest chart position was in Sweden at number six. As of May 2015, &quot;Forevermore&quot; has sold 44,000 copies in the US. Thom Jurek of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, in which he proclaimed: &quot;&quot;Forevermore&quot;, despite its tighter arrangements and more polished production is Whitesnake at its Brit hard rock best.&quot;

A supporting tour kicked off in New York on 11 May 2011. Accompanying the band was keyboardist Brian Ruedy. After several dates in the US, the tour continued across Europe. During the band&#x27;s performance at the Sweden Rock Festival, they were joined onstage by former guitarist Bernie Marsden. In October, Whitesnake played the Loud Park festival in Japan. During the tour, the band sold charity scarves as a humanitarian response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
Whitesnake took another hiatus in 2012 to compile live recordings from the &quot;Forevermore&quot; tour, which were released the following year as &quot;Made in Japan&quot; and &quot;Made in Britain/The World Record&quot;. In January 2013, Brian Tichy announced his departure from Whitesnake, in order to concentrate on his other band S.U.N. He was replaced by Tommy Aldridge, who rejoined the band for a second time. That May, Whitesnake initially toured in Japan, and then embarked on a UK co-headlining tour with Journey, followed by several dates in Europe. During the band&#x27;s performance in Manchester, they were once again joined onstage by Bernie Marsden. In June, Whitesnake played several co-headlining dates with Def Leppard in Spain. Following a North American tour, Whitesnake played Brazil at the Monsters of Rock festival in October. In May 2014, Doug Aldrich announced his departure from the band. He later explained his decision to leave, citing a need for a more flexible schedule to work on other projects and spend more time with his son. Night Ranger guitarist Joel Hoekstra was announced as his replacement the following August.

Whitesnake released their twelfth studio album, titled &quot;The Purple Album&quot;, on 15 May 2015 in Europe, followed by a North American release on 19 May. A collection of re-recorded songs from Coverdale&#x27;s time in Deep Purple, the idea sprang from talks he and Jon Lord had had about a possible Mark III reunion a few years earlier. After Lord&#x27;s death in 2012, Coverdale discussed the idea with Ritchie Blackmore, but they were unable to come to an agreement regarding the nature of the undertaking. Coverdale then decided to move forward with the project under the Whitesnake banner. He described the resulting record as a tribute to his time in Deep Purple.

&quot;The Purple Album&quot; reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart, while in the US it peaked at number 87. On the Independent Albums chart, it reached number nine, while in Japan it reached number eight. In its first week, the record sold 6,900 copies in the US. While the Associated Press commended the band for breathing new life into the songs, Dave Everley of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; called &quot;The Purple Album&quot; a &quot;wrong-headed travesty of an album&quot;. Responding to the criticism, Coverdale proclaimed: &quot;I&#x27;ve no space in my life for haters or negaters. [...] I owe those people nothing. Such opinions mean nothing to me.&quot; &quot;The Purple Album&quot; had been envisioned by Coverdale as potentially his last album before retiring. However, the process left him &quot;revitalised&quot; and eager to continue further.
Whitesnake kicked off the North American leg of The Purple Tour in May 2015. Joining the band was new keyboardist Michele Luppi. At a show in California, they were joined onstage by Coverdale&#x27;s former Deep Purple bandmate Glenn Hughes. Beginning in October, the band toured in Japan. In December, Whitesnake teamed up with Def Leppard for tour of the UK and Ireland. In Sheffield, Whitesnake were joined onstage by former guitarist Vivian Campbell (who has been a member of Def Leppard since 1992). In 2016, Whitesnake embarked on the Greatest Hits Tour, which saw them perform across Europe and the US. Before the tour, Coverdale revealed his plans to potentially retire in 2017, though he later recanted the statement.

In August 2017, Whitesnake signed a new distribution deal for North America and Japan with Rhino Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Tentative plans to release a new album the following year were also announced. In October 2017, Whitesnake&#x27;s eponymous album was reissued as a four-disc box set to commemorate its 30th anniversary. The band had planned a joint tour where they would have played the album in its entirety, but instead opted to take a break and focus on writing a new album. In December, a photography book chronicling The Purple Tour was released.

=== &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; and farewell tour (2018–present) ===
In 2018, Whitesnake toured the US with Foreigner on the Juke Box Heroes Tour. They also released &quot;The Purple Tour&quot; live album and the box set &quot;Unzipped&quot;, which featured various acoustic recordings from across the band&#x27;s career. Whitesnake&#x27;s thirteenth studio album had originally been set for release in early 2018, but was pushed back after Coverdale contracted H3 flu. In April 2018, the record was delayed again to early 2019 due to unspecified &quot;technical issues&quot; during the mixing process. Coverdale also had knee replacement surgery in 2018 due to degenerative arthritis. However, he later reiterated his plans not to retire, stating that he feels &quot;reinvigorated, energised and very inspired&quot;.
Whitesnake&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; was released on 10 May 2019. It saw Coverdale compose with Reb Beach and Joel Hoekstra for the first time, while production was handled by all three of them along with Michael McIntyre. &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; charted in eighteen countries, reaching number seven and number 131 in the UK and the US, respectively. It also topped the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart, and hit number five on the Independent Albums chart. Philip Wilding, writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, gave the record a positive review, in which he stated: &quot;If you want something to listen to while driving with the top down in some steamy Californian clime, then this Whitesnake is hard to beat.&quot;

The band embarked on a supporting tour in April with dates in North America, followed by a European tour over the summer. In September, Coverdale once again discussed the possibility of retiring, potentially in 2021, though he later clarified: &quot;I just thought it was amusing to say, &#x27;Oh, what better age for the lead singer of Whitesnake [to retire] than 69? I can&#x27;t wait to design the t-shirts.&#x27; That was just fun.&quot; Whitesnake were scheduled to tour Australia and New Zealand with the Scorpions in February 2020, but many of the shows had to be cancelled after Scorpions vocalist Klaus Meine was diagnosed with kidney stones. Whitesnake&#x27;s Japanese tour in March was also postponed due to the then-burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic. Whitesnake later canceled all their remaining tour dates for 2020 when Coverdale was diagnosed with a bilateral inguinal hernia, for which he was forced to undergo surgery. 

Between 2020 and 2021, Whitesnake released three new musically distinct compilation albums, collectively titled the &quot;Red, White and Blues&quot; trilogy. All three albums reached at least number two on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart. The collections were originally timed to coincide with a potential farewell tour, which had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Coverdale later reaffirmed his plan to retire from touring potentially in 2022, citing his age and the stress of travel as contributing factors. However, he still intended to be involved in music with several Whitesnake projects in the works. Coverdale also discussed the possibility of Whitesnake continuing to perform without him.
In July 2021, Whitesnake announced the addition of multi-instrumentalist Dino Jelusick to their ranks, turning Whitesnake into a septet for the first time. Later that November, Michael Devin parted ways with the band. He was replaced by Tanya O&#x27;Callaghan, marking the first female musician to join the group.

Whitesnake began their farewell tour in May 2022, starting in the UK and Ireland with Foreigner and Europe. During Whitesnake&#x27;s June performance at Hellfest, they were joined onstage by Steve Vai. Later that month, the band were forced to cancel several shows after Tommy Aldridge fell ill and Coverdale was diagnosed with an infection of the sinus and trachea. Reb Beach had previously missed a number of shows due to poor health as well. On 1 July, Whitesnake cancelled the remainder of their European tour. On 5 August, the band withdrew from their forthcoming North American tour with the Scorpions. O&#x27;Callaghan stated in October that Coverdale still needed &quot;a good few months&quot; to recuperate. However, he had resumed writing and discussed the possibility of doing a farewell album, encouraging former members to participate as well. In 2023, Coverdale expressed interest in continuing the band&#x27;s farewell tour in the future, but stated that his physical health would be the determining factor.

== Style and influences ==

=== Music ===
David Coverdale&#x27;s original vision for Whitesnake was to create a blues-based, melodic hard rock band. He wanted to combine elements of hard rock, R&amp;B and blues with &quot;good commercial hooks&quot;. Coverdale&#x27;s earliest influences included The Pretty Things and The Yardbirds, who combined blues and soul with electrified rock, a style Coverdale found more appealing to traditional twelve-bar blues structures. Another major influence on Whitesnake&#x27;s sound was The Allman Brothers Band, particularly their first album. Whitesnake&#x27;s other early influences included Cream, Mountain, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, Jeff Beck (particularly the albums &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot;), Paul Butterfield, and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers (particularly &quot;The Beano Album&quot;).

As the band began playing and writing together, their sound developed further into what has been described by music critics as their blues rock period, which encompasses roughly the first five Whitesnake studio albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Richard Bienstock described their early sound as &quot;bloozy, sexed-up pub-rock&quot;. Dave Ling, writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, described &quot;Walking in the Shadow of the Blues&quot; as &quot;a textbook fusion of blues, hard rock and melody&quot;. Micky Moody and Neil Murray have felt that Whitesnake didn&#x27;t truly find their sound until &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot;. Coverdale has seconded this, stating that &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; was the beginning of what Whitesnake should have sounded like from the start.

Beginning with &quot;Slide It In&quot;, Whitesnake&#x27;s sound developed more into straightforward hard rock. Neil Murray acknowledged that by 1983 the band&#x27;s sound had become &quot;repetitive&quot; and &quot;stale&quot;. Coverdale later expressed his desire for the band&#x27;s blues elements to &quot;rock more&quot;. Additionally, Murray attributed this shift partially to John Kalodner, who began pushing Whitesnake in a heavier, more guitar-based, &quot;American-sounding&quot; direction. John Sykes also played a pivotal role in Whitesnake&#x27;s evolution, with Murray remarking how Sykes wanted the band to be more &quot;American style&quot;. Regardless, music journalist Jerry Ewing described the change as a &quot;natural progression&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous albums.

The band&#x27;s eponymous album saw Whitesnake moving towards a sound Coverdale described as &quot;leaner, meaner and more electrifying&quot;. This later period of Whitesnake&#x27;s career has been described by music critics as hard rock, heavy metal, and glam metal. Coverdale would later admit that by the late 1980s, Whitesnake had become a &quot;heavy metal comic&quot;, stating: &quot;If people confuse Whitesnake with Mötley Crüe or any of these things, looking at the pictures [...] you can understand why.&quot; Musically though, Coverdale has rejected the notion that Whitesnake were ever a heavy metal band.

Since reforming the band in 2003, Coverdale has attempted to combine elements of Whitesnake&#x27;s early sound with their later hard rock style on their most recent studio albums. However, music critics have noted that Whitesnake&#x27;s style has remained most consistent with their late 1980s output, with Philip Wilding of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in his review for &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; stating: &quot;Those hoping that the new Whitesnake album record will recall Coverdale&#x27;s smoky, &quot;Lovehunter&quot; past should look away now. [...] Coverdale understood American radio in the 80s, and that might be why he still writes for it.&quot;

==== Comparisons to Led Zeppelin ====

As Whitesnake&#x27;s style evolved in the mid to late 1980s, they began to draw unfavourable comparisons to Led Zeppelin. Tracks like &quot;Slow an&#x27; Easy&quot;, &quot;Still of the Night&quot; and &quot;Judgement Day&quot; have been accused of copying Led Zeppelin, while David Coverdale has been accused of imitating singer Robert Plant. Responding to the claims, Coverdale jokingly stated in 1987: &quot;I guess it&#x27;s quite a compliment to be placed in a class like that.&quot; The comparison was exacerbated when Coverdale teamed up with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page to release the album &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; in 1993. In the press, Plant would refer to Coverdale as &quot;David Cover-version&quot; among other taunts, which was not well received by Coverdale nor Page.

Coverdale denied any notion of plagiarism, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how accurate the comparison is. People shouldn&#x27;t forget that I worked in Deep Purple for a number of years, so my pedigree in hard rock is quite strong. I understand that bands like Whitesnake, Purple and Led Zeppelin all play a solid powerful brand of rock, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re coming from the same place musically.&quot; Neil Murray laid some of the blame on John Kalodner, who he claimed began pushing Whitesnake in a more Led Zeppelin-like direction. As for the comparisons to Plant, Coverdale said they are &quot;both from a similar school of influences and inspirations and singers [...] I can tell you precisely who Robert listened to to develop the voice he has, which is Stevie Marriott and Terry Reid and that screaming blues voice isn&#x27;t copyrighted by Robert and that&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve grown up doing too&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
Coverdale has stated that lyrically all of his songs are love songs at their core. He has described them as diaries of particular times in his life. Nearly all of Whitesnake&#x27;s studio albums feature one or more songs with &quot;love&quot; in the title. Coverdale has maintained that this hasn&#x27;t been a conscious decision, rather he considers love his primary source of inspiration. He has also attributed some of Whitesnake&#x27;s longevity to the lyrics&#x27; &quot;human themes&quot;, whether physical or emotional.

Whitesnake and main lyricist Coverdale have been heavily criticised by the music press for their excessive use of double entendres and sexual innuendos, most egregiously on tracks such as &quot;Slide It In&quot;, &quot;Slow an&#x27; Easy&quot; and &quot;Spit It Out&quot;. Such criticism began in the late 1970s and was further inflamed with the &quot;Lovehunter&quot; (1979) cover art. Micky Moody, Bernie Marsden and Jon Lord have expressed some discomfort over the band&#x27;s lyrical content. Coverdale has reiterated that some of his lyrics are meant to provoke laughter more than anything else, stating: &quot;If I look at sex as an observer [...] there&#x27;s humour also as well as the serious nitty-gritty stuff and I like to write about this as well.&quot; He also added that many of his songs are tongue-in-cheek and inspired by his own experiences, not uncommon to other people as well. The lyrics along with his stage personality &quot;solidified an image of Coverdale: the preening, tight-trousered lothario&quot;, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Michael Hann, who also noted that although often ridiculed by the media, by 2015 &quot;there&#x27;s a certain affection for his magnificently preposterous persona&quot;.

Coverdale has repeatedly denied any accusations of misogyny or sexism. &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted in 2003 that Coverdale &quot;comes from a bygone era&quot;, while songs like &quot;Slide it In&quot; and &quot;Slow an&#x27; Easy&quot; show not only &quot;the blues aspect of Whitesnake&quot;, but also &quot;the tongue in cheek humor that Coverdale is so fond of&quot;. Marsden also conceded that while many of Coverdale&#x27;s lyrics are not entirely politically correct in a contemporary setting, they were written &quot;completely tongue-in-cheek&quot; and are more a product of a bygone era. Music journalist Malcolm Dome compared some of Whitesnake&#x27;s more suggestive lyrics to a &quot;Carry On&quot; film with their tongue-in-cheek sensibilities, also noting how in his opinion Coverdale has written songs with &quot;some real depth and lyrical awareness&quot; like &quot;Sailing Ships&quot; and &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t No Stranger&quot;.

<text>The University of Illinois System is a system of public universities in the U.S. state of Illinois, consisting of three campuses located in Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign. Across all campuses, the University of Illinois System enrolls more than 94,000 students. It had an operating budget of $7.18 billion in 2021. Its oldest university, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, was established as the state&#x27;s land grant university in 1867.

==Organization==

The University of Illinois System consists of three campuses in Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Chicago, and Springfield. The university in Urbana-Champaign is known as &quot;Illinois&quot;, &quot;U of I&quot;, or &quot;UIUC&quot;, whereas the Chicago campus is known as &quot;UIC&quot; and the Springfield campus as &quot;UIS&quot;.

The system is governed by a board of trustees consisting of thirteen members: the governor of Illinois serves as an ex officio member, nine trustees are appointed by the governor of Illinois, and a student trustee elected by referendum represents each of the system&#x27;s three universities. One of the three student trustees is designated by the governor to have a vote.

The U of I System is led by the president, an executive vice president, a CFO/vice president of finance, a vice president for economic development and innovation, and the chancellors that lead each of the three universities. System leadership works to develop strategies and solutions to address educational and administrative challenges across the system. Centralized system offices staff support the work of the three universities by providing critical services that are vital to its missions.

===Chicago===

The largest university in the Chicago area, UIC serves approximately 34,000 students within 16 colleges &amp; schools including Applied Health Sciences, Architecture, Design, and the Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Graduate, Honors, Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, Social Work, Urban Planning &amp; Public Affairs, Law, and the College of Medicine (largest branch of three branches of the medical school) which is one of the nation&#x27;s largest medical schools. With annual research expenditures exceeding $394 million, UIC is one of five doctoral research universities in the State of Illinois. Playing a critical role in Illinois healthcare, UIC operates the state&#x27;s major public medical center and serves as the principal educator of Illinois&#x27; physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other healthcare professionals. The University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System (a.k.a. &quot;UI Health&quot;), which includes the hospital, clinics, and health science colleges, is a part of UIC.

The modern UIC was formed in 1982 by the consolidation of two campuses: the Medical Center campus, which dates back to the 19th century; and the comprehensive Chicago Circle campus, which in 1965 replaced the two-year undergraduate Navy Pier campus designated to educate returning veterans.

===Springfield===
The newest university in the system is University of Illinois Springfield. It is located in Springfield, the state capital of Illinois. When it opened in 1969, it was named Sangamon State University, and was exclusively an upper-level university, serving only upperclassmen and graduate students. In 1995, Sangamon State joined the University of Illinois system and was renamed as the University of Illinois Springfield. The University of Illinois System then transitioned the school from an upper division university into a full four-year institution with an undergraduate program.

UIS is the smallest university in the University of Illinois System, with an enrollment of approximately 4,000 students. UIS offers more than 50 degree-granting programs. The academic curriculum of the university emphasizes a liberal arts core, an array of professional programs, opportunities in experiential education, and an engagement in public affairs issues in its academic and community service pursuits. UIS has the lowest student/teacher ratio of all three universities in the U of I System.

===Urbana–Champaign===


The Urbana-Champaign campus was founded in 1867 as the Illinois Industrial University. It was one of the 37 public land-grant institutions created shortly after Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act in 1862. The university changed its name to University of Illinois in 1885, and then again to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1982. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is the largest and most prestigious of the three universities, enrolling more than 56,000 students. UIUC, or more commonly &quot;ILLINOIS&quot;, is home to 17 colleges and instructional units including the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences; College of Applied Health Sciences; the Gies College of Business; College of Education; the Grainger College of Engineering; College of Fine and Applied Arts; Division of General Studies; Graduate College; School of Labor and Employment Relations; College of Law; College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; School of Information Sciences; College of Media; Carle Illinois College of Medicine; School of Social Work; and the College of Veterinary Medicine.

It is also home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, NCSA, where Marc Andreessen (of Netscape fame) and others helped develop the Mosaic web browser, the first HTML browser capable of rendering images. In addition, in 1987, NCSA created NCSA Telnet, a program which permitted users access to the supercomputer&#x27;s resources remotely. The petascale Blue Waters was among the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputers when it went into service in 2012.

UIUC and its alumni are particularly well known for their contributions to engineering, including inventions such as the LED, plasma screen, and the integrated circuit. The library is notable both for being the largest public academic library in the country, with over forty departmental libraries, and for possessing over twelve million volumes. Each year, the library circulates about 1.2 million items and answers about 293,000 reference questions. The university is highly ranked in psychology, engineering, law, library and information science, chemistry, computer science, labor and industrial relations, educational psychology, finance, accounting, business administration, communication, and music. Physics professor John Bardeen won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice in his lifetime, an honor no other researcher has received. The school&#x27;s marching band, named the Marching Illini, also enjoys a superb reputation. Until 2007, the symbol of the university&#x27;s athletic teams was a Native American figure, Chief Illiniwek, which sparked significant controversy. Chief Illiniwek completed his last performance on February 21, 2007, and has since been retired from performing and as the official symbol of the school.

Currently the university boasts the world&#x27;s most technologically advanced Computer Science building, Siebel Center, as well as many other world-class research laboratories such as the Electrical and Computer Engineering Building and the Loomis Laboratory of Physics.

===Discovery Partners Institute===

In 2017 the University of Illinois System launched the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI), a center for tech workforce development and applied R&amp;D in Chicago. Its primary goals are to prepare individuals for careers in Illinois-based tech companies and to bring academic expertise and tech company know-how together within a dedicated building. The DPI is currently located at 200 S. Wacker Dr., with plans for construction within The 78, in Chicago&#x27;s South Loop. It is part of the Illinois Innovation Network led by the University of Illinois System.

===SHIELD Illinois===

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Illinois System established the SHIELD Deployment Unit (&quot;SHIELD Illinois&quot;) to provide the saliva-based covidSHIELD SARS-CoV-2 assay, which was developed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, throughout the state of Illinois. SHIELD Illinois eventually performed over 7.2 million SARS-CoV-2 tests at over 2,300 sites including approximately 1,700 K-12 schools.

==Foundation==
The University of Illinois Foundation is the official fundraising and gift agency of the University of Illinois System. It operates on behalf of the three institutions within the U of I system including the hospital in Chicago. Most of the $3.82 billion endowment is assigned to support the Urbana campus, which is the oldest and largest part of the system.

==Alumni associations==
Each of the three universities has an alumni organization: the University of Illinois Alumni Association (Urbana-Champaign), the UIC Alumni Association, and University of Illinois Springfield Alumni Relations. Collectively, the University of Illinois System has one of the world&#x27;s largest alumni networks with more than 810,000 members internationally.

<doc id="148545" wikidata="Q48175" url="?curid=148545" title="Holy Land">
<text>The Holy Land is an area roughly located between the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern bank of the Jordan River, traditionally synonymous both with the biblical Land of Israel and with the region of Palestine. Today, the term &quot;Holy Land&quot; usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern states of Israel and Palestine. Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baháʼís regard it as holy.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the religious significance of Jerusalem (the holiest city to Judaism, and the location of the First and Second Temples), as well as its historical significance as the setting for most of the Bible, the historical locale of Jesus&#x27; ministry, the location of the first Qibla before Kaaba in Mecca and the site of the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj event in Islam, and the site of the most revered pilgrimage sites in the Baháʼí Faith.

The holiness of the land as a destination of Christian pilgrimage contributed to launching the Crusades, as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from Muslims, who had conquered it from the Christian Eastern Roman Empire in AD 630. In the 19th century, the Holy Land became the subject of diplomatic wrangling as the holy places played a role in the Eastern Question which led to the Crimean War in the 1850s. The Holy Land is currently the site of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been pilgrimage destinations for adherents of the Abrahamic religions, including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baháʼís. Pilgrims visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their faith, to confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and to connect personally to the Holy Land.

==Judaism==


Researchers consider that the concept of a land made holy by being the &quot;earthly dwelling of the God of Israel&quot; was present in Judaism at the latest by the time of Zechariah (6th century BCE).

Jews commonly refer to the Land of Israel as &quot;The Holy Land&quot; (Hebrew: ). The Tanakh explicitly refers to it as &quot;holy land&quot; in Zechariah 2:16. The term &quot;holy land&quot; is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books (Wisdom 12:3, 2 Maccabees 1:7). The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied by the Tanakh&#x27;s claim that the Land was given to the Israelites by God, that is, it is the &quot;Promised Land&quot;, an integral part of God&#x27;s covenant.

In the Torah, many mitzvot commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel, which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, &quot;no land shall be sold permanently&quot; (Leviticus 25:23). Shmita is only observed with respect to the Land of Israel, and the observance of many holy days is different, as an extra day is observed in the Jewish diaspora.

According to Eliezer Schweid:

From the perspective of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the &quot;Four Holy Cities&quot;: Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed and Tiberias – as Judaism&#x27;s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the Temple, is considered especially significant. Sacred burials are still undertaken for diaspora Jews who wish to lie buried in the holy soil of Israel.

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount Moriah, the location of the binding of Isaac. The Hebrew Bible mentions the name &quot;Jerusalem&quot; 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name &quot;Zion&quot;, which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The Talmud mentions the religious duty of populating Israel. So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of Sabbath observance to further its acquisition and settlement. Rabbi Johanan said that &quot;Whoever walks four cubits in Eretz Yisrael [the Land of Israel] is guaranteed entrance to the World to Come&quot;. A story says that when R. Eleazar b. Shammua&#x27; and R. Johanan HaSandlar left Israel to study from R. Judah ben Bathyra, they only managed to reach Sidon when &quot;the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back&quot;. Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said &quot;To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar.&quot; The saying &quot;His land will absolve His people&quot; implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one&#x27;s sins.

==Christianity==

For Christians, the Holy Land is considered holy because of its association with the birth, ministry, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, whom Christians regard as the incarnation of God and the Messiah. 

Christian books, including many editions of the Bible, often have maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, and Judea). For instance, the () of Heinrich Bünting (1545–1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map. His book was very popular, and it provided &quot;the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments.&quot;

As a geographic term, the description &quot;Holy Land&quot; loosely encompasses modern-day Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, western Jordan and south-western Syria.

==Islam==

In the Quran, the term (, ) is used in a passage about Musa (Moses) proclaiming to the Children of Israel: &quot;O my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you ˹to enter˺. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.&quot; The Quran also refers to the land as being &#x27;Blessed&#x27;.

Jerusalem (referred to as , , &#x27;The Holy&#x27;) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to Muhammad&#x27;s experiencing the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj as &quot;Glory be to the One Who took His servant ˹Muḥammad˺ by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs&quot;. infer that the &quot;Farthest Masjid&quot; is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by Abu Hurairah: &quot;On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, &#x27;Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your would have gone astray&#x27;.&quot; Jerusalem was Islam&#x27;s first (direction of prayer) in Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, however, this was later changed to the Kaaba in the Hijazi city of Mecca, following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel Jibril. The current construction of the Al-Aqsa mosque, which lies on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in Palestine. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell, referring to a testimony by Arculf, a Gallic monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes the possibility that the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Umar ibn al-Khattab, erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Mu&#x27;awiyah I, and it is possible that Mu&#x27;awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir. According to the Quran and Islamic traditions, Al-Aqsa Mosque is the place from which Muhammad went on a night journey () during which he rode on Buraq, who took him from Mecca to al-Aqsa. Muhammad tethered Buraq to the Western Wall and prayed at al-Aqsa Mosque and after he finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer. The historical significance of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of 16 or 17 months after migration to Medina in 624; it thus became the (&#x27;direction&#x27;) that Muslims faced for prayer.

The exact region referred to as being &#x27;blessed&#x27; in the Quran, in verses like , and , has been interpreted differently by various scholars. Abdullah Yusuf Ali likens it to a wide land-range including Syria and Lebanon, especially the cities of Tyre and Sidon; Az-Zujaj describes it as &quot;Damascus, Palestine, and a bit of Jordan&quot;; Muadh ibn Jabal as &quot;the area between al-Arish and the Euphrates&quot;; and Ibn Abbas as &quot;the land of Jericho&quot;. This overall region is referred to as &quot;Ash-Shām&quot; ().

==Baháʼí Faith==
The holiest places for Baháʼí pilgrimage are the Shrine of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and the Shrine of the Báb, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the coastal cities of Acre and Haifa, respectively.

The Baháʼí Faith&#x27;s founder, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, was exiled to Acre Prison from 1868 and spent his life in its surroundings until his death in 1892. In his writings he set the slope of Mount Carmel to host the Shrine of the Báb which his appointed successor &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá erected in 1909 as a beginning of the terraced gardens there. The Head of the religion after him, Shoghi Effendi, began building other structures and the Universal House of Justice continued the work until the Bahá&#x27;í World Centre was brought to its current state as the spiritual and administrative centre of the religion. Its gardens are highly popular places to visit and Mohsen Makhmalbaf&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Gardener&quot; featured them.

<text>The Strokes are an American rock band formed in New York City in 1998. The band is composed of lead singer and primary songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They were a leading group of the early-2000s garage rock revival and post-punk revival movements.

The release of their debut EP &quot;The Modern Age&quot; in early 2001 sparked a bidding war among minor labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records. That summer, they released their debut album, &quot;Is This It&quot;, to widespread critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists. It was followed by &quot;Room on Fire&quot; (2003) and &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot; (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match &quot;Is This It&quot; in immediate critical success, despite positive reviews nonetheless.

Following a five-year hiatus, they released &quot;Angles&quot; (2011) and &quot;Comedown Machine&quot; (2013) to generally positive receptions but dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the &quot;Future Present Past&quot; EP (2016) through Casablancas&#x27; label Cult. The band were relatively inactive throughout the rest of the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.

In 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;, produced by Rick Rubin and released through Cult and RCA. The album received highly positive reviews and was considered a return to form by critics. It went on to win Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;The Modern Age&quot; EP (1998–2001)===

Lead singer-songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti started playing together as teenagers while all of them were attending Dwight School in Manhattan, and formed an informal band in 1997. They later added bassist Nikolai Fraiture to their ranks, a close childhood friend of Casablancas who had attended the Lycée Français de New York with him. At the end of 1998, the group invited guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. to play with them. He had just moved to New York City and reconnected with Casablancas, whom he knew from their brief stints at the private boarding school Institut Le Rosey, near Nyon, Switzerland. At this point, he was the last member to join the band. The two soon became roommates not long after reconnecting, with Hammond remarking that &quot;two weeks later, we were sharing a flat.&quot;

In the following two years, the band practiced and performed tirelessly in New York City. Many of their contemporaries have credited the band&#x27;s earliest successes to their dedication and hustle, as well as their engaging personalities. They practiced most nights, with many rehearsals taking place in The Music Building in Midtown Manhattan. They played their first show as the Strokes on September 14, 1999, at The Spiral. They soon frequented Manhattan&#x27;s rock clubs including HiFi Bar and the Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side of New York, and later Manhattan&#x27;s popular Mercury Lounge. A young booker for the Mercury Lounge, Ryan Gentles, eventually quit his job to become the band&#x27;s manager.

The band began rehearsing a 14-song set (an early blueprint of the Strokes&#x27; 2001 debut, &quot;Is This It&quot;), including &quot;Alone, Together&quot;, &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;New York City Cops&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, and &quot;This Life&quot; (an early version of &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot;). Most of these songs now feature different lyrics. The band connected with producer Gordon Raphael in 2000 following a show at Luna Lounge and made a demo, &quot;The Modern Age&quot; EP, with him. The band sent the demo to the newly reformed Rough Trade Records in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, &quot;NME,&quot; who gave away a free MP3 download of &quot;Last Nite&quot; a week prior to the physical release as part of &quot;The Modern Age&quot; EP in 2001). The EP sparked a bidding war among record labels, the largest for a rock band in years. In August 2001, the Strokes made their first appearance on the cover of the publication &quot;The Fader&quot; in its ninth issue.

===&quot;Is This It&quot; (2001–2002) ===
The Strokes released their debut album, &quot;Is This It,&quot; in Australia in July 2001, and in Japan and the UK in August 2001 before the release of a subsequent US version in October 2001. The Australia, Japan and UK dates coincided with promotional tours in the respective countries. These included the Reading and Leeds Festivals at which the band were moved up the billing twice due to rapidly growing interest, shifted from being due to play on a tented stage to a slot on the main stage , that attracted their largest audiences up to this point.

The album was produced by Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album &quot;Room On Fire&quot;. RCA Records delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album&#x27;s cover and lyrics. The internationally released cover features a black-and-white photo of a gloved hand on a woman&#x27;s naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane&#x27;s then-girlfriend) while the North American version replaced it with a photo of particle collisions in the Big European Bubble Chamber. RCA replaced the track &quot;New York City Cops&quot; with &quot;When It Started&quot;, as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The track &quot;New York City Cops&quot;—featuring the refrain, &quot;New York City Cops, they ain&#x27;t too smart&quot;—was listed as No. 12 on &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate New York Playlist&quot; on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), &quot;Is This It&quot; received critical acclaim—among other accolades, four stars from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and a 9.1 from Pitchfork Media. The album made many critics&#x27; top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, and (in an article previewing summer concerts) &quot;NME&quot; urged readers to attend The Strokes&#x27; shows—as they were touring some of the &quot;best pop songs ever&quot;. While critics noted the influence of CBGB stalwarts Television, Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing the Velvet Underground and the Doors as reference points.

After the release of &quot;Is This It&quot;, the band toured around the world—including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America (the band opened for the Rolling Stones on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary &quot;In Transit&quot; was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK&#x27;s Carling Weekend festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall on a bill with the White Stripes. Jack White joined The Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on &quot;New York City Cops&quot;. During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. &quot;Is This It&quot; yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by Roman Coppola.

&quot;Is This It&quot; has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike. In 2009, &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Is This It&quot; as the Greatest Album of the Decade (2000s). The album placed second on a similar list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (the same issue featured a list of the &#x27;100 Best Songs of the 00s&#x27;, featuring &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; and &quot;Last Nite&quot; at Nos. 59 and 16, respectively). In January 2011, Rolling Stone surveyed their Facebook fans to determine the top ten debut albums of all time. &quot;Is This It&quot; came in at number ten and was also the most recent behind Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1991 debut.

===&quot;Room on Fire&quot; (2003–2004)===

The group began recording their follow-up in 2002 with producer Nigel Godrich (best known for his work with Radiohead), but later split with him in favor of Gordon Raphael, the producer of &quot;Is This It&quot;. Recordings with Godrich were never revealed. In August 2003, the band toured Japan, playing a couple of the upcoming songs: &quot;Reptilia&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in the Bathroom&quot;, &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;Between Love &amp; Hate&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Ze Newie&quot;) and &quot;12:51&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Supernova&quot;). The band also played Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot; with Japanese lyrics. The Strokes released their second album &quot;Room on Fire&quot; in October 2003. It received praise from critics but was less commercially successful, although it still went gold. The album&#x27;s sound maintained The Strokes&#x27; familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as the Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from &quot;Room on Fire&quot; was the song &quot;12:51&quot;, which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi&#x27;s guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film &quot;Tron&quot;. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.

In November 2003, The Strokes played on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, performing &quot;Reptilia&quot;, &quot;What Ever Happened&quot;, &quot;Under Control&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Win&quot;. During the 2003–2004 &quot;&quot;Room on Fire&quot; Tour&quot;, the band were supported by Kings of Leon and Regina Spektor. While on tour, Spektor and The Strokes recorded the song &quot;Modern Girls &amp; Old Fashion Men&quot;, released as a B-side on the &quot;Reptilia&quot; single. Also during the tour, the band included the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Clampdown&quot; as a cover, which was released as the B-side for &quot;The End Has No End&quot;.

In late 2004, The Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The &quot;Live in London&quot; LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary Alexandra Palace in North London.

=== &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot; and hiatus (2005–2007) ===
In late September 2005, &quot;Juicebox&quot;, the first single from The Strokes&#x27; then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single&#x27;s release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. &quot;Juicebox&quot; became The Strokes&#x27; second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 The Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;, was released on January 3, 2006. It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the U.S. and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was &quot;like a scientific breakthrough&quot;. In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; playing &quot;Juicebox&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;. The album was somewhat a departure from the band&#x27;s two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne. Despite its initial strong sales, &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot; received the worst reception, both commercially and critically, of all their albums.

In 2006, the band played eighteen sold-out shows during their UK tour. In February 2006, The Strokes won &quot;Best International Band&quot; at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the U.S. with their longest tour yet. The second single off &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;, &quot;Heart in a Cage&quot;, was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, The Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, Roskilde Festival in Denmark, the Oxegen Festival in Ireland, the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, the FIB (Festival Internacional de Benicàssim), Fuji Rock Festival and headlined the Pentaport Rock Festival in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour. While in the U.S., The Strokes opened for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers for five shows during their Highway Companion tour. The Strokes went on to complete another US tour. During this final tour, Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager Ryan Gentles, confirming that &quot;much needed break&quot;. A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; directed by Warren Fu. The video also featured a brief interlude with &quot;Ize of the World&quot;, also from &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;. The song &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot; was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync. Aleksandra Cisneros became The Strokes&#x27; assistant manager in late 2007.

===&quot;Angles&quot; (2009–2011)===
The Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing material for the album in January 2009, intent on entering the studio that February. Julian commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that they had completed about three songs that sounded like a mixture of 1970s rock and &quot;music from the future&quot;. On March 31, 2009, the band made an announcement from their MySpace account that announced the end of their &quot;much needed hibernation period&quot; and the commencement of new writing and rehearsing for a fourth full-length album, entitled &quot;Angles&quot;. This album would be different from the first three due to the fact that the music for the album would also be written by the other four Strokes, rather than Casablancas writing a majority share of the material once again: &quot;It&#x27;s supercollaborative, and it sounds different,&quot; said Valensi, &quot;but it has a Strokes vibe to it.&quot; In an &quot;NME&quot; article, Pharrell Williams expressed interest in producing this upcoming album. This followed the news that Casablancas had collaborated with both Williams and Santigold on &quot;My Drive Thru&quot;, a track commemorating the 100th anniversary of Converse&#x27;s Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoe. The song was available as a free download from the official Converse website. The album was due to be released in late 2009, but disagreements about just how ready the songs were to be released forced The Strokes to move the actual release date back. On February 1, 2010, The Strokes announced on their website that the recording of the fourth album was being helmed by award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters, the two parties first met in 2009 and, after finding they shared a similar mind space and similar thoughts on the potential direction of the new record, tried out some tracking. Not long after recording began, however, the band became frustrated with Chiccarelli&#x27;s reserved production style. Only one song from these recording sessions, &quot;Life Is Simple in the Moonlight&quot;, remained on the album&#x27;s track listing. Inspired, in part, by other contemporary bands like MGMT, Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, The Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques, and recorded the rest of the album&#x27;s material at Albert Hammond Jr.&#x27;s home studio in upstate New York with award-winning engineer Gus Oberg.

The Strokes confirmed that they would be headlining the Isle of Wight Festival, Lollapalooza, Roskilde Festival, Hurricane Festival, Splendour in the Grass, Rockness, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, On The Bright Side, and Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2010. Additionally, The Strokes were announced as the 2011 headliner for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in May, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim, Oxegen, Paléo, Peace &amp; Love and Super Bock Super Rock in July, and Reading Festival and Summer Sonic in August. They were also sub-headliners to Pulp at Leeds Festival during the bank holiday weekend in August. On June 9, 2010, at Dingwalls London, England, the band played a secret show under the name &#x27;Venison&#x27; to a crowd of just 487. This was their first live gig since October 2006. The band did not play any new material.

The lead single from the new album, &quot;Under Cover of Darkness&quot;, was released on February 9, 2011. The 7&quot; was officially released on March 1, 2011, and contained another track from &quot;Angles&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Right&quot;, as the B-side, followed by the album on March 18, 2011.In mid-March 2011, an interview with &quot;ShortList&quot; magazine revealed that The Strokes had already begun working on their fifth studio album. However, sessions were delayed due to the mixing process of &quot;Angles&quot;. Julian Casablancas and Nick Valensi both confirmed that there was material in the works as well as plenty of leftover material. Frontman Julian Casablancas claimed that the band was eager to begin working on new material and were already supposed to, but it took longer than expected to master &quot;Angles&quot;.
&quot;Taken for a Fool&quot; was confirmed as the second single, which was sent to U.S. radio on May 24, 2011. On June 9, The Strokes announced that a music video for &quot;Taken For a Fool&quot; was in the works, and that it would be directed by Laurent Briet. They revealed that the music video should be finished by the end of the month. The Strokes put out the music video for &quot;Taken For a Fool&quot; on July 8, 2011. 

===&quot;Comedown Machine&quot; (2012−2015)===

In April 2012, bassist Nikolai Fraiture posted a tweet announcing that the band was heading into the studio to work on some new ideas. The Strokes later revealed that they were planning to record a new album as soon as possible. Fraiture added that the band would record their fifth album in the same manner as they put together &quot;Angles&quot;, with each member bringing in his own ideas and putting them together in the studio. On January 17, 2013, Seattle alternative radio station 107.7 The End posted on their Facebook page that they were previewing a new song by The Strokes entitled &quot;All the Time&quot;. It was later confirmed that &quot;All the Time&quot; would be the lead single from the untitled fifth album. On January 25, 2013, the song &quot;One Way Trigger&quot; was published on their official website, and made available for free download. The song was initially met with a mixed reaction from fans of the band. On January 28, a Reddit user discovered what he correctly assumed to be the new album cover within the subpages of the band&#x27;s official website, which led to a widespread rumor that the new album would be titled &quot;Comedown Machine&quot;. On January 30, the title for the fifth album was revealed to be &quot;Comedown Machine&quot;, set to be released on March 26 in the U.S. and March 25 in the UK. On February 13, 2013, the first single from the band&#x27;s fifth album premiered on the radio, named &quot;All the Time&quot;. The single was released for download on February 19, and was described as a return to the classic Strokes sound of first albums &quot;Is This It&quot; and &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. The album was released on March 25, 2013, in the UK and March 26 in the United States. The band decided to pull a media blackout with the album: no promotion in the form of TV appearances, interviews, photos, shows, or tours. On October 15, 2013, the band revealed that they were looking to &quot;return to the scene&quot; in 2014.

In May 2014, The Strokes performed their first U.S. show in three years at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, performing songs from &quot;Comedown Machine&quot; for the first time. The band played at three other shows in 2014, including two headlining slots at Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City and FYF Fest in Los Angeles. On November 12, 2014, it was announced the band would headline Primavera Sound in 2015 for the festival&#x27;s 15th anniversary. On March 2, 2015, the band announced their second 2015 European festival headline appearance would be at London&#x27;s annual British Summer Time: Hyde Park festival on June 18, 2015, the band&#x27;s first London show in five years. The announcement takes the band&#x27;s number of appearances slated for 2015 up to six, with them also playing Big Guava Music Festival in Tampa, Florida, Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, Landmark Festival in Washington, D.C., and Austin City Limits in Austin, Texas, as well as the previously announced Primavera Sound 15th Anniversary. During their performance at Landmark Music Festival lead singer Julian Casablancas stated that the band was back in the studio working on a follow-up to their 2013 album &quot;Comedown Machine&quot;. In late 2015, The Strokes announced another date; at Monterrey, Mexico, during the festivities of the newborn festival Live Out.

===&quot;Future Present Past&quot; EP (2016–2017)===

The Strokes played their first show of 2016 at Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy Life Fest in Austin, Texas. 
On May 24, 2016, The Strokes announced another New York show on May 31 at the Capitol Theatre. On May 26, 2016, Julian Casablancas premiered &quot;OBLIVIUS&quot; on the debut of his monthly radio show &quot;Culture Void&quot; on Sirius XMU. Cult Records announced the release of &quot;Future Present Past&quot;, a four-song EP by The Strokes, in addition to the exclusive signing of the band to its roster. The EP includes three original songs (&quot;Drag Queen&quot;, &quot;OBLIVIUS&quot;, and &quot;Threat of Joy&quot;), along with an additional remix of &quot;OBLIVIUS&quot; by drummer, Fab Moretti. The EP was released on June 3, in both digital and physical formats to coincide with the band&#x27;s headlining performance at Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City. &quot;Future Present Past&quot; was recorded over the past year in Austin and New York with the help of producer, Gus Oberg.

The band played at the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia on July 22, 2016. They followed this performance with the inaugural City of Angels Benefit concert in Los Angeles to support charities such as Waste Not Want Not Now, the Center in Hollywood, and the Downtown&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Center on July 25, 2016.

The band performed a series of festival dates taking place throughout early 2017. Festival dates include performances in Estéreo Picnic Festival as well as Lollapalooza Brasil, Lollapalooza Chile, and Lollapalooza Argentina. The band&#x27;s first live performance of the year took place headlining the Estéreo Picnic Festival. The crowd in attendance of their Argentina show was reportedly 90,000 people. After the Lollapalooza Argentina show, it was revealed that their headlining slot at the festival was, to this day, their &quot;biggest show ever&quot; by Fraiture on social media.

===&quot;The New Abnormal&quot; (2019–present)===
In October 2016, guitarist Valensi indicated that the band were &quot;slowly but surely working on an album, we&#x27;re kind of just in writing sessions&quot;. In July 2017 Albert Hammond Sr. said The Strokes are working with Rick Rubin. Albert Hammond Jr. took to Twitter to clarify that &quot;we met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all&quot;. He also tweeted, &quot;Sorry everyone we are not in the studio recording&quot; and that there were &quot;a lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.&quot;

In May 2019, the band performed for the first time in over two years at a benefit show in Los Angeles. At this venue, the band debuted a new song entitled &quot;The Adults Are Talking&quot;. The show kicked off the band&#x27;s &quot;global comeback&quot; tour. However, this tour was met with many obstacles early on, from sound issues to rained-out shows to entire festivals being cancelled. In September 2019, Valensi, in an interview on C104.3 Out of the Box, hinted at the production of a sixth studio album, stating &quot;When, I don&#x27;t know. If – I would say, it&#x27;s a strong likelihood.&quot; During the band&#x27;s 2019 New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Brooklyn, Casablancas announced that the band&#x27;s sixth studio album would be released sometime in 2020. At the show, they also debuted a new song, titled &quot;Ode to the Mets&quot;.

On February 10, 2020, the band performed at a rally for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. At this performance, Casablancas formally announced the band&#x27;s sixth studio album and that the title would be &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;. He confirmed the release date of the album to be April 10 of that year. The band reportedly played two new songs at this show. On February 11, the band released a new song, &quot;At the Door&quot;, the first single off of their sixth studio album. Two more singles followed, &quot;Bad Decisions&quot;, and &quot;Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus&quot;. Their sixth studio album, &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;, was released worldwide on April 10, 2020. On October 24, the band was confirmed for their fourth appearance as the musical guest for the October 31 episode of Saturday Night Live with John Mulaney hosting, where they performed &quot;The Adults are Talking&quot; and &quot;Bad Decisions&quot; from &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;.

On June 21, 2021, the band shared a video in support of New York City mayoral candidate Maya Wiley featuring a clip of a new song &quot;Starting Again&quot; co-written with Gregg Alexander. Throughout 2022, the band were as present as ever in touring, including headlining at Lollapalooza dates in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, as well as other high-profile music festivals in Europe. On June 17, 2022, the band performed a benefit concert in support of Chicago-based congressional candidate Kina Collins. That summer, they toured as an opening act on the Red Hot Chili Peppers 2022 Global Stadium Tour.

In October 2022, Rubin revealed he&#x27;d been recording a new album with The Strokes in Costa Rica. , there has been no update on that album, with Casablancas in particular focusing more on his experimental music with The Voidz, remarking that with the Strokes &quot;Some of my dreams were kind of shattered a little bit along the way within that.&quot; On March 8, 2024, the band performed their second benefit concert in support of Collins&#x27; third congressional bid.

== Musical style ==
The band&#x27;s sound has been described as indie rock, garage rock revival, and post-punk revival by media outlets. The band also incorporated new wave and synth-pop on later records like &quot;Angles&quot; and &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;. Casablancas has cited the Doors as an inspiration for him to start a music career, and Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground as a major influence on his lyrics and singing style: &quot;The way Lou Reed wrote and sang about drugs and sex, about the people around himit was so matter-of-fact,&quot; Casablancas stated in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, &quot;Reed could be romantic in the way he portrayed these crazy situations, but he was also intensely real. It was poetry and journalism.&quot; Additionally, he has stated that Bob Marley, Nirvana and Pearl Jam are major influences on his work, the latter being the reason that he started making music after hearing the song &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
The Strokes&#x27; debut album &quot;Is This It&quot; was named number one album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; and number two by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;; it earned The Strokes tremendous respect across various artists in the alternative music scene. The lead singer of LCD Soundsystem, James Murphy, has said, &quot;&quot;Is This It&quot; was my record of the decade.&quot; The album won Best International Album in 2002, nominated by &quot;NME&quot;, and the ASCAP College Vanguard Award. Brandon Flowers of the Killers told &quot;NME&quot; that he felt &quot;depressed&quot; after hearing The Strokes&#x27; album &quot;Is This It&quot;. &quot;That record just sounded so perfect&quot;, he said. &quot;We threw away everything [we were working on] and the only song that made the cut and remained was &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;&#x27;.

The Strokes have been said to be, &quot;as influential to their era as the Velvet Underground or the Ramones were to theirs&quot;, by Lizzy Goodman in her book on the New York City music scene, claiming that, &quot;almost every artist I interviewed for this book – from all over the world – said it was The Strokes that opened the door for them.&quot; The band was named Band of the Year in 2002 by &quot;Spin&quot; and have heavily influenced bands like the Killers, Arctic Monkeys, and Franz Ferdinand. Alex Turner, lead singer of Arctic Monkeys, sang &quot;I just wanted to be one of The Strokes&quot; in their 2018 song &#x27;Star Treatment&#x27;. Other bands that have cited the Strokes as an influence include Wet Leg and We Are Scientists.

<doc id="148550" wikidata="Q575224" url="?curid=148550" title="Antiferromagnetism">
<text>In materials that exhibit antiferromagnetism, the magnetic moments of atoms or molecules, usually related to the spins of electrons, align in a regular pattern with neighboring spins (on different sublattices) pointing in opposite directions. This is, like ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, a manifestation of ordered magnetism. The phenomenon of antiferromagnetism was first introduced by Lev Landau in 1933.

Generally, antiferromagnetic order may exist at sufficiently low temperatures, but vanishes at and above the Néel temperature – named after Louis Néel, who had first in the West identified this type of magnetic ordering. Above the Néel temperature, the material is typically paramagnetic.

== Measurement ==
When no external field is applied, the antiferromagnetic structure corresponds to a vanishing total magnetization. In an external magnetic field, a kind of ferrimagnetic behavior may be displayed in the antiferromagnetic phase, with the absolute value of one of the sublattice magnetizations differing from that of the other sublattice, resulting in a nonzero net magnetization. Although the net magnetization should be zero at a temperature of absolute zero, the effect of spin canting often causes a small net magnetization to develop, as seen for example in hematite.

The magnetic susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic material typically shows a maximum at the Néel temperature. In contrast, at the transition between the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phases the susceptibility will diverge. In the antiferromagnetic case, a divergence is observed in the &quot;staggered susceptibility&quot;.

Various microscopic (exchange) interactions between the magnetic moments or spins may lead to antiferromagnetic structures. In the simplest case, one may consider an Ising model on a bipartite lattice, e.g. the simple cubic lattice, with couplings between spins at nearest neighbor sites. Depending on the sign of that interaction, ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order will result. Geometrical frustration or competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions may lead to different and, perhaps, more complicated magnetic structures.

The relationship between magnetization and the magnetizing field is non-linear like in ferromagnetic materials. This fact is due to the contribution of the hysteresis loop, which for ferromagnetic materials involves a residual magnetization.

== Antiferromagnetic materials ==
Antiferromagnetic structures were first shown through neutron diffraction of transition metal oxides such as nickel, iron, and manganese oxides. The experiments, performed by Clifford Shull, gave the first results showing that magnetic dipoles could be oriented in an antiferromagnetic structure.

Antiferromagnetic materials occur commonly among transition metal compounds, especially oxides. Examples include hematite, metals such as chromium, alloys such as iron manganese (FeMn), and oxides such as nickel oxide (NiO). There are also numerous examples among high nuclearity metal clusters. Organic molecules can also exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling under rare circumstances, as seen in radicals such as 5-dehydro-m-xylylene.

Antiferromagnets can couple to ferromagnets, for instance, through a mechanism known as exchange bias, in which the ferromagnetic film is either grown upon the antiferromagnet or annealed in an aligning magnetic field, causing the surface atoms of the ferromagnet to align with the surface atoms of the antiferromagnet. This provides the ability to &quot;pin&quot; the orientation of a ferromagnetic film, which provides one of the main uses in so-called spin valves, which are the basis of magnetic sensors including modern hard disk drive read heads. The temperature at or above which an antiferromagnetic layer loses its ability to &quot;pin&quot; the magnetization direction of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer is called the blocking temperature of that layer and is usually lower than the Néel temperature.

==Geometric frustration==

Unlike ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetic interactions can lead to multiple optimal states (ground states—states of minimal energy). In one dimension, the anti-ferromagnetic ground state is an alternating series of spins: up, down, up, down, etc. Yet in two dimensions, multiple ground states can occur.

Consider an equilateral triangle with three spins, one on each vertex. If each spin can take on only two values (up or down), there are 23 = 8 possible states of the system, six of which are ground states. The two situations which are not ground states are when all three spins are up or are all down. In any of the other six states, there will be two favorable interactions and one unfavorable one. This illustrates frustration: the inability of the system to find a single ground state. This type of magnetic behavior has been found in minerals that have a crystal stacking structure such as a Kagome lattice or hexagonal lattice.

== Other properties ==

Synthetic antiferromagnets (often abbreviated by SAF) are artificial antiferromagnets consisting of two or more thin ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic layer. Dipole coupling of the ferromagnetic layers results in antiparallel alignment of the magnetization of the ferromagnets.

Antiferromagnetism plays a crucial role in giant magnetoresistance, as had been discovered in 1988 by the Nobel Prize winners Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg (awarded in 2007) using synthetic antiferromagnets.

There are also examples of disordered materials (such as iron phosphate glasses) that become antiferromagnetic below their Néel temperature. These disordered networks &#x27;frustrate&#x27; the antiparallelism of adjacent spins; i.e. it is not possible to construct a network where each spin is surrounded by opposite neighbour spins. It can only be determined that the average correlation of neighbour spins is antiferromagnetic. This type of magnetism is sometimes called speromagnetism.

<text>Kansas is an American rock band formed in Topeka, Kansas in 1973. They became popular during the 1970s initially on album-oriented rock charts and later with hit singles such as &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. The band has produced nine gold albums, three multi-platinum albums (&quot;Leftoverture&quot; 5x, &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; 4×, and &quot;The Best of Kansas&quot; 4×), one other platinum studio album (&quot;Monolith&quot;), one platinum live double album (&quot;Two for the Show&quot;), and a million-selling single, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. Kansas appeared on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for over 200 weeks throughout the 1970s and 1980s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; was the second-most-played track on US classic rock radio in 1995 and No. 1 in 1997. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic referred to Kansas as &quot;staples&quot; of classic rock radio.

==History==

===1970–1973: early years===
In 1969, Don Montre and Kerry Livgren (guitars, keyboards, synthesizers) were performing in a band called the Reasons Why in their hometown of Topeka. After leaving to form the band Saratoga with Lynn Meredith and Dan Wright, they started playing Livgren&#x27;s original material, with Scott Kessler playing bass and Zeke Lowe on drums.

In 1970 they changed the band&#x27;s name to Kansas and merged with members of rival Topeka progressive rock group White Clover. White Clover members Dave Hope (bass) and Phil Ehart (drums, percussion) joined with Livgren, vocalists Meredith and Greg Allen, keyboardists Montre and Wright and saxophonist Larry Baker. This early Kansas group, sometimes called Kansas I, lasted until early 1971 when Ehart, Hope and some of the others left to re-form White Clover.

Ehart was replaced by Zeke Lowe and later Brad Schulz, Hope was replaced by Rod Mikinski and Baker was replaced by John Bolton on saxophone and flute. This lineup is sometimes referred to as Kansas II, and 30 years later would re-form under the name Proto-Kaw.

In 1972, after Ehart returned from England (where he had gone to look for other musicians), he and Hope once again re-formed White Clover with Robby Steinhardt (vocals, violin, viola, cello), Steve Walsh (vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, percussion) and Rich Williams (guitars). In early 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded. Eventually they received a recording contract with Don Kirshner&#x27;s eponymous label, after Kirshner&#x27;s assistant, Wally Gold, heard one of their demo tapes and came out to check out the band at one of their local gigs in March 1973 in Ellinwood, Kansas. After signing with Kirshner, the group decided to return to using the name &quot;Kansas&quot;.

===1974–1979: rise to national prominence===

Their 1974 self-titled debut album, produced by Gold, was released in March 1974, nearly a year after it was recorded in New York. It defined the band&#x27;s signature sound, a mix of American-style boogie rock and complex, symphonic arrangements with changing time signatures. Steinhardt&#x27;s violin was a distinctive element of the group&#x27;s sound, being defined more by heartland rock than the jazz and classical influences which most progressive rock violinists followed.

The band slowly developed a cult following due to promotion by Kirshner and extensive touring for the debut album and its two follow-ups, &quot;Song for America&quot; (February 1975) and &quot;Masque&quot; (October 1975). &quot;Song for America&quot; was co-produced by Wally Gold and their former White Clover bandmate Jeff Glixman, who would go on to produce all of their albums from &quot;Masque&quot; to &quot;Two for the Show&quot; (October 1978) on his own, returning to the helm for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Freaks of Nature&quot;. Both &quot;Masque&quot; and their next release, &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, were recorded at a studio in the middle of the Louisiana Bayou named Studio in the Country.

Kansas released its fourth album, &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, in October 1976, which produced a hit single, &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, in 1977. The follow-up, &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, recorded at Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana and Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville and released in October 1977, featured the title track and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, both hit singles. &quot;Leftoverture&quot; was a breakthrough for the band, hitting No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop album chart. &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; peaked even higher, at No. 4. Both albums sold over four million copies in the U.S. Both &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; were certified gold singles, selling over one million units each. &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; was certified gold as a digital download by the RIAA in 2005, almost 30 years after selling one million copies as a single. &quot;Leftoverture&quot; was eventually certified five-times platinum by the RIAA in 2001.

During this period, Kansas became a major headlining act and sold out the largest venues available to rock bands at the time, including New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The band documented this era in 1978 with &quot;Two for the Show&quot;, a double live album of recordings from various performances from its 1977 and 1978 tours. The band gained a solid reputation for faithful live reproduction of their studio recordings.

In March 1978 Kansas was brought over to tour Europe for the very first time and later on that same year, they were named UNICEF Deputy Ambassadors of Goodwill.

The follow-up studio album to &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; was &quot;Monolith&quot; (May 1979), which was self-produced. The album generated a Top 40 single in &quot;People of the South Wind&quot;, whose title refers to the meaning of the &#x27;Kanza&#x27; (Kaw) Native American people, after whom the state and the band are named. The album failed to garner the sales and radio airplay of its two predecessors. Nevertheless, the album eventually went platinum. Livgren&#x27;s platinum award for the album is on display at the Kansas Museum of History. The band toured the US for &quot;Monolith&quot; during the summer and fall of 1979 then went over to tour Japan for the first time in January 1980.

===1980–1984: creative tensions===
Kansas bandmembers began to drift apart in the early 1980s. During the tour supporting &quot;Monolith&quot;, Livgren became a born-again Christian, and this was reflected in his lyrics on the next three albums, beginning with &quot;Audio-Visions&quot; (September 1980). &quot;Hold On&quot;, a Top 40 single from that album, displayed his new-found faith. Hope soon converted to Christianity as well. This would be the final album with the original lineup (until they briefly reunited in 1999–2000), and also the last Kansas studio album to be certified gold by the RIAA.

Due to creative differences over the lyrical direction of the next album, Walsh left in October 1981 to form a new band, Streets. In early 1982 Walsh was replaced by vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist John Elefante, who—unknown to Livgren and Hope at the time—was also a Christian. He was chosen from over 200 applicants, such as Sammy Hagar, Doug Pinnick, Ted Neeley (who played the title character in the movie &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;), Warren Ham (ex-Bloodrock, who would join the band on the road in 1982 adding sax, flute, harmonica, back-up vocals and extra keyboards) and Michael Gleason (who would supply keyboards and back-up vocals on the group&#x27;s 1983 tour).

The first Kansas album with Elefante, &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot;, was released in June 1982. The record renewed interest in the group and generated the band&#x27;s first Top 20 hit in several years, &quot;Play the Game Tonight&quot;, which hit number 4 on Billboard&#x27;s newly deployed Mainstream Rock chart. The album&#x27;s mostly Christianity-based lyrics attracted a new audience and garnered radio airplay on the then fledgling Contemporary Christian Music format. The album featured backing vocals from Queen drummer Roger Taylor, who was recording in the studio next door. Still, sales of the album fell short of gold status.

&quot;Drastic Measures&quot; followed in July 1983. For various reasons, Livgren contributed only three songs to the album; the rest were penned by John Elefante and his brother Dino. With violinist Steinhardt leaving the group before the recording sessions, the result was a more mainstream pop-rock album. Though the album charted lower than any Kansas album since &quot;Masque&quot;, peaking at number 41, its single &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; fared better. It did not crack the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. It was the highest chart position of any Kansas release on any chart, though this particular chart did not exist prior to 1981. For their 1983 tour for &quot;Drastic Measures&quot;, Kansas was joined on stage by the aforementioned Michael Gleason and Terry Brock (who covered the absent Steinhardt&#x27;s harmony vocals).

During the band&#x27;s time with Elefante as lead vocalist, Livgren became increasingly uncomfortable with Kansas representing his Christian worldview. After a final New Year&#x27;s Eve performance on December 31, 1983, Livgren and Hope left to form AD with Warren Ham and Michael Gleason. They were joined by drummer Dennis Holt.

Elefante, Ehart and Williams sought to continue as Kansas and recorded one more song, &quot;Perfect Lover&quot;, which appeared on the retrospective &quot;The Best of Kansas&quot; (August 1984), which has sold over four million units in the U.S. alone. The song would eventually be removed in favor of other songs on the remastered release of the compilation. The group disbanded after its release, which thus became the final Kansas recording with Elefante. Since leaving the band, Elefante has become a popular Contemporary Christian music artist and has not performed with the group since.

In March 1984, Ehart, Williams and Elefante were part of a United Service Organizations (USO) tour of US military bases that had been put together by Ehart, called 1st Airborne Rock and Roll Division, that also included Patrick Simmons (Doobie Brothers), Leon Medica (LeRoux), David Jenkins, Cory Lerios and John Pierce (from Pablo Cruise) and Robin Zander, Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos (from Cheap Trick). The supergroup began four days of rehearsals in Hawaii on March 10 before beginning a 17-day tour playing for the United States Seventh Fleet in the Indian Ocean and land-based troops in Korea, Okinawa, Diego Garcia and the Philippines. This was followed by a second USO tour in March 1985 that included Ehart, Williams and Steve Walsh.

===1985–1990: reformation===

In July 1985 the band came back together with Ehart, Williams and Walsh (who had briefly played keyboards on the road for Cheap Trick in the spring and summer of 1985 after the break up of Streets), but without Livgren, Hope or Steinhardt. The new lineup included Streets bassist Billy Greer and guitarist Steve Morse (formerly of the Dixie Dregs). The first performances of the new lineup with Morse and Greer took place during a third USO 1st Airborne Rock and Roll Division tour that toured US military bases in the US, Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, Singapore, Iceland and most of Europe during the late summer through early October 1986.

The re-formed band released &quot;Power&quot; on October 28, 1986. The first single, &quot;All I Wanted&quot;, became the last Kansas single to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 chart, reaching #19. It made the Top 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Album Rock Tracks and received considerable airplay on MTV. Two more singles, the title track and &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry Anymore&quot;, were less successful, &quot;Power&quot; hitting the lower end of the Hot 100 and getting substantial play and charting on the Rock Charts, but &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry Anymore&quot; receiving little airplay despite a clever music video. The album sold approximately 400,000 copies.

The band added Baton Rouge native Greg Robert on keyboards and back-up vocals at the suggestion of LeRoux&#x27;s Leon Medica. Greg played his first show with Kansas on January 31, 1987, along with 38 Special, at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in Puerto Rico.

The new lineup released a second album, &quot;In the Spirit of Things&quot;, in October 1988. The concept album and subsequent tour were popular with the fan base but did not receive widespread airplay beyond the &quot;Stand Beside Me&quot; video on MTV. Morse temporarily left the band at the end of a tour of Germany in April 1989.

On September 15, 1990, Walsh, Williams and Ehart played a charity event at the Saddlerock Ranch in Malibu, California, alongside Saga, Lou Gramm (of Foreigner), Mr. Big, Eddie Money, Kevin Cronin (from REO Speedwagon) and others. Alex Lifeson joined them on stage for a short set of Kansas before Geddy Lee flew in to join Alex for a Rush set, with Ehart on drums subbing for Neil Peart.

In November 1990 a German promoter arranged to reunite all the original members of Kansas (except for Steinhardt) for a European tour. Greer joined them, along with keyboardist Greg Robert. At the end of the tour, Hope left again, but Livgren remained on into 1991.

===1991–1997: addition of David Ragsdale===
In March 1991, violinist David Ragsdale (who had submitted a tape of his playing to Ehart several years earlier) was invited to join the group and the return of the violin allowed Kansas to perform earlier material in arrangements closer to the originals. Livgren left during the 1991 summer tour, to be replaced temporarily by Steve Morse again. After the tour, Morse left the band for good to return to his own projects and eventually become a member of Deep Purple, and Ragsdale took over the extra guitar parts, leaving Williams as the primary guitar player. The resulting lineup of Ehart, Greer, Ragsdale, Robert, Walsh and Williams lasted from 1991 to 1997. This period saw one live album and accompanying video, &quot;Live at the Whisky&quot; (July 1992), and one studio album, &quot;Freaks of Nature&quot; (May 1995).

During the fall of 1993, drummer Van Romaine (formerly of Blood Sweat and Tears and Steve Morse&#x27;s band) came in to substitute for Ehart, who was taking care of the group&#x27;s business and putting together &quot;The Kansas Boxed Set&quot;, which was released in July 1994. Bryan Holmes, from The Producers, likewise filled in for Ehart during the spring and summer of 1994 until that December, when Phil returned for a tour of Germany.

On July 28, 1995, Kansas was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame in Hollywood.

===1997–2006: return of Robby Steinhardt===
In early 1997, Robert and Ragsdale left the band and Steinhardt returned.

In May 1998, Kansas released &quot;Always Never the Same&quot;, which featured Larry Baird conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. The album was a mix of older Kansas material (with new arrangements by Baird), several new songs and a cover of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;.

&quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;, a new studio album released in July 2000, featured all the original members of Kansas, plus Greer, with all songs written by Kerry Livgren. That same summer, Kansas was the opening act for Yes during their &quot;Masterworks&quot; tour.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Livgren would occasionally attend Kansas shows and come on stage to play one or more songs with the band. At a March 9, 2002 concert at Lake Tahoe, he played the whole show, subbing for Rich Williams who was &quot;under the weather&quot;, and another live album and DVD from Kansas, entitled &quot;Device - Voice - Drum&quot;, which was recorded in the band&#x27;s present home of Atlanta on June 15, 2002, was released that October.

Also in 2002, Kansas II (the lineup prior to the recording and release of the first Kansas album) released an album under the name Proto-Kaw, featuring demos and live material recorded from 1971 to 1973. It led to a new studio album, &quot;Before Became After&quot; (2004), with most of the Kansas II members participating. Proto-Kaw released a third album, &quot;The Wait of Glory&quot;, in 2006 and their fourth and final studio album, &quot;Forth&quot;, was released in 2011, after which the band ceased.

===2006–2014: continued touring and regained popularity===
Kansas continued to tour every year. The 2006 tour was delayed for a few weeks due to Steinhardt&#x27;s second departure in March and Ragsdale&#x27;s subsequent return to the lineup.

In 2008, the Kansas website announced that four of the five members (Ehart, Ragsdale, Williams, and Greer) had formed a side recording group called Native Window and they released their self-titled debut album in June 2009.

In February 2009, Kansas recorded a concert in Topeka featuring a full symphony orchestra, with Larry Baird conducting. Morse and Livgren appeared as special guests on several songs. The performance was released on CD, DVD, and Blu-ray as &quot;There&#x27;s Know Place Like Home&quot; that October and the DVD hit No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Chart the week after its release.

In July 2010, Kansas completed a 30-day &quot;United We Rock&quot; tour with fellow classic rock acts Styx and Foreigner. Kansas then began a collegiate tour in September 2010. On this tour they performed with the symphony orchestras of various US colleges in an effort to raise money for the individual schools&#x27; music programs. The success of the tour led the band to start another one the following year.
On September 13, 2012, Kansas began a new tour with a performance at the Best Buy Theater in New York City. Opening for them was the band King&#x27;s X and a one-man-band called That 1 Guy. This tour featured many hits from the albums &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, as well as material from a number of their other albums.

The band kicked off 2013 being featured on the Rock Legends II cruise. The floating rock festival for a cause aboard Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s Liberty of the Seas departed January 10, 2013, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Other big names included Foreigner, Paul Rodgers, Creedence Clearwater Revisited, Bachman &amp; Turner, 38 Special, The Marshall Tucker Band, Blue Öyster Cult, Foghat and Molly Hatchet.

On March 1, 2013, Kansas announced a 40th anniversary celebration was in the works. However, Steinhardt suffered a heart attack days before the concert and was unable to participate. Nevertheless, the show went on, billed as the &quot;40th Anniversary Fan Appreciation Concert&quot;, performed in Pittsburgh on August 17, 2013, at the same venue, Benedum Center (formerly The Stanley Theater), which had propelled them to national recognition. The show featured guest appearances by Kerry Livgren and Dave Hope and the first set featured symphonic accompaniment by the Three Rivers Orchestra, conducted by Larry Baird. Intermission featured Phil Ehart overseeing random prize drawings of autographed band merchandise, videotaped 40th anniversary well-wishes from other bands, and an exclusive first-look at the trailer for the upcoming feature-length documentary &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot;.

===2014–2020: retirement of Steve Walsh, &quot;The Prelude Implicit&quot;===
On July 2, 2014, a statement was issued on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page announcing the impending retirement of lead singer Steve Walsh.

On July 6, 2014, former Kansas lead singer John Elefante issued a statement that he had been contacted by the band on July 2 to discuss rejoining. However, on July 4, after turning to prayer, he said that it was not meant to be. At that point, he also cited Steve Walsh as one of the reasons he wanted to become a singer.

A statement was issued on July 14, 2014, through the band&#x27;s official Facebook page, stating that Chicago native Ronnie Platt (who had previously sung with Shooting Star) had been selected as the band&#x27;s new lead vocalist and keyboard player.

On July 24, 2014, the band announced that their longtime lighting specialist David Manion would be handling the main keyboard parts for the band on stage along with Platt, giving the group a full-time keyboardist for the first time since Greg Robert&#x27;s departure in 1997. Manion had also handled keyboard responsibilities for Kansas bassist and vocalist Billy Greer&#x27;s band, Seventh Key.

In March 2015, the band released the aforementioned documentary, &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot;. The documentary chronicles the band&#x27;s formation and follows them throughout their success with &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;. It was initially available in a limited-edition release that contained an extra DVD of bonus interviews. The documentary was released alongside a companion CD of the same name that contained a selection of the band&#x27;s greatest hits along with snippets of commentary from the documentary.

On September 1, 2015, a press release announced that Kansas had signed with Inside Out Music, a German label dedicated to progressive rock and related genres, for the release of their upcoming 15th studio album. The release of this album marked the longest period to date between studio releases since the previous album, &quot;Somewhere to Elsewhere&quot;, had been released over 15 years prior, in 2000. On February 26, 2016, the group officially announced &quot;The Prelude Implicit&quot; for a September 2016 release. The album&#x27;s co-producer and co-writer, Zak Rizvi, was subsequently named as a full member of the band, giving Kansas a second full-time guitarist for the first time since Steve Morse&#x27;s departure in 1991.

On September 30, 2016, the current lineup kicked off a multi-city tour at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, which was done again in the spring of 2017 with a twelve show 40th anniversary tour, that, like the fall jaunt, included performances of newer tracks, older songs and a complete rendering of the full &quot;Leftoverture&quot; album. A two CD set, &quot;Leftoverture Live &amp; Beyond&quot;, was released in November 2017 that contained nineteen songs culled from different shows during the tour and the band&#x27;s 2017 fall dates also included further 40th anniversary shows.

In 2018, the group decided to celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; by playing that album in its entirety at the shows on a tour, set to begin in September.

After the conclusion of the fall tour dates, keyboardist David Manion departed the band, and in December Tom Brislin (who had played with Yes, Meat Loaf, Debbie Harry, Renaissance, Camel, Dennis DeYoung and others) was announced as the new keyboardist, with the second leg of the &quot;Point&quot; 40th anniversary tour slated to resume in March 2019.

In December 2019, the band played the entire &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; albums in a special performance at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.

===2020–present: &quot;The Absence of Presence&quot;, 50th anniversary and beyond===
On March 20, 2020 the band announced the upcoming release of a new studio album, &quot;The Absence of Presence&quot;. Due to manufacturing delays, the album was not released until July 17, 2020. It was promoted by the release of videos for three songs: &quot;Throwing Mountains&quot;, &quot;Memories Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Jets Overhead&quot;. Recording for the album took place simultaneously during the band&#x27;s 2019 touring schedule.

To promote the album, an autumn 2020 tour of Europe was scheduled, but following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed to 2022.

Guitarist Zak Rizvi left the band in April 2021 in order to pursue new projects.

On May 28, 2021 the group released &quot;Point of Know Return: Live and Beyond&quot;, with performances taken from various dates on the 2019 to early 2020 legs of the &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; 40th Anniversary Tour.

Former violin player and vocalist Robby Steinhardt died from Pancreatitis on July 17, 2021, at the age of 71.

On December 9, 2022 the three disc compilation &quot;Another Fork in the Road - 50 Years of Kansas&quot; was released to commemorate the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2023. Included on it are various tracks from all 16 Kansas studio albums, however, tracks from &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;In the Spirit of Things&quot; are omitted on disc 2 of the North American version. Also featured is a new 2022 recording of &quot;Can I Tell You&quot;, a track originally from Kansas&#x27; debut album.

Eric Holmquist, the band&#x27;s drum tech since 2003, has filled in for drummer Ehart as needed over the years, including 2016 when Ehart was being treated for kidney stones, 2018, and again in the fall of 2022 and 2023 after Ehart sprained his arm. Ehart returned to the stage in June 2023, at the start of the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary tour, to play the final songs of the set after Holmquist had covered the bulk of the show.

In May 2023 just prior to the start of the band&#x27;s 50th Anniversary tour, it was announced that violinist David Ragsdale was leaving for personal reasons to be replaced by violinist/guitarist Joe Deninzon, from the progressive rock band Stratospheerius.

In November 2023 Kyle Henderson of The Producers filled in on bass and vocals on tour for Billy Greer. 

In January 2024 former Kansas guitarist Zak Rizvi filled in for Rich Williams for some Florida shows while Williams recovered from a brief illness.

On February 23, 2024 Kansas announced that Phil Ehart was forced to step away from the stage after suffering a heart attack. Eric Holmquist again assumed the drums, starting with a March 1, 2024 show in Richmond, VA.

On April 18, 2024 Kansas announced that Zak Rizvi had rejoined the band. He played his first show after rejoining on April 26, 2024 in Morristown, New Jersey.

On April 26, 2024 Kansas announced that bassist Dan McGowan, of the band The Tea Club, would be filling in for bassist Billy Greer at their upcoming KANSAS 50th Anniversary Tour concerts from April 26th (Morristown, NJ) through May 4th (Toronto, ON.) But even though Greer returned after that, the band&#x27;s show at The Colosseum at Caesars Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on September 1, 2024 was Greer&#x27;s final one with Kansas, as he announced his retirement after thirty nine years with them. Dan McGowan was then brought back as Greer&#x27;s permanent replacement.

Due to the devastation in the Western Carolinas caused by Hurricane Helene, the band&#x27;s Las Vegas show scheduled for 9/28/24 had to be canceled and Rich Williams was unable to travel to the next concerts scheduled for the first week of October in Topeka, KS and Park City, KS. Guitarist Scott Bernard (Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald) was announced as fill-in guitarist, while former members Kerry Livgren and Dave Hope were brought back for guest appearances on &quot;Hold On&quot; and the encore of &quot;Carry on Wayward Son&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==
Kansas&#x27;s musical style, a fusion of hard rock, southern rock, and progressive rock, was influenced by several bands. The music of Yes and Genesis was inspirational to Kansas, especially demonstrated in the lyrics of Walsh. Livgren cited the 1960s band Touch as foundational to his development. Livgren&#x27;s evolving spirituality is reflected in the band&#x27;s songs, with early works showing an interest in the mysticism of Eastern religions, works in the late 1970s influenced by the American spiritual philosophy of &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, followed in the early 1980s by works embracing born-again Christianity. The re-formed band produced a harder pop metal album in the late 1980s. In addition to British progressive rock, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic noted the apparent influence from American heartland rock also present in Kansas&#x27; work.
==Appearances in other media==
&quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; has been covered by many artists. The song is frequently played throughout the show &quot;Supernatural&quot; and also appears in &quot;Supernatural: The Anime Series&quot; (as the ending for each episode). It is often hailed as the show&#x27;s unofficial theme song.

&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; was featured near the end of the &quot;&quot; 1993 episode &quot;&quot; (Season 2 Episode 4) as lead character Duncan MacLeod is mourning the death of his fiance Tessa.

&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; was parodied by comedian Tim Hawkins, the parody called &quot;A Whiff of Kansas&quot; which is on the &quot;Pretty Pink Tractor&quot; album, and a video parody on the &quot;Insanitized&quot; live DVD. In 2016, the music video for the song was parodied on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;.

&quot;Point of Know Return&quot; was featured as part of the soundtrack for the 2021 film &quot;The Suicide Squad.&quot;

<text>Brandi Denise Chastain (born July 21, 1968) is an American retired soccer player, two-time FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup champion, two-time Olympic gold-medalist, coach, and sports broadcaster. She played for the United States national team from 1988 to 2004. In her 192 caps on the team, she scored 30 goals playing primarily in the defender and midfielder positions. She scored a World Cup–winning penalty shootout goal against China in the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final.

Chastain played professionally for Shiroki FC in the Japan Women&#x27;s Football League, the San Jose CyberRays of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, FC Gold Pride of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer, and California Storm of Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League.

Chastain was named to the USWNT All-Time Best XI in 2013. In March 2017, she was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In 2018 she was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Chastain was born and raised in San Jose, California and began playing soccer at the age of eight. Because there was no girls&#x27; soccer team at Davis Junior High School, she played for the boys&#x27; soccer team after a successful tryout.
Chastain attended Archbishop Mitty High School and helped lead the team to three consecutive Central Coast Section championships.

==Playing career==

===Collegiate===

====California Golden Bears, 1986====
Chastain attended University of California, Berkeley where she played as a forward for the Golden Bears and scored 15 goals as a freshman. Following her first and only year with the Bears, she was named All-American and earned Freshman Player Of The Year honors by Soccer America. Soon after, she underwent reconstructive anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgeries on both knees which caused her to miss the 1987 and 1988 seasons.

==== Santa Clara Broncos, 1989–1990 ====
After transferring to Santa Clara University ahead of the 1989 season, Chastain helped lead the Broncos to two consecutive Final Four NCAA College Cup appearances (for the first time ever) in 1989 and 1990. Chastain scored ten goals for the Broncos during the regular season. In 1990, she was a national scoring leader with 22 goals (50 points) and helped the Broncos to a record. The same year, she was named the ISAA Player of the Year. She also won the Honda Sports Award as the nation&#x27;s top soccer player. She graduated from SCU with a degree in communications in 1991.

=== International ===
Of her 192 international career caps, Chastain played 89 primarily as a defender but occasionally as a midfielder. On June 1, 1988, she earned her first cap for the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team during a match against Japan. She scored her first international goal on April 18, 1991. After coming in as a substitute forward, she scored five consecutive goals in the team&#x27;s 12–0 win against Mexico during the 1991 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Championship.

==== 1991 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup ====
The U.S. went on to win the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in China.

==== 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup ====
Chastain was not called for the 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in Sweden, in which the U.S. won the bronze medal.

==== 1996 Summer Olympics ====
Playing as a defender, Chastain competed with the national team at the 1996 Women&#x27;s Olympic Football Tournament in Atlanta, the first Olympic tournament to include women&#x27;s soccer. She played every minute of the U.S.&#x27; games despite suffering a third serious knee injury during the semifinal against Norway. The Americans won the gold medal after defeating China 2–1 in the final.

==== 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup ====
In the quarter-finals of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Chastain scored an own goal in the fifth minute for Germany. However, she redeemed herself by scoring the second equalizing goal for the U.S. in the 49th minute, finishing a corner kick that was taken by Mia Hamm. The match ended with a 3–2 win to the U.S. to advance to the semi-finals against Brazil, which they won 2–0. Later, Chastain, who had missed a penalty kick in the Algarve Cup against China months earlier, scored the deciding penalty against the same opponent in the final, clinching the World Cup title for the U.S. in the Rose Bowl, Pasadena. Chastain celebrated by removing her shirt, exposing her sports bra. This led to both praise and criticism from spectators and sports commentators, and the image of the celebration is considered a key symbol of women&#x27;s athletics worldwide.

===Club===

==== Shiroki FC, 1993 ====
In 1993, Chastain played club soccer for one season in Japan&#x27;s L.League for Shiroki FC. She earned team most valuable player (MVP) honors and was the only foreigner to be named one of the league&#x27;s top 11 players.

====San Jose CyberRays, 2001–2003 ====
Following the success of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s Cup, Chastain was a founding player in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, the first professional women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States. She played for the San Jose CyberRays all three years of the league&#x27;s existence. During the league&#x27;s inaugural season, she helped the team finish second in the regular season with a record securing a berth to the playoffs. The team eventually won the league&#x27;s championship title after defeating the Atlanta Beat in penalty kicks. Chastain started in all 19 games in which she played during the regular season, scored 2 goals, and provided 5 assists. During the playoffs, she started in both games and scored two goals.

The CyberRays finished in fifth place during the 2002 season with a record. Chastain started in all 18 games in which she played, scored 4 goals, and provided 3 assists.
During the 2003 season, Chastain started in all 15 games as a defender, scored 1 goal, and provided 4 assists. San Jose finished in sixth place during the regular season with a record.

==== FC Gold Pride, 2009 ====
In 2009 at age 40, Chastain played as a midfielder for FC Gold Pride in Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS), the second professional women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States. She was selected in the seventh round of the 2009 WPS Draft. She started in five of the ten games in which she played. The Pride finished in last place during the regular season with a record.

===Goal celebration===
On July 10, 1999, at the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after scoring the fifth kick in the penalty shootout to give the United States the championship, and the win over China in the final game, Chastain celebrated by spontaneously taking off her jersey and falling to her knees in a sports bra, her fists clenched, flexing her arms. Removing a jersey in celebration of a goal is so common in men&#x27;s soccer that it has, at times, been cause for an automatic yellow card caution, according to the Laws of the Game. The image of her celebration was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;most iconic photograph ever taken of a female athlete&quot;, and it has been considered one of the more famous photographs of a woman celebrating an athletic victory. Chastain described the celebration as &quot;momentary insanity, nothing more, nothing less. I wasn&#x27;t thinking about anything. I thought, &#x27;This is the greatest moment of my life on the soccer field.

In 2019, her celebration was commemorated with a bronze statue by Brian Hanlon outside the stadium where it occurred.

In the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 Final at Wembley, England striker Chloe Kelly celebrated her 110th-minute goal against Germany in the same way. Like Chastain, Kelly&#x27;s goal was a match and tournament winner – in Kelly&#x27;s case, securing not only the Lionesses&#x27; first ever major trophy but the first England senior team major trophy (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s) since the men&#x27;s team won the 1966 World Cup as hosts. Chastain acknowledged and congratulated Kelly, saying it put &quot;a big smile on my face&quot; and jokingly telling her to &quot;enjoy the free rounds of pints and dinners for the rest of [her] life&quot; from England fans. Chastain and Kelly later also swapped shirts after the United States&#x27; friendly against England at Wembley that October.

=== Television and film ===
Chastain has been featured on numerous television shows including &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.
In February 2001, Chastain appeared on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; and won with one dollar. The children&#x27;s cancer research organization that she played for received $15,000. In 2007, Chastain appeared in the HBO documentary &quot;Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Soccer Team&quot;. The 44-minute film &quot;Brandi Chastain: A Tribute to a Champion&quot; was broadcast on Fox Soccer in December 2010 and focused on Chastain&#x27;s testimonial game that occurred in October of the same year.

Chastain appeared as Candy in the season 6 premiere of &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot;, an episode which also included her World Cup–winning goal in 1999.

=== Magazines and books ===
Following the 1999 World Cup, photos of Chastain&#x27;s goal celebration were featured on the covers of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; as well as numerous newspapers around the world. In 2015, the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover was voted as the second most iconic cover in the history of the magazine. The same year, she posed nude except for soccer cleats and a strategically placed soccer ball for &quot;Gear&quot; magazine. In November 2008, she was featured in &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot;.

In 2005, Chastain&#x27;s book &quot;It&#x27;s Not About the Bra: Play Hard, Play Fair, and Put the Fun Back Into Competitive Sports&quot; () was published by HarperCollins.

=== Endorsements===
Following the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Chastain signed a number of endorsement deals, including Nike. 
She was the official spokesperson for Pfizer&#x27;s (legacy Wyeth) multivitamin product Centrum Ultra. In July 2016, she partnered with pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. to promote education and awareness about inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In 1999, she was featured on the Wheaties box. She has appeared in television commercials for Nike, Bud Light, and Gatorade.
