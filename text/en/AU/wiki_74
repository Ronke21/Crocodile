<text>Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910), known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, and essayist. He was praised as the &quot;greatest humorist the United States has produced,&quot; with William Faulkner calling him &quot;the father of American literature.&quot; Twain&#x27;s novels include &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876) and its sequel, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884), with the latter often called the &quot;Great American Novel.&quot; He also wrote &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889) and &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot; (1894) and cowrote &quot;The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today&quot; (1873) with Charles Dudley Warner. The novelist Ernest Hemingway claimed that &quot;All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.&quot;

Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for both &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. He served an apprenticeship with a printer early in his career, and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to his older brother Orion Clemens&#x27; newspaper. Twain then became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, which provided him the material for &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883). Soon after, Twain headed west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;.

Twain first achieved success as a writer with the humorous story &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,&quot; which was published in 1865; it was based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where Twain had spent some time while he was working as a miner. The short story brought Twain international attention. He wrote both fiction and non-fiction. As his fame grew, Twain became a much sought-after speaker. His wit and satire, both in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and Twain was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.

Although Twain initially spoke out in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands, he later reversed his position, going on to become vice president of the American Anti-Imperialist League from 1901 until his death in 1910, coming out strongly against the Philippine–American War and American colonialism. Twain published a satirical pamphlet, &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot;, in 1905 about Belgian atrocities in the Congo Free State.

Twain earned a great deal of money from his writing and lectures, but invested in ventures that lost most of it, such as the Paige Compositor, a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but in time overcame his financial troubles with the help of Standard Oil executive Henry Huttleston Rogers. Twain eventually paid all his creditors in full, even though his declaration of bankruptcy meant he was not required to do so. One hundred years after his death, the first volume of his autobiography was published. Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet and predicted that his death would accompany it as well, writing in 1909: “I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835; it’s coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It would be a great disappointment in my life if I don’t. The Almighty has said, no doubt: &#x27;Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.&#x27;&quot; He died a day after the comet was at its closest to the Sun.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri. He was the sixth of seven children of Jane (&quot;née&quot; Lampton; 1803–1890), a native of Kentucky, and John Marshall Clemens (1798–1847), a native of Virginia.

His parents met when his father, a lawyer called to the bar in Kentucky, tried to help Jane&#x27;s father and uncle avoid bankruptcy. They were married in 1823. Twain was of English and Scots-Irish descent. Only three of his siblings lived beyond childhood: Orion (1825–1897), Pamela (1827–1904), and Henry (1838–1858). His brother Pleasant Hannibal (1828) died at three weeks of age, his sister Margaret (1830–1839) died when Twain was three, and his brother Benjamin (1832–1842) died three years later.

When he was four, Twain&#x27;s family moved to Hannibal, Missouri, a port town on the Mississippi River that inspired the fictional town of St. Petersburg in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Slavery was legal in Missouri at the time, and it became a theme in these writings. His father was an attorney and judge who died of pneumonia in 1847, when Twain was only 11. The following year, Twain left school after the fifth grade to become a printer&#x27;s apprentice. In 1851, he began working as a typesetter, contributing articles and humorous sketches to the &quot;Hannibal Journal&quot;, a newspaper that Orion owned. When Twain was 18, he left Hannibal and worked as a printer in New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, joining the newly formed International Typographical Union, the printers&#x27; trade union. Twain educated himself in public libraries in the evenings, finding wider information than at a conventional school.

Twain describes his boyhood in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, stating that &quot;there was but one permanent ambition&quot; among his comrades: to be a steamboatman. &quot;Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even in those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary – from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay.&quot; As Twain described it, the pilot&#x27;s prestige exceeded that of the captain. The pilot had to &quot;get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cottonwood and every obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, must... actually know where these things are in the dark&quot;. Steamboat pilot Horace E. Bixby took Twain on as a cub pilot to teach him the river between New Orleans and St. Louis for $500 (), payable out of Twain&#x27;s first wages after graduating. Twain studied the Mississippi, learning its landmarks, how to navigate its currents effectively, and how to read the river and its constantly shifting channels, reefs, submerged snags, and rocks that would &quot;tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated&quot;. It was more than two years before he received his pilot&#x27;s license. Piloting also gave Twain his pen name from &quot;mark twain&quot;, the leadsman&#x27;s cry for a measured river depth of two fathoms (12 feet), which was safe water for a steamboat.

As a young pilot, Clemens served on the steamer &quot;A. B. Chambers&quot; with Grant Marsh, who became famous for his exploits as a steamboat captain on the Missouri River. The two liked and admired each other, and maintained a correspondence for many years after Clemens left the river.

While training, Samuel convinced his younger brother Henry to work with him, and even arranged a post of mud clerk for him on the steamboat &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. On June 13, 1858, the steamboat&#x27;s boiler exploded; Henry succumbed to his wounds eight days later. Twain claimed to have foreseen this death in a dream a month earlier, which inspired his interest in parapsychology; Twain was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research. Twain was guilt-stricken and held himself responsible for the rest of his life. Twain continued to work on the river and was a river pilot until the Civil War broke out in 1861, when traffic was curtailed along the Mississippi River.

At the start of hostilities, he enlisted briefly in a local Confederate unit, the Marion Rangers as a Second Lieutenant. Twain later wrote the sketch &quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot;, describing how he and his friends had been Confederate volunteers for two weeks before their unit disbanded.

Twain then left for Nevada to work for his brother Orion, who was Secretary of the Nevada Territory. Twain describes the episode in his book &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

===In the American West===

Orion became secretary to Nevada Territory governor James W. Nye in 1861, and Twain joined him when he moved west. The brothers traveled more than two weeks on a stagecoach across the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, visiting the Mormon community in Salt Lake City.

Twain&#x27;s journey ended in the silver-mining town of Virginia City, Nevada, where he became a miner on the Comstock Lode. Twain failed as a miner and went to work at the Virginia City newspaper &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;, working under a friend, the writer Dan DeQuille. Twain first used his pen name here on February 3, 1863, when he wrote a humorous travel account titled &quot;Letter From Carson – re: Joe Goodman; party at Gov. Johnson&#x27;s; music&quot; and signed it &quot;Mark Twain&quot;.

Twain&#x27;s experiences in the American West inspired &quot;Roughing It&quot;, written during 1870–71 and published in 1872. His experiences in Angels Camp (in Calaveras County, California) provided material for &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot; (1865).

Twain moved to San Francisco in 1864, still as a journalist, and met writers such as Bret Harte and Artemus Ward. He may have been romantically involved with the poet Ina Coolbrith.

Twain&#x27;s first success as a writer came when his humorous tall tale &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot; was published on November 18, 1865, in the New York weekly &quot;The Saturday Press&quot;, bringing him national attention. A year later, Twain traveled to the Sandwich Islands (present-day Hawaii) as a reporter for the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot;. His letters to the &quot;Union&quot; were popular and became the basis for his first lectures.

In 1867, local newspapers
&quot;The Alta California&quot; and &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; funded Twain&#x27;s trip to the Mediterranean aboard the &quot;Quaker City&quot;, including a tour of Europe and the Middle East. He wrote a collection of travel letters which were later compiled as &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; (1869). It was on this trip that Twain met fellow passenger Charles Langdon, who showed him a picture of his sister Olivia. Twain later claimed to have fallen in love at first sight.

Upon returning to the United States, Twain was offered honorary membership in Yale University&#x27;s secret society Scroll and Key in 1868.

===Marriage and children===

Twain and Olivia Langdon corresponded throughout 1868. She rejected his first marriage proposal, but Twain continued to court her and managed to overcome her father&#x27;s initial reluctance. They were married in Elmira, New York, in February 1870. She came from a &quot;wealthy but liberal family&quot;; through her, Twain met abolitionists, &quot;socialists, principled atheists and activists for women&#x27;s rights and social equality&quot;, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass, and utopian socialist writer William Dean Howells, who became a long-time friend. The Clemenses lived in Buffalo, New York, from 1869 to 1871. Twain owned a stake in the &quot;Buffalo Express&quot; newspaper and worked as an editor and writer. While they were living in Buffalo, their son Langdon died of diphtheria in 1872 at the age of 19 months. They had three daughters: Susy (1872–1896), Clara (1874–1962), and Jean (1880–1909). The Clemenses formed a friendship with David Gray, who worked as an editor of the rival &quot;Buffalo Courier&quot;, and his wife Martha. Twain later wrote that the Grays were all the solace&#x27; he and Livy had during their &#x27;sorrowful and pathetic brief sojourn in Buffalo, and that Gray&#x27;s &quot;delicate gift for poetry&quot; was wasted working for a newspaper.

Starting in 1873, Twain moved his family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he arranged the building of a home next door to Stowe. In the 1870s and 1880s, the family summered at Quarry Farm in Elmira, the home of Olivia&#x27;s sister, Susan Crane. In 1874, Susan had a study built, an octagonal gazebo, apart from the main house as a surprise to Twain so that he would have a quiet place in which to write and enjoy his cigars.

Twain wrote many of his classic novels during his 17 years in Hartford (1874–1891) and over 20 summers at Quarry Farm. They include &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876), &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1881), &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883), &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884), and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889).

The couple&#x27;s marriage lasted 34 years until Olivia&#x27;s death in 1904. All of the Clemens family are buried in Elmira&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

===Love of science and technology===

Twain was fascinated with science and scientific inquiry. He developed a close and lasting friendship with Nikola Tesla, and the two spent much time together in Tesla&#x27;s laboratory.
Twain patented three inventions, including an &quot;Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments&quot; (to replace suspenders) and a history trivia game. Most commercially successful was a self-pasting scrapbook; a dried adhesive on the pages needed only to be moistened before use. More than 25,000 were sold.

Twain was an early proponent of fingerprinting as a forensic technique, featuring it in a tall tale in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883) and as a central plot element in the novel &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot; (1894).

Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889) features a time traveler from the contemporary U.S., using his knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England. This type of historical manipulation became a trope of speculative fiction as alternate histories.

In 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at Stormfield, his home in Redding, Connecticut, and filmed him. Part of the footage was used in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1909), a two-reel short film. It is the only known existing film footage of Twain.

===Financial troubles===
Twain made a substantial amount of money through his writing, but he lost a great deal through investments. Twain invested mostly in new inventions and technology, particularly the Paige typesetting machine. It was considered a mechanical marvel that amazed viewers when it worked, but it was prone to breakdowns. Twain spent $300,000 () on it between 1880 and 1894, but before it could be perfected it was rendered obsolete by the Linotype. He lost the bulk of his book profits, as well as a substantial portion of his wife&#x27;s inheritance.

Twain also lost money through his publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, which enjoyed initial success selling the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant but failed soon afterward, losing money on a biography of Pope Leo XIII. Fewer than 200 copies were sold.

Twain and his family closed down their expensive Hartford home in response to the dwindling income and moved to Europe in June 1891. William M. Laffan of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; and the McClure Newspaper Syndicate offered him the publication of a series of six European letters. Twain, Olivia, and their daughter Susy were all faced with health problems, and they believed that it would be of benefit to visit European baths. The family stayed mainly in France, Germany, and Italy until May 1895, with longer spells at Berlin (winter 1891–92), Florence (fall and winter 1892–93), and Paris (winters and springs 1893–94 and 1894–95). During that period, Twain returned to New York four times due to his enduring business troubles. Twain rented &quot;a cheap room&quot; in September 1893 at $1.50 per day () at The Players Club, which he had to keep until March 1894; meanwhile, Twain became &quot;the Belle of New York&quot;, in the words of biographer Albert Bigelow Paine.

Twain&#x27;s writings and lectures enabled him to recover financially, combined with the help of his friend Henry Huttleston Rogers. In 1893, Twain began a friendship with the financier, a principal of Standard Oil, that lasted the remainder of his life. Rogers first made Twain file for bankruptcy in April 1894, then had him transfer the copyrights on his written works to his wife to prevent creditors from gaining possession of them. Finally, Rogers took absolute charge of Twain&#x27;s money until all his creditors were paid.

Twain accepted an offer from Robert Sparrow Smythe and embarked on a year-long around-the-world lecture tour in July 1895 to pay off his creditors in full, although Twain was no longer under any legal obligation to do so. It was a long, arduous journey, and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a carbuncle. The first part of the itinerary took Twain across northern America to British Columbia, Canada, until the second half of August. For the second part, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean. Twain&#x27;s scheduled lecture in Honolulu, Hawaii, had to be canceled due to a cholera epidemic. Twain went on to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, and South Africa. His three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book &quot;Following the Equator&quot;. In the second half of July 1896, Twain sailed back to England, completing his circumnavigation of the world begun 14 months before.

Twain and his family spent four more years in Europe, mainly in England and Austria (October 1897 to May 1899), with longer spells in London and Vienna. Clara had wished to study the piano under Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna.
However, Jean&#x27;s health did not benefit from consulting with specialists in Vienna, the &quot;City of Doctors&quot;. The family moved to London in spring 1899, following a lead by Poultney Bigelow, who had a good experience being treated by Dr. Jonas Henrik Kellgren, a Swedish osteopathic practitioner in Belgravia. They were persuaded to spend the summer at Kellgren&#x27;s sanatorium by the lake in the Swedish village of Sanna. Coming back in fall, they continued the treatment in London, until Twain was convinced by lengthy inquiries in America that similar osteopathic expertise was available there.

In mid-1900, Twain was the guest of newspaper proprietor Hugh Gilzean-Reid at Dollis Hill House, located on the north side of London. Twain wrote that he had &quot;never seen any place that was so satisfactorily situated, with its noble trees and stretch of country, and everything that went to make life delightful, and all within a biscuit&#x27;s throw of the metropolis of the world.&quot; Twain then returned to America in October 1900, having earned enough to pay off his debts. In winter 1900/01, Twain became his country&#x27;s most prominent opponent of imperialism, raising the issue in his speeches, interviews, and writings. In January 1901, Twain began serving as vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League of New York.

===Speaking engagements===

Twain was in great demand as a featured speaker, performing solo humorous talks similar to modern stand-up comedy. He gave paid talks to many men&#x27;s clubs, including the Authors&#x27; Club, Beefsteak Club, Vagabonds, White Friars, and Monday Evening Club of Hartford.

In the late 1890s, Twain spoke to the Savage Club in London and was elected an honorary member. He was told that only three men had been so honored, including the Prince of Wales, and Twain replied: &quot;Well, it must make the Prince feel mighty fine.&quot; He visited Melbourne and Sydney in 1895 as part of a world lecture tour. In 1897, Twain spoke to the Concordia Press Club in Vienna as a special guest, following the diplomat Charlemagne Tower, Jr. He delivered the speech &quot;Die Schrecken der Deutschen Sprache&quot; (&quot;The Horrors of the German Language&quot;)—in German—to the great amusement of the audience. In 1901, Twain was invited to speak at Princeton University&#x27;s Cliosophic Literary Society, where he was made an honorary member.

====Canadian visits====
In 1881, Twain was honored at a banquet in Montreal, Canada where he made reference to securing a copyright. In 1883, Twain paid a brief visit to Ottawa, and he visited Toronto twice in 1884 and 1885 on a reading tour with George Washington Cable, known as the &quot;Twins of Genius&quot; tour.

The reason for the Toronto visits was to secure Canadian and British copyrights for Twain&#x27;s upcoming book &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, to which he had alluded in his Montreal visit. The reason for the Ottawa visit had been to secure Canadian and British copyrights for &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;. Publishers in Toronto had printed unauthorized editions of Twain&#x27;s books at the time, before an international copyright agreement was established in 1891. These were sold in the United States as well as in Canada, depriving him of royalties. Twain estimated that Belford Brothers&#x27; edition of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; alone had cost him $10,000 (). He had unsuccessfully attempted to secure the rights for &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; in 1881, in conjunction with his Montreal trip. Eventually, Twain received legal advice to register a copyright in Canada (for both Canada and Britain) prior to publishing in the United States, which would restrain the Canadian publishers from printing a version when the American edition was published. There was a requirement that a copyright be registered to a Canadian resident; Twain addressed this by his short visits to the country.

===Later life and death===

In his later years, Twain lived at 14 West 10th Street in Manhattan. He passed through a period of deep depression which began in 1896 when his daughter Susy died of meningitis. Olivia&#x27;s death in 1904 and Jean&#x27;s on December 24, 1909, deepened Twain&#x27;s gloom. On May 20, 1909, his close friend Henry Rogers died suddenly.

In April 1906, Twain heard that his friend Ina Coolbrith had lost nearly all that she owned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he volunteered a few autographed portrait photographs to be sold for her benefit. To further aid Coolbrith, George Wharton James visited Twain in New York and arranged for a new portrait session. Twain was resistant initially, but he eventually admitted that four of the resulting images were the finest ones ever taken of him. In September, Twain started publishing chapters from his autobiography in the &quot;North American Review&quot;. The same year, Charlotte Teller, a writer living with her grandmother at 3 Fifth Avenue, began an acquaintanceship with him which &quot;lasted several years and may have included romantic intentions&quot; on his part.
In 1906, Twain formed the Angel Fish and Aquarium Club, for girls whom he viewed as surrogate granddaughters. Its dozen or so members ranged in age from 10 to 16. Twain exchanged letters with his &quot;Angel Fish&quot; girls and invited them to concerts and the theatre and to play games. Twain wrote in 1908 that the club was his &quot;life&#x27;s chief delight&quot;. In 1907, he met Dorothy Quick (then age 11) on a transatlantic crossing, beginning &quot;a friendship that was to last until the very day of his death&quot;.
Twain was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) by Yale University in 1901 and a Doctor of Law by the University of Missouri in 1902. Oxford University awarded him a Doctorate of Law in 1907.

Twain was born two weeks after Halley&#x27;s Comet&#x27;s closest approach in 1835; he said in 1909:
Twain&#x27;s prediction was eerily accurate; he died of a heart attack on April 21, 1910, in Stormfield, one day after the comet was at its closest to the Sun and a month before the comet the passed Earth.
Upon hearing of Twain&#x27;s death, President William Howard Taft said:

Twain&#x27;s funeral was at the Brick Presbyterian Church on Fifth Avenue, New York. He is buried in his wife&#x27;s family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York. The Langdon family plot is marked by a monument (two fathoms, or &quot;mark twain&quot;) placed there by Twain&#x27;s surviving daughter Clara. There is also a smaller headstone. He expressed a preference for cremation (for example, in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;), but he acknowledged that his surviving family would have the last word.

Officials in Connecticut and New York estimated the value of Twain&#x27;s estate at $471,000 ($ in ).

==Writing==
===Overview===
Twain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but he became a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies, and murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, Twain combined rich humor, sturdy narrative, and social criticism in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. He was a master of rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language.

Many of Twain&#x27;s works have been suppressed at times for various reasons. The &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; has been repeatedly restricted in American high schools, not least for its frequent use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, a slur commonly used for Black people in the nineteenth century.

A complete bibliography of Twain&#x27;s works is nearly impossible to compile because of the vast number of pieces he wrote (often in obscure newspapers) and his use of several different pen names. Additionally, a large portion of Twain&#x27;s speeches and lectures have been lost or were not recorded; thus, the compilation of his works is an ongoing process. Researchers have rediscovered published material as recently as 1995 and 2015.

===Early journalism and travelogues===
Twain was writing for the Virginia City newspaper the &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot; in 1863 when he met lawyer Tom Fitch, editor of the competing newspaper &quot;Virginia Daily Union&quot; and known as the &quot;silver-tongued orator of the Pacific&quot;. Twain credited Fitch with giving him his &quot;first really profitable lesson&quot; in writing. &quot;When I first began to lecture, and in my earlier writings,&quot; Twain later commented, &quot;my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything I saw and heard.&quot; In 1866, he presented his lecture on the Sandwich Islands to a crowd in Washoe City, Nevada. Afterwards, Fitch told him:
Clemens, your lecture was magnificent. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in my entire life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin – the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.
It was in these days that Twain became a writer of the Sagebrush School; he was known later as its most famous member. Twain&#x27;s first important work was &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,&quot; published in the &quot;New York Saturday Press&quot; on November 18, 1865. After a burst of popularity, the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; commissioned him to write letters about his travel experiences. The first journey that Twain took for this job was to ride the steamer &quot;Ajax&quot; on its maiden voyage to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). All the while, he was writing letters to the newspaper that were meant for publishing, chronicling his experiences with humor. These letters proved to be the genesis to Twain&#x27;s work with the San Francisco &quot;Alta California&quot; newspaper, which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from San Francisco to New York City via the Panama isthmus.

On June 8, 1867, Twain set sail on the pleasure cruiser &quot;Quaker City&quot; for five months, and this trip resulted in &quot;The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims&#x27; Progress&quot;. In 1872, he published his second piece of travel literature, &quot;Roughing It&quot;, as an account of his journey from Missouri to Nevada, his subsequent life in the American West, and his visit to Hawaii. The book lampoons American and Western society in the same way that &quot;Innocents&quot; critiqued the various countries of Europe and the Middle East. Twain&#x27;s next work was &quot;The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today&quot;, his first attempt at writing a novel. The book, written with Twain&#x27;s neighbor Charles Dudley Warner, is also his only collaboration.

Twain&#x27;s next work drew on his experiences on the Mississippi River. &quot;Old Times on the Mississippi&quot; was a series of sketches published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1875 featuring his disillusionment with Romanticism. &quot;Old Times&quot; eventually became the starting point for &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;.

===&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;===
Twain&#x27;s next major publication was &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, which draws on his youth in Hannibal. Tom Sawyer was modeled on Twain as a child, with traces of schoolmates John Briggs and Will Bowen. The book also introduces Huckleberry Finn in a supporting role, based on Twain&#x27;s boyhood friend Tom Blankenship.

&quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; was not as well received, despite a storyline that is common in film and literature today. The book tells the story of two boys born on the same day who are physically identical, acting as a social commentary as the prince and pauper switch places. Twain had started &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (which he consistently had problems completing) and had completed his travel book &quot;A Tramp Abroad&quot;, which describes his travels through central and southern Europe.

Twain&#x27;s next major published work was the &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, which confirmed him as a noteworthy American writer. Some have called it the first Great American Novel, and the book has become required reading in many schools throughout the United States. &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; was an offshoot from &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and had a more serious tone than its predecessor. Four hundred manuscript pages were written in mid-1876, right after the publication of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. The last fifth of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is subject to much controversy. Some say that Twain experienced a &quot;failure of nerve,&quot; as critic Leo Marx puts it. Ernest Hemingway once said of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;:

If you read it, you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.

Hemingway also wrote in the same essay:

All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

Near the completion of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, Twain wrote &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, which is said to have heavily influenced the novel. The travel work recounts Twain&#x27;s memories and new experiences after a 22-year absence from the Mississippi River. In it, he also explains that &quot;Mark Twain&quot; was the call made when the boat was in safe water, indicating a depth of two (or ) fathoms ().

McDowell&#x27;s cave—now known as Mark Twain Cave in Hannibal, Missouri, and frequently mentioned in Twain&#x27;s book &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;—has &quot;Sam Clemens&quot;, Twain&#x27;s real name, engraved on the wall by Twain himself.

===Later writing===
Twain produced President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; through his fledgling publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, which he co-owned with Charles L. Webster, his nephew by marriage.

At this time, Twain also wrote &quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot; for &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;. This piece detailed his two-week stint in a Confederate militia during the Civil War. Twain next focused on &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, written with the same historical fiction style as &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; shows the absurdities of political and social norms by setting them in the court of King Arthur. The book was started in December 1885, then shelved a few months later until the summer of 1887, and eventually finished in the spring of 1889.

Twain&#x27;s next large-scale work was &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot;, which he wrote rapidly, as he was desperately trying to stave off bankruptcy. From November 12 to December 14, 1893, Twain wrote 60,000 words for the novel. Critics have pointed to this rushed completion as the cause of the novel&#x27;s rough organization and constant disruption of the plot. This novel also contains the tale of two boys born on the same day who switch positions in life, like &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. It was first published serially in &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, and when it was finally published in book form, &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot; appeared as the main title; however, the &quot;subtitles&quot; make the entire title read &quot;The Tragedy of Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson and the Comedy of The Extraordinary Twins&quot;.

Twain&#x27;s next venture was a work of straight fiction that he called &quot;Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc&quot; and dedicated to his wife. Twain said a year before his death that this was the work that he was most proud of, despite the criticism that he received for it, writing: &quot; I like &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it perfectly well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing. The others needed no preparation and got none.&quot; The book had been a dream of Twain&#x27;s since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when Twain was an adolescent. It was written at the time of his bankruptcy and Twain was convinced that it would save his financial disposition. Twain specifically insisted it to be an anonymous publication so that readers would take it as a serious historical account. With the help of his financial adviser Henry Huttleston Rogers, it was published anonymously in serials in the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1895.

To pay the bills and keep his business projects afloat, Twain had begun to write articles and commentary furiously, with diminishing returns, but it was not enough. He filed for bankruptcy in 1894. During this time of dire financial straits, Twain published several literary reviews in newspapers to help make ends meet. He famously derided James Fenimore Cooper in his article detailing Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Literary Offenses&quot;. Twain became an extremely outspoken critic of other authors and other critics; he suggested that, before praising Cooper&#x27;s work, Thomas Lounsbury, Brander Matthews, and Wilkie Collins &quot;ought to have read some of it&quot;.

George Eliot, Jane Austen, and Robert Louis Stevenson also fell under Twain&#x27;s attack during this time period, beginning around 1890 and continuing until his death. Twain outlines what he considers to be &quot;quality writing&quot; in several letters and essays, in addition to providing a source for the &quot;tooth and claw&quot; style of literary criticism. Twain places emphasis on concision, utility of word choice, and realism; he complains, for example, that Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Deerslayer&quot; purports to be realistic but has several shortcomings. Ironically, several of Twain&#x27;s own works were later criticized for lack of continuity (&quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;) and organization (&quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot;).

Twain&#x27;s wife died in 1904 while the couple were staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence. After some time had passed, he published some works that his wife, his &quot;de facto&quot; editor and censor throughout her married life, had looked down upon. &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; is perhaps the best known, depicting various visits of Satan to earth. This particular work was not published in Twain&#x27;s lifetime. His manuscripts included three versions, written between 1897 and 1905: the so-called Hannibal, Eseldorf, and Print Shop versions. The resulting confusion led to extensive publication of a jumbled version, and only recently have the original versions become available as Twain wrote them.

Twain&#x27;s last work was his autobiography, which he dictated and thought would be most entertaining if he went off on whims and tangents in non-chronological order. Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into a more conventional form, thereby eliminating some of Twain&#x27;s humor and the flow of the book. The first volume of the autobiography, over 736 pages, was published by the University of California in November 2010, 100 years after his death, as Twain wished. It soon became an unexpected best-seller, making Twain one of a very few authors publishing new best-selling volumes in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.

===Censorship===
Twain&#x27;s works have been subjected to censorship efforts. According to Stuart (2013), &quot;Leading these banning campaigns, generally, were religious organizations or individuals in positions of influence – not so much working librarians, who had been instilled with that American &quot;library spirit&quot; which honored intellectual freedom (within bounds of course)&quot;. In 1905, the Brooklyn Public Library banned both &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; from the children&#x27;s department because of their language.

===Publishers===
For two decades, Twain lived in a house in Hartford, Connecticut (1871–1891), and the American Publishing Company in that city published the first edition of several of his books. The same can be said about a number of New York-based companies, such as Harper &amp; Brothers and his nephew&#x27;s Charles L. Webster and Company. Other memorable editions were created by The Ash Ranch Press of San Diego and Barry Moser&#x27;s Pennyroyal Press.

==Views==
Twain&#x27;s views became more radical as he grew older. In a letter to friend and fellow writer William Dean Howells in 1887, Twain acknowledged that his views had changed and developed over his lifetime, referring to one of his favorite works:
===Politics===

Twain was a staunch supporter of technological progress and commerce. He was against welfare measures, because Twain believed that society in the &quot;business age&quot; is governed by &quot;exact and constant&quot; laws that should not be &quot;interfered with for the accommodation of any individual or political or religious faction&quot;. He opined that &quot;there is no good government at all &amp; none possible&quot;. In the opinion of Washington University professor Guy A. Cardwell:

====Labor====
Twain wrote glowingly about unions in the river boating industry in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, which was read in union halls decades later. He supported the labor movement, especially one of the most important unions, the Knights of Labor. In a speech to them, Twain said:
Twain further wrote &quot;Why is it right that there is not a fairer division of the spoil all around? Because laws and constitutions have ordered otherwise. Then it follows that laws and constitutions should change around and say there shall be a more nearly equal division.&quot;

====Imperialism====
Before 1899, Twain was largely in favor of imperialism. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, he spoke out strongly in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands. Twain said the war with Spain in 1898 was &quot;the worthiest&quot; war ever fought. However, he reversed course in 1899. In the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, October 16, 1900, Twain describes his transformation and political awakening, in the context of the Philippine–American War, to anti-imperialism:

During the Boxer Rebellion, Twain said that &quot;the Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other people. I wish him success.&quot;

From 1901, soon after his return from Europe, until his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League, which opposed the annexation of the Philippines by the United States and had &quot;tens of thousands of members&quot;. He wrote many political pamphlets for the organization. The &quot;Incident in the Philippines&quot;, posthumously published in 1924, was in response to the Moro Crater Massacre, in which 600 Moros were killed. Twain wrote: &quot;In what way was it a battle? It has no resemblance to a battle...We cleaned up our four days&#x27; work and made it complete by butchering these helpless people.&quot; Many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on anti-imperialism appeared for the first time in book form in 1992.

Twain was critical of imperialism in other countries as well. In &quot;Following the Equator&quot;, Twain expresses &quot;hatred and condemnation of imperialism of all stripes&quot;. He was highly critical of European imperialists such as Cecil Rhodes and King Leopold II of Belgium, both of whom attempted to establish colonies on the African continent during the Scramble for Africa. &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot; is a political satire about the monarch&#x27;s private colony, the Congo Free State. Reports of outrageous exploitation and grotesque abuses led to widespread international outcry in the early 1900s, arguably the first large-scale human rights movement. In the soliloquy, the King argues that bringing Christianity to the colony outweighs &quot;a little starvation&quot;. The abuses against Congolese forced laborers continued until the movement forced the Belgian government to take direct control of the colony.

During the Philippine–American War, Twain wrote a short pacifist story titled &quot;The War Prayer&quot;, which makes the point that humanism and Christianity&#x27;s preaching of love are incompatible with the conduct of war. It was submitted to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; for publication, but on March 22, 1905, the magazine rejected the story as &quot;not quite suited to a woman&#x27;s magazine&quot;. Eight days later, Twain wrote to his friend Daniel Carter Beard, to whom he had read the story, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the prayer will be published in my time. None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth.&quot; Because he had an exclusive contract with Harper &amp; Brothers, Twain could not publish &quot;The War Prayer&quot; elsewhere; it remained unpublished until 1916. It was republished in the 1960s as campaigning material by anti-war activists.

Twain acknowledged that he had originally sympathized with the more moderate Girondins of the French Revolution and then shifted his sympathies to the more radical Sansculottes, indeed identifying himself as &quot;a Marat&quot; and writing that the Reign of Terror paled in comparison to the older terrors that preceded it. Twain supported the revolutionaries in Russia against the reformists, arguing that the Tsar must be got rid of by violent means, because peaceful ones would not work. He summed up his views of revolutions in the following statement:
====Civil rights====
Twain was an adamant supporter of the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of slaves, even going so far as to say, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Proclamation ... not only set the black slaves free, but set the white man free also&quot;. He argued that non-whites did not receive justice in the United States, once saying, &quot;I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean, cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature ... but I never saw a Chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done to him&quot;. Twain paid for at least one black person to attend Yale Law School and for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister.

Twain was also a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, as evidenced by his &quot;Votes for Women&quot; speech, given in 1901.

Helen Keller benefited from Twain&#x27;s support as she pursued her college education and publishing despite her disabilities and financial limitations. The two were friends for roughly 16 years.

Through Twain&#x27;s efforts, the Connecticut legislature voted a pension for Prudence Crandall, since 1995 Connecticut&#x27;s official heroine, for her efforts towards the education of young African-American women in Connecticut. Twain also offered to purchase for her use her former house in Canterbury, home of the Canterbury Female Boarding School, but she declined.

At 62, Twain wrote in his travelogue &quot;Following the Equator&quot; (1897) that in colonized lands all over the world, &quot;savages&quot; have always been wronged by &quot;whites&quot; in the most merciless ways, such as &quot;robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man&#x27;s whiskey&quot;; his conclusion is that &quot;there are many humorous things in this world; among them the white man&#x27;s notion that he is less savage than the other savages&quot;. Describing his travels, Twain wrote, &quot;So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile.&quot;

====Native Americans====
Twain&#x27;s earlier writings on American Indians reflected his view of essentialized racial difference. Twain wrote in &quot;The Noble Red Man&quot; in 1870: In the same tract, Twain advocates genocide, describing the &quot;Noble Aborigine&quot; as : &quot;nothing but a poor filthy, naked scurvy vagabond, whom to exterminate were a charity to the Creator&#x27;s worthier insects and reptiles which he oppresses&quot; This piece sought to undermine the sympathy felt on the &quot;Atlantic seabord&quot; for Native Americans. In 1895, Twain was still ridiculing the author of &quot;Last of the Mohicans,&quot; saying in &quot;Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s Literary Offenses&quot; that Cooper &quot;[...] was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.&quot;

====Political parties====
Twain was a Republican for most of his life. However, in 1884, Twain publicly broke with his party and joined the Mugwumps to support the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland, over the Republican nominee, James G. Blaine, whom he considered a corrupt politician. Twain spoke at rallies in favor of Cleveland. In the early 20th century, Twain began decrying both Democrats and Republicans as &quot;insane&quot; and proposed, in his 1907 book &quot;Christian Science&quot;, that while each party recognized the other&#x27;s insanity, only the Mugwumps (that is, those who eschewed party loyalties in favor of voting for &quot;the best man&quot;) could perceive the overall madness linking the two.

===Religion===

Twain was a Presbyterian. He was critical of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life. For example, Twain wrote, &quot;Faith is believing what you know ain&#x27;t so&quot;, and &quot;If Christ were here now there is one thing he would not be – a Christian&quot;. With anti-Catholic sentiment rampant in 19th century America, Twain noted that he was &quot;educated to enmity toward everything that is Catholic&quot;. As an adult, Twain engaged in religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as Twain wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality.

Twain generally avoided publishing his most controversial opinions on religion in his lifetime, and they are known from essays and stories that were published later. In the essay &quot;Three Statements of the Eighties&quot; in the 1880s, Twain stated that he believed in an almighty God, but not in any messages, revelations, holy scriptures such as the Bible, Providence, or retribution in the afterlife. Twain did state that &quot;the goodness, the justice, and the mercy of God are manifested in His works&quot;, but also that &quot;the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws&quot;, which determine &quot;small matters&quot;, such as who dies in a pestilence. At other times, he plainly professed a belief in Providence. In some later writings in the 1890s, Twain was less optimistic about the goodness of God, observing that &quot;if our Maker &quot;is&quot; all-powerful for good or evil, He is not in His right mind&quot;. At other times, he conjectured sardonically that perhaps God had created the world with all its tortures for some purpose of His own, but was otherwise indifferent to humanity, which was too petty and insignificant to deserve His attention anyway.

In 1901, Twain criticized the actions of the missionary Dr. William Scott Ament (1851–1909) because Ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from Chinese subjects in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising of 1900. Twain&#x27;s response to hearing of Ament&#x27;s methods was published in the &quot;North American Review&quot; in February 1901: &quot;To the Person Sitting in Darkness&quot;, and deals with examples of imperialism in China, South Africa, and with the U.S. occupation of the Philippines. A subsequent article, &quot;To My Missionary Critics&quot; published in &quot;The North American Review&quot; in April 1901, unapologetically continues his attack, but with the focus shifted from Ament to his missionary superiors, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

After his death, Twain&#x27;s family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional religion, including &quot;Letters from the Earth&quot;, which was not published until his daughter Clara reversed her position in 1962 in response to Soviet propaganda about the withholding. The anti-religious &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; was published in 1916. &quot;Little Bessie&quot;, a story ridiculing Christianity, was first published in the 1972 collection &quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s Fables of Man&quot;.

Twain raised money to build a Presbyterian Church in Nevada in 1864.

Twain created a reverent portrayal of Joan of Arc, a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years, studied for a dozen years and spent two years writing about. In 1900 and again in 1908, Twain stated, &quot;I like &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; best of all my books, it is the best&quot;.

Those who knew Twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife, his daughter Clara saying: &quot;Sometimes he believed death ended everything, but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond.&quot;

Twain&#x27;s frankest views on religion appeared in his final work &quot;Autobiography of Mark Twain&quot;, the publication of which started in November 2010, 100 years after his death. In it, Twain said:

Twain was a Freemason. He belonged to Polar Star Lodge No. 79 A.F.&amp;A.M., based in St. Louis. Twain was initiated an Entered Apprentice on May 22, 1861, passed to the degree of Fellow Craft on June 12, and raised to the degree of Master Mason on July 10.

Twain visited Salt Lake City for two days and met there members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They also gave him a Book of Mormon. He later wrote in &quot;Roughing It&quot; about that book:

==Pen names==
Twain used different pen names before deciding on &quot;Mark Twain&quot;. He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as &quot;Josh&quot; until 1863. Additionally, Twain used the pen name &quot;Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass&quot; for a series of humorous letters.

Twain maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating water safe for the passage of boat, was a measure on the sounding line. Twain is an archaic term for &quot;two&quot;, as in &quot;The veil of the temple was rent in twain.&quot; The riverboatman&#x27;s cry was &quot;mark twain&quot; or, more fully, &quot;by the mark twain&quot;, meaning &quot;according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]&quot;; that is, &quot;The water is deep and it is safe to pass.&quot;

Twain said that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, Twain wrote:
Captain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them &quot;MARK TWAIN&quot;, and give them to the &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot;. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; ... At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner&#x27;s discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands – a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.

Twain&#x27;s story about his pen name has been questioned by some, with the suggestion that &quot;mark twain&quot; refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper&#x27;s saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Samuel Clemens himself responded to this suggestion by saying, &quot;Mark Twain was the nom de plume of one Captain Isaiah Sellers, who used to write river news over it for the &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot;. He died in 1863 and as he could no longer need that signature, I laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietor&#x27;s remains. That is the history of the nom de plume I bear.&quot;

In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers&#x27;s use of &quot;Mark Twain&quot;: I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, and one day I wrote a rude and crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning the river and the changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs &quot;Mark Twain&quot; and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn&#x27;t know it, and the pilots didn&#x27;t know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in &quot;Old Times on the Mississippi.&quot; The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again. 

==Legacy and depictions==

While Twain is often depicted wearing a white suit, modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout his life are unfounded. Evidence suggests that Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit, after the death of his wife in 1904. However, there is also evidence showing Twain wearing a white suit before 1904. In 1882, he sent a photograph of himself in a white suit to 18-year-old Edward W. Bok, later publisher of the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, with a handwritten dated note. The white suit did eventually become Twain&#x27;s trademark, as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity (such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter). McMasters&#x27; &quot;The Mark Twain Encyclopedia&quot; states that Twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years, except at one banquet speech.

In his autobiography, Twain writes of his early experiments with wearing white out-of-season:

<text>A fathom is a unit of length in the imperial and the U.S. customary systems equal to , used especially for measuring the depth of water. The fathom is neither an international standard (SI) unit, nor an internationally accepted non-SI unit. Historically it was the maritime measure of depth in the English-speaking world but, apart from within the US, charts now use metres.

There are two yards (6 feet) in an imperial fathom. Originally the span of a man&#x27;s outstretched arms, the size of a fathom has varied slightly depending on whether it was defined as a thousandth of an (Admiralty) nautical mile or as a multiple of the imperial yard. Formerly, the term was used for any of several units of length varying around .

==Etymology==
The term (pronounced ) derives (via Middle English &quot;fathme&quot;) from the Old English &quot;fæðm&quot;, which is cognate with the Danish word &quot;favn&quot; (via the Vikings) and means &quot;embracing arms&quot; or &quot;pair of outstretched arms&quot;. It is maybe also cognate with the Old High German word &quot;fadum&quot;, which has the same meaning and also means &quot;yarn (originally stretching between the outstretched fingertips)&quot;.

==Forms==
===Ancient fathoms===
The Ancient Greek measure known as the orguia (, &quot;orgyiá&quot;, &quot;outstretched&quot;) is usually translated as &quot;fathom&quot;. By the Byzantine period, this unit came in two forms: a &quot;simple orguia&quot; (, &quot;haplē orguiá&quot;) roughly equivalent to the old Greek fathom (6 Byzantine feet, m) and an &quot;imperial&quot; (, &quot;basilikē&quot;) or &quot;geometric orguia&quot; (, &quot;geōmetrikē orguiá&quot;) that was one-eighth longer (6 feet and a span, m).

=== International fathom ===
One international fathom is equal to:
* 1.8288 metres exactly (Official international definition of the fathom)
=== British fathom ===
The British Admiralty defined a fathom to be a thousandth of an imperial nautical mile (which was 6080 ft) or . In practice the &quot;warship fathom&quot; of exactly was used in Britain and the United States. No conflict between the definitions existed in practice, since depths on imperial nautical charts were indicated in feet if less than and in fathoms for depths greater than that. Until the 19th century in England, the length of the fathom was more variable: from  feet on merchant vessels to either on fishing vessels (from ).

=== Other definitions ===
Other definitions of fathom include:
* 1.828804 m (Obsolete measurement of the fathom based on the US survey foot, only for use of historical and legacy applications)
* 2 yards exactly
* 18 hands

One metre is about 0.5468 fathoms

In the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom defined the length of the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre. In 1959 United States kept the US survey foot as definition for the fathom.

In October 2019, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey and the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced their joint intent to retire the U.S. survey foot, with effect from the end of 2022. The fathom in U.S. Customary units is thereafter defined based on the International 1959 foot, giving the length of the fathom as exactly 1.8288 metres in the United States as well.

==Derived units==
At one time, a &quot;quarter&quot; meant one-quarter of a fathom.

A &quot;cable length&quot;, based on the length of a ship&#x27;s cable, has been variously reckoned as equal to 100 or 120 fathoms.

==Use of the fathom==
===Water depth===

Most modern nautical charts indicate depth in metres. However, the U.S. Hydrographic Office uses feet and fathoms. A nautical chart will always explicitly indicate the units of depth used.

To measure the depth of shallow waters, boatmen used a sounding line containing fathom points, some marked and others in between, called &quot;deeps&quot;, unmarked but estimated by the user. Water near the coast and not too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line was referred to as &quot;in soundings&quot; or &quot;on soundings&quot;. The area offshore beyond the 100 fathom line, too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line, was referred to as &quot;out of soundings&quot; or &quot;off soundings&quot;. A &quot;deep-sea lead&quot;, the heaviest of sounding leads, was used in water exceeding 100 fathoms in depth.

This technique has been superseded by sonic depth finders for measuring mechanically the depth of water beneath a ship, one version of which is the &quot;Fathometer&quot; (trademark). The record made by such a device is a &quot;fathogram&quot;. A &quot;fathom line&quot; or &quot;fathom curve&quot;, a usually sinuous line on a nautical chart, joins all points having the same depth of water, thereby indicating the contour of the ocean floor.

Some extensive flat areas of the sea bottom with constant depth are known by their fathom number, like the Broad Fourteens or the Long Forties, both in the North Sea.

===Line length===
The components of a commercial fisherman&#x27;s setline were measured in fathoms. The rope called a &quot;groundline&quot;, used to form the main line of a setline, was usually provided in bundles of 300 fathoms. A single of this rope was referred to as a &quot;line&quot;. Especially in Pacific coast fisheries the setline was composed of units called &quot;skates&quot;, each consisting of several hundred fathoms of groundline, with and hooks attached. A &quot;tuck seine&quot; or &quot;tuck net&quot; about long, and very deep in the middle, was used to take fish from a larger seine.

A &quot;line&quot; attached to a whaling harpoon was about . A &quot;forerunner&quot; — a piece of cloth tied on a ship&#x27;s log line some fathoms from the outboard end — marked the limit of drift line. A &quot;kite&quot; was a drag, towed under water at any depth up to about , which upon striking bottom, was upset and rose to the surface.

A &quot;shot&quot;, one of the forged lengths of chain joined by shackles to form an anchor cable, was usually .

A &quot;shackle&quot;, a length of cable or chain equal to . In 1949, the British navy redefined the shackle to be .

The Finnish fathom (&quot;syli&quot;) is occasionally used: nautical mile or cable length.

===Burial===
A burial at sea (where the body is weighted to force it to the bottom) requires a minimum of six fathoms of water. This is the origin of the phrase &quot;to deep six&quot; as meaning to discard, or dispose of.

The phrase is echoed in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, where Ariel tells Ferdinand, &quot;Full fathom five thy father lies&quot;.

===On land===
Until early in the 20th century, it was the unit used to measure the depth of mines (mineral extraction) in the United Kingdom. Miners also use it as a unit of area equal to 6 feet square (3.34 m2) in the plane of a vein. In Britain, it can mean the quantity of wood in a pile of any length measuring square in cross section. In Central Europe, the klafter was the corresponding unit of comparable length, as was the toise in France. In Hungary the square fathom (&quot;négyszögöl&quot;) is still in use as an unofficial measure of land area, primarily for small lots suitable for construction.

<text>The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) censors both the publishing and viewing of online material. Many controversial events are censored from news coverage, preventing many Chinese citizens from knowing about the actions of their government, and severely restricting freedom of the press. China&#x27;s censorship includes the complete blockage of various websites, apps, and video games, inspiring the policy&#x27;s nickname, the Great Firewall of China, which blocks websites. Methods used to block websites and pages include DNS spoofing, blocking access to IP addresses, analyzing and filtering URLs, packet inspection, and resetting connections.

The government blocks website content and monitors Internet access. As required by the government, major Internet platforms in China have established elaborate self-censorship mechanisms as well as implementing a real-name system. As of 2019, more than sixty online restrictions had been created by the Government of China and implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, companies and organizations. Some companies hire teams and invest in powerful artificial intelligence algorithms to police and remove illegal online content. Despite restrictions, all websites except TikTok can still be accessible to Chinese users by using VPNs, which are currently heavily restricted but not banned due to them often being used for business purposes.

Amnesty International states that China has &quot;the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world&quot; and Reporters Without Borders stated in 2010 and 2012 that &quot;China is the world&#x27;s biggest prison for netizens.&quot; Freedom House rated China &quot;Not Free&quot; in the Freedom on the Net 2023 report.

Commonly alleged user offenses include communicating with organized groups abroad, signing controversial online petitions, and forcibly calling for government reform. The government has escalated its efforts to reduce coverage and commentary that is critical of the regime after a series of large anti-pollution and anti-corruption protests. Many of these protests were organized or publicized using instant messaging services, chat rooms, and text messages. China&#x27;s Internet police force was reported by official state media to be 2 million strong in 2013.

Since 2022, several Chinese social platforms announced that they would display user locations based on internet protocol (IP) addresses. These platforms include Quora-like Zhihu, the domestic version of TikTok, Douyin, and video streaming platform Bilibili. The platforms display the province for users located in China or the country or region if the IP address of the user is located overseas. Users cannot disable this feature.

China&#x27;s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall. However, it was reported that the central government authorities have been closely monitoring Internet use in these regions (see Internet censorship in Hong Kong).
==Background==

The political and ideological background of Internet censorship is considered to be one of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s favorite sayings in the early 1980s: &quot;If you open a window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.&quot; The saying is related to a period of the Chinese economic reform that became known as the socialist market economy. Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy, opening it up to foreign investors. Nonetheless, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wished to protect its values and political ideas by &quot;swatting flies&quot; of other ideologies, with a particular emphasis on suppressing movements that could potentially threaten the stability of the country.

The Internet first arrived in the country in 1994. Since its arrival and the gradual rise of availability, the Internet has become a common communication platform and an important tool for sharing information. Just as the Chinese government had expected, the number of Internet users in China soared from less than one percent in 1994, when the Internet was introduced, to 28.8 percent by 2009.

In 1998, the CCP feared the China Democracy Party (CDP), organized in contravention of the Four Cardinal Principles, would breed a powerful new network that CCP party elites might not be able to control resulting in the CDP being immediately banned. That same year, the Golden Shield project was created. The first part of the project lasted eight years and was completed in 2006. The second part began in 2006 and ended in 2008. The Golden Shield project was a database project in which the government could access the records of each citizen and connect China&#x27;s security organizations. The government had the power to delete any comments online that were considered harmful.

On 6 December 2002, 300 members in charge of the Golden Shield project came from 31 provinces and cities across China to participate in a four-day inaugural &quot;Comprehensive Exhibition on Chinese Information System&quot;. At the exhibition, many Western technology products including Internet security, video monitoring, and facial recognition systems were purchased. According to Amnesty International, around 30,000–50,000 Internet police have been employed by the Chinese government to enforce Internet laws.

The Chinese government has described censorship as the method to prevent and eliminate &quot;risks in the ideological field from the Internet&quot;.

==Legislative basis==

The government of China defends its right to censor the Internet by claiming that this right extends from the country&#x27;s own rules inside its borders. A white paper released in June 2010 reaffirmed the government&#x27;s determination to govern the Internet within its borders under the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty. The document states, &quot;Laws and regulations prohibit the spread of information that contains content subverting state power, undermining national unity [or] infringing upon national honor and interests.&quot; It adds that foreign individuals and firms can use the Internet in China, but they must abide by the country&#x27;s laws.

The Central Government of China started its Internet censorship with three regulations. The first regulation was called the Temporary Regulation for the Management of Computer Information Network International Connection. The regulation was passed in the 42nd Standing Convention of the State Council on 23 January 1996. It was formally announced on 1 February 1996, and updated again on 20 May 1997. The content of the first regulation stated that Internet service providers be licensed and that Internet traffic goes through ChinaNet, GBNet, CERNET or CSTNET. The second regulation was the Ordinance for Security Protection of Computer Information Systems. It was issued on 18 February 1994 by the State Council to give the responsibility of Internet security protection to the Ministry of Public Security.

===Article 5 of the Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection, and Management Regulations===
The Ordinance regulation further led to the Security Management Procedures in Internet Accessing issued by the Ministry of Public Security in December 1997. The regulation defined &quot;harmful information&quot; and &quot;harmful activities&quot; regarding Internet usage. Section Five of the Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection, and Management Regulations approved by the State Council on 11 December 1997 stated the following:

(The &quot;units&quot; stated above refer to work units () or more broadly, workplaces). As of 2021, the regulations are still active and govern the activities of Internet users online.

=== Interim Regulations of the PRC on the Management of International Networking of Computer Information ===
In 1996, the Ministry of Commerce created a set of regulations which prohibit connection to &quot;international networks&quot; or use of channels outside of those provided by official government service providers without prior approval or license from authorities. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has since been superseded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology or MIIT. To this date this regulation is still used to prosecute and fine users who connect to international networks or use VPNs.
===State Council Order No. 292===
In September 2000, State Council Order No. 292 created the first set of content restrictions for Internet content providers. China-based websites cannot link to overseas news websites or distribute news from overseas media without separate approval. Only &quot;licensed print publishers&quot; have the authority to deliver news online. These sites must obtain approval from state information offices and the State Council Information Agency. Non-licensed websites that wish to broadcast news may only publish information already released publicly by other news media. Article 11 of this order mentions that &quot;content providers are responsible for ensuring the legality of any information disseminated through their services.&quot; Article 14 gives Government officials full access to any kind of sensitive information they wish from providers of Internet services.

=== Cybersecurity Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

On 6 November 2017, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress promulgated a cybersecurity law which among other things requires &quot;network operators&quot; to store data locally, hand over information when requested by state security organs and open software and hardware used by &quot;critical information infrastructure&quot; operators to be subject to national security review, potentially compromising source codes and security of encryption used by communications service providers. The law is an amalgamation of all previous regulations related to Internet use and online censorship and unifies and institutionalises the legislative framework governing cyber control and content censorship within the country. Article 12 states that persons using networks shall not &quot;overturn the socialist system, incite separatism&quot; or &quot;break national unity&quot; further institutionalising the suppression of dissent online. 
=== Data Security Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

On 10 June 2021, the Data Security Law was promulgated and took effect on 1 September 2021. The law builds on the Cybersecurity Law and significantly extends China&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction of its current data regulations over new categories of data.  It establishes new rules for businesses interacting with Chinese citizens, both inside and beyond China&#x27;s borders, to follow.
==Enforcement==
In December 1997, the Ministry of Public Security released new regulations that levied fines for &quot;defaming government agencies, splitting the nation, and leaking state secrets.&quot; Violators could face a fine of up to CNY 15,000 (roughly US$1,800). Banning appeared to be mostly uncoordinated and ad hoc, with some websites allowed in one city, yet similar sites blocked in another. The blocks were often lifted for special occasions. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unblocked when reporters in a private interview with CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin specifically asked about the block and he replied that he would look into the matter. During the APEC summit in Shanghai during 2001, normally-blocked media sources such as CNN, NBC, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; became accessible. Since 2001, blocks on Western media sites have been further relaxed, and all three of the sites previously mentioned were accessible from mainland China. However, access to &quot;the New York Times&quot; was denied again in December 2008.

In the middle of 2005, China purchased over 200 routers from an American company, Cisco Systems, which enabled the Chinese government to use more advanced censor technology. In February 2006, Google, in exchange for equipment installation on Chinese soil, blocked websites which the Chinese government deemed illegal. Google reversed this policy in 2010, after they suspected that a Google employee passed information to the Chinese Government and inserted backdoors into their software.

In May 2011, the State Council Information Office announced the transfer of its offices which regulated the Internet to a new subordinate agency, the State Internet Information Office which would be responsible for regulating the Internet in China. The relationship of the new agency to other Internet regulation agencies in China was unclear from the announcement.

On 26 August 2014, the State Internet Information Office (SIIO) was formally authorized by the state council to regulate and supervise all Internet content. It later launched a website called the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs. In February 2014, the Central Internet Security and Informatization and the Deep State Leading Group was created in order to oversee cybersecurity and receive information from the CAC. Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, committed to &quot;fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens&#x27; privacy.&quot; The Conference comes on the eve of the First Digital China Summit, which was held at the Fuzhou Strait International Conference and Exhibition Centre in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province.

On 4 January 2019, the CAC started a project to take down pornography, violence, bloody content, horror, gambling, defrauding, Internet rumors, superstition, invectives, parody, threats, and proliferation of &quot;bad lifestyles&quot; and &quot;bad popular culture&quot;. On 10 January 2019, China Network Audiovisual Program Service Association announced a new regulation to censor short videos with controversial political or social content such as a &quot;pessimistic outlook of millennials&quot;, &quot;one night stands&quot;, &quot;non-mainstream views of love and marriage&quot; as well as previously prohibited content deemed politically sensitive.

China is planning to make deepfakes illegal which is described as the way to prevent &quot;parody and pornography.&quot;

In July 2019, the CAC announced a regulation that said that Internet information providers and users in China who seriously violate related laws and regulations will be subject to Social Credit System blocklist. It also announces that Internet information providers and users who are not meeting the standard but mildly violation will be recorded in the List to Focus.

On 1 August 2022, the were issued by the China Internet Information Office came into effect, which requires Internet accounts to fill in their real occupations, and user IP location will be displayed, while registration of some accounts in professional fields is even required to provide verification materials.

During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, the CAC directed companies such as Tencent and ByteDance to intensify their censorship efforts.

After 15 December 2022, the Regulations on the Administration of Internet Followers&#x27; Commenting Services came into force, which for the first time considered &quot;likes&quot; as a type of comment. In addition, the regulations state that public accounts must take the initiative to review the comments left by netizens. Some experts have pointed out that this means that netizens may be punished by the platform or the authorities for the content of their likes.

===Self-regulation===
Internet censorship in China has been called &quot;a panopticon that encourages self-censorship through the perception that users are being watched.&quot; On 16 March 2002, the Internet Society of China, a self-governing Chinese Internet industry body, launched the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, an agreement between the Chinese Internet industry regulator and companies that operate sites in China. In signing the agreement, web companies pledge to identify and prevent the transmission of information that Chinese authorities deem objectionable, including information that &quot;breaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity&quot;, or that &quot;may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability&quot;. As of 2006, the pledge had been signed by more than 3,000 entities operating websites in China.

Internet platforms like Sina and QQ are not authorized to broadcast news or conduct interviews. In practice, such platforms do so with self-constraint, avoiding publicizing news which could run counter to the government.

===Use of service providers===
Although the government does not have the physical resources to monitor all Internet chat rooms and forums, the threat of being shut down has caused Internet content providers to employ internal staff, colloquially known as &quot;big mamas&quot;, who stop and remove forum comments which may be politically sensitive. In Shenzhen, these duties are partly taken over by a pair of police-created cartoon characters, Jingjing and Chacha, who help extend the online &quot;police presence&quot; of the Shenzhen authorities. These cartoons spread across the nation in 2007 reminding Internet users that they are being watched and should avoid posting &quot;sensitive&quot; or &quot;harmful&quot; material on the Internet.

However, Internet content providers have adopted some counter-strategies. One is to post politically sensitive stories and remove them only when the government complains. In the hours or days in which the story is available online, people read it, and by the time the story is taken down, the information is already public. One notable case in which this occurred was in response to a school explosion in 2001, when local officials tried to suppress the fact the explosion resulted from children illegally producing fireworks.

On 11 July 2003, the Chinese government started granting licenses to businesses to open Internet cafe chains. Business analysts and foreign Internet operators regard the licenses as intended to clamp down on information deemed harmful to the Chinese government. In July 2007, the city of Xiamen announced it would ban anonymous online postings after text messages and online communications were used to rally protests against a proposed chemical plant in the city. Internet users will be required to provide proof of identity when posting messages on the more than 100,000 Web sites registered in Xiamen.
The Chinese government issued new rules on 28 December 2012, requiring Internet users to provide their real names to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities. The new regulations, issued by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings, but only if they first provide their real names to service providers, a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country&#x27;s Twitter-like microblogs. The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments, such as calls for a multiparty democracy or accusations of impropriety by local officials.

===Arrests===
Fines and short arrests are becoming an optional punishment to whoever spreads undesirable information through the different Internet formats, as this is seen as a risk to social stability.

In 2001, Wang Xiaoning and other Chinese activists were arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for using a Yahoo! email account to post anonymous writing to an Internet mailing list. On 23 July 2008, the family of Liu Shaokun was notified that he had been sentenced to one year re-education through labor for &quot;inciting a disturbance&quot;. As a teacher in Sichuan province, he had taken photographs of collapsed schools and posted these photos online. On 18 July 2008, Huang Qi was formally arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets. Huang had spoken with the foreign press and posted information on his website about the plight of parents who had lost children in collapsed schools. Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist, used his Yahoo! email account to send a message to a U.S.-based pro-democracy website. In his email, he summarized a government order directing media organizations in China to downplay the upcoming 15th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists. Police arrested him in November 2004, charging him with &quot;illegally providing state secrets to foreign entities&quot;. In April 2005, he was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment and two years&#x27; subsequent deprivation of his political rights.

In mid-2013 police across China arrested hundreds of people accused of spreading false rumors online. The arrest targeted microbloggers who accused CCP officials of corruption, venality, and sexual escapades. The crackdown was intended to disrupt online networks of like-minded people whose ideas could challenge the authority of the CCP. Some of China&#x27;s most popular microbloggers were arrested. In September 2013, China&#x27;s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander. The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption, but a slanderous message forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times could result in up to three years in prison.

In 2017, a Uyghur university student at Xinjiang University, Mehmut Memtimin, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for using a VPN.

According to the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders, China is the world&#x27;s biggest jailer of journalists, holding around 100 in detention. In February 2020, China arrested two of its citizens for taking it upon themselves to cover the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 10 May 2021 blogger Ruan Xiaohuan was arrested by the Shanghai police. He was convicted of &quot;inciting subversion of state power&quot; for his blog, &quot;ProgramThink&quot;, which was critical of the regime. His wife, Bei Zhenying, was apparently warned by authorities against discussing the case.

==Technical implementation==
===Current methods===
The Great Firewall has used numerous methods to block content, including IP dropping, DNS spoofing, deep packet inspection for finding plain text signatures within the handshake to throttle protocols, and more recently active probing.

===Golden shield project ===
The Golden Shield Project maintained and constructed by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China started in 1998, began processing in November 2003, and the first part of the project passed the national inspection on 16 November 2006 in Beijing. According to MPS, its purpose is to construct a communication network and computer information system for police to improve their capability and efficiency. By 2002, the preliminary work of the Golden Shield Project had cost &quot;US$800 million (equivalent to RMB 6,400 million or €640 million).&quot; Greg Walton, a freelance researcher, said that the aim of the Golden Shield is to establish a &quot;gigantic online database&quot; that would include &quot;speech and face recognition, closed-circuit television... [and] credit records&quot; as well as traditional Internet use records.

A notice issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on 19 May stated that, as of 1 July 2009, manufacturers must ship machines to be sold in mainland China with the Green Dam Youth Escort software. On 14 August 2009, Li Yizhong, minister of industry and information technology, announced that computer manufacturers and retailers were no longer obliged to ship the software with new computers for home or business use, but that schools, Internet cafes and other public use computers would still be required to run the software.

A senior official of the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information Office said the software&#x27;s only purpose was &quot;to filter pornography on the Internet&quot;. The general manager of Jinhui, which developed Green Dam, said: &quot;Our software is simply not capable of spying on Internet users, it is only a filter.&quot; Human rights advocates in China have criticized the software for being &quot;a thinly concealed attempt by the government to expand censorship&quot;. Online polls conducted on Sina, Netease, Tencent, Sohu, and &quot;Southern Metropolis Daily&quot; revealed over 70% rejection of the software by netizens. However, Xinhua commented that &quot;support [for Green Dam] largely stems from end users, opposing opinions primarily come from a minority of media outlets and businesses.&quot;

Political scientist Margaret Roberts contends that most Chinese censorship methods do not ban information outright but instead function &quot;as a tax on information, forcing users to pay money or spend more time if they want to access the censored material.&quot; 

==Targets of censorship==

===Targeted content===

According to a Harvard study, at least 18,000 websites were blocked from within mainland China in 2002, including 12 out of the Top 100 Global Websites. The Chinese-sponsored news agency, Xinhua, stated that censorship targets only &quot;superstitious, pornographic, violence-related, gambling, and other harmful information.&quot; This appears questionable, as the e-mail provider Gmail is blocked, and it cannot be said to fall into any of these categories. On the other hand, websites centered on the following political topics are often censored: Falun Gong, police brutality, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, freedom of speech, democracy, the Tibetan independence movement, and the Tuidang movement. According to a 2023 report by Human Rights Watch, content that criticizes racism in China will often be censored.

Testing performed by Freedom House in 2011 confirmed that material written by or about activist bloggers is removed from the Chinese Internet in a practice that has been termed &quot;cyber-disappearance&quot;.

A 2012 study of social media sites by other Harvard researchers found that 13% of Internet posts were blocked. The blocking focused mainly on any form of collective action (anything from false rumors driving riots to protest organizers to large parties for fun), pornography, and criticism of the censors. However, significant criticisms of the government were not blocked when made separately from calls for collective action. Another study has shown comments on social media that criticize the state, its leaders, and their policies are usually published, but posts with collective action potential will be more likely to be censored whether they are against the state or not.

A lot of larger Japanese websites were blocked from the afternoon of 15 June 2012 (UTC+08:00) to the morning of 17 June 2012 (UTC+08:00), such as Google Japan, Yahoo! Japan, Amazon Japan, Excite, Yomiuri News, Sponichi News and Nikkei BP Japan.

Chinese censors have been relatively reluctant to block websites where there might be significant economic consequences. For example, a block of GitHub was reversed after widespread complaints from the Chinese software developer community. In November 2013 after the Chinese services of Reuters and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; were blocked, GreatFire mirrored the Reuters website to an Amazon.com domain in such a way that it could not be shut down without shutting off domestic access to all of Amazon&#x27;s cloud storage service.

For one month beginning 17 November 2014, ProPublica tested whether the homepages of 18 international news organizations were accessible to browsers inside China, and found the most consistently blocked were &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;, &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Facebook, and Twitter. Internet censorship and surveillance has been tightly implemented in China that block social websites like Gmail, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others. The censorship practices of the Great Firewall of China have now impacted the VPN service providers as well. In November 2024, despite being previously blocked, OnlyFans became available in mainland China, according to GreatFire.

==== Artificial intelligence training data ====

In 2023, in-country access was blocked to Hugging Face, a company that maintains libraries containing training data sets commonly used for large language models.

===Search engines===

One part of the block is to filter the search results of certain terms on Chinese search engines such as Sogou, 360 Search and Baidu. Attempting to search for censored keywords in these Chinese search engines will yield few or no results.

In addition, a connection containing intensive censored terms may also be closed by The Great Firewall, and cannot be re-established for several minutes. This affects all network connections including HTTP and POP, but the reset is more likely to occur during searching. Before the search engines censored themselves, many search engines had been blocked.

===Discussion forums===

Several Bulletin Board Systems in universities were closed down or restricted public access since 2004, including the SMTH BBS and the YTHT BBS.

In September 2007, some data centers were shut down indiscriminately for providing interactive features such as blogs and forums. CBS reports an estimate that half the interactive sites hosted in China were blocked.

Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the government suppression of the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, the government ordered Internet portals, forums and discussion groups to shut down their servers for maintenance between 3 and 6 June 2009. The day before the mass shut-down, Chinese users of Twitter, Hotmail and Flickr, among others, reported a widespread inability to access these services.

===Social media===
The censorship of individual social media posts in China usually occurs in two circumstances:

1. Corporations/government hire censors to read individual social media posts and manually take down posts that violate policy. (Although the government and media often use the microblogging service Sina Weibo to spread ideas and monitor corruption, it is also supervised and self-censored by 700 Sina censors. )

2. Posts that will be primarily auto-blocked based on keyword filters, and decide which ones to publish later.

In the second half of 2009, the social networking sites Facebook and Twitter were blocked, presumably because of containing social or political commentary (similar to LiveJournal in the above list). An example is the commentary on the July 2009 Ürümqi riots. Another reason suggested for the block is that activists can utilize them to organize themselves.

In 2010, Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo became a forbidden topic in Chinese media due to his winning the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Keywords and images relating to the activist and his life were again blocked in July 2017, shortly after his death.

After the 2011 Wenzhou train collision, the government started emphasizing the danger in spreading &#x27;false rumours&#x27; (yaoyan), making the permissive usage of Weibo and social networks a public debate.

In 2012, &quot;First Monday&quot; published an article on &quot;political &quot;content&quot; censorship in social media, i.e., the active deletion of messages published by individuals.&quot; This academic study, which received extensive media coverage, accumulated a dataset of 56 million messages sent on Sina Weibo from June through September 2011, and statistically analyzed them three months later, finding 212,583 deletions out of 1.3 million sampled, more than 16 percent. The study revealed that censors quickly deleted words with politically controversial meanings (e.g., &quot;qingci&quot; 请辞 &quot;asking someone to resign&quot; referring to calls for Railway Minister Sheng Guangzu to resign after the Wenzhou train collision on 23 July 2011), and also that the rate of message deletion was regionally anomalous (compare censorship rates of 53% in Tibet and 52% in Qinghai with 12% in Beijing and 11.4% in Shanghai). In another study conducted by a research team led by political scientist Gary King, objectionable posts created by King&#x27;s team on a social networking site were almost universally removed within 24 hours of their posting.

The comment areas of popular posts which mentioned Vladimir Putin on Sina Weibo were shut down during the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit in Germany. It is a rare example that a foreign leader is granted the safety from a popular judgment on the Chinese Internet, which usually only granted to the Chinese leaders. This move by the Chinese Government may be related to their close ties with Russia and Putin himself.

However, a study by American researchers of 13.2 billion Weibo blog posts over the period 2009–2013 found that many sensitive topics were discussed, including on ethnic conflict, political scandals, and protests.

====WeChat====
WeChat is the dominant social media and messaging app in China, and is also the most popular messaging application for most Chinese nationals staying overseas. Though subject to state rules which saw individual posts removed, Tech in Asia reported in 2013 that certain &quot;restricted words&quot; had been blocked on WeChat globally. A crackdown in March 2014 deleted dozens of WeChat accounts, some of which were independent news channels with hundreds of thousands of followers. CNN reported that the blocks were related to laws banning the spread of political &quot;rumors&quot;.

The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported in July 2020 that the CAC would conduct an intensive three-month investigation and cleanup of 13 media platforms, including WeChat.

===SSL protocols ===
In March 2020, China suddenly started blocking websites using the TLS (Transport Layer Security 1.3) and ESNI (Encrypted Server Name Indicator) for SSL certificates, since ESNI makes it difficult if not impossible to identify the name of a website based on the server name displayed in its SSL certificate. Since May 2015, Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China. This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult (see also Wikimedia blockade in mainland China).

=== VPN protocols ===
In 2017, Apple started removing all VPN apps from Apple app stores at the behest of the Chinese government.

Beginning in 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in conjunction with the Cyberspace Administration Commission (CAC) began a sweeping crackdown on all VPN providers, ordering all major state owned telecommunications providers including China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom to block VPN protocols with only authorized users who have obtained permits beforehand to access VPNs (provided they are operated by state-owned telecommunications companies). Increased government crackdowns on VPNs have reduced their overall speeds, according to GreatFire.

Although China restricts VPNs, they remain widely used by private individuals. State-owned enterprises or state institutions also use VPNs for official work. The Chinese government has authorized several official licensed VPN providers who comply with Chinese censorship and backdoor access laws. Those who develop or sell their own VPNs potentially face years in prison.

==Specific examples of Internet censorship==

===Tiananmen Square protests and massacre===
The Chinese government censors Internet materials related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. According to the government&#x27;s white paper in 2010 on the subject of Internet in China, the government protects &quot;the safe flow of internet information and actively guides people to manage websites under the law and use the internet in a wholesome and correct way&quot;. The government, therefore, prevents people on the Internet from &quot;divulging state secrets, subverting state power and jeopardizing national unification; damaging state honor&quot; and &quot;disrupting social order and stability.&quot; Law-abiding Chinese websites such as Sina Weibo censors words related to the protests in its search engine. Sina Weibo is one of the largest Chinese microblogging services. As of October 2012, Weibo&#x27;s censored words include &quot;Tank Man.&quot; The government also censors words that have similar pronunciation or meaning to &quot;4 June&quot;, the date that the government&#x27;s violent crackdown occurred. &quot;陆肆&quot;, for example, is an alternative to &quot;六四&quot; (4 June). The government forbids remembrances of the protests. Sina Weibo&#x27;s search engine, for example, censors Hong Kong lyricist Thomas Chow&#x27;s song called 自由花 or &quot;The Flower of Freedom&quot;, since attendees of the Vindicate 4 June and Relay the Torch rally at Hong Kong&#x27;s Victoria Park sing this song every year to commemorate the victims of the events.

The government&#x27;s Internet censorship of such topics was especially strict during the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, which occurred in 2009. According to a Reporters Without Borders&#x27; article, searching photos related to the protest such as &quot;4 June&quot; on Baidu, the most popular Chinese search engine, would return blank results and a message stating that the &quot;search does not comply with laws, regulations, and policies&quot;. Moreover, a large number of netizens from China claimed that they were unable to access numerous Western web services such as Twitter, Hotmail, and Flickr in the days leading up to and during the anniversary. Netizens in China claimed that many Chinese web services were temporarily blocked days before and during the anniversary. Netizens also reported that microblogging services including Fanfou and Xiaonei (now known as Renren) were down with similar messages that claim that their services were &quot;under maintenance&quot; for a few days around the anniversary date.

In 2019, censors once again doubled down during the 30th anniversary of the protests, and by this time had been &quot;largely automated&quot; with AI rejecting protest-related posts. In May and June 2023, authorities censored Tiananmen protest-related posts and restricted communications of Tiananmen victims&#x27; families. In March 2024, censors removed social media posts containing photos of medals awarded to PLA soldiers who participated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

====Reactions of netizens in China====
In 2009, the Guardian wrote that Chinese netizens responded with subtle protests against the government&#x27;s temporary blockages of large web services. For instance, Chinese websites made subtle grievances against the state&#x27;s censorship by sarcastically calling the date 4 June as the &quot;Chinese Internet Maintenance Day&quot;. Owner of the blog Wuqing.org stated, &quot;I, too, am under maintenance&quot;. The dictionary website Wordku.com voluntarily took its site down with the claim that this was because of the &quot;Chinese Internet Maintenance Day&quot;. In 2013, Chinese netizens used subtle and sarcastic Internet memes to criticize the government and to bypass censorship by creating and posting humorous pictures or drawings resembling the Tank Man photo on Weibo. One of these pictures, for example, showed Florentijin Hofman&#x27;s rubber ducks sculptures replacing tanks in the Tank Man photo. On Twitter, Hu Jia, a Beijing-based AIDS activist, asked netizens in mainland China to wear black T-shirts on 4 June to oppose censorship and to commemorate the date. Chinese web services such as Weibo eventually censored searches of both &quot;black shirt&quot; and &quot;Big Yellow Duck&quot; in 2013.

As a result, the government further promoted anti-western sentiment. In 2014, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping praised blogger Zhou Xiaoping for his &quot;positive energy&quot; after the latter argued in an essay titled &quot;Nine Knockout Blows in America&#x27;s Cold War Against China&quot;, that American culture was &quot;eroding the moral foundation and self-confidence of the Chinese people.&quot;

====Debates about the significance of Internet resistance to censorship====
According to Chinese studies expert Johan Lagerkvist, scholars Pierre Bourdieu and Michel de Certeau argue that this culture of satire is a weapon of resistance against authority. This is because criticism against authority often results in satirical parodies that &quot;presupposes and confirms emancipation&quot; of the supposedly oppressed people. Academic writer Linda Hutcheon argues that some people, however, may view satirical language that is used to criticise the government as &quot;complicity&quot;, which can &quot;reinforce rather than subvert conservative attitudes&quot;. Chinese experts Perry Link and Xiao Qiang, however, oppose this argument. They claim that when sarcastic terms develop into common vocabulary of netizens, these terms would lose their sarcastic characteristic. They then become normal terms that carry significant political meanings that oppose the government. Xiao believes that the netizens&#x27; freedom to spread information on the Internet has forced the government to listen to popular demands of netizens. For example, the Ministry of Information Technology&#x27;s plan to preinstall mandatory censoring software called Green Dam Youth Escort on computers failed after popular online opposition against it in 2009, the year of the 20th anniversary of the protest.
Lagerkvist states that the Chinese government, however, does not see subtle criticisms on the Internet as real threats that carry significant political meanings and topple the government. He argues that real threats occur only when &quot;laugh mobs&quot; become &quot;organised smart mobs&quot; that directly challenge the government&#x27;s power. At a TED conference, Michael Anti gives a similar reason for the government&#x27;s lack of enforcement against these Internet memes. Anti suggests that the government sometimes allows limited windows of freedom of speech such as Internet memes. Anti explains that this is to guide and generate public opinions that favor the government and to criticize enemies of the party officials.

====Internet censorship of the protest in 2013====
The Chinese government has become more efficient in its Internet regulations since the 20th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On 3 June 2013, Sina Weibo quietly suspended usage of the candle icon from the comment input tool, which netizens used to mourn the dead on forums. Some searches related to the protest on Chinese website services no longer come up with blank results, but with results that the government had &quot;carefully selected.&quot; These subtle methods of government censorship may cause netizens to believe that their searched materials were not censored.

===Usage of Internet kill switch===
China completely shut down Internet service in the autonomous region of Xinjiang from July 2009 to May 2010 for up to 312 days after the July 2009 Ürümqi riots.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

Reporters without Borders has accused that China&#x27;s policies prevented an earlier warning about the COVID-19 pandemic. At least one doctor suspected as early as 25 December 2019 that an outbreak was occurring, but arguably may have been deterred from informing the media due to harsh punishment for whistleblowers.

During the pandemic, academic research concerning the origins of the virus was censored. An investigation by ProPublica and &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that the Cyberspace Administration of China placed censorship restrictions on Chinese media outlets and social media to avoid mentions of the COVID-19 outbreak, mentions of Li Wenliang, and &quot;activated legions of fake online commenters to flood social sites with distracting chatter&quot;.

In late 2022, demonstrations erupted across China against the Zero-COVID measures and various other issues. The catalyst for these protests was a fire in an Ürümqi apartment, which claimed 10 lives in November, during a persistent COVID-19 lockdown. In response, authorities acted to eliminate digital discussions regarding the protests. This included deleting posts, imposing limits on search capabilities, and erasing calls for the freeing of detained demonstrators. The Cyberspace Administration of China mandated that digital platforms increase their content moderation teams to erase any mentions of tools that might allow users to bypass censorship, aiming to cut off any pathways to openly discussing the protests through unfiltered internet channels. Following these events, the government lifted restrictions associated with COVID-19, leading to a surge in infection rates and fatalities. Sina Weibo, a major social media platform, blocked search results related to the “pandemic in Beijing” and prevented live conversations about the consequences of lifting lockdown measures. In January 2023, the authorities initiated a digital clampdown to eliminate &quot;gloomy sentiments&quot; fueled by what they termed as false information concerning the pandemic, and any digital content mentioning infection rates or fatalities was promptly deleted.

===Winnie the Pooh===
Since 2013, the Disney character Winnie the Pooh is systematically removed on the Chinese Internet following the spread of an Internet meme in which photographs of Xi and other individuals were compared to the bear and other characters from the works of A. A. Milne as re-imagined by Disney. The first heavily censored viral meme can be traced back to the official visit to the United States in 2013 during which Xi was photographed by a Reuters photographer walking with then-U.S. president Barack Obama in Sunnylands, California. A blog post where the photograph was juxtaposed with the cartoon depiction went viral, but Chinese censors rapidly deleted it. A year later came a meme featuring Xi and Shinzo Abe. When Xi Jinping inspected troops through his limousine&#x27;s sunroof, a popular meme was created with Winnie the Pooh in a toy car. The widely circulated image became the most censored picture of the year in 2015. In addition to not wanting any kind of online euphemism for the CCP&#x27;s general secretary, the Chinese government considers that the caricature undermines the authority of the party general secretarial office as well as the paramount leader himself, and all works comparing Xi with Winnie the Pooh are purportedly banned in China.

===Other examples===
In 2006, the government censored what it viewed as excessive anti-Japanese sentiment online related to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute. Following the 2010 boat collision in the disputed islands, the Chinese government censored related keywords online and shut down internet chatrooms addressing the issues in an effort to decrease bilateral tension between the two countries.

In February 2018, Xi Jinping appeared to set in motion a process to scrap term limits, allowing himself to become ruler for life. To suppress criticism, censors banned phrases such as &quot;Disagree&quot; (不同意), &quot;Shameless&quot; (不要脸), &quot;Lifelong&quot; (终身), &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, and at one point briefly censored the letter &#x27;N&#x27;. Li Datong, a former state newspaper editor, wrote a critical letter that was censored; some social media users evaded the censorship by posting an upside-down screenshot of the letter.
On 13 March 2018, China&#x27;s CCTV incidentally showed Yicai&#x27;s Liang Xiangyi apparently rolling her eyes in disgust at a long-winded and canned media question during the widely watched National People&#x27;s Congress. In the aftermath, Liang&#x27;s name became the most-censored search term on Weibo. The government also blocked the search query &quot;journalist in blue&quot; and attempted to censor popular memes inspired by the eye-roll.

On 21 June 2018, British-born comedian John Oliver criticized China&#x27;s paramount leader Xi Jinping on his U.S. show &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; over Xi Jinping&#x27;s apparent descent into authoritarianism (including his sidelining of dissent, human rights abuses against Uyghur peoples, and clampdowns on Chinese Internet censorship), as well as the Belt and Road Initiative. As a result, the English language name of John Oliver (although not the Chinese version) was censored on Sina Weibo and other sites on the Chinese Internet.

The American television show South Park was banned from China in 2019 and any mention of it was removed from almost all sites on the Chinese Internet, after criticizing China&#x27;s government and censorship in season 23 episode, &quot;Band in China&quot;. Series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone later issued a mock apology.

On 20 April 2020, Scratch was completely banned in China because of recognition of Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries.

In October 2022, in the run-up to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, photographs and videos of the Beijing Sitong Bridge protest were censored.

In January 2024, past articles concerning China&#x27;s economic development from the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; were censored.

Discussion of doping cases involving Chinese athletes in international sports is widely censored.

==International influence==

Foreign content providers such as Yahoo!, AOL, and Skype must abide by Chinese government wishes, including having internal content monitors, to be able to operate within mainland China. Also, per mainland Chinese laws, Microsoft began to censor the content of its blog service Windows Live Spaces, arguing that continuing to provide Internet services is more beneficial to the Chinese. Chinese journalist Michael Anti&#x27;s blog on Windows Live Spaces was censored by Microsoft. In an April 2006 e-mail panel discussion Rebecca MacKinnon, who reported from China for nine years as a Beijing bureau chief for CNN, said: &quot;... many bloggers said he [Anti] was a necessary sacrifice so that the majority of Chinese can continue to have an online space to express themselves as they choose. So the point is, compromises are being made at every level of society because nobody expects political freedom anyway.&quot;

The Chinese version of Myspace, launched in April 2007, has many censorship-related differences from other international versions of the service. Discussion forums on topics such as religion and politics are absent and a filtering system that prevents the posting of content about politically sensitive topics has been added. Users are also given the ability to report the &quot;misconduct&quot; of other users for offenses including &quot;endangering national security, leaking state secrets, subverting the government, undermining national unity, spreading rumors or disturbing the social order.&quot;

Some media have suggested that China&#x27;s Internet censorship of foreign websites may also be a means of forcing mainland Chinese users to rely on China&#x27;s e-commerce industry, thus self-insulating their economy from the dominance of international corporations. On 7 November 2005 an alliance of investors and researchers representing 26 companies in the U.S., Europe and Australia with over US$21 billion in joint assets announced that they were urging businesses to protect freedom of expression and pledged to monitor technology companies that do business in countries violating human rights, such as China. On 21 December 2005 the UN, OSCE and OAS special mandates on freedom of expression called on Internet corporations to &quot;work together ... to resist official attempts to control or restrict the use of the Internet.&quot; Google finally responded when attacked by hackers rumored to be hired by the Chinese government by threatening to pull out of China.

In 2006, Reporters Without Borders wrote that it suspects that regimes such as Cuba, Zimbabwe, and Belarus have obtained surveillance technology from China.

=== Chinese social media platforms ===
With the proliferation of Chinese social media platforms such as TikTok, WeChat, QQ, Weibo and Xiaohongshu (RED) abroad, concerns have been raised about data harvesting by Chinese technology firms since such companies are registered in China and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of Chinese law, requiring access to data without warrant when requested by Chinese intelligence and public security authorities. Concern has also grown about the spread of Chinese language disinformation and propaganda on platforms targeted at overseas Chinese diaspora communities and the potential to sow discord and unrest towards host nation states and societies in addition to the exporting of Chinese censorship practices abroad, preventing the exercise of free speech by Chinese communities even when physically outside China.

==Evasion==
===Using a VPN service===
Internet censorship in China is circumvented by determined parties by using proxy servers outside the firewall. Users may circumvent all of the censorship and monitoring of the Great Firewall if they have a working VPN or SSH connection method to a computer outside mainland China. However, disruptions of VPN services have been reported and the free or popular services especially are increasingly being blocked. During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, the Chinese government intensified crackdowns on VPNs. To avoid deep packet inspection and continue providing services in China some VPN providers implemented server obfuscation.

In 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China proposed new rules that would punish individuals and institutions for helping internet users bypass the &#x27;Great Firewall&#x27;, further attempting to restrict VPN usage. However, such article did not appear on the final version of the law published in September 2024.

===Changing IP addresses===
Blogs hosted on services such as Blogger and Wordpress.com are frequently blocked. In response, some China-focused services explicitly offer to change a blog&#x27;s IP address within 30 minutes if it is blocked by the authorities.

===Using a mirror website===
In 2002, Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google. This has since been blocked.

===Modifying the network stack===
In July 2006, researchers at Cambridge University claimed to have defeated the firewall by ignoring the TCP reset packets.

===Using Tor and DPI-resistant tools===
Although many users use VPNs to circumvent the Great Firewall of China, many Internet connections are now subject to deep packet inspection, in which data packets are looked at in detail. Many VPNs have been blocked using this method. Blogger Grey One suggests users trying to disguise VPN usage forward their VPN traffic through port 443 because this port is also heavily used by web browsers for HTTPS connections. However, Grey points out this method is futile against advanced inspection. Obfsproxy and other pluggable transports do allow users to evade deep-packet inspection.

The Tor anonymity network was and is subject to partial blocking by China&#x27;s Great Firewall. The Tor website is blocked when accessed over HTTP but it is reachable over HTTPS so it is possible for users to download the Tor Browser Bundle. The Tor project also maintains a list of website mirrors in case the main Tor website is blocked.

The Tor network maintains a public list of approximately 3000 entry relays; almost all of them are blocked. In addition to the public relays, Tor maintains bridges which are non-public relays. Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network. The Great Firewall scrapes nearly all the bridge IPs distributed through bridges.torproject.org and email. According to Winter&#x27;s research paper published in April 2012, this blocking technique can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges. Tor Obfs4 bridges still work in China as long as the IPs are discovered through social networks or self-published bridges.

Tor now primarily functions in China using Snowflake and meeks which works via front-end proxies hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to obfuscate the information coming to and from the source and destination, it is a type of pluggable transport. Examples are Microsoft&#x27;s Azure and Cloudflare.

===Unintended methods===
It was common in the past to use Google&#x27;s cache feature to view blocked websites. However, this feature of Google seems to be under some level of blocking, as access is now erratic and does not work for blocked websites. Currently, the block is mostly circumvented by using proxy servers outside the firewall and is not difficult to carry out for those determined to do so.

The mobile Opera Mini browser uses a proxy-based approach employing encryption and compression to speed up downloads. This has the side effect of allowing it to circumvent several approaches to Internet censorship. In 2009 this led the government of China to ban all but a special Chinese version of the browser.

===Using an analogy to bypass keyword filters===
As the Great Firewall of China gets more sophisticated, users are getting increasingly creative in the ways they elude the censorship, such as by using analogies to discuss topics. Furthermore, users are becoming increasingly open in their mockery of them by actively using homophones to avoid censorship. Deleted sites have &quot;been harmonized&quot;, indicating CCP general secretary Hu Jintao&#x27;s Internet censorship lies under the larger idea of creating a &quot;Socialist Harmonious Society&quot;. For example, censors are referred to as &quot;river crabs&quot; (河蟹), because in Chinese that phrase forms a homophone for &quot;harmony&quot; (和谐).

===Using steganography===
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; editor Charles Arthur, Internet users in China have found more technical ways to get around the Great Firewall of China, including using steganography, a practice of &quot;embedding useful data in what looks like something irrelevant. The text of a document can be broken into its constituent bytes, which are added to the pixels of an innocent picture. The effect is barely visible on the picture, but the recipient can extract it with the right software&quot;.

===Voices===
Rupert Murdoch famously proclaimed that advances in communications technology posed an &quot;unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere&quot; and Ai Weiwei argued that the Chinese &quot;leaders must understand it&#x27;s not possible for them to control the Internet unless they shut it off&quot;.

However, Nathan Freitas, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard and technical adviser to the Tibet Action Institute, says &quot;There&#x27;s a growing sense within China that widely used VPN services that were once considered untouchable are now being touched.&quot; In June 2015 Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault in Silicon Valley, reported that hackers, possibly with the assistance of the Chinese government, had found ways to circumvent the most popular privacy tools on the Internet: virtual private networks, or VPNs, and Tor. This is done with the aid of a particularly serious vulnerability, known as JSONP, that 15 web services in China never patched. As long as the users are logged into one of China&#x27;s top web services such as Baidu, QQ, Taobao, Sina, Sohu, and Ctrip the hackers can identify them and access their personal information, even if they are using Tor or a VPN. The vulnerability is not new; it was published in a Chinese security and web forum around 2013.

=== Specific examples of evasion as Internet activism ===
The rapid increase of access to Internet in China has also created new opportunities for Internet activism. For example, in terms of journalism, Marina Svensson&#x27;s article on &quot;Media and Civil Society in China: Community building and networking among investigative journalists and beyond&quot; illustrates that although Chinese journalists are not able to create their own private companies, they are using informal connections online and offline that allows them to create a community that may allow them to go around state repression. Specifically, with the development of microblogging, an increase in new community that are formed underlines a possibility of &quot;...more open expressions of solidarity and ironic resistance&quot;. However, one shortcoming with Internet activism is digital inequality.

In 2016, the number of Internet users reached 731 million, which was about a rate of 53% for Internet penetration. According to the Information and Communications Technologies Development Index (IDI), China exhibits high inequality in terms of regional and wealth differences.

A 2022 study analysed memes of Kim Jong-un by Chinese social media users. Results has shown how publics can express political opinions, even in a high censorship environment.

==Economic impact==
According to the BBC, local Chinese businesses such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, some of the world&#x27;s largest Internet enterprises, benefited from the way China has blocked international rivals from the market, encouraging domestic competition.

According to &quot;Financial Times&quot;, China&#x27;s crackdown on VPN portals has brought business to state-approved telecom companies. &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that China&#x27;s state newspaper has expanded its online censoring business. The company&#x27;s net income in 2018 has risen 140 percent. Its Shanghai-listed stock price jumped up by 166 percent in 2018.

<text>Warpstone was an independent magazine that covered the topic of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. The magazine was in circulation from 1996 to 2014.

The name was derived from warpstone, a fictional mutagen in the &quot;Warhammer&quot; fictional universe and also in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe during the first and second editions. &quot;Warhammer&quot; materials described warpstone as solidified dark magic with transmutatory and alchemical powers.

==History==
&quot;Warpstone&quot; was an unofficial &quot;Warhammer&quot; magazine. Launched in 1996 by John Foody and John Keane, it featured reviews of official products, interviews, comment pieces, and fan-written material. Some &quot;Warpstone&quot; articles have been collected into the book &quot;Corrupting Influence - The Best of Warpstone: Volume 1&quot; published by Hogshead Publishing.

From April 1999 until their closure at the end of 2002, Hogshead Publishing assumed control over distribution of &quot;Warpstone&quot;, which made it possible for them to publish material that they were unable to use in official &quot;Warhammer&quot; publications.

Around the publication of Issue 28, the decision had been made to end the magazine&#x27;s run with Issue 30. This happened to coincide with a Cease &amp; Desist letter from GW, which delayed further publication while this was resolved.

The final issue 30 was eventually released in November 2014, as a bumper farewell edition.

<doc id="154465" wikidata="Q4122" url="?curid=154465" title="Wolfenbüttel">
<text>Wolfenbüttel (; ) is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany, the administrative capital of Wolfenbüttel District. It is best known as the location of the internationally renowned Herzog August Library and for having the largest concentration of timber-framed buildings in Germany, around 1,000. It is an episcopal see of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick. It is also home to the Jägermeister distillery, houses a campus of the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, and the Landesmusikakademie of Lower Saxony.

==Geography==
The town center is located at an elevation of on the Oker river near the confluence with its Altenau tributary, about south of Brunswick and southeast of the state capital Hannover. Wolfenbüttel is situated about half-way between the Harz mountain range in the south and the Lüneburg Heath in the north. The Elm-Lappwald Nature Park and the Asse hill range stretch east and southeast of the town.

With a population of about 52,000 people, Wolfenbüttel is part of the Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region and Braunschweig&#x27;s urban agglomeration. It is the southernmost of the 172 towns in Northern Germany whose names end in &quot;büttel&quot;, meaning &quot;residence&quot; or &quot;settlement.&quot;

==Mayor==
Between 2006 and 2014, the mayor of Wolfenbüttel was Thomas Pink, who was reelected in 2014 with 67.7% of the vote. In August 2018 he left the German Christian Democratic Union party.

In September 2021, Ivica Lukanic (Independent) became Wolfenbüttel&#x27;s first politically independent mayor, beating Dennis Berger (SPD) in a run-off with 55.7% of the vote.

==History==
A first settlement, probably restricted to a tiny islet in the Oker river, was founded in the tenth century. It was mentioned in 1118 as &quot;Wulferisbuttle&quot;, when the Saxon count Widekind of Wolfenbüttel erected a water castle on the important trade route from Brunswick to Halberstadt and Leipzig. Destroyed by Henry the Lion in 1191, and again by his great-grandson Duke Albert I of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1255, the fortress and town, as well as nearby Asseburg Castle, were seized in 1258 by Albert I from the House of Asseburg, the descendants of Widekind. The castle was rebuilt by the Welf duke Henry I of Brunswick from 1283 onwards.

By 1432, the town became the permanent residence of the Brunswick Princes of Wolfenbüttel. Devastated in the 1542 Schmalkaldic War, it was largely rebuilt in a Renaissance style under Duke Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg, including several &quot;gracht&quot; waterways laid out by Hans Vredeman de Vries. The duke vested the citizens with market rights in 1570 and founded the Ducal Library (&quot;Herzogliche Bibliothek&quot;, the later &quot;Bibliotheca Augusta&quot;) two years later.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Danish troops under King Christian IV occupied the fortified town in 1626. Upon the nearby Battle of Lutter, they were besieged by the Imperial forces of General Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim. Re-conquered in 1627, the Wolfenbüttel fortress remained under the command of Gottfried Huyn von Geleen. In June 1641 the Battle of Wolfenbüttel was fought here, when the Swedish forces under Wrangel and the Count of Königsmark defeated the Austrians under Archduke Leopold of Habsburg, however, they failed to occupy the town.

Over two centuries, especially under Duke Julius&#x27; successors Henry Julius and Augustus the Younger, Wolfenbüttel grew to be a center of the arts and science: Already in 1604, the composer Michael Praetorius (1571–1621) served as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the Brunswick dukes. From 1682, the composer Johann Rosenmüller (1619–1684), who had to flee Germany due to allegations of homosexuality, spent his last years in Wolfenbüttel. Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729–1781) directed the Ducal Library, and established one of the first lending libraries in Enlightenment Europe. However, the ducal court eventually returned to Brunswick in 1753 and Wolfenbüttel subsequently lost in importance.

During World War II, the city prison became a major execution site of prisoners of the Gestapo. Most of those executed were members of various Resistance groups. Victims include Marguerite Bervoets and Fernande Volral, and a Dom Lambert, a monk of Ligugé Abbey in France, who was beheaded there on 3 December 1943.

===Immigration===
Roughly 14% of Wolfenbüttel are foreigners and 27.2% of the town has a migration background.

== Main sights ==
* The baroque castle &quot;Schloss Wolfenbüttel&quot;. In 1866, the castle became the Anna-Vorwerk-School for girls. Today part of the building is used as a high school; it also houses a great example of Baroque state apartments, which are open to the public as a museum.
* &quot;Herzog-August-Bibliothek&quot; (HAB), the ducal library, hosts one of the largest and best-known collections of ancient books in the world. It is especially rich in bibles, incunabula, and books of the Reformation period, with some 10,000 manuscripts. It was founded in 1572 and rehoused in an interpretation of the Pantheon in 1723, built facing the castle; the present library building was constructed in 1886. Leibniz and Lessing worked in this library as librarians. The &quot;Codex Carolinus&quot; in the library is one of the few remaining texts in Gothic. The library also houses the bible of Henry the Lion, a book preserved in near mint condition from the year 1170.
* &quot;Klein-Venedig&quot;. A pittoresque waterside building ensemble (Gracht) along the River Oker built in the eighteenth century.
* The churches Marienkirche (Hauptkiche Beatae Mariae Virginis), built during the seventeenth century, and St. Trinitatis (Trinity Church), built during the early eighteenth century.

The town is also the location of the former Northampton Barracks, which housed units of the British Army of the Rhine until 1993 (postcode: BFPO 101).

Today, Wolfenbüttel is smaller than the neighbouring cities of Braunschweig (Brunswick), Salzgitter, and Wolfsburg, but, because it was largely undamaged by the war, its downtown is rich in half-timber buildings, many dating several centuries back, and it still retains its historical character. Wolfenbüttel is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

==Culture==

Wolfenbüttel is home of several departments of the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences and the , an organisation for the study of Lessing&#x27;s works. It is also home to the &quot;Niedersächsisches Staatsarchiv&quot;, the state archives of Lower Saxony, as well as the renowned &quot;Biblioteca Augusta&quot;. Beginning in 2009 the Landesmusikakademie Niedersachsen is located in the Seeliger Park and sponsored by the state of Lower Saxony to promote music education at various levels.

The herb liqueur Jägermeister&#x27;s headquarters of Mast-Jägermeister are still located in Wolfenbüttel, as are some of its distillation sites.

Wolfenbüttel hosted the three-day International German Bus Pulling Championships in May 2009, where five-person teams pull a 16-ton bus 30 meters.

Every year starting in late November, Wolfenbüttel stages a Christmas market with food and drinks. Locals often come and enjoy the pre-Christmas atmosphere.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Wolfenbüttel is twinned with:
* Sèvres, France (1958)
* Kenosha, United States (1970)
* Satu Mare, Romania (1976)
* Kamienna Góra, Poland (2001)
* Blankenburg, Germany (2015)

A bridge in Wolfenbüttel is named after each of these cities. In Kenosha, there is a park located on the coast of Lake Michigan named after Wolfenbüttel.

<doc id="154473" wikidata="Q13633683" url="?curid=154473" title="Fermi level">
<text>The Fermi level of a solid-state body is the thermodynamic work required to add one electron to the body. It is a thermodynamic quantity usually denoted by &quot;μ&quot; or &quot;E&quot;F
for brevity. The Fermi level does not include the work required to remove the electron from wherever it came from.
A precise understanding of the Fermi level—how it relates to electronic band structure in determining electronic properties; how it relates to the voltage and flow of charge in an electronic circuit—is essential to an understanding of solid-state physics.

In band structure theory, used in solid state physics to analyze the energy levels in a solid, the Fermi level can be considered to be a hypothetical energy level of an electron, such that at thermodynamic equilibrium this energy level would have a &quot;50% probability of being occupied at any given time&quot;.
The position of the Fermi level in relation to the band energy levels is a crucial factor in determining electrical properties.
The Fermi level does not necessarily correspond to an actual energy level (in an insulator the Fermi level lies in the band gap), nor does it require the existence of a band structure.
Nonetheless, the Fermi level is a precisely defined thermodynamic quantity, and differences in Fermi level can be measured simply with a voltmeter.

==Voltage measurement==

Sometimes it is said that electric currents are driven by differences in electrostatic potential (Galvani potential), but this is not exactly true.
As a counterexample, multi-material devices such as p–n junctions contain internal electrostatic potential differences at equilibrium, yet without any accompanying net current; if a voltmeter is attached to the junction, one simply measures zero volts.
Clearly, the electrostatic potential is not the only factor influencing the flow of charge in a material—Pauli repulsion, carrier concentration gradients, electromagnetic induction, and thermal effects also play an important role.

In fact, the quantity called &quot;voltage&quot; as measured in an electronic circuit has a simple relationship to the chemical potential for electrons (Fermi level).
When the leads of a voltmeter are attached to two points in a circuit, the displayed voltage is a measure of the &quot;total&quot; work transferred when a unit charge is allowed to move from one point to the other.
If a simple wire is connected between two points of differing voltage (forming a short circuit), current will flow from positive to negative voltage, converting the available work into heat.

The Fermi level of a body expresses the work required to add an electron to it, or equally the work obtained by removing an electron.
Therefore, &quot;V&quot;A − &quot;V&quot;B, the observed difference in voltage between two points, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, in an electronic circuit is exactly related to the corresponding chemical potential difference, &quot;μ&quot;A − &quot;μ&quot;B, in Fermi level by the formula
formula_1
where −&quot;e&quot; is the electron charge.

From the above discussion it can be seen that electrons will move from a body of high &quot;μ&quot; (low voltage) to low &quot;μ&quot; (high voltage) if a simple path is provided.
This flow of electrons will cause the lower &quot;μ&quot; to increase (due to charging or other repulsion effects) and likewise cause the higher &quot;μ&quot; to decrease.
Eventually, &quot;μ&quot; will settle down to the same value in both bodies.
This leads to an important fact regarding the equilibrium (off) state of an electronic circuit:
This also means that the voltage (measured with a voltmeter) between any two points will be zero, at equilibrium.
Note that thermodynamic equilibrium here requires that the circuit be internally connected and not contain any batteries or other power sources, nor any variations in temperature.

==Band structure of solids==
In the band theory of solids, electrons occupy a series of bands composed of single-particle energy eigenstates each labelled by &quot;ϵ&quot;. Although this single particle picture is an approximation, it greatly simplifies the understanding of electronic behaviour and it generally provides correct results when applied correctly.

The Fermi–Dirac distribution, formula_2, gives the probability that (at thermodynamic equilibrium) a state having energy &quot;ϵ&quot; is occupied by an electron:
formula_3

Here, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature and &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant. If there is a state at the Fermi level (&quot;ϵ&quot; = &quot;μ&quot;), then this state will have a 50% chance of being occupied. The distribution is plotted in the left figure. The closer &quot;f&quot; is to 1, the higher chance this state is occupied. The closer &quot;f&quot; is to 0, the higher chance this state is empty.

The location of &quot;μ&quot; within a material&#x27;s band structure is important in determining the electrical behaviour of the material.
* In an insulator, &quot;μ&quot; lies within a large band gap, far away from any states that are able to carry current.
* In a metal, semimetal or degenerate semiconductor, &quot;μ&quot; lies within a delocalized band. A large number of states nearby &quot;μ&quot; are thermally active and readily carry current.
* In an intrinsic or lightly doped semiconductor, &quot;μ&quot; is close enough to a band edge that there are a dilute number of thermally excited carriers residing near that band edge.

In semiconductors and semimetals the position of &quot;μ&quot; relative to the band structure can usually be controlled to a significant degree by doping or gating. These controls do not change &quot;μ&quot; which is fixed by the electrodes, but rather they cause the entire band structure to shift up and down (sometimes also changing the band structure&#x27;s shape). For further information about the Fermi levels of semiconductors, see (for example) Sze.

===Local conduction band referencing, internal chemical potential and the parameter &quot;ζ&quot;===

If the symbol &quot;ℰ&quot; is used to denote an electron energy level measured relative to the energy of the edge of its enclosing band, &quot;ϵ&quot;C, then in general we have formula_4 We can define a parameter &quot;ζ&quot; that references the Fermi level with respect to the band edge:formula_5It follows that the Fermi–Dirac distribution function can be written asformula_6The band theory of metals was initially developed by Sommerfeld, from 1927 onwards, who paid great attention to the underlying thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Confusingly, in some contexts the band-referenced quantity &quot;ζ&quot; may be called the &quot;Fermi level&quot;, &quot;chemical potential&quot;, or &quot;electrochemical potential&quot;, leading to ambiguity with the globally-referenced Fermi level.
In this article, the terms &quot;conduction-band referenced Fermi level&quot; or &quot;internal chemical potential&quot; are used to refer to &quot;ζ&quot;.

&quot;ζ&quot; is directly related to the number of active charge carriers as well as their typical kinetic energy, and hence it is directly involved in determining the local properties of the material (such as electrical conductivity).
For this reason it is common to focus on the value of &quot;ζ&quot; when concentrating on the properties of electrons in a single, homogeneous conductive material.
By analogy to the energy states of a free electron, the &quot;ℰ&quot; of a state is the kinetic energy of that state and &quot;ϵ&quot;C is its potential energy. With this in mind, the parameter, &quot;ζ&quot;, could also be labelled the &quot;Fermi kinetic energy&quot;.

Unlike &quot;μ&quot;, the parameter, &quot;ζ&quot;, is not a constant at equilibrium, but rather varies from location to location in a material due to variations in &quot;ϵ&quot;C, which is determined by factors such as material quality and impurities/dopants.
Near the surface of a semiconductor or semimetal, &quot;ζ&quot; can be strongly controlled by externally applied electric fields, as is done in a field effect transistor. In a multi-band material, &quot;ζ&quot; may even take on multiple values in a single location.
For example, in a piece of aluminum there are two conduction bands crossing the Fermi level (even more bands in other materials); each band has a different edge energy, &quot;ϵ&quot;C, and a different &quot;ζ&quot;.

The value of &quot;ζ&quot; at zero temperature is widely known as the Fermi energy, sometimes written &quot;ζ&quot;0. Confusingly (again), the name &quot;Fermi energy&quot; sometimes is used to refer to &quot;ζ&quot; at non-zero temperature.

==Temperature out of equilibrium==

The Fermi level, &quot;μ&quot;, and temperature, &quot;T&quot;, are well defined constants for a solid-state device in thermodynamic equilibrium situation, such as when it is sitting on the shelf doing nothing. When the device is brought out of equilibrium and put into use, then strictly speaking the Fermi level and temperature are no longer well defined. Fortunately, it is often possible to define a quasi-Fermi level and quasi-temperature for a given location, that accurately describe the occupation of states in terms of a thermal distribution. The device is said to be in &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; when and where such a description is possible.

The quasi-equilibrium approach allows one to build a simple picture of some non-equilibrium effects as the electrical conductivity of a piece of metal (as resulting from a gradient of &quot;μ&quot;) or its thermal conductivity (as resulting from a gradient in &quot;T&quot;). The quasi-&quot;μ&quot; and quasi-&quot;T&quot; can vary (or not exist at all) in any non-equilibrium situation, such as:
*If the system contains a chemical imbalance (as in a battery).
*If the system is exposed to changing electromagnetic fields (as in capacitors, inductors, and transformers).
*Under illumination from a light-source with a different temperature, such as the sun (as in solar cells),
*When the temperature is not constant within the device (as in thermocouples),
*When the device has been altered, but has not had enough time to re-equilibrate (as in piezoelectric or pyroelectric substances).

In some situations, such as immediately after a material experiences a high-energy laser pulse, the electron distribution cannot be described by any thermal distribution.
One cannot define the quasi-Fermi level or quasi-temperature in this case; the electrons are simply said to be &quot;non-thermalized&quot;. In less dramatic situations, such as in a solar cell under constant illumination, a quasi-equilibrium description may be possible but requiring the assignment of distinct values of &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;T&quot; to different bands (conduction band vs. valence band). Even then, the values of &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;T&quot; may jump discontinuously across a material interface (e.g., p–n junction) when a current is being driven, and be ill-defined at the interface itself.

==Technicalities==

===Nomenclature===

The term &quot;Fermi level&quot; is mainly used in discussing the solid state physics of electrons in semiconductors, and a precise usage of this term is necessary to describe band diagrams in devices comprising different materials with different levels of doping.
In these contexts, however, one may also see Fermi level used imprecisely to refer to the &quot;band-referenced Fermi level&quot;, &quot;μ&quot; − &quot;ϵ&quot;C, called &quot;ζ&quot; above.
It is common to see scientists and engineers refer to &quot;controlling&quot;, &quot;pinning&quot;, or &quot;tuning&quot; the Fermi level inside a conductor, when they are in fact describing changes in &quot;ϵ&quot;C due to doping or the field effect.
In fact, thermodynamic equilibrium guarantees that the Fermi level in a conductor is &quot;always&quot; fixed to be exactly equal to the Fermi level of the electrodes; only the band structure (not the Fermi level) can be changed by doping or the field effect (see also band diagram).
A similar ambiguity exists between the terms, &quot;chemical potential&quot; and &quot;electrochemical potential&quot;.

It is also important to note that Fermi &quot;level&quot; is not necessarily the same thing as Fermi &quot;energy&quot;.
In the wider context of quantum mechanics, the term Fermi energy usually refers to &quot;the maximum kinetic energy of a fermion in an idealized non-interacting, disorder free, zero temperature Fermi gas&quot;.
This concept is very theoretical (there is no such thing as a non-interacting Fermi gas, and zero temperature is impossible to achieve). However, it finds some use in approximately describing white dwarfs, neutron stars, atomic nuclei, and electrons in a metal.
On the other hand, in the fields of semiconductor physics and engineering, &quot;Fermi energy&quot; often is used to refer to the Fermi level described in this article.

===Fermi level referencing and the location of zero Fermi level===

Much like the choice of origin in a coordinate system, the zero point of energy can be defined arbitrarily. Observable phenomena only depend on energy differences.
When comparing distinct bodies, however, it is important that they all be consistent in their choice of the location of zero energy, or else nonsensical results will be obtained.
It can therefore be helpful to explicitly name a common point to ensure that different components are in agreement.
On the other hand, if a reference point is inherently ambiguous (such as &quot;the vacuum&quot;, see below) it will instead cause more problems.

A practical and well-justified choice of common point is a bulky, physical conductor, such as the electrical ground or earth.
Such a conductor can be considered to be in a good thermodynamic equilibrium and so its &quot;μ&quot; is well defined.
It provides a reservoir of charge, so that large numbers of electrons may be added or removed without incurring charging effects.
It also has the advantage of being accessible, so that the Fermi level of any other object can be measured simply with a voltmeter.

====Why it is not advisable to use &quot;the energy in vacuum&quot; as a reference zero====

In principle, one might consider using the state of a stationary electron in the vacuum as a reference point for energies.
This approach is not advisable unless one is careful to define exactly where &quot;the vacuum&quot; is. The problem is that not all points in the vacuum are equivalent.

At thermodynamic equilibrium, it is typical for electrical potential differences of order 1 V to exist in the vacuum (Volta potentials).
The source of this vacuum potential variation is the variation in work function between the different conducting materials exposed to vacuum.
Just outside a conductor, the electrostatic potential depends sensitively on the material, as well as which surface is selected (its crystal orientation, contamination, and other details).

The parameter that gives the best approximation to universality is the Earth-referenced Fermi level suggested above. This also has the advantage that it can be measured with a voltmeter.
===Discrete charging effects in small systems===
In cases where the &quot;charging effects&quot; due to a single electron are non-negligible, the above definitions should be clarified. For example, consider a capacitor made of two identical parallel-plates. If the capacitor is uncharged, the Fermi level is the same on both sides, so one might think that it should take no energy to move an electron from one plate to the other. But when the electron has been moved, the capacitor has become (slightly) charged, so this does take a slight amount of energy. In a normal capacitor, this is negligible, but in a nano-scale capacitor it can be more important.

In this case one must be precise about the thermodynamic definition of the chemical potential as well as the state of the device: is it electrically isolated, or is it connected to an electrode?

* When the body is able to exchange electrons and energy with an electrode (reservoir), it is described by the grand canonical ensemble. The value of chemical potential can be said to be fixed by the electrode, and the number of electrons on the body may fluctuate. In this case, the chemical potential of a body is the infinitesimal amount of work needed to increase the &quot;average&quot; number of electrons by an infinitesimal amount (even though the number of electrons at any time is an integer, the average number varies continuously.): formula_7 where is the free energy function of the grand canonical ensemble.
* If the number of electrons in the body is fixed (but the body is still thermally connected to a heat bath), then it is in the canonical ensemble. We can define a &quot;chemical potential&quot; in this case literally as the work required to add one electron to a body that already has exactly electrons, formula_8 where is the free energy function of the canonical ensemble, alternatively, formula_9

These chemical potentials are not equivalent, , except in the thermodynamic limit. The distinction is important in small systems such as those showing Coulomb blockade.
The parameter, , (i.e., in the case where the number of electrons is allowed to fluctuate) remains exactly related to the voltmeter voltage, even in small systems.
To be precise, then, the Fermi level is defined not by a deterministic charging event by one electron charge, but rather a statistical charging event by an infinitesimal fraction of an electron.

<doc id="154481" wikidata="Q483810" url="?curid=154481" title="The Cranberries">
<text>The Cranberries were an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989. The band was composed of lead singer and guitarist Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan (Noel&#x27;s brother), and drummer Fergal Lawler; O&#x27;Riordan replaced founding member Niall Quinn in 1990. The band was originally named The Cranberries Saw Us, and was renamed after the addition of O&#x27;Riordan. The band classified themselves as an alternative rock group, but incorporated elements of indie rock, jangle pop, dream pop, folk rock, post-punk, and pop rock into their sound.

In 1991, the Cranberries signed with Island Records, and released their debut album, &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot; (1993), to commercial success. Their second album, &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; (1994), brought the band to international fame and included the single &quot;Zombie&quot; which became a stadium anthem and one of the band&#x27;s most recognizable songs. The band continued this success with the albums &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot; (1996) and &quot;Bury the Hatchet&quot; (1999), and transferred to MCA Records in 2000. Their fifth album, &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot; (2001), did not meet the commercial success of their preceding albums, and the band cited their dissatisfaction with MCA&#x27;s promotion.

Following a six-year hiatus from 2003 to 2009, the Cranberries embarked on a North American tour which was followed by shows in Latin America and Europe. They released their sixth album, &quot;Roses&quot; (2012), their first album in eleven years since &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot;, and expanded their musical style with their seventh acoustic album, &quot;Something Else&quot; (2017). Following O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death from drowning due to alcohol intoxication in 2018, Noel Hogan confirmed that the remaining members chose to disband out of respect for her. They disbanded after the release of their acclaimed final album, &quot;In the End&quot; (2019).

The Cranberries were one of the best-selling alternative acts of the 1990s, and have sold nearly 50 million albums worldwide as of 2019. They won an Ivor Novello Award a Juno Award, an MTV Europe Music Award, a World Music Award, and were nominated for a Brit Award and a Grammy Award. The music video for &quot;Zombie&quot; is the first by an Irish band to reach one billion views on YouTube.

==History==

=== 1989–1991: Formation and early years ===
Brothers Noel Hogan and Mike Hogan, descendants of the nineteenth-century Irish poet Michael Hogan, met Fergal Lawler in the mid-1980s. The young kids who grew up together in Limerick, Ireland, also shared their love of 1980s English/indie music and were &quot;galvanised by punk&#x27;s DIY ethic&quot;. Lawler received his first drum kit as a Christmas present when he was about seventeen; two months later, Mike Hogan received his first bass and his brother his first guitar. Niall Quinn, who also lived in the region, played with his own group called Hitchers and occasionally shared his experiences with the trio. Thereafter, they moved towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and Quinn decided to stay on with the band. In mid-1989, Mike (16) and Noel (18) Hogan formed the Cranberry Saw Us with Lawler (18), and singer Quinn. The initial release from Cranberry Saw Us was the demo EP &quot;Anything&quot; in January 1990. Shortly afterwards, Quinn left the band to return to his previous group Hitchers, although they remained on good terms. Despite this unexpected break-up, the three musicians transitioned to an instrumental group for several months, continuing to improve on ideas and song structures of instrumental pieces. Lawler and the two Hogan brothers then placed an advertisement for a female singer. Subsequently, Quinn introduced the trio to a friend of his girlfriend&#x27;s sister, mentioning that she was a singer-songwriter looking for a group who would compose original music.

On a Sunday afternoon in mid-1990, 18-year-old Dolores O&#x27;Riordan cycled to the audition at Xeric Studios dressed in a tracksuit and with a broken Casio keyboard under her arm. O&#x27;Riordan said of the first encounter &quot;I really liked what I heard; I thought they were very nice and tight. It was a lovely potential band but they needed a singer – and direction&quot;. Noel Hogan gave her a rough cassette demo incorporating chord sequences of indie-jangly guitar sounds, then O&#x27;Riordan took home Hogan&#x27;s tape and began writing lyrics and overlaying melodies which would underpin the group&#x27;s future material. Within a week, she returned to the musicians with whom she sang along a rough version of &quot;Linger&quot;. Mike Hogan later described it as &quot;we were immediately blown away, her voice was something special&quot;. Noel Hogan elaborated, &quot;she was so small and quiet... then she opened her mouth and this amazing voice, this huge voice came out for the size of her&quot;; and then acknowledged: &quot;how come she&#x27;s not already in a band? [...] that day changed our lives&quot;. A musical relationship rapidly developed between O&#x27;Riordan and Noel Hogan, who had enough songs to record a demo. &quot;It was that thing where you&#x27;ve found somebody that you clicked with, and you wanted to get as much as you could out of that,&quot; says Hogan.
 The fledgling band recorded a four-track demo EP called &quot;Water Circle&quot;, released in cassette format by local record label Xeric Records.

In July 1990, the group performed their first gig with O&#x27;Riordan at a hotel basement called Ruby&#x27;s Club, Cruises Hotel, Limerick, performing six original songs to an audience of 60 people including three other local groups. The Cranberry Saw Us moved to Xeric Recording studio and recorded &quot;Nothing Left at All&quot;, their first commercial three-track EP released on tape in 300 copies by Xeric Records, which sold out in local record shops in Limerick within a few days. The owner of Xeric Studios, Pearse Gilmore, became their manager and provided the group with studio time to complete a demo tape, which he produced. It featured early versions of &quot;Linger&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;, which were sent directly to record companies in London by Noel Hogan, determined to leave the underground circuit of small Irish clubs and pubs. Rough Trade label founder Geoff Travis immediately gave his approval, and although the Cranberries did not sign on to his label the demo continued to earn the attention of both the UK press and record industry and sparked a bidding war between major British record labels.

On 18 April 1991, the group played a decisive show in their hometown at Jetland Center as part of the University of Limerick&#x27;s RAG Week to 1,400 students. In attendance was record producer Denny Cordell, who was then A&amp;R for Island Records, and thirty-two other A&amp;R men who flew from London. Shortly thereafter, the band changed their name to &quot;The Cranberries&quot;. &quot;Nothing Left at All&quot; began to circulate in the UK with the support of John Best PR agency. Then, they performed their first UK tour opening for the British band Moose over the course of three weeks. The Cranberries received more letters expressing interest from Virgin, EMI, Imago, CBS, and Warner, which led the Hogan brothers to quit their jobs. Eventually the group signed a six-album deal with Island Records who won the battle through Denny Cordell. In mid-1991, the Cranberries headed back into the studio with Gilmore as their producer to &quot;hastily&quot; record their first EP &quot;Uncertain&quot; and created a music video for the title track, which was not released. Gilmore made various alterations to the album&#x27;s rough cuts. 5,000 total copies of &quot;Uncertain&quot; were printed and released in October 1991 by Island Records under the Xeric name. The EP received poor reviews in the press and led to tension between the group and Gilmore. By this time, Gilmore began restricting information to the Cranberries and made separate arrangements with Island&#x27;s U.S. branch. In October 1991 the Cranberries performed at Underworld in London during a UK and Ireland tour. Adding to this period of doubt, touring conditions and money were lacking with maximum earnings of $25 a day. On 9 December 1991, the Cranberries was supposed to support Nirvana in Belfast&#x27;s Conor Hall, but Nirvana canceled their tour at the last moment as well as the five remaining shows due to Kurt Cobain&#x27;s ill health.

=== 1992–1995: &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot; and &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; ===

After a difficult recording session, intended for their first album on Island Records in January 1992, the band scrapped their work and fired Gilmore. Noel Hogan stated &quot;we didn&#x27;t have a problem with each other, we had a problem with this guy&quot;. During that period the Cranberries toured Ireland and the UK as the opening act for TOP, gaining more attention from the British press. Subsequently, they hired Geoff Travis as their new manager. The Cranberries headed back into the studio in Dublin in March 1992 to restart working on their first LP with Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the Smiths. The Cranberries began a UK and Ireland headlining tour during the last four months of 1992 to promote the subsequent release of &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot;. In October 1992, &quot;Dreams&quot; was released in the UK, becoming &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s single of the week. In November 1992, they performed at the emblematic Royal Albert Hall supporting Mercury Rev and the House of Love. Between 1991 and 1993, the band also recorded several studio and live sessions intended for Irish and British radio and television shows, including 2fm&#x27;s &quot;The Dave Fanning Show&quot; in Dublin and BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;John Peel Show&quot;. The band released &quot;Dreams&quot; as a single in September 1992, and followed this up with &quot;Linger&quot;, released in the UK in February 1993.

Their first full-length album &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot; was released 1 March 1993. Neither the album nor the singles gained much attention. Nevertheless on the 3rd of May 1993 the band came to Paris (their first trip to France) to record a Live radio programme, Black Session (France Inter). On that occasion they sang 12 songs. When the band embarked on a tour supporting Suede, they caught the attention of MTV, which put their videos into heavy rotation. The defining moment occurred when mid-way through the tour running order was reversed and the Cranberries replaced Suede as the tour headliner. In late 1993, the band toured extensively throughout the US and &quot;Linger&quot; received heavy rotation on college radio stations across the country. The band&#x27;s first big hit, &quot;Linger&quot; peaked at No. 3 in Ireland. It reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and stayed on the charts for 24 weeks. &quot;Linger&quot; was later re-issued in February 1994 peaking at No. 14. &quot;Linger&quot; was followed by &quot;Dreams&quot;, released again in May 1994; the single peaked at No. 27 on the UK charts and reached the Top 15 on the US Alternative Airplay list, helping the band&#x27;s debut album to top both the UK Albums Chart and Irish Albums Chart in June. By mid-1994, the Cranberries&#x27; North America tour drew an attendance of 10,000 to 13,500 per show.

The group reunited with Street for &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;, which was released on 3 October 1994. It would go on to peak at No. 6 on the U.S. charts and eventually outsold its predecessor. Within a year it went triple platinum, spawning the number-one hit &quot;Zombie&quot; and the No. 11 &quot;Ode to My Family&quot; on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. By March 1994, the Cranberries won the Top International Act of Music Week (UK). On 13 August 1994, during their US tour, the Cranberries performed at Woodstock II in Saugerties, New York. Ed Power of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote that the Cranberries &quot;superstardom was sealed by a November 1994 rendition of &#x27;Zombie&#x27; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;&quot;; he said, &quot;It was a dark, sludgy appearance, topped off by O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s stunning transformation from indie urchin to blonde-dyed rock chick in high boots&quot;. In 1995, the band continued touring and released two more singles, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be with You&quot; and &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts&quot;. On 20 February 1995, the Cranberries received a nomination at the Brit Awards in the International Group category at the 15th edition of the annual pop music awards in the United Kingdom. On 15 May 1995, the Cranberries had planned an impromptu free acoustic set for 3,000 people at National Sylvan Theater in Washington, D.C. The show was organized and promoted by radio station WHFS, which had paid for the use of five U.S. park police officers. Before the show began, the organizers realized how erroneous their original crowd estimates were when a frenzied crowd of over 10,000 devotees appeared. The show started 40 minutes late, and stage diving began before the first guitar note was played. Park Police officers established that they could not control the crowd and stopped the show after one and a half songs. When the crowd were told that the Cranberries would not be returning, rioting began, with the crowd throwing rocks, food, and beer bottles at Park Police officers. Some audience members jumped onstage, and O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s acoustic guitar was stolen. More officers in riot gear arrived, and dozens of mounted horse patrols cleared the south quarter of the Washington Monument grounds while the fracas continued outside.

On 23 May 1995, at London&#x27;s Grosvenor House, the Cranberries were nominated for Best Contemporary Song for &quot;Zombie&quot; at the Ivor Novello Awards. In mid-1995, the Cranberries had broken the American market; while the UK bands had failed. At that time, the band was Ireland&#x27;s biggest musical export since U2. In 1995 the Cranberries performed &quot;Ode to My Family&quot; at the World Music Awards, winning the Award for Best Irish Recording Artists. They were named Best Irish Recording Artists at the 10th annual Irish Music awards, held at Dublin&#x27;s Burlington Hotel. On 23 November 1995 the Cranberries won the &quot;Best Song&quot; award for &quot;Zombie&quot; at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards, beating out Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;. During the &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; European tour &#x27;95, the Cranberries performed to more than 500,000 people, with peak attendance reaching 20,000 people per night in United States.

=== 1996–2000: &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot; and &quot;Bury the Hatchet&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s third album &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot; was released on 30 April 1996, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot; sold four million copies in six weeks and went double platinum in the US and Gold in the UK, it failed to match the sales of its predecessors. The album was &quot;mauled&quot; by the press due to the politically charged songs &quot;Bosnia&quot;, &quot;War Child&quot;, and the real, unaltered sound of gunshots in &quot;I Just Shot John Lennon&quot;. The first single from the album was &quot;Salvation&quot;, which topped the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single from the album was &quot;Free to Decide&quot;; the single&#x27;s peak in the UK was 33, and it reached number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In September 1996, the Cranberries&#x27; video for &quot;Salvation&quot; was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction. In November 1996 &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot; was released as a single in the US, peaking at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On 9 June 1996, the Cranberries canceled the remainder of the Australian leg of their 117-date world tour, as O&#x27;Riordan re-injured her knee during a concert in Cairns on 8 June. The tour resumed in August 1996 in North America, but they never finished it and canceled the European leg, citing O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s &quot;ill health&quot;. She said that she was exhausted, suffering insomnia, paranoia, and anorexia; her weight had dropped to . O&#x27;Riordan also complained about the press and photographers invading her private life. The circumstances had almost led to the band breaking up and they then took a one-year hiatus from the music industry.

On 9 March 1997, Bruce Fairbairn and the Cranberries were nominees at the Juno Awards for their work on &quot;Free to Decide&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot;. On 19 May 1997, the band received an Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement at London&#x27;s Grosvenor House. On 12 November 1998, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan and Fergal Lawler made an appearance at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards in Milan and presented the award for best song. On 11 December 1998, the band played &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Linger&quot; at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert at Oslo Spektrum in Norway. &quot;Promises&quot; was performed live for the first time, four months before the release of &quot;Bury the Hatchet&quot;. At that time, the Cranberries were named as one of the &quot;Most Outstanding Irish Bands of All Time&quot;, along with Van Morrison and U2.

On 19 April 1999, the band released &quot;Bury the Hatchet&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Promises&quot;, was released in February. &quot;Promises&quot; would be the only single from the album to chart in the US and the last U.S. chart single released by the band before their hiatus. The album peaked at 7 in the UK and 13 in the US and was certified gold in the US. The second single from the album was &quot;Animal Instinct&quot;, which did not chart in the UK, although it did chart in France, Austria and many others. The album&#x27;s third and fourth singles were &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; and &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;, respectively. The band had a guest appearance on popular television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, performing &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; on the fifth episode of the second season, &quot;She&#x27;s a Man, Baby, a Man!&quot;. The Cranberries undertook a 110-date world tour which drew more than one million fans. The world tour started in April 1999 and was completed in July 2000. The group partnered with Ticketmaster.com to be the first artists to sell tickets for a national tour exclusively online. It was the biggest and most successful tour of the Cranberries&#x27; career. The tour brought them back to Ireland for their first date since May 2000. They performed at Millstreet in County Cork. As the tour rolled on, the band released &quot;Bury the Hatchet – The Complete Sessions&quot;, a double CD featuring B-sides as well as live tracks taken from a show in Paris. Although &quot;Bury the Hatchet&quot; was a major seller, the album marked a sales decrease compared to their previous releases.

=== 2001–2008: &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot; and hiatus ===
On 22 October 2001, the album &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot; was released; the band&#x27;s old producer Stephen Street returned to produce the album. The album peaked at No. 46 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 2 on the Spanish, Italian and French album charts. It went to No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canadian Albums Chart and reached No. 61 in the UK. The first single released from the album was &quot;Analyse&quot;, which charted in the US Adult Top 40 at a peak of 26. In January 2002, they released the second single &quot;Time Is Ticking Out&quot;, and some months later another one, &quot;This Is the Day&quot;. In September, a greatest hits album was released titled &quot;&quot;, which was released alongside an of music videos. The album peaked in the UK at No. 20. The song &quot;Stars&quot; was released as a single from that album. They started a European tour in mid-October 2002 and ended in December.

In January 2003, following advice from their legal advisors, the Cranberries parted ways with record label MCA, due to the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the promotion of &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot;. Noel Hogan observed &quot;with little effort from our label, we have been pleased to see top-10 sales in many countries&quot;. Despite comments from MCA regarding that the album did not reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s top 30, the 2002 concerts drew an average audience of 10,000 people, with many of the dates selling out. O&#x27;Riordan told &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;since we were signed in 1991 by Island Records, we have gradually seen our label dissolve from a pioneering independent spirited label into a corporate monolith that completely lost touch with the group&#x27;s creative vision&quot;. The Cranberries signed in 1991 with Island Records America, which was transferred to MCA in 2000 following a contract renegotiation. The band failed to replicate its earlier success; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Browne said that &quot;even as their sound grew edgier and punkier, they never lost their fan base, for whom the troubled O&#x27;Riordan remained a relatable pop star&quot;. At the end of February 2003, the Cranberries started working with Stephen Street and debuted their work for the first time in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 29 May 2003, performing the songs &quot;Astral Projection&quot; and &quot;In It Together&quot;.

In September 2003, the band announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers, as well as concentrate on family, and scrapped sessions for a sixth studio release. Initially, a two-year sabbatical was confirmed, while O&#x27;Riordan assured that the group would just take a hiatus, she said &quot;we&#x27;ve been together for 13 years; it&#x27;s a much needed break. It was getting predictable and lacking in a challenge; time to experiment&quot;. Although a spokesperson for the Cranberries announced a &quot;temporary shutdown in activities&quot;, the four members remained on good terms and in regular contact with each other.

O&#x27;Riordan started collaborating with other musicians in 2004 before launching her solo career with the album &quot;Are You Listening?&quot; in 2007 and a world tour, following it with &quot;No Baggage&quot; in 2009. Noel and Mike Hogan started a new project called Mono Band, writing all instrumentation in his own studio and developing a &quot;new way of working&quot; with programmer Matt Vaughan; the project&#x27;s first full-length self-titled album saw a limited release in 2005, and they later became Arkitekt, releasing EPs in 2007 and 2009. Noel Hogan has also been working as a producer with Supermodel Twins, from his native Limerick and Remma. In April 2006, Mike Hogan and his wife Siobhán opened a café called The Sage Café, on Catherine Street in the heart of Limerick City. The café closed on 25 September 2017. Fergal Lawler was a member of the Low Network, whose first album was released in 2007. He also worked with Walter Mitty and the Realists as well as Last Days of Death Country as both producer and musician.

=== 2009–2017: Reunion, &quot;Roses&quot; and &quot;Something Else&quot; ===
The Cranberries reunited in January 2009 to celebrate O&#x27;Riordan becoming an Honorary Patron of University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin). The group indicated at the time that this did not signify an official reunion, but on 25 August 2009, in anticipation of the release of &quot;No Baggage&quot;, O&#x27;Riordan announced that the Cranberries would be reuniting for a North American and European tour. O&#x27;Riordan indicated that the band would be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of the Cranberries&#x27; classic hits as well as some new group compositions. At this point of their career, the Cranberries were managed by Danny Goldberg, former Nirvana and Kurt Cobain manager. In 2011, the actual &quot;Water Circle&quot; demo tape emerged, widely assumed to be the first appearance of the Cranberries with the vocal of Dolores O&#x27;Riordan. A private collector from United States submitted the bid to US$1499.95 via eBay store; the offer was eclipsed later. 
The Cranberries recorded &quot;Roses&quot; at the Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Canada, from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on their first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the &quot;Roses&quot; session, although not all were included on the album. &quot;Roses&quot; was released on 27 February 2012. The sixth studio album &quot;Roses&quot; peaked at 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and achieved numerous placements on other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, such as No. 4 on the Independent Albums, No. 6 on the Canadian Albums Chart, No. 9 on the Alternative Albums, No. 10 on the Rock Albums and No. 20 on Tastemaker Albums chart. On 18 February 2012 the Cranberries returned to the stage of the Ariston Theatre where they presented their new single &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in Sanremo at the 62nd Song Festival di Sanremo, Italy. They performed &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Zombie&quot;, having been invited on more than one occasion to the festival. O&#x27;Riordan started legal proceedings against Noel Hogan in October 2013. The case was struck out in July 2015 and the cause was not divulged.

An acoustic Cranberries album titled &quot;Something Else&quot; was released on 28 April 2017, through BMG. &quot;Something Else&quot; featured orchestral arrangements of prior releases, re-recorded in 2016 acoustically with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, and three new songs: &quot;The Glory&quot;, &quot;Why&quot;, and &quot;Rupture&quot;. After the release of &quot;Something Else&quot;, the group announced a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the European tour, the Cranberries had to cancel the remainder of the European dates due to O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s health, with the band&#x27;s website citing &quot;medical reasons associated with a back problem&quot;. The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed enough for her to participate.

=== 2018–2019: Death of O&#x27;Riordan, &quot;In The End&quot; and breakup ===
On 15 January 2018, O&#x27;Riordan died unexpectedly in London, England. She had recently arrived in London for a studio mixing session on her D.A.R.K. album and to discuss the upcoming album of the band with record label BMG. The inquest into her death was adjourned until 3 April while the coroner awaited the results of &quot;various tests&quot;. On 6 September 2018, it was ruled that she had accidentally drowned in her hotel room&#x27;s bathtub due to sedation by alcohol poisoning. In mid-September 2018, Noel Hogan confirmed that the Cranberries would not continue as a band, but would release their final album &quot;In the End&quot; before their dissolution. During the 2017 tour, and the following winter, O&#x27;Riordan and Noel Hogan had written and demoed eleven tracks. Her recorded vocal demos for the album were stored in her personal hard disk drive from her home in New York City. Hogan stated: &quot;We will do this album and then that will be it. No one wants to do this without Dolores...&quot; &quot;So there&#x27;s a song called &#x27;In the End&#x27;, it&#x27;s the last song on the album, and it just kind of summed up the whole album and the band. Because it&#x27;s definitely the end of it for us. So we&#x27;ve called it that.&quot;

On 15 January 2019, one year after O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death, the band released &quot;All Over Now&quot;, the first single from &quot;In the End&quot;. The band released the single &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot; on 19 March 2019. The Cranberries released the title track of the album, &quot;In the End&quot; on 16 April 2019, which was the last song recorded by O&#x27;Riordan before her death. The Cranberries released &quot;In the End&quot; on 26 April 2019. The album peaked at No. 8 in Germany, No. 11 in France, No. 4 in Italy, No. 3 in Ireland, and charted in the Top 10 of the UK Official Charts. &quot;In the End&quot; also went to No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart, and No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Alternative Albums chart. The Cranberries&#x27; final album &quot;In the End&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.

On 18 January 2019, Noel Hogan, Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler were conferred with honorary doctorates by University of Limerick. A posthumous award was presented to Eileen O&#x27;Riordan, mother of Dolores O&#x27;Riordan. Saint Sister, a duo from Northern Ireland, performed an a cappella rendition of the song &quot;Dreams&quot; at Lyra McKee&#x27;s funeral in Belfast on 24 April 2019; McKee was murdered by the New IRA in April 2019. On 1 September 2019, Noel Hogan joined Kodaline on stage at the Electric Picnic Festival in Stradbally, Ireland, to play &quot;Zombie&quot; in tribute to Dolores O&#x27;Riordan.

=== Post-breakup ===
In early April 2021, &quot;Zombie&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Digital Song Sales chart. On 6 September 2021, the band released the compilation album &quot;Remembering Dolores&quot;. The album peaked at number 50 on the UK Album Sales Chart, number 48 on the UK Physical Albums Chart, number 36 on the UK Vinyl Albums Chart, and number 33 on the UK Record Store Chart.

On 25 March 2024, the Cranberries released the &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; EP; the extended play contained the songs: &quot;Linger&quot;, &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot;, &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, &quot;(They Long To Be) Close To You&quot;, &quot;I Really Hope&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;. On 28 June 2024, the Cranberries released a remix of &quot;Linger&quot; by Iain Cook. Lawler said that &quot;Iain did an outstanding job in remixing &quot;Linger.&quot; He reimagined the song completely, creating a fresh and upbeat version of this classic. Dolores&#x27;s original vocal is retained and sounds so beautiful and vulnerable at times. I&#x27;m sure she would have loved it.&quot;

==Artistry==

=== Musical style ===

The Cranberries were defined as an alternative rock band. The band&#x27;s sound, characterised by Noel Hogan&#x27;s guitar-driven indie rock, combined musical genres ranging from jangle pop, dream pop, indie pop, and folk music styles (notably Irish folk)to post-punk, embodied by the drumming style and O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s voice. Their debut single &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;introduced the world to the band&#x27;s unique twist on the Celtic rock tradition&quot;; &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot;″s Kaitlyn Fox wrote, &quot;one of the most well-known and influential groups from the Irish music scene is the Cranberries&quot;. They also incorporated string arrangements to various effect; writer Simon Vozick-Levinson described &quot;O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s impossibly tender vocals&quot; on &quot;Linger&quot;, mingled with &quot;the orchestral swoon, the just-this-side-of-shoegaze guitars&quot;. However, their music made a shift toward a heavier sound, in songs such as &quot;So Cold in Ireland&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Promises&quot;, among others. &quot;Salvation&quot; has been considered as straight-ahead punk rock. &quot;Loud and Clear&quot; has a &quot;boisterous middle eight and odd structure&quot; defined by a &quot;bridge, then verse, then wordless chorus all the way to the finish&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dan Weiss said of the song that the &quot;absurdist chorus (&#x27;People are stranger/ People deranged, are&#x27;) would be appreciated by Jim Morrison&quot;. With their final album, &quot;In the End&quot;, the Cranberries returned to their musical origins with the same &quot;simplicity&quot; that initiated their 1993 debut album, in a matured version.

The band&#x27;s music has been likened to Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Siouxsie and the Banshees. O&#x27;Riordan stated her singing style incorporating yodelling was inspired by her father, who used to sing &quot;The Lonesome Cattle Call&quot;: &quot;I just kept with my father all the time, just copying him and eventually I learned how to do it. Then over the years there were artists like Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Siouxsie from Siouxsie and the Banshees and even Peter Harvey was doing it. It was something that you could work into The Cranberries&#x27; format because a lot of that was used in religious Irish music&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan was influenced by Gregorian chant, and by her experiences singing solo in local church, school choir, traditional Irish ballads and songs in both English and Irish. She was a classically trained pianist and played the church organ.

=== Influences ===
O&#x27;Riordan was influenced by The Smiths, Duran Duran, The Cure, R.E.M., and Depeche Mode. Lawler, Mike and Noel Hogan were inspired by The Cure, Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, and The Smiths. Noel Hogan stressed that at the band&#x27;s beginnings, &quot;All these roads led to The Smiths, who became very big in our lives later on.&quot;

== Achievements ==

=== Album sales ===
By mid-1996, the band&#x27;s combined albums had sold more than 22 million copies. By January 1999, the Recording Industry Association of America announced US sales of 5 million copies of &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot;. Also in January 1999, the Recording Industry Association of America announced a total of 28 million albums by the band sold. In late 2001, the Cranberries had sold more than 33 million albums worldwide. As of late 2014, &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; had generated worldwide album sales of 17 million. At the time of O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death, more than 40 million of the Cranberries albums were sold worldwide. In March 2019, the Cranberries had sold close to 50 million albums worldwide. &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; went 5× platinum in Canada, platinum in Switzerland, and 7× platinum in the United States. 

On 10 March 1996, the Cranberries received the Best-Selling Album Award for &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; at the 26th Annual Juno Awards. In October 2016, the Cranberries received a BMI Award in London for three million radio plays in the United States of their single &quot;Dreams&quot; taken from their debut studio album. The award had been presented with a special citation of achievement.

=== Music videos ===
A music video restoration campaign of the entire catalogue of the Cranberries on YouTube was launched on 3 October 2019, 25 years after the release of the album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;. On 18 April 2020, the official music video for &quot;Zombie&quot; became the first song by an Irish band to reach over one billion views on YouTube, becoming the third video from the 1990s, and the sixth from the 20th century, to reach the milestone on the video streaming service.

<text>A parkway is a landscaped thoroughfare. The term is particularly used for a roadway in a park or connecting to a park from which trucks and other heavy vehicles are excluded.

Over the years, many different types of roads have been labeled parkways. The term may be used to describe city streets as narrow as two lanes with a landscaped median, wide landscaped setbacks, or both. 

The term has also been applied to scenic highways and to limited-access roads more generally. Many parkways originally intended for scenic, recreational driving have evolved into major urban and commuter routes.

==United States==

===Scenic roads===
The first parkways in the United States were developed during the late 19th century by landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux as roads that separated pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and horse carriages, such as Eastern Parkway, which is credited as the world&#x27;s first parkway, and Ocean Parkway in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The term &quot;parkway&quot; to define this type of road was coined by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with &quot;pleasure roads&quot;.In Buffalo, New York, Olmsted and Vaux used parkways with landscaped medians and setbacks to create the first interconnected park and parkway system in the United States. Bidwell Parkway and Chapin Parkway are 200 foot wide city streets with only one lane for cars in each direction and broad landscaped medians that provide a pleasant, shaded route to the park and serve as mini-parks within the neighborhood. The Rhode Island Metropolitan Park Commission developed several parkways in the Providence area.

Other parkways, such as Park Presidio Boulevard in San Francisco, California, were designed to serve larger volumes of traffic. 

During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include limited-access highways designed for recreational driving of automobiles, with landscaping. These parkways originally provided scenic routes without very slow or commercial vehicles, at grade intersections, or pedestrian traffic. Examples are the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut and the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway in New York. But their success led to more development, expanding a city&#x27;s boundaries, eventually limiting the parkway&#x27;s recreational driving use. The Arroyo Seco Parkway between Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena, California, is an example of lost pastoral aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name &quot;parkway&quot;.

===Early high speed roads===

In New York City, construction on the Long Island Motor Parkway (Vanderbilt Parkway) began in 1906 and planning for the Bronx River Parkway in 1907. In the 1920s, the New York City Metropolitan Area&#x27;s parkway system grew under the direction of Robert Moses, the president of the New York State Council of Parks and Long Island State Park Commission, who used parkways to provide access to newly created state parks, especially for city dwellers. As Commissioner of New York City Parks under Mayor LaGuardia, he extended the parkways to the heart of the city, creating and linking its parks to the greater metropolitan systems.

Most of the New York metropolitan parkways were designed by Gilmore Clark. The famed &quot;Gateway to New England&quot; Merritt Parkway in Connecticut was designed in the 1930s as a pleasurable alternative for affluent locals to the congested Boston Post Road, running through forest with each bridge designed uniquely to enhance the scenery. Another example is the Sprain Brook Parkway from lower-Westchester to connect to the Taconic State Parkway to Chatham, New York. Landscape architect George Kessler designed extensive parkway systems for Kansas City, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Indianapolis; and other cities at the beginning of the 20th century.

===New Deal roads===
In the 1930s, as part of the New Deal, the U.S. federal government constructed National Parkways designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower speed limits and are maintained by the National Park Service. An example is the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Virginia.

Others are Skyline Drive in Virginia; the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee; and the Colonial Parkway in eastern Virginia&#x27;s Historic Triangle area. The George Washington Memorial Parkway and the Clara Barton Parkway, running along the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Virginia, were also constructed during this era.

===Post-war parkways===
In Kentucky the term &quot;parkway&quot; designates a freeway in the Kentucky Parkway system, with nine built in the 1960s and 1970s. They were toll roads until the construction bonds were repaid; the last of these roads to charge tolls became freeways in 2006.

The Arroyo Seco Parkway from Pasadena to Los Angeles, built in 1940, was the first segment of the vast Southern California freeway system. It became part of State Route 110 and was renamed the Pasadena Freeway. A 2010 restoration of the freeway brought the Arroyo Seco Parkway designation back.
In the New York metropolitan area, contemporary parkways are predominantly limited-access highways or freeways restricted to non-commercial traffic, excluding trucks and tractor-trailers. Some have low overpasses that also exclude buses. The Vanderbilt Parkway, an exception in western Suffolk County, is a surviving remnant of the Long Island Motor Parkway that became a surface street, no longer with controlled-access or non-commercial vehicle restrictions. The Palisades Interstate Parkway is a post-war parkway that starts at the George Washington Bridge, heads north through New Jersey, continuing through Rockland and Orange counties in New York. The Palisades Parkway was built to allow for a direct route from New York City to Harriman State Park.

In New Jersey, the Garden State Parkway, connecting the northern part of the state with the Jersey Shore, is restricted to buses and non-commercial traffic north of the Route 18 interchange, but trucks are permitted south of this point. It is one of the busiest toll roads in the country.

In the Pittsburgh region, two of the major Interstates are referred to informally as parkways. The Parkway East (I-376, formally the Penn-Lincoln Parkway) connects Downtown Pittsburgh to Monroeville, Pennsylvania. The Parkway West (I-376) runs through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and links Downtown to Pittsburgh International Airport, southbound I-79, Imperial, Pennsylvania, and westbound US 22/US 30. The Parkway North (I-279) connects Downtown to Franklin Park, Pennsylvania and northbound I-79.

In the suburbs of Philadelphia, U.S. Route 202 follows an at-grade parkway alignment known as the &quot;U.S. Route 202 Parkway&quot; between Montgomeryville and Doylestown. The parkway varies from two to four lanes in width, has shoulders, a walking path called the US 202 Parkway Trail on the side, and a speed limit. The parkway opened in 2012 as a bypass of a section of US 202 between the two towns; it had originally been proposed as a four-lane freeway before funding for the road was cut.

In Minneapolis, the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway system has of streets designated as parkways. These are not freeways; they have a slow speed limit, pedestrian crossings, and stop signs.

In Cincinnati, parkways are major roads which trucks are prohibited from using. Some Cincinnati parkways, such as Columbia Parkway, are high-speed, limited-access roads, while others, such as Central Parkway, are multi-lane urban roads without controlled access. Columbia Parkway carries US-50 traffic from downtown towards east-side suburbs of Mariemont, Anderson, and Milford, and is a limited access road from downtown to the Village of Mariemont.

In Boston, parkways are generally four to six lanes wide but are not usually controlled-access. They are highly trafficked in most cases, transporting people between neighborhoods quicker than a typical city street. Many of them serve as principal arterials and some (like Storrow Drive, Memorial Drive, the Alewife Brook Parkway and the VFW Parkway) have evolved into regional commuter routes.

==Canada==
&quot;Parkway&quot; is used in the names of many Canadian roads, including major routes through national parks, scenic drives, major urban thoroughfares, and even regular freeways that carry commercial traffic.

Parkways in the National Capital Region are administered by the National Capital Region (Canada). However, some of them are named &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;driveway&quot;.

The term in Canada is also applied to multi-use paths and greenways used by walkers and cyclists.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;parkway&quot; more commonly refers to park and ride railway stations, where this is often indicated as part of the name, as with Bristol Parkway, the first such station, opened in 1972. 

Luton Airport Parkway is somewhat analogous - an interconnect railway station with an airport via a public transport shuttle (initially buses, now the Luton DART light railway). 

Parkways fitting the definition applied in this article also exist, as listed in this section.

===Peterborough===

The city of Peterborough has roads branded as &quot;parkways&quot; which provide routes for much through traffic and local traffic. The majority are dual carriageways, with many of their junctions numbered. Five main parkways form an orbital outer ring road. Three parkways serve settlements.

===Plymouth===
In the City of Plymouth, the A38 is called &quot;The Parkway&quot; and bisects a rural belt of the local authority area, which coincides with the geographical centre; it has two junctions to enter the downtown part of the city.

== Australia ==

===Australian Capital Territory===

The Australian Capital Territory uses the term &quot;parkway&quot; to refer to roadways of a standard approximately equivalent to what would be designated as an &quot;expressway&quot;, &quot;freeway&quot;, or &quot;motorway&quot; in other areas. Parkways generally have multiple lanes in each direction of travel, no intersections (crossroads are accessed by interchanges), high speed limits, and are of dual carriageway design (or have high crash barriers on the median).

===Victoria===
Victoria uses the term &quot;parkway&quot; to sometimes refer to smaller local access roads that travel through parkland. Unlike other uses of the term, these parkways are not high-speed routes but may still have some degree of limited access.

==Other countries==

Singapore uses the term &quot;parkway&quot; as an alternative to &quot;expressway&quot;. As such, parkways are also dual carriageways with high speed limits and interchanges. The East Coast Parkway is currently the only expressway in Singapore that uses this terminology.

In Russia, long, broad (multi-lane) and beautified thoroughfares are referred to as prospekts.

<doc id="154489" wikidata="Q2487821" url="?curid=154489" title="Bronx River Parkway">
<text>The Bronx River Parkway (sometimes abbreviated as the Bronx Parkway) is a limited-access parkway in downstate New York in the United States. It is named for the nearby Bronx River, which it parallels. The southern terminus of the parkway is at Story Avenue near the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx neighborhood of Soundview. The northern terminus is at Kensico Circle in North Castle, Westchester County, where the parkway connects to the Taconic State Parkway and via a short connector, New York State Route 22 (NY 22). Within the Bronx, the parkway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation and is designated New York State Route 907H (NY 907H), an unsigned reference route. In Westchester County, the parkway is maintained by the Westchester County Department of Public Works and is designated unsigned County Route 9987 (CR 9987).

Most of the exits on the parkway, including the traffic light-controlled intersections in Westchester County, have interchange numbers. The term &quot;Bronx River Parkway&quot; originally referred to the Bronx River Reservation, New York&#x27;s first linear park, of which the road is a portion, from the Bronx–Westchester county line to Kensico Dam Plaza. Current usage of the term is confined to the roadway, but extends it to the portion which now continues southward beyond the Reservation. Its northern terminus ends with a rotary near the Kensico Dam with exits for the Taconic State Parkway and NY 22.

==Route description==
The southern third of the parkway, in the Bronx, is exclusively controlled-access. It serves as a commuter route, intersecting several major east–west routes. Halfway through the borough it begins to closely parallel the Harlem Line of Metro-North Railroad, a pairing which continues to the road&#x27;s northern terminus.

In Westchester County, the road continues to have the same character until the Sprain Brook Parkway splits off at Bronxville, allowing most through traffic to bypass White Plains. The stretches north of that junction have more of the original park character, and are still used that way. North of White Plains, all interchanges are at-grade intersections with traffic lights.

===The Bronx===
The parkway begins at Story Avenue in the neighborhood of Soundview in the Bronx, where two roadways merge near Metcalf and Morrison Avenues. Immediately to the north is the cloverleaf interchange at the Bruckner Expressway (Interstate 278 or I-278), where most traffic enters the parkway, which begins as a six-lane freeway. Basketball courts and baseball fields flank the highway in the strip of parkland as the road leads to the north, slightly northwestward. North of Watson Avenue, within a half-mile (1 km) of the southern terminus, an on-ramp carries northbound traffic from Metcalf. The corresponding offramp for southbound traffic merges onto Harrod Avenue north of Westchester Avenue.

Now in West Farms, the Bronx River Parkway has an onramp to the southbound lanes from East 174th Street. North of it is exit 4, the interchange with the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95). The single ramp of exit 5 allows southbound traffic to follow East 177th Street to NY 895 (Sheridan Boulevard) and the Triborough Bridge. North of the interchange the road veers to the northeast slightly and crosses the railroad tracks of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor line. At East 180th Street, the linear park ends temporarily. The road becomes elevated to cross the East 180th Street Yard along the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT White Plains Road Line, which carries the , as well as the former New York, Westchester and Boston Railway. After crossing the yard, wooded surroundings resume as the parkway follows the eastern edge of the Bronx Zoo in the Bronx Park neighborhood and the Bronx River, which gives the road its name, begins to follow it on the west. On the northbound side, as it enters the park, is an unnumbered exit allowing authorized vehicles (like those of people working at the NYC Parks Department) access to local streets via Birchall Avenue.

A quarter-mile to the north is the main exit for the zoo at Boston Road, with access to Boston Road (U.S. Route 1 or US 1 northbound) for northbound traffic, then the full cloverleaf at Pelham Parkway, where traffic can join US 1 southbound on Fordham Road. Past the exit the large wooded area on the west is the New York Botanical Garden, a National Historic Landmark (NHL). One half-mile (1 km) further north, exit 8 allows access to the Mosholu Parkway and Allerton Avenue. At the next exit, Gun Hill Road, the Williamsbridge station serving that neighborhood on Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, which closely parallels the parkway from this point on, is located immediately west of the highway. The railroad tracks join the river and the parkland in paralleling the road north as it continues straight along the east edge of Woodlawn Cemetery, another NHL.

Almost a mile and a half () to the north, the Woodlawn station is located at the northeast corner of the cemetery next to the East 233rd Street exit. The highway bends left and then right again, crossing the river and the railroad, near the split along the tracks between the Harlem and New Haven lines immediately north of the station. After the curves, the Bronx River Parkway crosses the county line into Westchester County at the McLean Avenue/Nereid Avenue overpass and leaves the Bronx.

===Westchester County===
Once across the county line the parkway is in Yonkers, close to its boundary with Mount Vernon. A southbound exit, 10C, serves Bronx River Road at Wakefield Avenue near that train station a quarter-mile (500 m) north of the county line, even though the station is in the Bronx and the Harlem Line enters Westchester north of it. Northound traffic has 10A, for Mount Vernon Avenue and Yonkers Avenue at the Mount Vernon West station three-quarters of a mile () to the north. Another southbound exit, 10B, serves Bronx River Road just to the north at its Mile Square Road and Winfred Avenue intersections. The park widens around the highway as it bends slightly, heading even more to the northeast. Just past this is exit 11, the Cross County Parkway, where the road swings toward the east to allow space for the complex of onramps that also allow access to Broad Street and the Fleetwood station. A half-mile north of that junction, the parkland and the roadway narrow as Bronxville becomes the community on the opposite side of the Bronx River.

The parkway reaches an interchange with the southern terminus of the Sprain Brook Parkway and becomes a four-lane expressway, turning sharply to the northwest, away from the Harlem Line. The exit numbers reset here; the new exit 1, Paxton Avenue in Bronxville, is on the northbound lanes just north of the Sprain (exit 1A allows southbound traffic to leave the parkway for Desmond Avenue just before merging). Exit 2, West Pondfield Road, also northbound-only, is a thousand feet (300 m) to the north as the highway curves around downtown Bronxville to the east. Here, the road runs through the Armour Villa neighborhood until it runs under the Tuckahoe Road bridge. Almost a mile (1.6 km) separates it from the next exit, at Elm Street in Tuckahoe. The park continues to parallel the parkway, with paved bike paths and a large pond. A thousand feet to the north, Scarsdale Road is the first at-grade interchange, and the parkway turns sharply to the east, then back to the northeast more gradually. Exit 8, Thompson Street, serves the nearby Crestwood station as the Harlem Line&#x27;s tracks begin to parallel the road again. Another three-quarter mile north, after the road has resumed its northeast course, comes the next at-grade exit, Leewood Drive, on the northbound side.

A quarter-mile (500 m) to the north are abandoned parking lots on both sides that were once gas stations. One-tenth of a mile (150 m) to the north, the roadways diverge and the river runs between them. Just beyond this is another at-grade interchange, Harney and Strathmore Roads. The roadways remain apart through a wooded section as they curve westward for the next three-quarter mile, returning to the highway&#x27;s northeastern heading as it leaves Yonkers and briefly enters Greenburgh south of the southbound Ardsley Road exit east of downtown Scarsdale. Just after it curves eastward again and crosses the Harlem Line, entering Scarsdale, traffic can enter and exit at Crane Road and East Parkway with southbound traffic using a light to cross over the northbound lanes and no entrance onto the southbound lanes. In the next stretch, there are exits for Ogden and Butler Roads from the northbound lanes. Fenimore Road, just east of the Hartsdale and its train station, is a northbound exit with southbound entry. Just to its north, southbound traffic can exit onto Greenacres Avenue. The parkway begins heading even more to the northeast, the tracks immediately adjacent, past northbound exits for River and Claremont roads.

Just north of the latter exit, the highway enters White Plains, the Westchester county seat. After the northbound Walworth crossing exit, it turns northwest across the river and the tracks and then resumes its northeasterly course. A half-mile (1 km) north it reaches the Main Street (NY 119) northbound exit/southbound entrance, just west of the White Plains station on the west side of heavily developed downtown White Plains. It bends north and then northwest to the first of several at-grade intersections with traffic lights, also signed and numbered as exits, with Central Avenue (NY 100), at the Westchester County Center. From here, parkway traffic is also directed toward the nearby Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287) via NY 119, as the parkway has no direct interchange with it.

The two roadways once again diverge, becoming almost apart in the half-mile (1 km) before they converge again as they reach the Old Tarrytown Road intersection just north of the expressway. Beyond it the parkway goes due north before curving slightly into the Fisher Lane intersection just west of the last Metro-North station along the parkway, North White Plains. The Parkway Homes and Virginia Road intersections follow, spaced roughly a thousand feet (300 m) apart. Another thousand feet from that intersection, the highway turns to the northeast again as the roadways diverge and cross the Harlem Line and the Bronx River for the last time. Northbound traffic has the last exit, exit 27, onto Washington Avenue North. Kensico Dam is visible in the distance as the parkway reaches its northern terminus at Kensico Circle, southern terminus of the Taconic State Parkway, also listed on the Register.

A seven-mile (11 km) section of the Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County south of White Plains is closed to motorist traffic from 10 AM to 2 PM select Sundays in May, June, September and October (with the exception of Memorial and Labor Day weekends), allowing bicyclists to venture along the scenic road. Another section north of the one reserved for bicyclists is reserved for inline skating. This program is sponsored by Con Edison and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

==History==

Construction began in Westchester County in 1907, making it the earliest limited-access highway to start construction. However, although construction on the Long Island Motor Parkway began a year later, a section of the Long Island road opened for traffic before the end of 1908, opening before the Bronx River Parkway as the first limited-access highway to be put into use. Neither was up to current freeway standards, utilizing left turns across the opposing direction at access points. The Bronx River Parkway was the first highway to utilize a median strip to separate the opposing lanes, the first highway constructed through a park, and the first highway where intersecting streets crossed over bridges. Construction on the remainder of the portion in Westchester began in 1917, after almost a decade of delays. The first of this opened in 1922, with the last opened in 1925. This officially competed the highway as originally designed.

On January 1, 1926, with he parkway completed, maintenance of the Westchester County portion was transferred to the recently created Westchester County Parks Commission, while the Bronx portion had its maintenance transferred to the city of New York.

In 1927, the intersections with Palmer Road, Pondfield Road, Tuckahoe Road, and Ardsley Road were replaced by overpasses.

The intersection with Dewitt Avenue was known to be a safety hazard towards pedestrians since its opening. However, it would take until a person was killed in 1930 that a pedestrian operated traffic signal was installed. It was a success, as most pedestrians used it and drivers obeyed it.

In 1929, construction began on a northern extension of the road to the Croton Reservoir. In April 1931 steam shovels finally broke ground at Shrub Oak for the section built in Putnam County. Roosevelt and Moses both spoke at the ceremony, the former suggesting he still planned for the parkway to one day reach Canada. Eight months later the two rivals were at the north portal of the triple-hinged steel suspension bridge built over the reservoir, at the longest of that type in the world at the time, for the ribbon cutting ceremony. The next day, 20,000 cars took the new road from the city into the Manhattan Hills. Along the way were public picnic grounds in three areas, and of bridle paths in the median strip. 

From 1927 to 1933, the East 233rd Street intersection was replaced by an interchange in order to increase capacity.

Rest stops along the portion in Wescaster County were opened to traffic from 1930 to 1935 in an effort to better serve traveler needs. Two were right hand facilitates serving eastbound or westbound traffic only, while the other was a left hand facility serving both directions.

The road’s northern terminus was truncated to NY 22 in 1941, with the existing portion replaced by an extension of the Taconic State Parkway. 

A widening to six lanes and extension southward to the Bruckner Boulevard was considered starting after World War II. Construction began in 1948, and was completed on January 6, 1951.

In 1953, reconstruction and widening to six lanes began the segment between Bronxville and the Bronx. During this reconstruction period, a new overpass was built to serve the Cross County Parkway, with the ramps rebuilt into a partial cloverleaf interchange. Intersections in the area were also replaced by overpasses or grade separated interchanges. This was completed in February 1955.

In 1955, reconstruction and widening to six lanes began at the half mile stretch of the Parkway between the Woodland Viaduct and Scarsdale line. This was in part done to eliminate sharp dips and twists that had a negative effect on drivers. Work was completed in 1956. 

In 1957, over 4,000 trees and shrubs were painted, lawns developed, and new rustic fences installed. This was done due to criticism by some that previous construction ruined the landscape. 

In 1960, the exit and entrance on the northbound side between exits 5 and 6 in the Bronx, and an associated U-turn from southbound to northbound, was restricted to use only by police officers or employees of the Parks Departmet. This was to increase safety.

From 1960 to 1964, the portion between Tuckatoe Road and the Park Avenue Viaduct was rebuilt and widened to six lanes.

The portion in Butler Woods was reconstructed to eliminate sharp dips and twists as well as widened to six lanes, from 1967 to 1969. This was to eliminate negative impacts on drivers.

The rest area serving eastbound traffic only was reconstructed in 1972 after being damaged by a flood.

In the late 1960s, plans were made to extend the road southward to Soundview Park. However, this was canceled in 1974.

The interchange with the Cross County Parkway originally did not provide direct access to and from both directions of either. This was until that roads widening allowed the addition of extra ramps. Work was completed in 1978.

A pair of former rest areas on the outer margins of the roadway in Westchester near Crestwood, the southbound one is currently being used as a Westchester County Police Sub-Station, and the northbound used only as a tourist information stand. A rest stop formerly served both directions between Bronx exits 7 and 8. It was destroyed by a fire. Rather than being rebuilt, it was demolished, with the median in the area rebuilt. Both closed in 1980.

In 1991, 13 miles of road were added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The portion between the Westcheaster County line and northern terminus was designated as a New York Scenic Byway in 1992.

From 1992 to 1995, the first 3 miles of road was reconstructed an widened to six lanes. This was done to increase safety and reduce deterioration.

In 1995, it was discovered that the Woodland Viaduct was in a severe state of disrepair. Because of this, from 1997 to 2000, the structure was extensively rehabilitated. Also as part of this, a nearby portion of the mainline was rebuilt.

In 2009, the exit to Oak Street in Yonkers was closed and a new exit onto Yonkers Avenue was opened a block to the south. 

After seven people died in an accident, improved median barriers were added to three viaducts along the road in 2012.

In 2012, a reconstruction project began on the portion in Scarsdale. This invoked widening lane width, installing guardrails, and reconstructing bridges. Work was completed in 2015.

In 2024, a new safety system was introduced to easily close low lying portions of the road in the event of a flood.

===Westchester designation===
The southernmost portion of the parkway in Westchester, south of the Sprain, is internally designated as NY 907G, an unsigned reference route, in apparent violation of the numbering standard. Ordinarily, the second digit should be the region. New York City and Long Island, regions 10 and 11, share 0; Westchester is region 8 (the Hutchinson River Parkway also shares this oddity). The section south of here is marked only with reference markers, and the section north only with county mileposts. This middle section has county mileposts in the middle, and reference markers with state mileposts (counting from the southern terminus in the Bronx, not the city line) alongside. However, Reference Route 907G is no longer listed in the NYSDOT traffic counts and the entirety of the parkway in the county is considered a county route by Westchester County.

The parkway was documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in 2001. Drawings and photographs from the documentation project were made available through the Westchester County Archives, winning an award of excellence from the Lower Hudson Conference.

<doc id="154490" wikidata="Q2246615" url="?curid=154490" title="Battle of Brunanburh">
<text>The Battle of Brunanburh was fought in 937 between Æthelstan, King of England, and an alliance of Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin; Constantine II, King of Scotland; and Owain, King of Strathclyde. The battle is sometimes cited as the point of origin for English national identity: historians such as Michael Livingston argue that &quot;the men who fought and died on that field forged a political map of the future that remains, arguably making the Battle of Brunanburh one of the most significant battles in the long history not just of England, but of the whole of the British Isles.&quot;

Following an unchallenged invasion of Scotland by Æthelstan in 934, possibly launched because Constantine had violated a peace treaty, it became apparent that Æthelstan could be defeated only by an alliance of his enemies. Olaf led Constantine and Owen in the alliance. In August 937 Olaf and his army sailed from Dublin to join forces with Constantine and Owen, but they were routed in the battle against Æthelstan. The poem &quot;Battle of Brunanburh&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recounts that there were &quot;never yet as many people killed before this with sword&#x27;s edge ... since the east Angles and Saxons came up over the broad sea&quot;.

Æthelstan&#x27;s victory preserved the unity of England. The historian Æthelweard wrote around 975 that &quot;[t]he fields of Britain were consolidated into one, there was peace everywhere, and abundance of all things&quot;. Alfred Smyth has called the battle &quot;the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before Hastings&quot;. The site of the battle is unknown; many possible locations have been proposed by scholars.

==Background==

After Æthelstan defeated the Vikings at York in 927, King Constantine of Scotland, King Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, Ealdred I of Bamburgh, and King Owen I of Strathclyde (or Morgan ap Owain of Gwent) accepted Æthelstan&#x27;s overlordship at Eamont, near Penrith. Æthelstan became King of England and there was peace until 934.

Æthelstan invaded Scotland with a large military and naval force in 934. Although the reason for this invasion is uncertain, John of Worcester stated that the cause was Constantine&#x27;s violation of the peace treaty made in 927. Æthelstan evidently travelled through Beverley, Ripon, and Chester-le-Street. The army harassed the Scots up to Kincardineshire and the navy up to Caithness, but Æthelstan&#x27;s force was never engaged.

Following the invasion of Scotland, it became apparent that Æthelstan could only be defeated by an allied force of his enemies. The leader of the alliance was Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin, joined by Constantine II, King of Scotland and Owen, King of Strathclyde. (According to John of Worcester, Constantine was Olaf&#x27;s father-in-law.) Though they had all been enemies in living memory, historian Michael Livingston points out that &quot;they had agreed to set aside whatever political, cultural, historical, and even religious differences they might have had in order to achieve one common purpose: to destroy Æthelstan&quot;.

In August 937, Olaf sailed from Dublin with his army to join forces with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston&#x27;s opinion this suggests that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia.

Livingston thinks that the invading armies entered England in two waves, Constantine and Owen coming from the north, possibly engaging in some skirmishes with Æthelstan&#x27;s forces as they followed the Roman road across the Lancashire plains between Carlisle and Manchester, with Olaf&#x27;s forces joining them on the way. Deakin argues against a western passage for the coalition army by demonstrating that on the few occasions Scottish armies had crossed into England, they had used the Stainmore Pass or Dere Street and were engaged in battle to the east of the Pennines. Livingston speculates that the battle site at Brunanburh was chosen in agreement with Æthelstan, on which &quot;there would be one fight, and to the victor went England&quot;.

==Battle==
The battle resulted in an overwhelming victory for Æthelstan&#x27;s army. The main source of information is the poem &quot;Battle of Brunanburh&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. After travelling north through Mercia, Æthelstan&#x27;s army met the invading forces at Brunanburh. In a battle that lasted all day, the English finally forced them to break up and flee. There was probably a prolonged period of hard fighting before the invaders were finally defeated. According to the poem, the English &quot;clove the shield-wall, hacked the war-lime, with hammers&#x27;s leavings&quot;. &quot;There lay many a soldier of the men of the north, shot over shield, taken by spears, likewise Scottish also, sated, weary of war&quot;. Wood states that all large battles were described in this manner, so the description in the poem is not unique to Brunanburh.

Æthelstan and his army pursued the invaders until the end of the day, slaying great numbers of enemy troops. Olaf fled and sailed back to Dublin with the remnants of his army and Constantine escaped to Scotland; Owain&#x27;s fate is not mentioned. According to the poem: &quot;Then the Northmen, bloody survivors of darts, disgraced in spirit, departed on Ding&#x27;s Mere, in nailed boats over deep water, to seek out Dublin, and their [own] land again.&quot; Never has there been greater slaughter &quot;since the Angles and Saxons came here from the east...seized the country&quot;.

The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; describe the battle as &quot;great, lamentable and horrible&quot; and record that &quot;several thousands of Norsemen ... fell&quot;. Among the casualties were five kings and seven earls from Olaf&#x27;s army. The poem records that Constantine lost several friends and family members in the battle, including his son. The largest list of those killed in the battle is contained in the &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;, which names several kings and princes. A large number of English also died in the battle, including two of Æthelstan&#x27;s cousins, Ælfwine and Æthelwine.

==Medieval sources==
The battle of Brunanburh is mentioned or alluded to in over forty Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Norman and Norse medieval texts.

One of the earliest and most informative sources is the Old English poem &quot;Battle of Brunanburh&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (version A), which was written within two decades of the battle. The poem relates that Æthelstan and Edmund&#x27;s army of West Saxons and Mercians fought at Brunanburh against the Vikings under Anlaf (i.e. Olaf Guthfrithson) and the Scots under Constantine. After a fierce battle lasting all day, five young kings, seven of Anlaf&#x27;s earls, and countless others were killed in the greatest slaughter since the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Anlaf and a small band of men escaped by ship over &quot;Dingesmere&quot; (or Ding&#x27;s Mere) to Dublin. Constantine&#x27;s son was killed, and Constantine fled home.

Another very early source, the Irish &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, calls the battle &quot;a huge war, lamentable and horrible&quot;. It notes Anlaf&#x27;s return to Dublin with a few men the following year, associated with an event in the spring.

In its only entry for 937, the mid/late 10th-century Welsh chronicle &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; laconically states &quot;war at Brune&quot;.

Æthelweard&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; (ca. 980) says that the battle at &quot;Brunandune&quot; was still known as &quot;the great war&quot; to that day, and no enemy fleet had attacked the country since.

Eadmer of Canterbury&#x27;s &quot;Vita Odonis&quot; (very late 11th century) is one of at least six medieval sources to recount Oda of Canterbury&#x27;s involvement in a miraculous restitution of Æthelstan&#x27;s sword at the height of the battle.

William Ketel&#x27;s &quot;De Miraculis Sancti Joannis Beverlacensis&quot; (early 12th century) relates how, in 937, Æthelstan left his army on his way north to fight the Scots at Brunanburh, and went to visit the tomb of Bishop John at Beverley to ask for his prayers in the forthcoming battle. In thanksgiving for his victory, Æthelstan gave certain privileges and rights to the church at Beverley.

According to Symeon of Durham&#x27;s &quot;Libellus de exordio&quot; (1104–15):
:::…in the year 937 of the Lord´s Nativity, at Wendune which is called by another name Et Brunnanwerc or Brunnanbyrig, he [Æthelstan] fought against Anlaf, son of former king Guthfrith, who came with 615 ships and had with him the help of the Scots and the Cumbrians.

John of Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot; (early 12th century) was an influential source for later authors and compilers.
It corresponds closely to the description of the battle in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but adds that:
:::Anlaf, the pagan king of the Irish and many other islands, incited by his father-in-law Constantine, king of the Scots, entered the mouth of the River Humber with a strong fleet.

Another influential work, &quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot; by William of Malmesbury (1127) adds the detail that Æthelstan &quot;purposely held back&quot;, letting Anlaf advance &quot;far into England&quot;. Michael Wood argues that, in a twelfth-century context, &quot;far into England&quot; could mean anywhere in southern Northumbria or the North Midlands. William of Malmesbury further states that Æthelstan raised 100,000 soldiers. He is at variance with Symeon of Durham in calling Anlaf &quot;son of Sihtric” and asserting that Constantine himself had been slain.

Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; (1133) adds the detail that Danes living in England had joined Anlaf&#x27;s army. Michael Wood argues that this, together with a similar remark in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, suggests that Anlaf and his allies had established themselves in a centre of Anglo-Scandinavian power prior to the battle.

The mid-12th century text &quot;Estoire des Engleis&quot;, by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, says that Æthelstan defeated the Scots, men of Cumberland, Welsh and Picts at &quot;Bruneswerce&quot;.

The &quot;Chronica de Mailros&quot; (1173–4) repeats Symeon of Durham&#x27;s information that Anlaf arrived with 615 ships, but adds that he entered the mouth of the river Humber.

&quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; is an Icelandic saga written in Old Norse in 1220–40, which recounts a battle at &quot;Vínheidi&quot; (Vin-heath) by &quot;Vínuskóga&quot; (Vin-wood); it is generally accepted that this refers to the Battle of Brunanburh. Egil&#x27;s Saga contains information not found in other sources, such as military engagements prior to the battle, Æthelstan&#x27;s use of Viking mercenaries, the topology of the battlefield, the position of Anlaf&#x27;s and Æthelstan&#x27;s headquarters, and the tactics and unfolding of events during the battle. Historians such as Sarah Foot argue that Egil&#x27;s Saga may contain elements of truth but is not an historically reliable narrative.

Pseudo-Ingulf&#x27;s &quot;Ingulfi Croylandensis Historia&quot; (ca. 1400) recounts that:
The &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot; (an early medieval Irish chronicle of unknown date that survives only in an English translation from 1627) states that:
:::Awley [i.e. Anlaf], with all the Danes of Dublin and north part of Ireland, departed and went overseas. The Danes that departed from Dublin arrived in England, &amp; by the help of the Danes of that kingdom, they gave battle to the Saxons on the plaines of othlyn, where there was a great slaughter of Normans and Danes.
The &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot; records 34,800 Viking and Scottish casualties, including Ceallagh the prince of Scotland (Constantine&#x27;s son) and nine other named men.

==Aftermath==
Æthelstan&#x27;s victory prevented the dissolution of England, and Foot writes that &quot;[e]xaggerating the importance of this victory is difficult&quot;. Livingston writes that the battle was &quot;the moment when Englishness came of age&quot; and &quot;one of the most significant battles in the long history not just of England but of the whole of the British isles&quot;. The battle was called &quot;the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before the Hastings&quot; by Alfred Smyth, who nonetheless says its consequences beyond Æthelstan&#x27;s reign have been overstated.

Alex Woolf describes it as a pyrrhic victory for Æthelstan: the campaign against the northern alliance ended in a stalemate, his &quot;imperium&quot; appears to have declined, and after he died in 939 Olaf acceded to the Kingdom of Northumbria without resistance. In 954 the Northumbrians finally submitted to southern kingship and expelled Eric Bloodaxe.

==Location==

The location of the battlefield is unknown and has been the subject of lively debate among historians since at least the 17th century. Over forty locations have been proposed, from the southwest of England to Scotland, although most historians agree that a location in Northern England is the most plausible.

Wirral Archaeology, a local volunteer group, believes that it may have identified the site of the battle near Bromborough on the Wirral. They found a field with a heavy concentration of artifacts which may be a result of metal working in a tenth-century army camp. The location of the field is being kept secret to protect it from nighthawks. As of 2020, they are seeking funds to pursue their research further. The military historian Michael Livingston argues in his 2021 book &quot;Never Greater Slaughter&quot; that Wirral Archaeology&#x27;s case for Bromborough is conclusive, but this claim is criticised in a review of the book by Thomas Williams. He accepts that Bromborough is the only surviving place name which originates in Old English &quot;Brunanburh&quot;, but says that there could have been others. He comments that evidence of military metal working is unsurprising in an area of Viking activity: it is not evidence for a battle, let alone any particular battle. In an article in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; in 2022, Michael Deakin questions the philological case for Bromborough as &quot;Brunanburh&quot;, suggesting that the first element in the name is &#x27;brown&#x27; and not &#x27;Bruna&#x27;. Bromborough would therefore be &#x27;the brown [stone-built] manor or fort&#x27;. The corollary of this argument being the early names of Bromborough cannot be derived from Old English &quot;Brunanburh&quot;. Michael Wood (historian), in an article in Notes and Queries in 2017, discusses the alternative spelling &quot;Brunnanburh&quot; &#x27;the burh at the spring or stream&#x27;, found in several Anglo-Saxon Chronicle manuscripts.

The medieval texts employ a plethora of alternative names for the site of the battle, which historians have attempted to link to known places. The earliest relevant document is the “&quot;Battle of Brunanburh&quot;” poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (version A), written within two decades of the battle, which names the battlefield location as “&quot;ymbe Brunanburh&quot;” (around Brunanburh). Many other medieval sources contain variations on the name Brunanburh, such as &quot;Brune&quot;, &quot;Brunandune&quot;, &quot;Et Brunnanwerc&quot;, &quot;Bruneford&quot;, &quot;Cad Dybrunawc&quot; &quot;Duinbrunde&quot; and &quot;Brounnyngfelde&quot;.

It is thought that the recurring element &quot;Brun-&quot; could be a personal name, a river name, or the Old English or Old Norse word for a spring or stream. Less mystery surrounds the suffixes &quot;–burh/–werc, -dun, -ford&quot; and &quot;–feld, &quot;which are the Old English words for a fortification, low hill, ford, and open land respectively.

Not all the place-names contain the &quot;Brun-&quot; element, however. Symeon of Durham (early 12th C) gives the alternative name &quot;Weondune&quot; (or &quot;Wendune&quot;) for the battle site, while the Annals of Clonmacnoise say the battle took place on the “&quot;plaines of othlyn&quot;” Egil&#x27;s Saga names the locations &quot;Vínheiðr&quot; and &quot;Vínuskóga&quot;.

Few medieval texts refer to a known place, although the Humber estuary is mentioned by several sources. John of Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; (early 12th C), Symeon of Durham&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum&quot; (mid-12th C), the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; (late 12th C) and Robert Mannyng of Brunne&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1338) all state that Olaf&#x27;s fleet entered the mouth of the Humber, while Robert of Gloucester&#x27;s &quot;Metrical Chronicle&quot; (late 13th C) says the invading army arrived &quot;south of the Humber&quot;. Peter of Langtoft&#x27;s &quot;Chronique&quot; (ca. 1300) states the armies met at “&quot;Bruneburgh on the Humber&quot;”, while Robert Mannyng of Brunne&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1338) claims the battle was fought at “&quot;Brunesburgh on Humber&quot;”. Pseudo-Ingulf (ca. 1400) says that as Æthelstan led his army into Northumbria (i.e. north of the Humber) he met on his way many pilgrims coming home from Beverley. Hector Boece&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; (1527) claims that the battle was fought by the River Ouse, which flows into the Humber estuary.

Few other geographical hints are contained in the medieval sources. The poem in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; says that the invaders fled over deep water on &quot;Dingesmere&quot;, perhaps meaning an area of the Irish Sea or an unidentified lake or river. Deakin noted that the term &quot;ding&quot; had been used in the Old English Andreas (poem) where it is suggested to have been used metaphorically for a grave and/or Hell. His analysis of the context of lines 53–56 of the &quot;Brunanburh&quot; poem suggest to him that &quot;dingesmere&quot; is a poetic and figurative term for the sea.

Egil&#x27;s Saga contains more detailed topographical information than any of the other medieval texts, although its usefulness as historical evidence is disputed. According to this account, Olaf&#x27;s army occupied an unnamed fortified town north of a heath, with large inhabited areas nearby. Æthelstan&#x27;s camp was pitched to the south of Olaf, between a river on one side and a forest on raised ground on the other, to the north of another unnamed town at several hours&#x27; ride from Olaf&#x27;s camp.

<text>In ancient times, Armorica or Aremorica (Gaulish: ; ; ) was a region of Gaul between the Seine and the Loire that includes the Brittany Peninsula, and much of historical Normandy.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Armorica&quot; is a Latinized form of the Gaulish toponym , which literally means &#x27;place in front of the sea&#x27;. It is formed with the prefix &quot;are&quot;- (&#x27;in front of&#x27;) attached to -&quot;mori&quot;- (&#x27;sea&#x27;) and the feminine suffix &quot;-(i)cā&quot;, denoting the localization (or provenance). The inhabitants of the region were called &quot;Aremorici&quot; ( &quot;Aremoricos&quot;), formed with the stem &quot;are-mori&quot;- extended by the determinative suffix -&quot;cos&quot;. It is glossed by the Latin &quot;antemarini&quot; in Endlicher&#x27;s Glossary. The Slavs use a similar formation, &quot;Po-mor-jane&quot; (&#x27;those in front of the sea&#x27;), to designate the inhabitants of Pomerania. The Latin adjective &quot;Armoricani&quot; was an administrative term designating in particular a sector of the Roman defence line in Gaul in Late Antiquity, the &quot;Tractus Armoricani&quot; (&#x27;Armorican Tract&#x27;).

In medieval Insular Celtic languages, the Celtic term &quot;*Litauia&quot;, meaning &#x27;Land&#x27; or &#x27;Country&#x27; (from an original Proto-Celtic &#x27;Earth&#x27;, &#x27;the Vast One&#x27;), came to be used to designate the Brittany Peninsula, as in Old Irish &quot;,&quot; Old Welsh , Old Breton , or in the Latinized form . 

In Breton, which belongs to the Brythonic branch of the Insular Celtic languages, along with Welsh and Cornish, &quot;on [the] sea&quot; is &quot;war vor&quot; (Welsh &quot;ar fôr&quot;, &quot;f&quot; being voiced and pronounced like English &quot;v&quot;), but the older form &quot;arvor&quot; is used to refer to the coastal regions of Brittany, in contrast to &quot;argoad&quot; (&quot;ar&quot; &quot;on/at&quot;, &quot;coad&quot; &quot;forest&quot; [Welsh &quot;ar goed&quot; or &quot;coed&quot; &quot;trees&quot;]) for the inland regions. The cognate modern usages suggest that the Romans first contacted coastal people in the inland region and assumed that the regional name &quot;Aremorica&quot; referred to the whole area, both coastal and inland.

== History ==
Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Natural History&quot; (4.17.105), claims that Armorica was the older name for &quot;Aquitania&quot; and states Armorica&#x27;s southern boundary extended to the Pyrenees. Taking into account the Gaulish origin of the name, that is perfectly correct and logical, as Aremorica is not a country name but a word that describes a type of geographical region, one that is by the sea. Pliny lists the following Celtic tribes as living in the area: the Aedui and Carnuteni as having treaties with Rome; the Meldi and Secusiani as having some measure of independence; and the Boii, Senones, Aulerci (both the Eburovices and Cenomani), the Parisii, Tricasses, Andicavi, Viducasses, Bodiocasses, Veneti, Coriosvelites, Diablinti, Rhedones, Turones, and the Atseui.

Trade between Armorica and Britain, described by Diodorus Siculus and implied by Pliny was long-established. Because, even after the campaign of Publius Crassus in 56 BC, continued resistance to Roman rule in Armorica was still being supported by Celtic aristocrats in Britain. Julius Caesar led two invasions of Britain, in 55 BC, and again in 54 BC, in response. Some hint of the complicated cultural web that bound Armorica and the Britanniae (the &quot;Britains&quot; of Pliny) is given by Caesar when he describes Diviciacus of the Suessiones as &quot;the most powerful ruler in the whole of Gaul, who had control not only over a large area of this region but also of Britain&quot; Archaeological sites along the south coast of England, notably at Hengistbury Head, show connections with Armorica as far east as the Solent. This &#x27;prehistoric&#x27; connection of Cornwall and Brittany set the stage for the link that continued into the medieval era. Still farther East, however, the typical Continental connections of the Britannic coast were with the lower Seine valley instead.


Archaeology has not yet been as enlightening in Iron-Age Armorica as the coinage, which has been surveyed by Philip de Jersey.

Under the Roman Empire, Armorica was administered as part of the province of Gallia Lugdunensis, which had its capital in Lugdunum, (modern day Lyon). When the Roman provinces were reorganized in the 4th century, Armorica (&quot;Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus&quot;) was placed under the second and third divisions of Lugdunensis. After the legions retreated from Britannia (407 AD) the local elite there expelled the civilian magistrates in the following year; Armorica too rebelled in the 430s and again in the 440s, throwing out the ruling officials, as the Romano-Britons had done. At the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 a Roman coalition led by General Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic King Theodoric I clashed violently with the Hunnic alliance commanded by King Attila the Hun. Jordanes lists Aëtius&#x27; allies as including Armoricans and other Celtic or German tribes (Getica 36.191).

The &quot;Armorican&quot; peninsula came to be settled with Britons from Britain during the poorly documented period of the 5th–7th centuries. Even in distant Byzantium Procopius heard tales of migrations to the Frankish mainland from the island, largely legendary for him, of &quot;Brittia&quot;. These settlers, whether refugees or not, made the presence felt of their coherent groups in the naming of the westernmost, Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica, Cornouaille (&quot;Cornwall&quot;) and Domnonea (&quot;Devon&quot;). These settlements are associated with leaders like Saints Samson of Dol and Pol Aurelian, among the &quot;founder saints&quot; of Brittany.

The linguistic origins of Breton are clear: it is a Brythonic language descended from the Celtic British language, like Welsh and Cornish one of the Insular Celtic languages, brought by these migrating Britons. Still, questions of the relations between the Celtic &quot;cultures&quot; of Britain— Cornish and Welsh—and Celtic Breton are far from settled. Martin Henig (2003) suggests that in Armorica as in sub-Roman Britain:

There was a fair amount of creation of identity in the migration period. We know that the mixed, but largely British and Frankish population of Kent repackaged themselves as &#x27;Jutes&#x27;, and the largely British populations in the lands east of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) seem to have ended up as &#x27;West Saxons&#x27;. In western Armorica, the small élite which managed to impose an identity on the population happened to be British rather than &#x27;Gallo-Roman&#x27; in origin, so they became Bretons. The process may have been essentially the same.&quot;

According to C. E. V. Nixon, the collapse of Roman power and the depredations of the Visigoths led Armorica to act &quot;like a magnet to peasants, &quot;coloni&quot;, slaves and the hard-pressed&quot; who deserted other Roman territories, further weakening them.

Vikings settled in the Cotentin peninsula and the lower Seine around Rouen in the ninth and early tenth centuries and, as these regions came to be known as &quot;Normandy&quot;, the name &quot;Armorica&quot; fell out of use in the area. With western Armorica having already evolved into &quot;Brittany&quot;, the east was recast from a Frankish viewpoint as the Breton March under a Frankish margrave.

==In popular culture==
The home village of the fictional comic-book hero Asterix was located in Armorica during the Roman Republic; there, &quot;indomitable Gauls&quot; hold out against Rome. The unnamed village was reported as having been discovered by archaeologists in a spoof article in the British &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper on April Fool&#x27;s Day in 1993. The opening chapter of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce also refers to North Armorica.

<text>The Long Island Motor Parkway, also known as the Vanderbilt Parkway, Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, or Motor Parkway, was a limited-access parkway on Long Island, New York, United States. It was the first highway designed for automobile use only. The parkway was privately built by William Kissam Vanderbilt II with overpasses and bridges to remove most intersections. It officially opened on October 10, 1908. It closed in 1938 when it was taken over by the state of New York in lieu of back taxes. Parts of the parkway survive today, used as sections of other roads or as a bicycle trail.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, was an auto-racing enthusiast and created the Vanderbilt Cup, the first major road racing competition, in 1904. He ran the races on local roads in Nassau County during the first decade of the 20th century, but the deaths of two spectators and injury to many others showed the need to eliminate racing on residential streets. Vanderbilt responded by establishing a company to build a graded, banked and grade-separated highway suitable for racing that was also free of the horse manure dust often churned up by motor cars. The resulting Long Island Motor Parkway, with its banked turns, guard rails, reinforced concrete roadbed, and limited-access, was the first limited-access highway in the world.

The road was originally planned to stretch for in and out of New York City as far as Riverhead, the county seat of Suffolk County and point of division for the north and south forks of Long Island. Only (from Queens in New York City to Lake Ronkonkoma) were constructed, at a cost of $6 million. Construction began in June 1908 (a year after the Bronx River Parkway). On October 10, 1908, a section opened as far as modern Bethpage. It hosted races in 1908 and on the full road in 1909 and 1910, but an accident in the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup, killing two riding mechanics with additional injuries, caused the New York Legislature to ban racing except on race tracks, ending its career as a racing road.

By 1911, the road was extended to Lake Ronkonkoma. Its western stretch was also extended from Great Neck to what is now Fresh Meadows. The Long Island Motor Parkway was the first road designed exclusively for automobile use, the first concrete highway in the United States, and the first to use overpasses and bridges to eliminate intersections.

===AAA Champ Car Venue===
The parkway was used for four American Automobile Association Contest Board Champ Car races. The first one was held on October 30, 1909, and was won by Harry Grant. Three races were held on October 10, 1910, in front of a crowd estimated at 300,000 people. Grant won the main 22-lap event. A 15-lap event was won by Frank Gelnaw, and Bill Endicott won a 10-lap event.

== Access ==

The Long Island Motor Parkway was a limited-access toll road, with access at a small number of toll booths, joined to local roads by short connector roads. Traffic could turn left between the parkway and connectors, crossing oncoming traffic, so it was not a controlled-access highway (or &quot;freeway&quot; as later defined by the federal government&#x27;s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices). Access points were:
*Nassau Boulevard (NY 25D) west of Francis Lewis Boulevard. The right-of-way of Nassau Boulevard was later used for the Long Island Expressway (I-495).
*Hillside Avenue (NY 25B) – Springfield Boulevard south of 77th Avenue
*Great Neck – Lakeville Road south of Lake Road
*Roslyn – Roslyn Road south of Barnyard Lane
*Mineola – Jericho Turnpike (NY 25) at Rudolph Drive
*Garden City – Clinton Road at Vanderbilt Court
*Meadowbrook – Merrick Avenue north of Stewart Avenue
*Bethpage – Hicksville Road (NY 107) south of Avoca Avenue; Round Swamp Road south of Old Bethpage Road
*Melville – Broad Hollow Road (NY 110) north of Spagnoli Road
*Deer Park – Deer Park Road (NY 231)
*East Commack – Commack Spur along Harned Road (CR 14) to Jericho Turnpike (NY 25)
*Brentwood – Washington Avenue
*Ronkonkoma – Rosevale Avenue

When the parkway opened, the toll was set at $2. It was reduced to $1.50 in 1912, $1 in 1917, and 40 cents in 1938. The first six toll houses were designed by architect John Russell Pope, designer of the Jefferson Memorial and the rotunda in the American Museum of Natural History. The toll houses were designed to include living space for the toll collectors so that toll could be collected at all hours. The most prominent remaining toll house is in Garden City. Once located at the junction of Clinton Road and Vanderbilt Court, it was moved in 1989 to 230 Seventh Street, now the headquarters of the Garden City Chamber of Commerce.

== Demise ==

Roadway design advances of the 1920s rendered the road obsolete less than 20 years after construction. At the same time Robert Moses was planning the Northern State Parkway. In 1929, the owners and some Long Island officials proposed that New York State should buy the road and integrate it into the state parkway system, despite its narrow roadway (varying from 16 to 22 feet wide) and steep bridges not meeting new standards. Moses opposed the idea, stating that the Long Island Motor Parkway had been &quot;a white elephant for the last twenty years&quot; and that it would need significant reconstruction to integrate it into the state parkway system.

The completion of the Northern State Parkway signaled the end for the road. In 1937, the portion of the Long Island Motor Parkway in Suffolk County was donated to Suffolk County. In July 1938, the remainder of the parkway&#x27;s land was given to Nassau County and the Long Island State Parks Commission.

== Remaining portions ==

Most of the road in Queens is a bicycle trail from Cunningham Park to Alley Pond Park, part of the Brooklyn–Queens Greenway. It starts at Francis Lewis Boulevard in Cunningham Park. The path runs south, parallel with 199th Street, and crosses a bridge over 73rd Avenue. It turns east toward Francis Lewis Boulevard, crossing it on a bridge. It continues through the park, crossing under the Clearview Expressway through a tunnel, and then over Hollis Hills Terrace on a third bridge before leaving the park. There is access to 209th and 210th Streets in Hollis Hills. It goes through a wooded corridor, soon crossing over Bell Boulevard on a bridge, and provides access to 220th Street just east of Bell Boulevard. After crossing Springfield Boulevard on another bridge, there is access to Cloverdale Boulevard where the main line of the greenway goes north. The road continues as a spur route that enters Alley Pond Park, crosses under the Grand Central Parkway, and provides access to Union Turnpike before ending at Union Turnpike and Winchester Boulevard at the park&#x27;s eastern boundary.

The Nassau County roadway has been redeveloped, or turned into a right of way for Long Island Power Authority transmission lines. A small section of the roadway remains in Lake Success in Great Neck, though unmarked and not open to the public. Most of this section is currently within the property of Great Neck South High School. The adjacent former Great Neck toll house was incorporated into the building of a private house.

Another section may be seen on either side of Willis Avenue on the boundary between Albertson and Wiliston Park. On the east side of the avenue, several hundred yards of road provide access to the Williston Park pool property abutting the LIRR.
The road survives as a continuous county road, Vanderbilt Motor Parkway (CR 67), from Half Hollow Road in Dix Hills to its original end in Ronkonkoma, just a few blocks short of the lake. Signage along the way also identifies it variously as Vanderbilt Parkway and Motor Parkway. From Half Hollow Road, it goes northeast to NY 231 (Deer Park Avenue). It starts to parallel the Northern State Parkway and intersects with CR 4 (Commack Road) in Commack. It crosses the Sagtikos State Parkway (with northbound access northbound) and heads south to I-495 (the Long Island Expressway). The parkway heads eastward, paralleling the expressway (with access to and from the LIE) before ultimately crossing it and continuing southeast to NY 111 (Joshua&#x27;s Path). It then heads north, crossing the LIE again at exit 57, and then curves to the east and crosses NY 454 (Veterans Memorial Highway). It heads east across Old Nichols and Terry roads ahead of one final northeastward turn to end at Rosevale Avenue (CR 93) in Ronkonkoma, close to the lake. &lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;40.775342&quot; longitude=&quot;-73.251343&quot; zoom=&quot;10&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

&lt;/mapframe&gt;Though not a limited-access highway since 1938, most of the road was recognizable into the 1970s, while new intersections continued to be cut through it. In the approximate middle of the road in and around Islandia, office construction and other commercial building has widened the road and made it appear a typical highway.

In 2008 the road celebrated its 100th anniversary. On October 30, 2011, a centennial event marked the 100th anniversary of the completion of the Lake Ronkonkoma section. Led by the winner of the 1909 and 1910 Vanderbilt Cup races, a parade of automobiles made prior to 1948 went from Dix Hills to Lake Ronkonkoma.

<doc id="154502" wikidata="Q3025883" url="?curid=154502" title="Type 2 diabetes">
<text>Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Other symptoms include increased hunger, having a sensation of pins and needles, and sores (wounds) that heal slowly. Symptoms often develop slowly. Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, stroke, diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the lower limbs, which may lead to amputations. A sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.
Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise. Some people are genetically more at risk than others.

Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune-induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1c).
Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying at a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet (high in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and saturated fat).

Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes. If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended. Many people may eventually also require insulin injections. In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels (such as through a continuous glucose monitor) is advised; however, this may not be needed in those who are not on insulin therapy. Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.
Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from  BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.
==Signs and symptoms==

The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss. Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include loss of taste. Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing. A small number of people with type 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure).

===Complications===

Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and stroke; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations, and increased rates of hospitalizations. In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure. It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementia. Other complications include hyperpigmentation of skin (acanthosis nigricans), sexual dysfunction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and frequent infections. There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss.

==Causes==
The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors. While some of these factors are under personal control, such as diet and obesity, other factors are not, such as increasing age, female sex, and genetics. Generous consumption of alcohol is also a risk factor. Obesity is more common in women than men in many parts of Africa. The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role.

===Lifestyle===

Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, psychological stress, and urbanization. Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders. Among those who are not obese, a high waist–hip ratio is often present. Smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Lack of sleep has also been linked to type 2 diabetes. Laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism, nervous system activity, or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes.

Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk. The type of fats in the diet are important, with saturated fat and trans fatty acids increasing the risk, and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk. Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk. A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases. Sedentary lifestyle is another risk factor. Persistent organic pollutants may also play a role.

===Genetics===

Most cases of diabetes involve many genes, with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type 2 diabetic. The proportion of diabetes that is inherited is estimated at 72%. More than 36 genes and 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had been found that contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. All of these genes together still only account for 10% of the total heritable component of the disease. The TCF7L2 allele, for example, increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants. Most of the genes linked to diabetes are involved in pancreatic beta cell functions.

There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene (known as monogenic forms of diabetes or &quot;other specific types of diabetes&quot;). These include maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), Donohue syndrome, and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome, among others. Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5% of all cases of diabetes in young people.

Epigenetic regulation may have a role in type 2 diabetes.

===Medical conditions===
There are a number of medications and other health problems that can predispose to diabetes. Some of the medications include: glucocorticoids, thiazides, beta blockers, atypical antipsychotics, and statins. Those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Other health problems that are associated include: acromegaly, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and certain cancers such as glucagonomas. Individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes. Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type 2 diabetes. Eating disorders may also interact with type 2 diabetes, with bulimia nervosa increasing the risk and anorexia nervosa decreasing it.

==Pathophysiology==
Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue. In the liver, insulin normally suppresses glucose release. However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood. The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.

Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include: increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells, resistance to and lack of incretin, high glucagon levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system. However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.

In the early stages of insulin resistance, the mass of beta cells expands, increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity, so that the disposition index remains constant. But when type 2 diabetes has become manifest, the person will have lost about half of their beta cells.

The causes of the aging-related insulin resistance seen in obesity and in type 2 diabetes are uncertain. Effects of intracellular lipid metabolism and ATP production in liver and muscle cells may contribute to insulin resistance.

==Diagnosis==

The World Health Organization definition of diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms, otherwise raised values on two occasions, of either:
* fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)
:or
* glucose tolerance test with two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)
A random blood sugar of greater than 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) in association with typical symptoms or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5 DCCT %) is another method of diagnosing diabetes. In 2009, an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommended that a HbA1c threshold of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5 DCCT %) should be used to diagnose diabetes. This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010. Positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugar &gt;11.1 mmol/L (&gt;200 mg/dL).

Threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests, fasting glucose or HbA1c and complications such as retinal problems. A fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test, as they are more convenient for people. HbA1c has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose. It is estimated that 20% of people with diabetes in the United States do not realize that they have the disease.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. This is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances. If the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type 1 diabetes and C-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type 2 diabetes, with C-peptide levels normal or high in type 2 diabetes, but low in type 1 diabetes.

==Screening==
Universal screening for diabetes in people without risk factors or symptoms is not recommended.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended in 2021 screening for type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years old who are overweight (i.e. BMI over 25) or have obesity. For people of Asian descent, screening is recommended if they have a BMI over 23. Screening at an earlier age may be considered in people with a family history of diabetes; some ethnic groups, including Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans; a history of gestational diabetes; polycystic ovary syndrome. Screening can be repeated every 3 years.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended in 2024 screening in all adults from the age of 35 years. ADA also recommends screening in adults of all ages with a BMI over 25 (or over 23 in Asian Americans) with another risk factor: first-degree relative with diabetes, ethnicity at high risk for diabetes, blood pressure ≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, physical inactivity, polycystic ovary syndrome or severe obesity. ADA recommends repeat screening every 3 years at minimum. ADA recommends yearly tests in people with prediabetes. People with previous gestational diabetes or pancreatitis are also recommended screening.

There is no evidence that screening changes the risk of death and any benefit of screening on adverse effects, incidence of type 2 diabetes, HbA1c or socioeconomic effects are not clear.

In the UK, NICE guidelines suggest taking action to prevent diabetes for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. For people of Black African, African-Caribbean, South Asian and Chinese descent the recommendation to start prevention starts at the BMI of 27,5. A study based on a large sample of people in England suggest even lower BMIs for certain ethnic groups for the start of prevention, for example 24 in South Asian and 21 in Bangladeshi populations.

==Prevention==

Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise. Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half. The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person&#x27;s initial weight or subsequent weight loss. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28%. Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone, however, is limited, with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks. There is an association between higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice and diabetes, but no evidence of an association with 100% fruit juice. A 2019 review found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber.

A 2017 review found that, long term, lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28%, while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal. While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk.

In those with prediabetes, diet in combination with physical activity delays or reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, according to a 2017 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, metformin may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to diet and exercise or a placebo intervention, but not compared to intensive diet and exercise, and there was not enough data on outcomes such as mortality and diabetic complications and health-related quality of life, according to a 2019 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose may delay or reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose improved cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events, according to a 2018 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, pioglitazone may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to placebo or no intervention, but no difference was seen compared to metformin, and data were missing on mortality and complications and quality of life, according to a 2020 Cochrane review. In those with prediabetes, there was insufficient data to draw any conclusions on whether SGLT2 inhibitors may delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to a 2016 Cochrane review.

==Management==

Management of type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions, lowering other cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range. Self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education, although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable. In those who do not want to measure blood levels, measuring urine levels may be done. Managing other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and microalbuminuria, improves a person&#x27;s life expectancy. Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes. Intensive blood pressure management (less than 130/80 mmHg) as opposed to standard blood pressure management (less than 140–160 mmHg systolic to 85–100 mmHg diastolic) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death.

Intensive blood sugar lowering (HbA1c &lt; 6%) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering (HbA1c of 7–7.9%) does not appear to change mortality. The goal of treatment is typically an HbA1c of 7 to 8% or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL); however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation, taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy. Hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes. Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long-term benefits, many people – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit, are over-treated.

It is recommended that all people with type 2 diabetes get regular eye examinations. There is moderate evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing results in an improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.

===Lifestyle===
==== Exercise ====
A proper diet and regular exercise are foundations of diabetic care, with one review indicating that a greater amount of exercise improved outcomes. Regular exercise may improve blood sugar control, decrease body fat content, and decrease blood lipid levels.

==== Diet ====

Calorie restriction to promote weight loss is generally recommended. Around 80 percent of obese people with type 2 diabetes achieve complete remission with no need for medication if they sustain a weight loss of at least , but most patients are not able to achieve or sustain significant weight loss. Even modest weight loss can produce significant improvements in glycemic control and reduce the need for medication.

Several diets may be effective such as the DASH diet, Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, or monitored carbohydrate diets such as a low carbohydrate diet. Other recommendations include emphasizing intake of fruits, vegetables, reduced saturated fat and low-fat dairy products, and with a macronutrient intake tailored to the individual, to distribute calories and carbohydrates throughout the day. A 2021 review showed that consumption of tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) reduced fasting blood glucose in diabetic people. , there is insufficient data to recommend nonnutritive sweeteners, which may help reduce caloric intake. An elevated intake of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates can help reducing the effects of T2D. Viscous fiber supplements may be useful in those with diabetes.

Culturally appropriate education may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels for up to 24 months. There is not enough evidence to determine if lifestyle interventions affect mortality in those who already have type 2 diabetes.

==== Stress management ====
Although psychological stress is recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the effect of stress management interventions on disease progression are not established. A Cochrane review is under way to assess the effects of mindfulness‐based interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes.

===Medications===

==== Blood sugar control ====

There are several classes of diabetes medications available. Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is some evidence that it decreases mortality; however, this conclusion is questioned. Metformin should not be used in those with severe kidney or liver problems. The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend using a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor as the first-line treatment in patients who have or are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. The higher cost of these drugs compared to metformin has limited their use.

Other classes of medications include: sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists. A 2018 review found that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists, but not DPP-4 inhibitors, were associated with lower mortality than placebo or no treatment. Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, has not been found to improve long-term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels. Additionally it is associated with increased rates of heart disease and death.

Injections of insulin may either be added to oral medication or used alone. Most people do not initially need insulin. When it is used, a long-acting formulation is typically added at night, with oral medications being continued. Doses are then increased to effect (blood sugar levels being well controlled). When nightly insulin is insufficient, twice daily insulin may achieve better control. The long acting insulins glargine and detemir are equally safe and effective, and do not appear much better than NPH insulin, but as they are significantly more expensive, they are not cost effective as of 2010. In those who are pregnant, insulin is generally the treatment of choice.

==== Blood pressure lowering ====
Many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes. However, there is only limited evidence regarding what the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg, and a subsequent review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 and 140 mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.

In people with diabetes and hypertension and either albuminuria or chronic kidney disease, an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (such as an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) to reduce the risks of progression of kidney disease and present cardiovascular events. There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease. Although a 2016 review found similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes. There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs provides additional benefits.

==== Other ====
The use of statins in diabetes to prevent cardiovascular disease should be considered after evaluating the person&#x27;s total risk for cardiovascular disease.

The use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes is controversial. Aspirin is recommended in people with previous cardiovascular disease, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes. Aspirin as primary prevention may have greater risk than benefit, but could be considered in people aged 50 to 70 with another significant cardiovascular risk factor and low risk of bleeding after information about possible risks and benefits as part of shared-decision making.

Vitamin D supplementation to people with type 2 diabetes may improve markers of insulin resistance and HbA1c.

Sharing their electronic health records with people who have type 2 diabetes helps them to reduce their blood sugar levels. It is a way of helping people understand their own health condition and involving them actively in its management.

===Surgery===
Weight loss surgery in those who are obese is an effective measure to treat diabetes. Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medication following surgery and long-term mortality is decreased. There however is some short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery. The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear. It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.

==Epidemiology==

The International Diabetes Federation estimates nearly 537 million people lived with diabetes worldwide in 2021, 90–95% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is common both in the developed and the developing world.

Some ethnic groups such as South Asians, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and Native Americans are at particularly high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes in normal weight individuals represents 60 to 80 percent of all cases in some Asian countries. The mechanism causing diabetes in non-obese individuals is poorly understood.

Rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30 million, increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005. This increase is believed to be primarily due to the global population aging, a decrease in exercise, and increasing rates of obesity. Traditionally considered a disease of adults, type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates. The five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31.7 million, China 20.8 million, the United States 17.7 million, Indonesia 8.4 million, and Japan 6.8 million. It is recognized as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization.

==History==

Diabetes is one of the first diseases described with an Egyptian manuscript from  BCE mentioning &quot;too great emptying of the urine.&quot; The first described cases are believed to be of type 1 diabetes. Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as &quot;madhumeha&quot; or &quot;honey urine&quot; noting that the urine would attract ants. The term &quot;diabetes&quot; or &quot;to pass through&quot; was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius Memphites. The disease was rare during the time of the Roman Empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922. This was followed by the development of the longer acting NPH insulin in the 1940s.

In 1916, Elliot Joslin proposed that in people with diabetes, periods of fasting are helpful. Subsequent research has supported this, and weight loss is a first line treatment in type 2 diabetes.

== Research ==
In 2020, Diabetes Severity Score (DISSCO) was developed which is a tool that might better than HbA1c identify if a person&#x27;s condition is declining. It uses a computer algorithm to analyse data from anonymised electronic patient records and produces a score based on 34 indicators.

=== Stem cells ===

In April 2024 scientists reported the first case of reversion of type 2 diabetes by use of stem cells in a 59-year-old man treated in 2021 who has since remain insulin-free. Replication in more patients and evidence over longer periods would be needed before considering this treatment as a possible cure.

<text>A digital signal processor (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing. DSPs are fabricated on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit chips. They are widely used in audio signal processing, telecommunications, digital image processing, radar, sonar and speech recognition systems, and in common consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, disk drives and high-definition television (HDTV) products.

The goal of a DSP is usually to measure, filter or compress continuous real-world analog signals. Most general-purpose microprocessors can also execute digital signal processing algorithms successfully, but may not be able to keep up with such processing continuously in real-time. Also, dedicated DSPs usually have better power efficiency, thus they are more suitable in portable devices such as mobile phones because of power consumption constraints. DSPs often use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time. 

==Overview==
Digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples. Signals (perhaps from audio or video sensors) are constantly converted from analog to digital, manipulated digitally, and then converted back to analog form. Many DSP applications have constraints on latency; that is, for the system to work, the DSP operation must be completed within some fixed time, and deferred (or batch) processing is not viable.

Most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute DSP algorithms successfully, but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and PDAs because of power efficiency constraints. A specialized DSP, however, will tend to provide a lower-cost solution, with better performance, lower latency, and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries.

Such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial communications satellites where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters, switches, frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the uplinked signals and ready them for downlinking, and can be replaced with specialised DSPs with significant benefits to the satellites&#x27; weight, power consumption, complexity/cost of construction, reliability and flexibility of operation. For example, the SES-12 and SES-14 satellites from operator SES launched in 2018, were both built by Airbus Defence and Space with 25% of capacity using DSP.

The architecture of a DSP is optimized specifically for digital signal processing. Most also support some of the features of an applications processor or microcontroller, since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system. Some useful features for optimizing DSP algorithms are outlined below.

==Architecture==

===Software architecture===

By the standards of general-purpose processors, DSP instruction sets are often highly irregular; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations, instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in DSP calculations. Both traditional and DSP-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple ARM or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a DSP optimized instruction set.

One implication for software architecture is that hand-optimized assembly-code routines (assembly programs) are commonly packaged into libraries for re-use, instead of relying on advanced compiler technologies to handle essential algorithms. Even with modern compiler optimizations hand-optimized assembly code is more efficient and many common algorithms involved in DSP calculations are hand-written in order to take full advantage of the architectural optimizations.

====Instruction sets====
*multiply–accumulates (MACs, including fused multiply–add, FMA) operations
**used extensively in all kinds of matrix operations
***convolution for filtering
***dot product
***polynomial evaluation
**Fundamental DSP algorithms depend heavily on multiply–accumulate performance
***FIR filters
***Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
*related instructions:
**SIMD
**VLIW
*Specialized instructions for modulo addressing in ring buffers and bit-reversed addressing mode for FFT cross-referencing
*DSPs sometimes use time-stationary encoding to simplify hardware and increase coding efficiency.
*Multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle – typically supporting reading 2 data values from 2 separate data buses and the next instruction (from the instruction cache, or a 3rd program memory) simultaneously.
*Special loop controls, such as architectural support for executing a few instruction words in a very tight loop without overhead for instruction fetches or exit testing—such as zero-overhead looping and hardware loop buffers.

====Data instructions====
*Saturation arithmetic, in which operations that produce overflows will accumulate at the maximum (or minimum) values that the register can hold rather than wrapping around (maximum+1 doesn&#x27;t overflow to minimum as in many general-purpose CPUs, instead it stays at maximum). Sometimes various sticky bits operation modes are available.
*Fixed-point arithmetic is often used to speed up arithmetic processing.
*Single-cycle operations to increase the benefits of pipelining.

====Program flow====
*Floating-point unit integrated directly into the datapath
*Pipelined architecture
*Highly parallel multiplier–accumulators (MAC units)
*Hardware-controlled looping, to reduce or eliminate the overhead required for looping operations

===Hardware architecture===

====Memory architecture====

DSPs are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time, such as the Harvard architecture or Modified von Neumann architecture, which use separate program and data memories (sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses).

DSPs can sometimes rely on supporting code to know about cache hierarchies and the associated delays. This is a tradeoff that allows for better performance. In addition, extensive use of DMA is employed.

=====Addressing and virtual memory=====

DSPs frequently use multi-tasking operating systems, but have no support for virtual memory or memory protection. Operating systems that use virtual memory require more time for context switching among processes, which increases latency.

*Hardware modulo addressing
**Allows circular buffers to be implemented without having to test for wrapping
*Bit-reversed addressing, a special addressing mode
**useful for calculating FFTs
*Exclusion of a memory management unit
*Address generation unit

==History==

===Development===
In 1976, Richard Wiggins proposed the Speak &amp; Spell concept to Paul Breedlove, Larry Brantingham, and Gene Frantz at Texas Instruments&#x27; Dallas research facility. Two years later in 1978, they produced the first Speak &amp; Spell, with the technological centerpiece being the TMS5100, the industry&#x27;s first digital signal processor. It also set other milestones, being the first chip to use linear predictive coding to perform speech synthesis. The chip was made possible with a 7 μm PMOS fabrication process.

In 1978, American Microsystems (AMI) released the S2811. The AMI S2811 &quot;signal processing peripheral&quot;, like many later DSPs, has a hardware multiplier that enables it to do multiply–accumulate operation in a single instruction. The S2281 was the first integrated circuit chip specifically designed as a DSP, and fabricated using vertical metal oxide semiconductor (VMOS, V-groove MOS), a technology that had previously not been mass-produced. It was designed as a microprocessor peripheral, for the Motorola 6800, and it had to be initialized by the host. The S2811 was not successful in the market.

In 1979, Intel released the 2920 as an &quot;analog signal processor&quot;. It had an on-chip ADC/DAC with an internal signal processor, but it didn&#x27;t have a hardware multiplier and was not successful in the market.

In 1980, the first stand-alone, complete DSPs – Nippon Electric Corporation&#x27;s NEC μPD7720 based on the modified Harvard architecture and AT&amp;T&#x27;s DSP1 – were presented at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference &#x27;80. Both processors were inspired by the research in public switched telephone network (PSTN) telecommunications. The μPD7720, introduced for voiceband applications, was one of the most commercially successful early DSPs.

The Altamira DX-1 was another early DSP, utilizing quad integer pipelines with delayed branches and branch prediction.

Another DSP produced by Texas Instruments (TI), the TMS32010 presented in 1983, proved to be an even bigger success. It was based on the Harvard architecture, and so had separate instruction and data memory. It already had a special instruction set, with instructions like load-and-accumulate or multiply-and-accumulate. It could work on 16-bit numbers and needed 390 ns for a multiply–add operation. TI is now the market leader in general-purpose DSPs.

About five years later, the second generation of DSPs began to spread. They had 3 memories for storing two operands simultaneously and included hardware to accelerate tight loops; they also had an addressing unit capable of loop-addressing. Some of them operated on 24-bit variables and a typical model only required about 21 ns for a MAC. Members of this generation were for example the AT&amp;T DSP16A or the Motorola 56000.

The main improvement in the third generation was the appearance of application-specific units and instructions in the data path, or sometimes as coprocessors. These units allowed direct hardware acceleration of very specific but complex mathematical problems, like the Fourier-transform or matrix operations. Some chips, like the Motorola MC68356, even included more than one processor core to work in parallel. Other DSPs from 1995 are the TI TMS320C541 or the TMS 320C80.

The fourth generation is best characterized by the changes in the instruction set and the instruction encoding/decoding. SIMD extensions were added, and VLIW and the superscalar architecture appeared. As always, the clock-speeds have increased; a 3 ns MAC now became possible.

==Modern DSPs==

Modern signal processors yield greater performance; this is due in part to both technological and architectural advancements like lower design rules, fast-access two-level cache, (E)DMA circuitry, and a wider bus system. Not all DSPs provide the same speed and many kinds of signal processors exist, each one of them being better suited for a specific task, ranging in price from about US$1.50 to US$300.

Texas Instruments produces the C6000 series DSPs, which have clock speeds of 1.2 GHz and implement separate instruction and data caches. They also have an 8 MiB 2nd level cache and 64 EDMA channels. The top models are capable of as many as 8000 MIPS (millions of instructions per second), use VLIW (very long instruction word), perform eight operations per clock-cycle and are compatible with a broad range of external peripherals and various buses (PCI/serial/etc). TMS320C6474 chips each have three such DSPs, and the newest generation C6000 chips support floating point as well as fixed point processing.

Freescale produces a multi-core DSP family, the MSC81xx. The MSC81xx is based on StarCore Architecture processors and the latest MSC8144 DSP combines four programmable SC3400 StarCore DSP cores. Each SC3400 StarCore DSP core has a clock speed of 1 GHz.

XMOS produces a multi-core multi-threaded line of processor well suited to DSP operations, They come in various speeds ranging from 400 to 1600 MIPS. The processors have a multi-threaded architecture that allows up to 8 real-time threads per core, meaning that a 4 core device would support up to 32 real time threads. Threads communicate between each other with buffered channels that are capable of up to 80 Mbit/s. The devices are easily programmable in C and aim at bridging the gap between conventional micro-controllers and FPGAs

CEVA, Inc. produces and licenses three distinct families of DSPs. Perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the CEVA-TeakLite DSP family, a classic memory-based architecture, with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual MACs. The CEVA-X DSP family offers a combination of VLIW and SIMD architectures, with different members of the family offering dual or quad 16-bit MACs. The CEVA-XC DSP family targets Software-defined Radio (SDR) modem designs and leverages a unique combination of VLIW and Vector architectures with 32 16-bit MACs.

Analog Devices produce the SHARC-based DSP and range in performance from 66 MHz/198 MFLOPS (million floating-point operations per second) to 400 MHz/2400 MFLOPS. Some models support multiple multipliers and ALUs, SIMD instructions and audio processing-specific components and peripherals. The Blackfin family of embedded digital signal processors combine the features of a DSP with those of a general use processor. As a result, these processors can run simple operating systems like μCLinux, velocity and Nucleus RTOS while operating on real-time data. The SHARC-based ADSP-210xx provides both delayed branches and non-delayed branches.

NXP Semiconductors produce DSPs based on TriMedia VLIW technology, optimized for audio and video processing. In some products the DSP core is hidden as a fixed-function block into a SoC, but NXP also provides a range of flexible single core media processors. The TriMedia media processors support both fixed-point arithmetic as well as floating-point arithmetic, and have specific instructions to deal with complex filters and entropy coding.

CSR produces the Quatro family of SoCs that contain one or more custom Imaging DSPs optimized for processing document image data for scanner and copier applications.

Microchip Technology produces the PIC24 based dsPIC line of DSPs. Introduced in 2004, the dsPIC is designed for applications needing a true DSP as well as a true microcontroller, such as motor control and in power supplies. The dsPIC runs at up to 40MIPS, and has support for 16 bit fixed point MAC, bit reverse and modulo addressing, as well as DMA.

Most DSPs use fixed-point arithmetic, because in real world signal processing the additional range provided by floating point is not needed, and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity. Floating point DSPs may be invaluable in applications where a wide dynamic range is required. Product developers might also use floating point DSPs to reduce the cost and complexity of software development in exchange for more expensive hardware, since it is generally easier to implement algorithms in floating point.

Generally, DSPs are dedicated integrated circuits; however DSP functionality can also be produced by using field-programmable gate array chips (FPGAs).

Embedded general-purpose RISC processors are becoming increasingly DSP like in functionality. For example, the OMAP3 processors include an ARM Cortex-A8 and C6000 DSP.

In Communications a new breed of DSPs offering the fusion of both DSP functions and H/W acceleration function is making its way into the mainstream. Such Modem processors include ASOCS ModemX and CEVA&#x27;s XC4000.

In May 2018, Huarui-2 designed by Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology of China Electronics Technology Group passed acceptance. With a processing speed of 0.4 TFLOPS, the chip can achieve better performance than current mainstream DSP chips. The design team has begun to create Huarui-3, which has a processing speed in TFLOPS level and a support for artificial intelligence.

<doc id="154508" wikidata="Q885594" url="?curid=154508" title="Blue (1993 film)">
<text>Blue is a 1993 British drama film directed by Derek Jarman. It is his final feature film, released four months before his death from AIDS-related complications. Such complications had already rendered him partially blind at the time of the film&#x27;s release and he was only able to see in shades of blue.

The film was his last testament as a film-maker and consists of an unchanging entirely blue screen, to a soundtrack where Jarman&#x27;s and some of his long-time collaborators&#x27; narration describes his life and vision.

==Structure==

The film is split into two halves, with differing strands of narration. The first story, intercut with the second, tells the adventures of Blue, as a character and color. Blue is described as getting into fights with other colors, &quot;Yellowbelly scorches the earth with its accursed breath...&quot;, to adventures, &quot;Marco Polio stumbles across the blue mountains...&quot;.

The other story features the day-to-day life of Derek Jarman, a gay man living in 1990s London, and the complications of living with AIDS. Some of the events mentioned are realistic and true, such as visiting a café with friends, discussing the war in Sarajevo, and having difficulty with day-to-day life, such as putting clothes on backward. Others feel more dreamlike, such as when Jarman wonders what is beyond the sky. This contrasts with thoughts of his health and how long he has left until he dies, the weakening of his body, and the eventual downfall of his eyesight.

There are also a handful of sections in which Jarman daydreams. The narration mentions walking across the sky, and wondering what an astronaut may be like.

The film&#x27;s final moments consist of a set of names, being repeated. &quot;John. Daniel. Howard. Graham. Terry. Paul&quot;. These names are all former lovers and friends of Jarman who had died of AIDS.

Jarman himself would succumb to AIDS on 19 February 1994 at the age of 52, just months after the film&#x27;s premiere.

==Cast==
All narrators:

* John Quentin
* Nigel Terry
* Derek Jarman
* Tilda Swinton

==Release and premiere==
On its premiere, on 19 September 1993, Channel 4 and BBC Radio 3 collaborated on a simultaneous broadcast so viewers could enjoy a stereo soundtrack. Radio 3 subsequently broadcast the soundtrack separately as a radio play and it was later released as a CD.

The film has been released on DVD in Germany and Italy. On 23 July 2007, British distributor &#x27;Artificial Eye&#x27; released a DVD tying &quot;Blue&quot; with &quot;Glitterbug&quot;, a collage of Jarman&#x27;s Super-8 footage.

Cinematographer Christopher Doyle has called &quot;Blue&quot; one of his favourite films, calling it &quot;one of the most intimate films I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

<doc id="154509" wikidata="Q1167952" url="?curid=154509" title="Dave Walker">
<text>David Walker (born 25 January 1945) is an English singer and guitarist who has been front-man for a number of bands; most notably The Idle Race, Savoy Brown and Humble Pie, he also served briefly with Fleetwood Mac and Black Sabbath.

==History==

===Early life===
Walker was raised by his strict grandmother in a household where rock and roll was not allowed to be watched on television. His first experience with public singing came at a very young age at a Methodist church, where Dave volunteered to sing &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;. As teenagers, Dave and his brother Mick formed a &quot;backyard skiffle&quot; group which played at weddings and youth gatherings.

==Career==

===The Redcaps (1960–1965)===

Dave Walker started his career in 1960 with a Brumbeat R &amp; B band called The Redcaps. The band was formed by Dave on rhythm guitar, his twin brother Mick Walker (born Michael Walker, 25 January 1945, in Walsall - died 25 February 2016) on bass guitar, Ronnie on lead vocals, Ronnie&#x27;s brother Roy Brown on lead guitar, Mac Broadhurst on saxophone, and Jimmy Richards on drums. Following an on-stage argument between Dave Walker and Ronnie Brown in 1962, Ronnie departed the band, leaving Dave to take on the role of lead vocalist; and following a tour of France in 1964 both Roy Brown and Jimmy Richards departed the band, and were replaced by Mick Blythe and Alan Morley (who later joined Chicken Shack) respectively.

They recorded three singles for Decca Records, who were trying to cash in on the success of The Beatles, as The Redcaps had opened for The Beatles in concert on four occasions. Their first single, in 1963, was a cover of the pulsating Isley Brothers&#x27;s &quot;Shout&quot; backed by &quot;Little Things You Do&quot; an original tune written by Dave Walker and Roy Brown. However, Lulu had beaten The Redcaps to the British charts with her version of &quot;Shout&quot;. Their next single, in 1964, was a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Talking About You&quot; backed by &quot;Come on Girl&quot;. It has been rumoured that guitarist Jimmy Page, later of Led Zeppelin, played on &quot;Talking About You&quot;, in his early pre-Yardbirds London session days, but Walker has since said Page does not play on this track. The story behind the rumour being that Page was available, if needed, but Redcaps guitarist Roy Brown handled the lead parts himself. The track was recorded in a different studio from where Page was working, on the day of the recording. Their final single, &quot;Funny Things&quot; an original tune penned by Blythe backed by &quot;Mighty Fine Girl&quot;, was also released in 1964; but after all three singles flopped, The Redcaps disbanded in 1965.

Mick Walker died on 25 February 2016, aged 71.

===Beckett (1965–1969)===
Between 1965 and 1969 Walker played in Beckett, a band which included Pete Oliver, Don McGinty and Colin Timmons. Beckett played three days a week at the Rum Runner nightclub in Birmingham (which at the time was managed by Mick Walker), but they never recorded, and disbanded in late 1969.

===The Idle Race (1970–1971)===
In early 1970, Jeff Lynne left his original band, The Idle Race, to join The Move with former Idle Race guitarist Roy Wood; just prior to its evolution into the Electric Light Orchestra. Idle Race had built a substantial cult following in the Birmingham area, and wanted to continue after Lynne&#x27;s exit. This resulted in the remaining members of the band (rhythm guitarist Dave Pritchard, drummer Roger Spencer, and bassist Greg Masters) recruiting Walker as lead vocalist and Mike Hopkins as lead guitarist.

In 1970 this new line-up recorded two singles for Liberty Records; a cover of Mungo Jerry&#x27;s skiffle hit &quot;In the Summertime&quot;, (which reached number one in Argentina) backed by an Idle Race original &quot;Told You Twice&quot;. Their second single was a cover of Hotlegs&#x27; &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot; backed by another Idle Race original number &quot;Victim of Circumstance&quot;.

Also in 1970, Idle Race recorded an album &quot;Time Is&quot; for Regal Zonophone, however Walker was incorrectly credited as &quot;&quot;Richie&quot; Walker&quot;. Walker wrote two tracks (&quot;I Will See You&quot;, &quot;And The Rain&quot;) and co-wrote two others (&quot;Alcatraz&quot;, &quot;We Want It All&quot;) on this album. The album was a commercial failure and in 1971 all members of the incumbent line-up with the exception of Masters (Walker, Hopkins, Pritchard, and Spencer) departed the band. Masters&#x27; initially put together another line-up of The Idle Race, but he too soon departed, and the remaining members&#x27; soon reformed as the Steve Gibbons Band.

===Savoy Brown (1971–1972)===
In 1971, guitarist Kim Simmonds, leader of blues-rock band Savoy Brown, lost the rest of his band - guitarist Dave Peverett, bassist Tony Stevens, and drummer Roger Earl - after they decided to depart Savoy Brown in order to form Foghat with former Black Cat Bones guitarist Rod Price. To replace the departing members, Simmonds hired Walker on vocals, along with three recently departed members&#x27; of Stan Webb&#x27;s Chicken Shack - keyboardist/guitarist Paul Raymond (later of UFO and Michael Schenker Group), bassist Andy Silvester, and drummer Dave Bidwell.

They recorded the &quot;Street Corner Talking&quot; album in 1971 on Parrot/Deram Records, which included one of Savoy Brown&#x27;s biggest hits &quot;Tell Mama&quot;, written by Raymond, and they headlined a tour over Rod Stewart and The Grease Band in early 1971, as persistent touring was beginning to pay off for the Savoys. The next album, &quot;Hellbound Train&quot; (Parrot/Deram), was their biggest-selling album to date, reaching the top 40 in the US while the title cut became a concert favourite. Ex-Blodwyn Pig/Juicy Lucy bassist Andy Pyle replaced Silvester by the next album &quot;Lion&#x27;s Share&quot; (Parrot/Deram) for which Walker wrote &quot;Denim Demon&quot;. &quot;Lion&#x27;s Share&quot; was released in late 1972; after Savoy Brown had previewed tracks on their extensive tours earlier that year.

In addition to the studio albums, two &quot;official&quot; live Savoy Brown albums from this era, also include Walker:- a 1972 New York City concert, &quot;Live in Central Park&quot; (Relix Records) 1985 (LP) and 1989 (CD); and &quot;Jack the Toad Live &#x27;70/&#x27;72&quot; (Mooncrest Records) 2000 taken from Kim Simmonds&#x27; personal collection of live Savoy Brown recordings. Simmonds recordings are all from the same venue: Edmonton Gardens in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada but on different dates, and only two tracks include Walker.

Before the late 1972 tour began, Walker decided to leave Savoy Brown in order to join Fleetwood Mac.

===Fleetwood Mac (1972–1973)===
In August 1972 Danny Kirwan was fired from Fleetwood Mac and was replaced by Walker on vocals and Bob Weston on guitar. They joined Fleetwood Mac at a time when the band were struggling to record the &quot;Penguin&quot; album (1973, Reprise Records). Walker only appears on two tracks, his self-penned &quot;The Derelict&quot; and a cover of Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars&#x27; Motown classic &quot;(I&#x27;m a) Road Runner&quot;.

The subsequent tour seemed to go well, and &quot;Penguin&quot; was the highest charting Fleetwood Mac album in the US at the time, clawing its way into the Top 50. However, during the recording of their next album, &quot;Mystery to Me&quot;, it was mutually agreed by the other five members of the band at that time (Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie, Bob Welch, and Weston) that Walker&#x27;s vocal style and attitude &quot;did not fit in&quot; with Fleetwood Mac and he was asked to leave in mid-1973, ultimately not featuring on &quot;Mystery to Me&quot;.

===Hungry Fighter (1974)===
In 1974 Walker formed the band Hungry Fighter with his former Savoy Brown colleagues bassist Andy Silvester and keyboardist/guitarist Paul Raymond, his predecessor in Fleetwood Mac Danny Kirwan, and former Warhorse drummer Mac Poole. Hungry Fighter only managed to play one live gig, at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England (which was not recorded), before the consequences of a road accident sustained by their crew following the gig (which included the destruction of the band&#x27;s equipment and serious injuries sustained by one member of the road crew), combined with Kirwan&#x27;s deteriorating mental health, caused the band to fold.

Mac Poole died on 21 May 2015.

===Raven (1975–1976)===
Walker then moved to San Francisco and joined Raven; a band which in its short life had a revolving door of personnel but was fronted throughout by the late ex-Quicksilver Messenger Service guitarist John Cipollina. During Walker&#x27;s tenure with Raven he performed at some live shows and worked on some of the early recording sessions for what would eventually become Raven&#x27;s eponymous album (postponed in 1976 but eventually released in 1980 as &quot;John Cipollina&#x27;s Raven&quot;); however Walker does not feature on the final release. During Walker&#x27;s tenure in Raven, the band&#x27;s line-up consisted of himself, Cipollina, future Greg Kihn Band guitarist Greg Douglass, bassist Skip Olsen, and drummer David Weber.

===Mistress (1976–1977)===
Later in 1976, Walker, Douglass, and Olsen decided to leave Raven and join keyboardist Chris Kovacs and drummer Chris Paulsen in Mistress; a fledgling band which had been around since 1972. Olsen departed later that year and was replaced by Dave Brown; with Kovacs also departing and the band adding Charlie Williams on guitar at the same time. With this line-up the band recorded some demos in the hope of gaining a recording contract, but this did not come to fruition during Walker&#x27;s tenure in the band. In 1977 Walker returned to England to join Black Sabbath and Douglass departed to join the Steve Miller Band; leaving Williams to switch to lead vocalist, and guitarists&#x27; Danny Chauncey and Kenny Hopkins to join the band. Eventually the band were able to release an album, which featured a song co-written by Walker and Paulsen, entitled &quot;High on the Ride&quot;, amongst its track-listing; but it is unknown whether any of Walker&#x27;s vocals are featured on this track. The album also included a minor hit, with the ballad &quot;Mistrusted Love&quot; scraping into the US top 50 singles chart. Legal difficulties also caused the eponymous album recorded by Mistress (again without Walker) in 1977 to be shelved, but it was released in 1979 by RSO Records, nearly two years after Mistress broke up.

===Black Sabbath (1977–1978)===
Tony Iommi remembered Walker from their days in Birmingham, and contacted Walker in San Francisco, asking him to join Black Sabbath, as singer Ozzy Osbourne had just left the band.

On the flight from San Francisco to London in November 1977, and for the next three weeks, Walker wrote lyrics to the new music which the remaining members of Black Sabbath (guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Terry &#x27;Geezer&#x27; Butler and drummer Bill Ward) wrote for their next album. No vocals were recorded with Walker, but the new line-up appeared on the BBC Midlands TV program &quot;Look Hear&quot; on 6 January 1978, performing their hit &quot;War Pigs&quot; plus an early version of what would eventually become &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot;.

Shortly after this appearance, Osbourne decided to rejoin Black Sabbath, so Dave Walker was out before recording with the band. None of Walker&#x27;s lyrics were used for Black Sabbath&#x27;s resulting &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; album, because Osbourne would not sing any material written during his time out of the band. Geezer Butler thus resumed his traditional job as Black Sabbath&#x27;s primary lyricist, and completely new lyrics for the album were written, including what became &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. After the 1978 tour to promote the album, Osbourne was asked to leave, and was replaced by Ronnie James Dio.

===Dave Walker Band #1 (1979)===
After returning to the US, Walker briefly assembled his own band, consisting of himself, Michael Boyd and Steph Burnbaum on guitars, Jim Pugh on keyboards, Jim Wade on drums, and Mike Williams on bass. This venture was short-lived, and following the band&#x27;s dissolution Walker temporarily retired from music.

===Savoy Brown again (1986–1991)===
After being out of the music business for eight years, in 1986 Kim Simmonds persuaded Walker to rejoin his revamped Savoy Brown, which included Al Macomber on drums and Jim Dagnesi on bass.

In 1987 Walker moved to Gallup, New Mexico where he lived until 1998 and Savoy Brown recorded the &quot;Make Me Sweat&quot; album, released in early 1988 on GNP Crescendo Records, followed in April 1989 by the &quot;Kings of Boogie&quot; album (also on GNP Crescendo).

Macomber was replaced by Pete Mendillo on drums, Lou Kaplan replaced Dagnesi on bass and Rick Jewett augmented the line-up on keyboards for the tour to promote &quot;Kings of Boogie&quot;, and in November 1990 a live album from this tour was released called &quot;Live And Kickin&#x27;&quot; (GNP Crescendo). These well received albums were produced by Neil Norman who sought out Dave&#x27;s infectious comedic style.

However, by September 1991, Dave Walker had had enough of gruelling tours, so he left Savoy Brown again.

===Donovan&#x27;s Brain (1999-2003)===
By the late 1990s Walker had relocated to Bozeman, Montana, where in 1999 he met up with an old friend from his San Francisco days, Ron Sanchez, who had (and still has) a psychedelic garage band called Donovan&#x27;s Brain, who have an &quot;open door&quot; approach to personnel, jamming and making music. Consequently, between 1999 and 2003 Walker was a member of Donovan&#x27;s Brain; and during this time he worked on a Donovan&#x27;s Brain session for their &quot;Tiny Crustacean Light Show&quot; album (originally on Get Hip Records but now on Career Records), in which he did much of the backing vocals and some lead vocals; a role he also performed on their next album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Great Leap Forward&quot;. He also sang on what is now considered to be a rare Donovan&#x27;s Brain track, &quot;22 Lost Marbles&quot; (which appeared on &quot;A Pot By Any Other Name&quot;, a free CD with issue 30 (Spring 2001) of the independent music magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope), and a Brain cover of a song &quot;The Single #2&quot;, originally by the band Man. This cover appeared on a various-artists Man tribute CD &quot;Man, We&#x27;re Glad We Know You: A Tribute to the Man Band&quot; (originally a private pressing, but now on Career Records). Several tracks including Walker; that were left over from the TCLS sessions, were released in January 2003 on the Donovan&#x27;s Brain album, &quot;The Great Leap Forward&quot; (Career Records).

===Dave Walker Band #2 (2007–present)===
In 2007 Dave Walker recorded and released a solo album under his own name. The album, entitled &quot;Walking Underwater&quot;, featured guitarist Jimmy Lewis; and the working relationship between the two musicians led to Dave Walker reforming a band under his name, featuring musicians solely from his home city of Montana, which has been touring since January 2008. The line-up of the band consists of Walker, Lewis, Chris Cundy (piano, keyboards, Hammond organ), Eddie Tsuru (bass), and Mike Gillan (drums). The band has made appearances at Rockin&#x27; The Rivers Music Festival and Magic City Blues Festival.

===Other contributions===
Walker had a band called The Pleasure Chorizos in his later New Mexico days in the early 1990s but ultimately the band did nothing of note. Walker played tambourine on a track by The Nomads (who were working in the same studio as Donovan&#x27;s Brain on 24 May 1999) called &quot;Top Alcohol&quot;, which was the B-side to their &quot;The King of Night Train&quot; single (White Jazz Records). He also recorded backing vocals for one track on a 2003 album by Angie Pepper. In 2004, Walker also contributed vocals to a cover of &quot;I&#x27;m Tired&quot;, on founder member of Savoy Brown John O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s album &quot;Sins&quot;. This album was re-released as &quot;Two for the Show&quot; in 2010 on the Acrobat label. In 2005 Walker recorded &quot;Mostly Sonny – A Tribute to Sonny Boy Williamson&quot; on The Mooreland Street Records label. Musicians included members of Peter Green&#x27;s Splinter Group, The Kinks, Downliners Sect (Don Craine and Keith Grant) and former Yardbird Ray Majors on lead guitar. In addition to which former Savoy Brown member John O&#x27;Leary is featured on harmonica.

In Spring 2020, during COVID lockdown, Walker recorded the Black Sabbath song &quot;The Wizard&quot; under the band name Silver Sabbath (Dave Walker- vocals, Jerry Marotta-drums, Michael Visceglia-bass, Dennis Gruenling- electric harmonica, David Malachowski-guitar), filmed/recorded remotely from New York City, Woodstock, New Jersey, and Montana, edited by Jarek Zabcynski.

<text>Jephthah (pronounced ; , &quot;Yīftāḥ&quot;) appears in the Book of Judges as a judge who presided over Israel for a period of six years (). According to Judges, he lived in Gilead. His father&#x27;s name is also given as Gilead, and, as his mother is described as a prostitute, this may indicate that his father might have been any of the men of that area. Jephthah led the Israelites in battle against Ammon and, in exchange for defeating the Ammonites, made a vow to sacrifice whatever would come out of the door of his house first. When his daughter was the first to come out of the house, he immediately regretted the vow, which bound him to sacrifice his daughter to God. Jephthah carried out his vow.

Traditionally, Jephthah ranks among the major judges because of the length of the biblical narrative referring to him, but his story also shares features with those of the minor judges, such as his short tenure—only six years—in office.

== Story ==

The story of Jephthah is found in the Book of Judges, chapters 11–12. The Israelites &quot;again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord ... they forsook the Lord and did not serve him. So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites ...&quot;.

Jephthah, having been born illegitimately, is driven out by his half-brothers and takes up his dwelling in Tob, east of Gilead. &quot;Outlaws collected around Jephthah and went raiding with him.&quot; The elders of Gilead ask him to be their leader in the campaign against the Ammonites, but he holds out for a more permanent and a broader position, and the elders agree that, provided Jephthah succeeds in defeating Ammon, he will be their permanent chieftain. On behalf of Israel as a whole and in reliance on the might of God the Judge, Jephthah challenges the Ammonites. Jephthah swears an oath:

&quot;. . . and whatever [footnote: Or &quot;whoever&quot;] comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the &#x27;s, and I will offer it [footnote: Or &quot;him&quot;] up for a burnt offering.
:—, &quot;English Standard Version&quot;

The victorious Jephthah is met on his return by his only child, a daughter. Jephthah tears his clothes and cries, &quot;Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low!&quot; but is bound by his vow: &quot;I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot take back my vow&quot;. The girl asks for two months&#x27; grace, &quot;...that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity&quot;. And so Jephthah &quot;did with her according to his vow that he had made&quot;. The story ends by recounting how &quot;the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah, the Gileadite, four days in the year&quot;.

Later, Jephthah was forced to fight against the Ephraimites, who refused to aid him in his struggle against the Ammonites. The story is remembered for the killing of the fugitive Ephraimites who were identified by their accent; they said the Hebrew word &quot;shibboleth&quot; as &quot;sibboleth&quot;. &quot;At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell&quot; ().

Jephthah is referenced once in the Epistle to the Hebrews 11:32.

== Commentary ==
===Sacrifice of daughter===
Jephthah&#x27;s sacrifice of his daughter stands in stark contrast to the Binding of Isaac in the Book of Genesis, in which Abraham was about to perform a divinely ordered sacrifice of his son, when an angel of God directly intervened and stopped the sacrifice.

Some writers have observed that the Israelites of the time widely disrespected Mosaic law, which forbade human sacrifice; and that there are several other examples of rash vows, some with similarly terrible consequences (for instance ). David Janzen argued that the story was an integral part of the Deuteronomist picture of moral decline through adoption of non-Israelitic practices such as child sacrifice. Solomon Landers believed that the absence of express judgement implies that the sacrifice was not acceptable to God, notwithstanding the fact that the sacrifice nevertheless happened. 

Pseudo-Philo&#x27;s &quot;Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum&quot; gives a name for Jephthah&#x27;s daughter, Seila. Her character is elaborated and emphasized; &quot;the author has done his utmost to put this woman on the same level as the patriarchs, in this case especially Isaac.&quot; John Chrysostom held that God allowed Jephthah to kill his daughter in order to prevent similar rash vows being made in the future and that it was for that purpose that the annual bewailing of the event took place as a constant reminder. Ambrose cited the story as an example of how it is &quot;sometimes contrary to duty to fulfill a promise, or to keep an oath&quot;.One midrash characterizes Yiftach (Jephthah) as a person of poor judgment, who makes &quot;unfitting&quot; vows without proper consideration for consequences (B&#x27;reishit Rabbah, 60:3). Another midrash (Tanhuma Bechukotai 7) asserts that if Jephthah had read the laws of vows in the Torah, he would not have lost his daughter. The rabbis also ascribe Jephthah&#x27;s death to his actions, as punishment: &quot;Jephthah’s penalty consists of the shedding of his limbs, which are buried in numerous places, as is learned from Jud. 12:7: &#x27;Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and he was buried in the towns of Gilead.&#x27; One limb would slough away and be buried in one location, and then another would fall off somewhere else and be buried there.&quot; Rashi also quotes the Midrash Rabba saying that he was punished for not going to the high priest to get the vow annulled and was afflicted with an illness that caused his limbs to decompose off of his body at which point it would be buried where it fell thereby explaining the verse that said he was buried in the cities as opposed to city of Gilead. According to some rabbinical commentators, Phineas also sinned by failing to address the needs of relieving Jephthah of his vow to sacrifice his daughter. As consequence, the high priesthood was taken from him and temporarily given to the offspring of Ithamar, essentially Eli and his sons.

Since at least the 12th or 13th century, Jewish scholars, among them the compiler and summarizer David Kimhi (1160–1235) and Levi Ben Gershon (1288–1344), have taken fulfilment of Jephthah&#x27;s vow as meaning that he only kept her in seclusion. This view is put forward also by Christian scholars from the 14th century and continues to be propounded today, as by Solomon Landers, who considers it most likely that the fate of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter was perpetual virginity or solitary confinement.

Ethelbert William Bullinger, looks at the word &quot;and&quot; in Jephthah&#x27;s vow (Judges 11:31: &quot;whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord&#x27;s, &quot;and&quot; I will offer it up as a burnt offering&quot;). As he explains the Hebrew prefix &quot;ו&quot; that is translated in the above passage as &quot;and&quot; is often used as a disjunctive, and means &quot;or&quot;, when there is a second proposition. Indeed, this rendering is suggested in the margin of the A.V. Bullinger goes on to give examples from the Bible where the same word has been translated as &quot;or&quot;. According to him, the right translation of this passage is: &quot;whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord&#x27;s, &quot;or&quot; I will offer it up as a burnt offering.&quot; Jephthah&#x27;s daughter, being the first that came out of the house, was thus, according to Bullinger, dedicated to God. He also says:
However, in the Hebrew Bible, the same word for &#x27;burnt offering&#x27; (Hebrew, &quot;ʿōlāh&quot;) used in reference to Jephthah and his daughter in Judges 11:31 is also used in other Biblical stories alluding to human sacrifice, such as the story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22) and Mesha of Moab and his son (2 Kings 3:27). Moreover, an &quot;ʿōlāh&quot; in the Hebrew Bible exemplifies a pure gift to the deity. Thus, Jephthah is not stating an alternative between dedicating something to God and offering it up as a burnt offering, but clearly linking the two.

&quot;Adam Clarke&#x27;s Commentary&quot; has an exposition of the issues at stake in this passage and contends that the vow Jephthah made was not as rash as it sounds.

The Order of the Eastern Star refers to her as Adah.

=== Possible origins ===
Israel Finkelstein has suggested that behind multiple and large-scale Deuteronomistic and post-Deuteronomistic additions and redactions, there may lie an oral story which reflects a conflict on the boundary between Israelite and Ammonite settlements in Transjordan, around the towns of Gilead and Mizpah. It may have been first written down in the 8th century BCE, when the Northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria) began to collect its heroic tales, royal stories, and foundation myths. Finkelstein has also suggested that the story of Jephthah&#x27;s vow may have been added into the story as late as the Hellenistic period.

Some observers have noted the similarities between Jephthah and the mythical Cretan general, Idomeneus, as related by Servius the Grammarian in his &quot;Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil&quot;. Idomeneus had asked the gods to calm a storm, promising in return that he would sacrifice the first living thing he saw upon his return, which turned out to be his son. The similarity has caused some to wonder if they share a common ancestor.

A similar story about Meander is given by Pseudo-Plutarch.

The story of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter is also sometimes compared to that of Agamemnon&#x27;s daughter Iphigenia. In his play &quot;Jephthas sive votum – Jeptha or the Vow&quot;, the Scottish scholar and dramatist George Buchanan (1506–1582) called Jephthah&#x27;s daughter &quot;Iphis&quot;, obviously alluding to Iphigenia, and Handel&#x27;s 1751 oratorio, &quot;Jephtha&quot;, based on Buchanan&#x27;s play, uses the same name.

== Burial ==
According to an early Jewish tradition, Jephthah was buried in Ajloun, a town in present-day Jordan.

== Cultural influence ==

The story of Jephthah has influenced a number of literary works.

*&quot;Historia di Jephta&quot;, an oratorio by Giacomo Carissimi.
*&quot;Jephthes, sive Votum&quot;, a tragedy by George Buchanan (1554).
*&quot;Jeptha of Offerbelofte&quot;, a play by Joost van den Vondel (1659), a reworking in Dutch of the play by Buchanan.
*&quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, A political and theological book John Locke (1689) challenging the divine right of kings, using Jephthah to demonstrate his &quot;appeal to heaven&quot; for changing government by the use of force in the absence of an earthly authority to petition to. See Book II, section 21. This concept is extremely important in first amendment jurisprudence, and is one of the strongest arguments against temporary restraining orders that enjoin speech, also known as a prior restraint, because of how dangerous they are. See for example &quot;Milk Wagon Drivers v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc.&quot; 312 U.S. 287,293 (1941).
*&quot;Jephté&quot;, a tragedy by Charles Piroye (1703). 
*&quot;Jephté&quot;, an opera by Michel Pignolet de Montéclair (1732).
*&quot;Jephtha&quot;, an oratorio by Maurice Greene (1737).
*&quot;Jephtha&quot;, an oratorio by George Frideric Handel (1751).
*&quot;Jephtas Gelübde&quot;, an opera by Meyerbeer (1812).
*&quot;Jephtha&quot; an oratorio by John H. Hewitt (1846).
*&quot;The Vow&quot;, a one-act opera by based on the story Colin McAlpin (1915).
* The story of Jephthah and his daughter is the subject of Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Jefta und seine Tochter&quot; (1957), English translation, &quot;Jephta and His Daughter&quot;, also known as &quot;Jephthah and His Daughter&quot;, published 1958
* In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Polonius tells Hamlet &quot;If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter I love passing well.&quot;
* The 2015 winner of the BP Portrait Award, &quot;Annabelle and Guy&quot; by Matan Ben-Cnaan was inspired by the story of Jephthah and his daughter.
* The 2008 novel &quot;Ever&quot; by Gail Carson Levine is based on the story of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter; Judges 11:34 is quoted in the foreword, and the plot follows the story of a girl in a Bronze Age Middle Eastern–inspired society whose father promises to sacrifice to his god the first person who congratulates him on his wife&#x27;s recovery from an illness.
* The song &quot;Burn, Baby Burn&quot; by The Residents (from their album &quot;&quot;) is inspired by the story of Jephthah.

<doc id="154512" wikidata="Q250160" url="?curid=154512" title="Ganguro">
<text>is an alternative fashion trend among young Japanese women which peaked in popularity around the year 2000 and evolved from &quot;gyaru&quot;.

The Shibuya and Ikebukuro districts of Tokyo were the centres of &quot;ganguro&quot; fashion; it was started by rebellious youth who contradicted the traditional Japanese concept of beauty; pale skin, dark hair and neutral makeup tones. &quot;Ganguro&quot; instead tanned their skin, bleached their hair and used colourful makeup in unusual ways.

&quot;Ganguro&quot; has a connection to Japanese folklore of ghosts and demons who are depicted with a similar appearance, such as those in kabuki and noh costumes. This connection is further underlined by the off-shoot style &quot;yamanba&quot;, named after a mountain witch in Japanese folklore.

The &quot;ganguro&quot; trend started in the mid-1990s and reached its peak by the latter half of the decade; it purportedly became almost obsolete by 2000 when a (light skin) craze emerged among young women who wanted to imitate the look of their favourite popular singers, specifically Ayumi Hamasaki, who debuted at the time. The &quot;ganguro&quot; trend faded out afterwards, although its influence can be observed in &quot;yamanba&quot; style.

==Characteristics==
Ganguro appeared as a new fashion style in Japan in the mid-1990s and was prevalent mostly among young women. In &quot;ganguro&quot; fashion, a deep tan is combined with hair dyed in shades of red to blonde, or a silver grey known as &quot;high bleached&quot;. Black ink is used as eyeliner and white concealer is used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often added to this. Platform shoes and brightly coloured outfits complete the &quot;ganguro&quot; look. Also typical of &quot;ganguro&quot; fashion are tie-dyed sarongs, miniskirts, stickers on the face, and many bracelets, rings, and necklaces.

Ganguro falls into the larger subculture of , a slang term used for various groups of young women, usually referring to overly childish women. Researchers in the field of Japanese studies believe that &quot;ganguro&quot; is a form of revenge against traditional Japanese society due to resentment of neglect, isolation, and constraint of Japanese society. This is their attempt at individuality, self-expression, and freedom, in open defiance of school standards and regulations.

&quot;Ganguro&quot; can be used to describe girls, or gals, with tan, lightened hair and some brand clothing; they can often be confused with &quot;Oneegyaru&quot; (Big Sister Gal) and &#x27; (Celeb), although &quot;Oneegyaru&quot; is usually associated with expensive gal brands and &#x27; focuses on expensive western fashions.

Fashion magazines like &quot;Egg&quot; and &quot;Ageha&quot; have had a direct influence on the &quot;ganguro&quot;. Other popular &quot;ganguro&quot; magazines include &quot;Popteen&quot; and &quot;Ego System&quot;. The &quot;ganguro&quot; culture is often linked with &quot;para para&quot;, a Japanese dance style. However, most para para dancers are not ganguro, and most ganguro are not para para dancers, though there are many who are ganguro or gal and dance para para.

One of the most famous early &quot;ganguro&quot; girls was known as Buriteri, nicknamed after the black soy sauce used to flavor yellowtail fish in teriyaki cooking. &quot;Egg&quot; made her a star by frequently featuring her in its pages during the height of the &quot;ganguro&quot; craze. After modeling and advertising for the Shibuya tanning salon &quot;Blacky&quot;, social pressure and negative press convinced Buriteri to retire from the &quot;ganguro&quot; lifestyle.

===Yamanba ===
, also sometimes shortened to just , is a more extreme style that evolved from &quot;ganguro&quot;. Old school &quot;yamanba&quot; featured deep tans and white lipstick, pastel eye makeup, tiny metallic or glittery adhesives below the eyes, brightly colored circle lenses, vibrant clothing, and incongruous accessories, such as Hawaiian &quot;leis&quot;. While yamanba faded in popularity it also started to become more extreme, with multicolored and usually synthetic hair. &quot;Manba&quot; in 2008 saw a darker tan, and no facial stickers. Hair was usually neon/bright colors, with pink being a favorite. Wool-emulating dreadlocks, extensions, and clips were worn to make the hair appear longer. Clothing remained the same, although &quot;leis&quot; were worn less frequently.

The male equivalent is called a Sentaa Guy (&quot;センターガイ&quot;), a pun on the name of a popular pedestrian shopping street near Shibuya Station in Tokyo called .

==Etymology==
Ganguro practitioners say that the term derives from the phrase . The word &quot;&quot; can be translated as &quot;burn-black look&quot;, and &quot;dark tanning&quot;.

The term &quot;&quot; is derived from Yama-uba, the name of a mountain hag in Japanese folklore whom the fashion is thought to resemble.

<doc id="154515" wikidata="Q296785" url="?curid=154515" title="Tōgō Heihachirō">
<text>, served as a &quot;gensui&quot; or admiral of the fleet in the Imperial Japanese Navy and became one of Japan&#x27;s greatest naval heroes. As Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, he successfully confined the Russian Pacific naval forces to Port Arthur before winning a decisive victory over a relieving fleet at Tsushima in May 1905. Western journalists called Tōgō &quot;the Nelson of the East&quot;. He remains deeply revered as a national hero in Japan, with shrines and streets named in his honour.

==Early life==

Tōgō was born as Tōgō Nakagorō (仲五郎) on 27 January 1848 in the Kajiya-chō (加治屋町) district of the city of Kagoshima in Satsuma domain (modern-day Kagoshima Prefecture), the third of four sons of Togo Kichizaemon, a samurai serving the Shimazu daimyō as controller of the revenue, master of the wardrobe, and district governor, and Hori Masuko (1812–1901), a noblewoman from the same clan as her husband.

Kajiya-chō was one of Kagoshima&#x27;s &quot;samurai&quot; housing-districts, in which many other influential figures of the Meiji period were born, such as Saigō Takamori and Ōkubo Toshimichi. They rose to prominent positions under the Meiji Emperor partly because the Shimazu clan had been a decisive military and political factor in the Boshin War against the Tokugawa shogunate during the Meiji Restoration.

As a youth, Tōgō was educated to become a samurai warrior. He changed his name to Heihachirō (meaning &quot;peaceful son&quot;) in a religious and patriotic ceremony held when he turned 13, in which samurai tradition called for youth to adopt a change in name (genpuku).

==Tokugawa conflicts (1863–1869)==
Tōgō&#x27;s first experience at war was during the Bombardment of Kagoshima in August 1863, in which Kagoshima was shelled by the Royal Navy to punish the Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot; for the death of Charles Lennox Richardson on the Tōkaidō highway the previous year (the Namamugi Incident), and the Japanese refusal to pay an indemnity in compensation. Tōgō, who was aged 15 at the time, was part of a gun crew manning one of the cannons defending the port.

The following year, Satsuma established a navy, in which Tōgō enlisted in 1866 at age 17. Two of his brothers also enlisted. In January 1868, during the Boshin War, Tōgō was assigned to the paddle-wheel steam warship , which participated in the Battle of Awa, near Osaka, against the navy of the Tokugawa &quot;Bakufu&quot;, the first Japanese naval battle between two modern fleets.

As the conflict spread to northern Japan, Tōgō participated as a third-class officer aboard the &quot;Kasuga&quot; in the last battles against the remnants of the &quot;Bakufu&quot; forces, the Battle of Miyako Bay and the Battle of Hakodate in 1869.

After the civil war ended in the autumn 1869, Tōgō, on the instructions of the Satsuma clan, first travelled to the treaty port of Yokohama to study English. He resided in Yokohama with Daisuke Shibata, a government official reputedly proficient in English and received additional pronunciation coaching from Charles Wagman, Japan correspondent of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. Tōgō made rapid progress in his studies and in 1870 secured a place at the newly established Imperial Japanese Navy Training School at Tsukiji, Tokyo. On 11 December 1870 he was formally appointed a cadet on the Japanese ironclad flagship , then at anchor in Yokohama harbour.

==Studies in Britain (1871–1878)==

In February 1871, Tōgō and eleven other Japanese officer cadets were selected to travel to Britain to further their naval studies. Between extensive practical sea training and an extended voyage to Australia, Tōgō lived and studied in Britain for a period of seven years. Arriving at the port of Southampton in April 1871 after a journey of 80 days, Tōgō first traveled to London, at that time the most populous city in the world. According to contemporary accounts of the cadet&#x27;s first days in England, many things were strange to Japanese eyes at that time; the domed buildings made out of stone, the &quot;number and massiveness of the buildings&quot;, &quot;the furnishings of a commonplace European room&quot;, and &quot;the displays in the butchers&#x27; shop windows: it took them several days to become accustomed to such an abundance of meat.&quot;

The Japanese group was separated and sent to English boarding houses for individual instruction in English language, customs and manners. Tōgō was initially sent for some weeks to a boarding house in the major naval port of Plymouth, to gain some understanding of the British Royal Navy. Subsequently, he studied history, mathematics and engineering at a naval preparatory school in Portsmouth under the direction of a tutor and local clergyman in order to prepare for admission to the training establishment &quot;Britannia&quot; at Dartmouth, Devon.

After the British Admiralty decided in 1872 that no places were to be made available at Dartmouth for the Japanese cadets, Tōgō was able to gain admission as a cadet on , the training ship of the Thames Nautical Training College, moored at Greenhithe. Tōgō found his cadet rations &quot;inadequate&quot;: &quot;I swallowed my small rations in a moment. I formed the habit of dipping my bread in my tea and eating a great deal of it, to the surprise of my English comrades.&quot; Tōgō&#x27;s comrades called him &quot;Johnny Chinaman&quot;, being unfamiliar with the &quot;Orient&quot; and not knowing the difference between Asiatic peoples. &quot;The young &quot;samurai&quot; did not like that, and on more than one occasion he would threaten to put an end to it by blows.&quot; Gunnery training for the college was held aboard , at the time moored in Portsmouth harbour. Tōgō is recorded to have attended Trafalgar Day observances on the deck of the ship in 1873. After two years of training, Tōgō was to graduate second in his class.

During 1875, Tōgō circumnavigated the world as an ordinary seaman on the British training ship &quot;Hampshire&quot;, leaving in February and staying seventy days at sea without a port call until reaching Melbourne. Tōgō &quot;observed the strange animals on the Southern continent&quot;. Rounding Cape Horn on his return voyage, Tōgō had sailed thirty thousand miles before returning to England in September 1875. During the autumn and winter of 1875–1876, Tōgō spent five months in Cambridge studying mathematics and English under the direction of the Rev. Arthur Douglas Capel. The Rev. Capel was at the time of Tōgō&#x27;s visit, both a mathematics tutor and curate at the Anglican church of Little St Mary&#x27;s, Cambridge. Tōgō is recorded to have attended services at the church during his stay.

In 1875 Tōgō suffered a bout of illness which severely threatened his eyesight: &quot;the patient asked his medical advisers to &#x27;try everything&#x27;, and some of their experiments were extremely painful.&quot; Capel commented later, &quot;If I had not seen with my own eyes what a Japanese can suffer without complaint, I should often have been disinclined to believe ... But, having observed Tōgō, I believe all of them.&quot; Harley Street ophthalmologists were able to save his eyesight. Upon recovery Tōgō travelled to Portsmouth to continue his training before being assigned the role of inspector for the construction of , one of three new warships ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Residing in proximity to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, Tōgō made use of the opportunity to apply his training, observing the construction of the ship at the Samuda Brothers shipyard on the Isle of Dogs.

Tōgō was absent from Japan during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. His three brothers all fought in the rebellion: two were killed in battle, and the third died shortly after the rebellion&#x27;s end. Later, Tōgō would often express regret for the fate of his benefactor, Saigō Takamori.

==Return to Japan==

Tōgō, newly promoted to lieutenant, finally returned to Japan on 22 May 1878 aboard one of the newly purchased British-built ships, . That same year, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant of the Japanese built paddle-steamer warship , later to be transferred to the corvette . In 1882, Tōgō led his ship&#x27;s company in landing troops at Seoul in the wake of the Imo Incident.

In 1883, Tōgō was given command of his first ship, and interacted with the British, American, and German fleets during this time.

==Sino-French War (1884–1885)==
On his return to Japan Tōgō received several commands, first as captain of &quot;Daini Teibō&quot;, and then &quot;Amagi&quot;. During the Sino-French War (1884–1885), Tōgō, onboard &quot;Amagi&quot;, closely followed the actions of the French fleet under Admiral Courbet.

Tōgō also observed the ground combat of the French forces against the Chinese in Formosa (Taiwan), under the guidance of Joseph Joffre, future Commander-in-Chief of French forces during World War I.

Although first promoted to the rank of captain in 1886, Tōgō suffered from a bout of acute rheumatism during the late 1880s that confined him to bed rest for nearly three years. He used this period of enforced absence from front line naval duties to study aspects of international and maritime law.

==Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)==

In 1891, Tōgō&#x27;s health had sufficiently recovered that he was appointed to the command of the cruiser . In 1894, at the beginning of the First Sino-Japanese War, Tōgō, as a captain of &quot;Naniwa&quot;, sank the transport ship, &quot;Kowshing&quot;, which was chartered by the Chinese Beiyang Fleet to convey troops, during the Battle of Pungdo. A report of the incident was sent by Suematsu Kenchō to Mutsu Munemitsu. The ship, which was under the command of captain T.R. Galsworthy, who incidentally had been one of Tōgō&#x27;s instructors as a young cadet on HMS &quot;Worcester&quot;, had been ferrying more than a thousand Chinese soldiers towards Korea, and these soldiers had refused to be taken prisoner or interned on the appearance and under threat from the Japanese warships.

A contemporary account from a German survivor, Major von Hannecken, stated that the Chinese survivors had been fired upon, sinking two lifeboats.
&quot;...By this time only the &quot;Kowshing&quot;&#x27;s masts were visible. The water was however covered with Chinese, and there were two lifeboats from the &quot;Kowshing&quot; crowded with soldiers. The Japanese officer informed me that he had been ordered by signal from the &quot;Naniwa&quot; to sink these boats. I remonstrated, but he fired two volleys from the cutter, turned back, and steamed for the &quot;Naniwa&quot;. No attempt was made to rescue the Chinese. The &quot;Naniwa&quot; steamed about until eight o&#x27;clock in the evening, but did not pick up any other Europeans ...&quot;

Tōgō later took part in the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, with &quot;Naniwa&quot; as the last ship in the line of battle under the overall command of Admiral Tsuboi Kōzō. &quot;Naniwa&quot; assisted in sinking the Chinese cruisers and .

Tōgō was promoted to rear admiral at the end of the war, in 1895.

==Subsequent commands==
In May 1896, Tōgō was appointed commandant of the Naval War College in Tokyo. He reformed the curriculum, and was promoted to vice admiral during this time. In 1899, he was appointed commander of the Sasebo Naval College, and he also served as Commander of the Standing Fleet.

With the advent of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1899, Tōgō was appointed Admiral of the Fleet and recalled to active sea duty on 20 May 1900. During the rebellion, he was responsible for patrolling the Chinese coast. As the Boxer Rebellion was crushed in 1902, Tōgō was relieved of his command, and was decorated for his service to the Emperor. He was subsequently posted to supervise the construction of and become the first commander of the naval base at Maizuru.

==Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)==


In 1903, the Navy Minister Yamamoto Gonnohyōe appointed Tōgō Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy. This astonished many people, including Emperor Meiji, who asked Yamamoto why Tōgō was appointed. Yamamoto replied to the emperor, &quot;Because Tōgō is a man of good fortune&quot;.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Tōgō engaged the Russian navy at Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea in 1904, and to widespread international acclaim commanded the Japanese naval forces at the destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905.

The Battle of Tsushima was considered a daring naval victory pitting a small but rapidly militarising emerging Asian nation against a major European adversary. Russia was at the time the world&#x27;s third-largest naval power. While the Japanese fleet at Tsushima lost only three torpedo boats under Tōgō&#x27;s command, of the 36 Russian warships that went into action, 22 were sunk (including seven battleships), six were captured, six were interned in neutral ports and only three escaped to the safety of Vladivostok.

Tsushima broke Russian naval dominance in East Asia, and is said to have been a contributing factor in subsequent uprisings in the Russian Navy (1905 uprisings in Vladivostok and the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; uprising), contributing to the Russian Revolution of 1905. Post-war investigations were held into Russian naval leaders during those battles in which Tōgō had prevailed, seeking the reasons behind their utter defeat. The Russian commander of the destroyed Baltic fleet, Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky (who was badly wounded in the battle) attempted to take full responsibility for the disaster, and the authorities (and rulers of Russia) acquitted him at his trial. However, they made Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov, who had tried to blame the Russian government, a scapegoat. Nebogatov was found guilty and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment in a fortress, but was released by the tsar after serving only two years.

==Later life==

Tōgō kept his journals in English, and wrote, &quot;I am firmly convinced that I am the re-incarnation of Horatio Nelson.&quot; In 1906, he was made a Member of the British Order of Merit by King Edward VII.

Tōgō was Chief of the Naval General Staff and was given the title of &quot;hakushaku&quot; (Count) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. He also served as a member of the Supreme War Council. In 1911, Tōgō returned to England for the first time in over 30 years to attend the coronation of King George V, the Coronation Fleet Review at Portsmouth, to attend naval alumni dinners and visit dockyards on the Clyde and in Newcastle.

In 1913, Admiral Tōgō received the honorific title of Marshal-Admiral, which is roughly equivalent to the rank of Grand Admiral or Admiral of the Fleet in other navies. From 1914 to 1924, &quot;Gensui&quot; Tōgō was put in charge of the education of Crown Prince Hirohito, the future Shōwa Emperor.

Tōgō publicly expressed a dislike and lack of interest for involvement in politics; however, he did make strong statements against the London Naval Treaty.

Tōgō was awarded the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1926, an honour that was held only by Emperor Hirohito and Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito at the time; the award made him Japan&#x27;s most decorated naval officer ever. He added the award to his existing Order of the Golden Kite (1st class) and already existing Order of the Chrysanthemum. His peerage was raised to that of &quot;kōshaku&quot; (marquis) in 1934, a day before his death.

Admiral Tōgō died at 6:35 am on 30 May 1934, of throat cancer at the age of 86. He was accorded a state funeral. The navies of the United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands, France, Italy and China all sent representatives and ships to a naval parade in his honour in Tokyo Bay.
In 1940, Tōgō Jinja was built in Harajuku, Tokyo, as the naval rival to the Nogi Shrine erected in the honour of Imperial Japanese Army General Nogi Maresuke. The idea of elevating him to a Shinto &quot;kami&quot; had been discussed before his death, and he had been vehemently opposed to the idea. There is another Tōgō shrine at Tsuyazaki, Fukuoka. The statues to him in Japan include one at Ontaku Shrine, in Agano, Saitama and one in front of the memorial battleship &quot;Mikasa&quot; in Yokosuka.

Tōgō&#x27;s son and grandson also served in the Imperial Japanese Navy. His grandson died in combat during the Pacific War on the heavy cruiser at the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
In 1958, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, an admirer of Tōgō, helped to finance the restoration of the &quot;Mikasa&quot;, Admiral Tōgō&#x27;s flagship during the Russo-Japanese war. In exchange, Japanese craftsmen created the Japanese Garden of Peace, a replica of Marshal-Admiral Tōgō&#x27;s garden, at the National Museum of the Pacific War (formerly known as The Nimitz Museum) in Fredericksburg, Texas.

==Family==

Tōgō&#x27;s wife was Kaieda Tetsu (1861–1934). The couple had two sons; the elder son, Hyō (1885–1969), succeeded his father as the second Marquis Tōgō in 1934 and held the title until the &quot;kazoku&quot; was abolished in 1947. The younger, Rear-Admiral Tōgō Minoru (1890–1962) followed his father into the navy, rising to the rank of rear-admiral and ending his career in 1943 as commander of the naval district in Fukuoka. His elder son Ryōichi, who became a naval lieutenant, was killed in action during the Second World War aboard the heavy cruiser &quot;Maya&quot;. Neither Tōgō Minoru nor Tōgō Ryōichi had the same naval &#x27;inclinations&#x27; as their famous ancestor; Tōgō Minoru placed 142nd out of 144 cadets in the Naval Academy&#x27;s 40th Class, while Tōgō Ryōichi graduated dead-last (625th out of 625 cadets) in the Naval Academy&#x27;s 72nd Class.

Tōgō Hyō married Ohara Haruko (1899–1985); the couple had one son, Kazuo (1919–1991) and two daughters, Ryōko (1917–1972) and Momoko (1925–). Kazuo married Amano Tamiko and had three daughters, Kikuko (1948–), Shoko (1952–) and Muneko (1956–). As Kazuo and his wife never had sons, to perpetuate the Tōgō name they adopted their son-in-law, Maruyama Yoshio (1942–), the husband of Kikuko. Kikuko and Yoshio have two sons; the elder, Yoshihisa (1971–), married Niimi Miyuki and has two sons, Ryūta (1991–) and Masahei (1993–).
Minoru married Akazaki Yae, and had three sons and a daughter, Ryōichi, Chūzō, Kenzō and Hisako. Kenzō&#x27;s son, Hiroshige Tōgō is a retired captain (一等海佐) of JMSDF.

==In popular culture==
Tōgō&#x27;s success in the Russo-Japanese War was seen as a source of inspiration for some Turks. Halide Edip Adıvar, a Turkish journalist and nationalist who was among the founders of modern Turkey, named one of her children Togo.

Tōgō was portrayed by Toshiro Mifune in the 1969 Japanese film &quot;The Battle of the Japan Sea&quot; (日本海大海戦), directed by Seiji Maruyama.

In the miniseries &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;, Tōgō is portrayed by Robert Ya Fu Lee.

In the game Civilization VI Togo Heihachiro is portrayed as a great admiral that can be earned and used in naval warfare.

<doc id="154518" wikidata="Q1463257" url="?curid=154518" title="The Real Slim Shady">
<text>&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; is a song by American rapper Eminem from his third studio album &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000). It was released as the lead single a month before the album&#x27;s release.

The song peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving him his biggest hit up to that point. It was also Eminem&#x27;s first song to reach number one in the UK and Ireland and the song was the 14th best selling of 2000 in the UK. It won multiple awards, including MTV Video Music Awards for Best Video and Best Male Video, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. In October 2011, &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 80 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. It was listed at number 396 on &quot;NME&quot;″s 500 greatest songs of all time.

==Production==
&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; was not originally intended to be part of &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;. Interscope Records&#x27;s Jimmy Iovine wanted Eminem to get a song to introduce the album, similar to the way &quot;My Name Is&quot; was the first single on &quot;The Slim Shady LP.&quot; Eminem, Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster and Mike Elizondo wrote &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; just hours before the final copy of the album was due. The first single was intended to be &quot;Who Knew&quot;.

The song&#x27;s first verse interpolated the 1999 novelty single &quot;Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)&quot; by Tom Green, and the intro and chorus of the song interpolate the famous catchphrase &quot;will the real _____ please stand up?&quot; from the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;PopMatters&quot; described the song as &quot;slamming their &#x27;enemies&#x27; with comic book intensity&quot;, while also noting its ironic themes surrounding the number of near-identical &quot;wannabes&quot; due to Eminem&#x27;s overall appearance, citing his &quot;signature style&quot; which bore &quot;bleached blond hair, pale skin, [and] humungous T-shirt&quot;. AllMusic highlighted the single.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the sound of the single as &quot;slick, bright, melodic funk that&#x27;s so R&amp;B-ish, you can dance to it&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Will Hermes was also positive, writing, &quot;In the aftermath of Slim Shady, he married the girlfriend he imagined killing, while his mother, immortalized in his hit single &#x27;My Name Is&#x27; (&quot;I just found out my Mom does more dope than I do&quot;), sued him for $10 million for defamation of character.&quot; The defamation case was settled in 2001 for $25,000 as Debbie Mathers&#x27; former attorney was awarded $23,354—netting Ms. Mathers just over $1600 for her efforts.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; favored &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; as a &quot;modest step to the mainstream—a fresh and funny, almost PG-rated swipe at everything from the Grammy Awards to shallow teen pop&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; wrote: &quot;The album&#x27;s obligatory &#x27;pop&#x27; number is exposed on &#x27;The Real Slim Shady,&#x27; which chugs and lurches along to a boinging electro funk beat. It would be a total pop smash if it weren&#x27;t for the lyrics, though. Leave it to Em to juice it up with ear candy effervescent, but keep the words in the subversive. As with the other Dre crafted tunes on the album, there&#x27;s plenty of cool special effects bustling about—fart noises, heavy breathing, all of it coalescing with Em&#x27;s cartoon character on crystal meth delivery. Sure it&#x27;s pop, but of the most demented nature.&quot;

The song has been included as part of many films, notably &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (2012) and &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; (2001).

==Music video==
Philip G. Atwell and Dr. Dre directed the music video filmed in April 7–10, 2000. Eminem&#x27;s friends and former group-mates from D12 including rappers Denaun Porter, Proof, Swifty McVay, Bizarre, Kuniva, and Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst are featured in the video along with him.

Actress and comedian Kathy Griffin, notable for insulting celebrities in her act, appears in the video as an attending nurse in a psychiatric ward. Griffin said during a July 21, 2005, interview on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that Eminem selected her for the video because fellow rapper Snoop Dogg told him she was &quot;really funny&quot;.

The music video has 1 billion views on YouTube as of October 2024, making it Eminem&#x27;s seventh video to cross the one billion mark.

<text>The University of Central Florida (UCF) is a public research university with its main campus in unincorporated Orange County, Florida, United States. It is part of the State University System of Florida. With 68,442 students as of the fall 2022 semester, UCF has the fourth-largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States. UCF is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

UCF was founded in 1963 and opened its first classes in 1968 as Florida Technological University, with the mission to provide personnel educated in science, technology, engineering and math to support the growing U.S. space program at the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (known at the time as Cape Kennedy Air Force Station) on Florida&#x27;s Space Coast. As its academic scope expanded beyond engineering and technology, Florida Tech was renamed the University of Central Florida in 1978. UCF continues to have space root connections, as it developed and oversees the Florida Space Institute, Robinson Observatory, manages the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, and is the leader of the NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium. Initial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students; enrollment in 2022 exceeds 68,000 students from over 150 countries, all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Most students attend classes on the university&#x27;s main campus, east of downtown Orlando and west of Cape Canaveral. UCF offers more than 230 degrees through 13 colleges including the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona Medical City, the Rosen College of Hospitality Management in south Orlando and the city campus in downtown Orlando. Since its founding, UCF has awarded more than 401,245 degrees, including over 60,000 graduate and professional degrees.

Its official colors are black and gold, and the university academic seal features Pegasus, which &quot;symbolizes the university&#x27;s vision of limitless possibilities&quot;. The university&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, known as the UCF Knights and represented by mascot Knightro, compete in NCAA Division I and in the Big 12 Conference, except for Men&#x27;s Soccer, which competes in the Sun Belt Conference.

==History==

===Founding===
Following President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s September 1962 speech &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot;, in which he described his goal of accomplishing a crewed space flight to the Moon by the end of the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former state senate president William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, on June 10, 1963, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions. Defense scientists and NASA met with students, recruiting for the space program.

On January 24, 1964, the board of regents purchased of remote forest and pasture land along Alafaya Trail (SR 434) in northeast Orlando for $500,000 as the site of the new university. Local residents donated another , and raised more than $1 million in funds to secure the land acquisition. In December 1965, the board of regents appointed Charles Millican the first president of the new university. With the consultation of a citizen advisory group, Millican chose the name Florida Technological University, as well as co-designed the school&#x27;s distinctive Pegasus seal. Millican is also responsible for the university&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;, for the two key principles of the school, &quot;accent on excellence&quot; and &quot;accent on the individual&quot;, and for the campus&#x27;s unique pedestrian-oriented concentric-circle layout, which was based on plans by Walt Disney and has become a model for other universities. Millican and then-Governor Claude Kirk presided over FTU&#x27;s groundbreaking in March 1967. On October 7, 1968, the inaugural classes were held in the school&#x27;s first academic building. 1,948 students were enrolled in 55 degree programs within five colleges, led by 90 instructors and aided by 150 staff members, during the university&#x27;s first year. FTU graduated its first class of 423 seniors on June 14, 1970, with astronaut and Orlando native John Young giving the commencement address.

Millican selected the university&#x27;s official colors, and had a role in selecting its first mascot, the Citronaut, a mix of an orange and an astronaut. The Citronaut proved unpopular, so in 1969 the student newspaper, &quot;The Central Florida Future&quot;, encouraged mascot suggestions from students and faculty. The search for a replacement proved unsuccessful until 1970, when Judy Hines, a night nurse, proposed Vincent the Vulture. He served as the university&#x27;s unofficial mascot for more than a year. In late 1971, students voted and selected the Knight of Pegasus as the school&#x27;s official athletic mascot. The nickname later evolved to the Golden Knights and eventually to the Knights.

After retiring as president in 1978, Millican identified his proudest moment leading the school as when President Richard Nixon delivered the university&#x27;s spring 1973 commencement address.

===Expansion===
Entering office in 1978, the university&#x27;s second president, Trevor Colbourn, recognized the diversification and growth of UCF&#x27;s academic programs away from its strictly technological and scientific beginnings. As the university developed strong business, education, and liberal arts programs, Colbourn recognized that the university&#x27;s name no longer reflected its mission. From its establishment the university was known as Florida Technological University, nicknamed Florida Tech, until December 1978 when Governor Reubin Askew signed legislation changing the school&#x27;s name to the University of Central Florida.

Colbourn established the university&#x27;s honors program, and started the university&#x27;s first satellite campus. In addition, he was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the UCF campus, founded in 1978. The park serves as a major focus of simulation for space and defense-related research. It was part of Colbourn&#x27;s plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university&#x27;s first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. Colbourn also supported the university&#x27;s athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school&#x27;s football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.

===Hitt presidency===
In March 1992, John C. Hitt became UCF&#x27;s fourth president, ushering in an era of unprecedented growth and prominence for the university. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standing while also evolving into a more traditional research university. When Hitt took office, UCF&#x27;s enrollment was 20,302. As of 2014, 60,821 students attend classes on 12 campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of 13 colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff. Under Hitt&#x27;s direction, UCF raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.

Hitt&#x27;s efforts resulted in not only an increase in the university&#x27;s academic profile, but also an on-campus football stadium, new basketball arena, more on-campus housing, and the development of the UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona. Until 1999, the Knights were represented by a jouster from the Medieval Times dinner show in nearby Kissimmee, Florida. That same year, Knightro was introduced at the staple homecoming event, Spirit Splash.

The past decade has seen enrollment increase by over 40%, the acceptance rate for first time in college students falling from over 60% to near 40% in 2008, and the doubling of expected annual expenses. Since 2000, UCF has awarded over 100,000 degrees. It is the largest university in the nation in terms of undergraduate enrollment, the largest university in Florida, and in 2003 was the fastest-growing university in the United States. During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, UCF awarded its 200,000th degree, less than five years after awarding its 150,000th.

==== Colbourn Hall scandal ====
In August 2018, the state university system&#x27;s Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature opened an investigation into the university for misuse of state funds. On September 13, 2018, UCF admitted to misappropriating money intended for educational and operating expenses to build the new $38 million Trevor Colbourn Hall, leading to the resignation of CFO Bill Merck. In January 2019, UCF severed ties with President Emeritus John Hitt after the investigation proved that UCF had misspent or planned to misspend over $85 million between 2013 and 2018. Newly appointed president Dale Whittaker, who was a provost at UCF during Hitt&#x27;s tenure, resigned in February 2019 after just seven months in office over allegations that he also knew about the misappropriation of funds. Board of Trustees Chairman Marcos Marchena also resigned that month. In August 2019, the final report into additional UCF construction projects revealed the balance of misdirected funds between July 2010 and August 2018 was $99.61 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The report found that key people in the university leadership were aware of the misdirection of the funds. UCF was fined by the state for 120% the cost of the misused funds. 

=== Cartwright presidency ===
Alexander Cartwright is the fifth and current president of UCF. He became the president on April 13, 2020, succeeding acting president Thad Seymore, who took over following Whittaker&#x27;s resignation in February 2019.

==Campuses==

===Main campus===
The University of Central Florida main campus is located along Alafaya Trail east of Orlando, Florida.

The campus is designed to be pedestrian-oriented, with a series of concentric circles. The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle.

Pegasus Circle contains the student union, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college. As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings&#x27; loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine. &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country in 2011.

Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities and on-campus residence.
The north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village with stores and restaurants, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida and the engineering wing.

The south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities, leisure pool, recreation park, and more student housing. Also located directly south of the main campus is Central Florida Research Park, which is the seventh largest research park in the nation and the largest in Florida, housing over 116 corporations. The park provides more than 10,000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni.

Main Campus is one of the safest branches nationally in comparison of all branches in the US. The percent of crimes in Main Campus decreased from 0.12% (in 2010) to 0.07% (in 2014) crimes per year.

===Regional campuses===
In addition to the Orlando campus, the University of Central Florida has several other campuses to service the Central Florida region.

In Orlando, there is another campus, located in downtown Orlando, the health sciences campus located at Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida. In addition, the Rosen College of Hospitality Management is located away from the main campus, in close proximity to the heart of Orlando&#x27;s tourism industries near Universal Studios and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

==== Downtown Campus ====
In 2019, a campus was opened in Downtown Orlando in collaboration with Valencia West. It includes the Dr. Phillips Academic Commons, the Union West, and the UCF Center for Emerging Media buildings.

==== Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona ====

The UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona includes the UCF College of Medicine and the Burnett Biomedical Sciences Building. The Burnham Institute for Medical Research, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute, turning the area into a medical city. The campus will also serve as the future home of the UCF College of Nursing and the newly approved UCF College of Dental Medicine. The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class in August 2009.

Upon completion of construction, the campus could accommodate as many as 5,000 upper division, professional, and graduate students and faculty members in the health-related programs, and include up to two million square feet of research and instruction space.

==Administration==

As a part of the State University System of Florida, UCF falls under the purview of the Florida Board of Governors. The University of Central Florida is headed by the board of trustees, which governs the university, consisting of 13 appointed to staggered five-year terms by the Florida Board of Governors. The Student Government president and the faculty chair also serve on the board for the duration of their one-year terms of office.

The president of the University of Central Florida is the university&#x27;s principal executive officer. The office was formed upon the university&#x27;s creation in 1963. The president is appointed by the board of trustees with the consent of the Florida Board of Governors and leads the university through its daily business. Today, the president&#x27;s office is in Millican Hall on the university&#x27;s main campus, and the president lives in the Burnett House, also on the main campus. The fourth president of UCF, John C. Hitt, served from 1992 to 2018 and was succeeded by incumbent university president Dale Whittaker. After Whittaker resigned in 2019, Thad Seymour Jr. was appointed from his previous position as UCF&#x27;s vice president for partnerships and chief innovation officer to serve as the university&#x27;s interim president until the board of trustees chould choose a replacement.

Due to cutbacks in federal, state and local budgets, UCF has had over $140 million in funds cut from its operating budget since 2008. This included a $53 million cut to UCF&#x27;s 2012–13 fiscal year budget by the Florida legislature. So far UCF has endured the budget cuts by implementing a hiring freeze, ending some faculty perks, such as free seminars, cutting executive pay, and wise management of funds. To help counter the budget decreases, the university received $18 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. UCF&#x27;s operating budget for the 2014–15 fiscal year is $1.5 billion, a 13.9% increase from the previous year. UCF&#x27;s financial endowment, administered by the University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc., was valued at $162 million in 2020.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
UCF&#x27;s admission rate for first-time-in-college freshmen has declined from 61% of prospective students admitted in the fall of 2005, to 42% for fall 2020.

34% of accepted applicants were in the top ten percent of their graduating class, while 72% of accepted applicants were in the top quarter of their high school class rankings. Freshmen enrolled in fall 2020 posted average SAT scores of 1320, ACT scores of 28.7 and average high school weighted GPAs of 4.18. UCF is in the top 20 percent of universities in the nation for SAT average and the top 25 percent for GPA average. 71% of undergraduates receive financial aid. 90% of students receive scholarships through the Florida Bright Futures program. Forty percent of incoming freshman received Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or an equivalent college credit upon entrance, while 30% of the freshman class received merit based scholarships. The retention rate of the 2010 freshman class was 87%.

More freshmen and transfer students applied to UCF during 2015 than any other public university in Florida, and UCF also awarded more bachelor&#x27;s degrees than any other Florida public university that year. In 2010, UCF was ranked 2nd in Florida, and 34th in the United States, by the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled. 335 National Merit Scholars enrolled at UCF for the fall 2020 term.

===Classification===

===Colleges===

The university houses 13 colleges, which offer 101 baccalaureate programs, 88 master&#x27;s programs, 31 doctoral programs, three specialist programs, and a professional program (medicine). In addition, 75% of the faculty have doctorate degrees, and 46% have tenure. The 13 colleges house 41 separate degree-granting departments and schools.

By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Sciences, the College of Business Administration, and the Health Professions and Sciences. At the graduate level, the College of Graduate Studies serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university. Graduate students are also students of one of the other 12 colleges at the university. The university is seeking approval for a College of Dental Medicine, which would be housed at the Health Sciences Campus in Lake Nona.
====The Burnett Honors College====
The University Honors Program, administered by the Burnett Honors College is designed for 500 accomplished incoming undergraduates annually. Undergraduates enrolled in the Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned research in the area of a sponsoring faculty member. Another program offered by the college is Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis.

====College of Medicine====
The UCF College of Medicine was established in 2006 by the Florida Legislature and the Florida Board of Governors to increase opportunities for medical education in Florida. The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class of 41 students on August 3, 2009, and eventually will produce about 120 medical graduates a year.

With more than 4,300 applications for 41 available positions, UCF broke the state university record for most applications, and for 2009 it was the most selective medical school in the country. For the class of 2014, there were 3,761 applicants and only 60 were accepted. This initial class had the highest average MCAT score, 32.2, and GPA, 3.8, of any incoming class of medical students in the state. The inaugural class had a median age of 28, with 25% of the class composed of out-of-state students. The charter class completed their first year of courses on the UCF main campus, while the Lake Nona Medical City was completed. Every member of the inaugural class received a full scholarship, including tuition and basic living expenses, for their entire four years at the university, valued at over $160,000.

The university aims for the college to become a research-intensive medical school, with the aid of the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, the UCF Lake Nona Cancer Center, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, Tavistock Group, and a M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute, all located on the College of Medicine&#x27;s Lake Nona campus.

====Rosen College of Hospitality Management====

Located near the Orange County Convention Center on Universal Boulevard in Downtown Orlando, the college&#x27;s campus is designed to imitate a resort-style feel, with various areas of the college named for major donors to the college (e.g. Disney Dining Room, Universal Orlando Library, Darden Auditorium, and the state-of-the-art Anheuser Busch Beer &amp; Wine Lab). Regular Shuttle service is offered on most days that class is in session to and from the UCF Main Campus.

The college features an on-site Campus Life Office and Career Services Office that coordinate on-campus activities and career development events in conjunction with the UCF Student Government Association. In 2005, the university opened two on-campus housing buildings, able to house 400 residents. The college offers a variety of student organizations including associations such as Eta Sigma Delta (International Hospitality Management Honor Society), National Society of Minorities in Hospitality, the Professional Convention Management Association, and the National Association of Catering Executives, and the Global Association of Christian Hospitality Professionals.

===Limited access programs===
Among the colleges, a number of undergraduate academic programs are termed &quot;limited access programs&quot; which are programs where student demand exceeds available resources thus making admission to such program competitive. Examples include academic programs taught under the Nicholson School of Communication and the music, theatre, dance, and medical laboratory sciences schools or departments. Students must apply to join these programs separately from admission to the university. Criteria for admission varies but is generally very selective and includes factors such as indicators of ability, performance, creativity, and talent. Arts programs require competitive auditions and have some of the smallest numbers of undergraduate majors in the university.

===Libraries===


UCF Libraries collections include over 2.2 million print volumes, 3.2 million microforms, 330,000 government documents, 10,000 full text electronic journal subscriptions, 660,000 e-books, 40,000 media titles, a base of 43,000 serial subscriptions, in addition to special collections and university archives materials. Notable collections within the library include the Bryant West Indies collection, the Van Sickle Leftist Pamphlet collection, the Book Arts Collection, collections of materials on tourism and hospitality, and materials on the history of Central Florida. UCF Libraries is a partner within the State University System of Florida Libraries.

Most of the print and media collection is housed in the John C. Hitt Library, which is located on UCF&#x27;s main campus and is open to students, faculty and the public seven days a week. The library is five stories tall, and was the first academic building on campus. Leonardo Nierman&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Flame of Hope&quot; is displayed outside the entrance to the building, and Nierman&#x27;s stained glass &quot;Genesis&quot; window is exhibited on the third floor of the library building. In 2012, the main campus library was dedicated to honor John C. Hitt, UCF&#x27;s fourth president, who at the time was celebrating his twentieth anniversary as university president. In addition to the John C. Hitt Library, Rosen College library, Downtown Library, Curriculum Materials Center, and the Harriet F. Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, UCF operates libraries at nine of its regional campuses throughout Central Florida.

The student newspaper, the &quot;Central Florida Future&quot;, at one time was housed on the upper floor of the library before moving to the Central Florida Research Park. In 1984, a complete renovation of the original library was undertaken, as well as an addition that more than doubled the size of the building. University president Trevor Colbourn dedicated the newly remodeled and expanded library in February 1985. A $64.4 million expansion of the Hitt Library, which would add of space, as well as an Automated Retrieval System was recently approved by the university&#x27;s board of trustees but may be delayed due to budget cuts.

In 2022, the library began working on its 21st Century Library Project, a multi-phased plan designed to create additional space for student learning, technology, collaboration, and research expansion. The project upon completion will include the construction of a four-story automated retrieval center, increased quiet study space, and the creation of additional research and writing facilities on the fifth floor.

==Research==
The University of Central Florida fosters research among its thirteen academic colleges and schools, partnerships with corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Disney, Boeing, L3Harris, Siemens, SpaceX, and Universal. UCF also houses a satellite campus in Cocoa, FL, near Kennedy Space Center. UCF is also a member of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council. The university has made noted research contributions to aerospace, optics, modeling and simulation, digital media, engineering and computer science, business administration, education, and hospitality management.

UCF is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, UCF spent $215.3 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 107th in the nation. In 2009, UCF directly influenced 26,000 jobs and $1.96 billion in economic activity. When UCF&#x27;s economic impact is combined with that of the Central Florida Research Park, the university and park influenced 46,000 jobs and $3.84 billion in economic activity in 2009. The new College of Medicine, which opened in August 2009, will create an estimated 30,000 local jobs and have an economic impact of $7.6 billion in its first few years.

Metropolitan Orlando sustains the world&#x27;s largest recognized cluster of modeling, simulation and training companies. Located directly south of the main campus is the Central Florida Research Park, which is one of the largest research parks in the nation, providing more than 10,000 jobs. Research Park is the 7th largest research park in the nation, with 2,700 Department of Defense, NASA personnel, and direct support contractors. Collectively, those defense organizations manage $5.2 billion in contracts every year. Many of the employees in Research Park work with UCF researchers and students on projects in the sciences, engineering, photonics and optics, modeling and simulation, and health-related fields.

The university also conducts research through numerous institutions and centers, including the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers, Florida Solar Energy Center, Institute for Simulation and Training and Institute for Economic Competitiveness.

===Space Institute===
UCF founded and governs the Florida Space Institute along with government partnerships such as NASA. As a result of their contributions, 17 UCF researchers had asteroids named after them. UCF researchers found and named a planet in 2012 after the discovery of UCF-1.01. The U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center is also managed by UCF. A 2015 &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; workforce study named UCF the No. 1 supplier of engineers to aerospace and defense industries.

Due to budget decreases and increased demands on the university, the UCF board of trustees, with the approval of the board of governors and the Florida legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year. For the 2020–21 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Graduate tuition costs were $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Tuition for the medical school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students. Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $22,2849 for Florida residents and $38,949 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students and $38,878 for out-of-state students. About 8% of tuition fees are allocated to support the university&#x27;s athletic programs.

UCF has over 400 registered student organizations, intramural sports, and an active Student Government Association. The university encourages student activism through organizations such as the Office of Student Involvement, the Multicultural Student Center, the Campus Activities Board, Volunteer UCF and Learning and Interacting with New Knights (LINK), an organization that fosters freshman involvement.

===Traditions===
Spirit Splash is a homecoming tradition at UCF, and is traditionally the only time during the year that students are allowed into the Reflecting Pond. It has been named the best college tradition in Florida by &quot;Florida Leader&quot; magazine, and among &quot;The 20 Best College Traditions&quot; by &quot;Business Insider&quot;.

Spirit Splash occurs the Friday before the Homecoming game, and serves as a pep rally where students descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined that the best way to protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.

One of the newest traditions on the UCF campus pertains to the Pegasus seal in the center of the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.

===Housing===
The university currently houses over 12,000 on-campus students in eight different communities. Residence hall style suites are available in the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students. Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time. Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well before the start of the fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.

In addition, about 3,750 beds are available at the university-affiliated housing communities of Knights Circle and The Pointe at Central, which are off-campus apartment communities owned by The University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc. and managed by Asset Living. These communities contain many UCF services such as Resident Assistants, UCF Police service, reduced rent and offer shuttle service to and from campus on class days. The university also administers NorthView, which is owned and operated by UCF and located directly north of the main campus in Oviedo. NorthView houses 600 students, and includes a , a Catholic Student Center, and a common space for other faith based organizations to use.

Greek housing is also available on the main campus in the Greek Park community, which consists of close to 500 beds. There are ten sororities and three fraternities housed on campus, with eleven fraternities offering housing off campus.

===Recreation and fitness===

Many different recreational organizations and facilities are available on the UCF campus. Lake Claire is an on-campus lake with canoes, kayaks, and pedal boats available for rent (free to UCF students), and a small beachfront. In addition, UCF&#x27;s Challenge Course is one of only five in the country to contain a high elements course.

UCF&#x27;s main campus boasts the Recreation and Wellness Center and is located on the south side of campus, adjacent to the Academic Village. The center is open to all students, and paid memberships are available for non-students. The Wellness Center offer programs to boost students&#x27; understanding of their health, provides discounted blood and STD testing, staffs certified personal trainers, and teaches methods to maintain good health.

The UCF Recreation and Wellness Center, which opened in 2002, is a building that comprises five programs: Intramural Sports, Sport Clubs, Outdoor Adventure, Fitness, and Aquatics. The main recreation center includes a custom climbing wall with more than 20 different routes, as well as, tennis courts, sand volleyball courts, a disc golf course, numerous intramural sports fields, a leisure pool, and an outdoor lap pool.

===Student government===

The University of Central Florida&#x27;s Student Government (UCF SG) is an advocacy group for the students who attend the university, representing the university&#x27;s approximately 70,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It is the largest student government within the state of Florida and one of the largest in the United States. UCF SG operates within a multimillion-dollar budget. It funds and operates five campus departments—the Recreation and Wellness Center, the Office of Student Involvement, Student Legal Services, the A&amp;SF Business Office, and the Student Union—while also providing around $1 million in funding to nearly 600 registered student organizations.

===Campus and area transportation===
The university campus is served by &quot;The Pegasus Express&quot; which serves the 11 shuttle routes on-campus. The Central Florida Research Park, Rosen College of Hospitality, Health sciences campus, and the Downtown city campus are all served by the regional campus shuttles, which has 15 routes and covers 22 off-campus UCF apartment complexes as well.

===Media===
KnightNews.com is the only digital student newspaper serving the UCF community, and it operates without oversight from the university administration. KnightNews.com won the College Press Freedom Award in 2016 for its work fighting for open government. A print newspaper, the &quot;Central Florida Future&quot;, was shut down in August 2016. The &quot;Future,&quot; which also ran without university oversight, was one of the largest student-run newspapers in the United States. It focused on campus and local news coverage, but also featured national and international stories. The university itself publishes two magazines, &quot;Centric&quot; and &quot;Pegasus.&quot; &quot;Centric&quot; is the official student magazine of the university, and &quot;Pegasus&quot; is the official university magazine.

The university has operated WUCF-FM, a NPR station, since 1978. The station broadcasts Jazz that reaches Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Brevard, Lake and Volusia counties in central Florida. They broadcast an Internet program that is heard worldwide. In 2011, the university purchased WUCF-TV, which is Central Florida&#x27;s only Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television station. As the region&#x27;s sole PBS affiliate, the station broadcasts to an estimated population of 4.6 million people in its aerial viewing area.

One limited access program at UCF is the Jazz Studies program, which launched a professional recording label for the university, Flying Horse Records. The program&#x27;s faculty group, The Jazz Professors, and their student group, The Flying Horse Big Band, have both issued professional recordings since 2011 for the university label.

===Greek life===

The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life at The University of Central Florida is separated into five divisions: UCF Greek Council, Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Panhellenic Council, and the Diversified Greek Council. The Order of Omega has a chapter at the university.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 18 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 12 sororities. In addition there are also many multicultural and honor Greek organizations. The Diversified Greek Council consists of 9 cultural organizations, four fraternities and five sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council comprises nine historically black organizations, five fraternities and four sororities. There are now also three recognized fraternal organizations for Christian students.

Greek life at the University of Central Florida involves more than 3,000 students in over 45 chapters. Approximately 11% of current undergraduate males and 9% of undergraduate females are members of either a sorority or fraternity.

The average GPA of Greek Life is higher than the overall university average. UCF&#x27;s Greek Life won the inaugural Mid-American Conference Grade Point Average Award, which is given to the university with the highest Greek GPA above their campus&#x27; non-Greek GPA.

==Athletics==
The University of Central Florida features a large variety of intercollegiate athletics teams, known as the &quot;UCF Knights&quot;, which compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the Big 12 Conference (except for the men&#x27;s soccer team which competes in the Sun Belt Conference).

UCF fields 15 varsity teams, 6 men, and 9 women. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer, and tennis. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, rowing, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

The Knights varsity teams have won numerous conference titles, and two national titles. UCF, as members of Conference USA (CUSA) between 2005 and 2013, were conference champions in football in 2007 and 2010, and women&#x27;s basketball in 2009 and 2010. The women&#x27;s volleyball team won the AIAW Small College Division national championship in 1978 (at the time the women&#x27;s sports equivalent of NCAA Division II; the NCAA did not sanction women&#x27;s sports until the 1980s), and the men&#x27;s basketball team reached the Division II Elite Eight the same year. The Knights only other national championship was in 2017, when they were named national champions in football by the Colley Matrix. While they did not play in that season&#x27;s College Football Playoff, they finished the 2017 season unbeaten; all other selectors named Alabama as the 2017 national champion. The Colley Matrix was the only one out of over 40 NCAA-recognized selectors to name UCF the national champions. As none of these national titles were awarded by the NCAA, this makes UCF one of only four schools in a power conference to never win an NCAA title.

The UCF cheerleading team, which is a club sport, has also captured national titles. They have won three at the College Cheerleading and Dance Team Nationals, in 2003, 2007, 2020 and 2024. As the reigning national champions, the cheerleading team was followed by WE tv&#x27;s cheerleading show, &quot;Cheerleader U&quot; in 2008.

The UCF varsity athletic program began during the 1969–70 academic year. Then known as the &quot;Florida Technological University Knights of Pegasus&quot;, the university was a charter member of the Sunshine State Conference in 1975. Since the 1970s, the UCF athletic programs have become a major competitor in college athletics. Their development culminated in the mid-2000s, when the Knights joined C-USA in 2005 and debuted a new athletic village in 2007. Advertised as &quot;Bringing the Knights home&quot;, the newly developed athletic village on the north end of campus known as Knights Plaza, consisted of a new 10,000-seat indoor sports venue now known as Addition Financial Arena, the new 45,000-seat football stadium known as FBC Mortgage Stadium, a new softball complex, and the first Division I indoor football practice facility in the state. The debut of the athletic village made UCF the first university to ever open a new football stadium and basketball arena during the same year. The athletic complex surrounding Knights Plaza also includes Jay Bergman Field, the UCF Soccer and Track Stadium and numerous practice facilities. To coincide with the opening of the athletic village, the university also debuted new athletic logos and an update to mascot Knightro.

The Knights football program began in 1979. UCF competed in the playoffs three times before ascending to the FBS level in 1996. The Knights have won two conference championships and four division titles. In UCF&#x27;s first year in CUSA, the team experienced the fourth-best turnaround in NCAA history by winning the conference&#x27;s eastern division and earning its first bowl berth in the 4th Annual Hawai&#x27;i Bowl. Celebrating their inaugural year in their new on-campus stadium, the 2007 UCF Football team won the CUSA Championship for the first time in the school&#x27;s history and the eastern division for the second time in three seasons, securing a berth to the school&#x27;s second bowl game, the 49th Annual AutoZone Liberty Bowl. During the 2010 season, for the first time in school history, the Knights garnered national rankings, finishing the season with a top–20 ranking. The Knights won the 2010 CUSA Championship game, securing a berth to the AutoZone Liberty Bowl in which the team earned their first-ever bowl victory, a 10–6 win over Georgia. In 2013, the Knights joined the American Athletic Conference (AAC) as a full member, won the conference&#x27;s inaugural football championship, and upset the sixth-ranked Big 12 Conference champion Baylor Bears in the 2014 Fiesta Bowl. In 2017, the Knights finished with the only undefeated season in the FBS after a third AAC Championship win and a victory over the eighth-ranked Auburn Tigers in the 2018 Peach Bowl.

The UCF men&#x27;s basketball team started in 1969 under head coach Torchy Clark. The Knights have advanced to the NCAA tournament ten times (four of which as members of Division I), including a trip to the Division II Final Four in 1978. The program has won seven conference regular-season championships and five conference tournament titles. The 2008–09 UCF men&#x27;s team featured senior Jermaine Taylor, who was one of the nation&#x27;s top scorers averaging over 20 points per game. Following a 10–0 start to the 2010–11 season, and being one of nine unbeaten teams, the Knights led by coach Donnie Jones and guard Marcus Jordan were nationally ranked for the first time in program history. In the 2016-17 season, newly hired head coach Johnny Dawkins took the Knights to a semi-final berth in the NIT for the first time in school history. UCF was a layup away from advancing to the Sweet Sixteen and beating Duke, the consensus number-one seed, in the 2019 NCAA tournament, as Coach Dawkins, with his son on the team, faced off against his own previous coach, Mike Krzyzewski.

The Knights main rival is the University of South Florida Bulls, with whom they share the War on I-4.

<text>The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (now more commonly rendered as The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe) is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published in 1719. Just as in its significantly more popular predecessor, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719), the first edition credits the work&#x27;s fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author. It was published under the considerably longer original title: &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Being the Second and Last Part of His Life, And of the Strange Surprising Accounts of his Travels Round three Parts of the Globe&quot;. Although intended to be the last Crusoe tale, the novel is followed by a non-fiction book involving Crusoe by Defoe entitled &quot;Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World&quot; (1720).

It has been speculated that the story is partially based on Moscow embassy secretary Adam Brand&#x27;s journal detailing the embassy&#x27;s journey from Moscow to Peking from 1693 to 1695.

==Plot summary==
The book starts with the statement about Crusoe&#x27;s marriage in England. He bought a little farm in Bedfordshire and had three children: two sons and one daughter. Our hero suffered a distemper and a desire to see &quot;his island.&quot; He could talk of nothing else, and one can imagine that no one took his stories seriously, except his wife. She told him, in tears, &quot;I will go with you, but I won&#x27;t leave you.&quot; But in the middle of this felicity, Providence unhinged him at once, with the loss of his wife.

===Crusoe&#x27;s return to his island===
At the beginning of 1693, Crusoe made his nephew the commander of a ship. Around the beginning of January 1694, Crusoe and Friday went on board this ship in the Downs on the 8th, then arrived at Crusoe&#x27;s Island via Ireland. They discovered that the English mutineers left on the island by Crusoe a decade earlier had been making trouble. But when the island fell under attack by cannibals, the various parties on the island were forced to work together under truce to meet the threat. Crusoe takes various steps to consolidate leadership on the island and assure the civility of the inhabitants, including leaving a quantity of needed supplies, setting up a sort of rule of law under an honour system and ensuring cohabitating couples are married. He also leaves additional residents with necessary skills. On the way to the mainland once again from Crusoe&#x27;s island, the ship is attacked by the cannibals. Friday dies from three arrow shots during an attempt to negotiate, but the crew eventually wins the encounter without further serious casualty.

===Crusoe&#x27;s adventures in Madagascar===
After having buried Friday in the ocean, the same evening they set sail for Brazil. They stayed for a long period there, then went directly over to the Cape of Good Hope. They landed on Madagascar where their nine men were pursued by three hundred natives, because one of his mariners had carried off a young native girl among the trees. The natives hanged this person, so the crew massacred 32 persons and burned the houses of the native town. Crusoe opposed all these, therefore he was marooned, and settled at the Bay of Bengal for a long time.

===Crusoe&#x27;s travels in Southeast Asia and China===
Finally, he bought a ship that later turned out to be stolen. Therefore, they went to the river of Cambodia and Cochinchina or the Bay of Tonquin, until they came to the latitude of 22 degrees and 30 minutes, and anchored at the island of Formosa (Taiwan). Then they arrived on the coast of China. They visited Nanking near the river of Kilam, and sailed southwards to a port called Quinchang. An old Portuguese pilot suggested that they go to Ningpo by the mouth of a river. This Ningpo was a canal that passed through the heart of that vast empire of China, crossed all the rivers and some hills by the help of sluices and gates, and went up to Peking, being near 270 leagues long. So they did, then it was the beginning of February, in the Old Style calendar, when they set out from Peking.

Then they travelled through the following places: Changu, Naum (or Naun, a fortified city), Argun(a) on the Chinese-Russian border (13 April 1703).

===Crusoe&#x27;s travels in Siberia===
Argun was the first town on the Russian border; then they went through Nertzinskoi (Nerchinsk), Plotbus, touched a lake called Schaks Ozer, Jerawena, the river Udda, Yeniseysk, and Tobolsk (from September 1703 to beginning of June 1704). They arrived in Europe around the source of the river Wirtska, south of the river Petrou, in a village called Kermazinskoy near Soloy Kamskoy (Solikamsk). They passed a little river called Kirtza, near Ozomoys (or Gzomoys), came to Veuslima (?) on the river Witzogda (Vychegda), running into the Dwina, then they stayed in Lawrenskoy (3–7 July 1704; possibly Yarensk, known as Yerenskoy Gorodok at that time). Finally Crusoe arrived at the White Sea port town Arch-Angel (Archangelsk) on 18 August, sailed into Hamburg (18 September), and The Hague. He arrived at London on 10 January 1705, having been gone from England ten years and nine months.

<text>William Wake (26 January 165724 January 1737) was a priest in the Church of England and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1716 to his death.

==Life==
Wake was born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, and educated at Christ Church, Oxford. He took orders, and in 1682 went to Paris as chaplain to the ambassador; Richard Graham, Viscount Preston (1648–1695). There, he became acquainted with many of the savants of the capital, and was much interested in French clerical affairs. He also collated some Paris manuscripts of the &quot;Greek New Testament&quot; for John Fell, bishop of Oxford.

He returned to England in 1685. In 1688, he became preacher at Gray&#x27;s Inn, and in 1689, he received a canonry of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1693, he was appointed rector of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. Ten years later, he became Dean of Exeter, and in 1705, he was consecrated bishop of Lincoln. He was translated to the see of Canterbury in 1716 on the death of Thomas Tenison. Tenison had been his mentor and was responsible for his obtaining his bishopric despite the notable reluctance of Queen Anne, who regarded the appointment of bishops as her prerogative and distrusted Tenison&#x27;s judgment.

In 1718, he negotiated with leading French churchmen about a projected union of the Gallican and English churches to resist the claims of Rome. In dealing with Nonconformism, he was tolerant and even advocated a revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; if that would allay the scruples of dissenters.

His writings are numerous, the chief being his &quot;State of the Church and Clergy of England... historically deduced&quot; (London, 1703). In those writings, he produced a massive defence of Anglican Orders and again disproved the Nag&#x27;s Head Fable by citing a number of documentary sources. The work was written in part as a refutation of the arguments of the &quot;high church&quot; opposition to the perceived Erastian policies of King William and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison. He died at his official home, Lambeth Palace.

He was grandfather of the noted English geologist Etheldred Benett.

He was buried in Croydon Minster, in Surrey.

== Collections ==
Wake bequeathed his collections of printed books, manuscripts and coins to Christ Church. The manuscript volumes include 31 bound volumes of Wake&#x27;s correspondence.

To the collection of manuscripts belonged minuscule manuscripts of the New Testament: 73, 74, 506-520. These manuscripts came from Constantinople to England about 1731.

<doc id="154527" wikidata="Q1210734" url="?curid=154527" title="The 120 Days of Sodom">
<text>The 120 Days of Sodom, or the School of Libertinage () is an unfinished novel by the French writer and nobleman Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, written in 1785 and published in 1904 after its manuscript was rediscovered. It describes the activities of four wealthy libertine Frenchmen who spend four months seeking the ultimate sexual gratification through orgies, sealing themselves in an inaccessible castle in the heart of the Black Forest with 12 accomplices, 20 designated victims and 10 servants. Four aging prostitutes relate stories of their most memorable clients whose sexual practices involved 600 &quot;passions&quot; including coprophilia, necrophilia, bestiality, incest, rape, and child sexual abuse. The stories inspire the libertines to engage in acts of increasing violence leading to the torture and murder of their victims, most of whom are adolescents and young women.

The novel only survives in draft form. Its introduction and first part were written according to Sade&#x27;s detailed plan, but the subsequent three parts are mostly in the form of notes. Sade wrote it in secrecy while imprisoned in the Bastille. When the fortress was stormed by revolutionaries on 14 July 1789, Sade believed the manuscript had been lost. However, it had been found and preserved without his knowledge and was eventually published in a restricted edition in 1904 for its scientific interest to sexologists. The novel was banned as pornographic in France and English-speaking countries before becoming more widely available in commercial editions in the 1960s. It was published in the prestigious French Pléiade edition in 1990 and a new English translation was published as a Penguin Classic in 2016.

The novel attracted increasing critical interest after World War II. In 1957, Georges Bataille said it &quot;towers above all other books in that it represents man&#x27;s fundamental desire for freedom that he is obliged to contain and keep quiet&quot;. Critical opinion, however, remains divided. Neil Schaeffer calls it &quot;one of the most radical, one of the most important novels ever written&quot;, whereas for Laurence Louis Bongie it is &quot;an unending mire of permuted depravities&quot;.

== Text ==
Existing texts derive from an incomplete manuscript discovered after the storming of the Bastille in 1789. The novel consists of an introduction and four parts along with notes, supplements and addenda. Sade completed the introduction and first part in draft form. Parts Two to Four mainly consist of detailed notes. Sade did not revise and correct the draft he had completed and therefore there are some errors and inconsistencies.

==Plot==

&quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot; is set near the end of the reign of Louis XIV. Four wealthy libertines—the Duc de Blangis (representing the nobility), the Bishop of X*** (representing the clergy), the Président de Curval (representing the legal system), and Durcet (representing high finance)—lock themselves in an isolated castle, the Château de Silling, atop a mountain in the Black Forest, along with a number of accomplices and victims. Their main accomplices are four middle-aged women, who have spent their lives in debauchery and will recount stories of libertinage, torture, and murder for the pleasure and instruction of the male libertines, who will then seek to emulate these crimes on selected victims. Eight male accomplices, called &quot;fuckers&quot;, have been recruited for their large penises. The principal victims will be drawn from the libertines&#x27; four daughters, three of whom have been given in marriage to libertines other than their fathers. The other victims will be drawn from a harem of girls and boys, aged from 12 to 15. The libertines have also engaged other servants, including governesses, cooks, and scullery maids.

The orgy takes place from 1 November to 28 February and is organised according to rules and a strict timetable, to which each of the victims must adhere on pain of corporal punishment or death. Sex sessions are scheduled before and after a session of storytelling each evening. Each storyteller is on duty for a month, and each evening she recounts a story from her life that illustrates five &quot;passions&quot; (perversions of the laws of nature and religion). Over the four months, therefore, there will be 120 stories, illustrating 600 passions. These passions are in four categories of increasing complexity and savagery—simple, complex, criminal, and murderous. The four libertines frequently interrupt these stories to indulge in the described passions with the victims and others. They also emulate the passions in orgies after the stories are told.

* Introduction. The background to the 120-day orgy is presented in detail, along with character portraits of the four libertines and their daughters. Blangis opines that there is no god and that he is but a machine following the instincts given to him by Nature. Classification of deeds as virtue and vice are merely social conventions, and the only universal good is personal pleasure. Given that vice gives him the most pleasure, he is obeying Nature&#x27;s dictates by indulging his vices and passions.
* Part One. November, the simple passions. These anecdotes are written in detail. They are &quot;simple&quot; in the sense of not including sexual intercourse. The stories include sexual abuse of children, urine-drinking, vomit-drinking, coprophilia, and necrophilia. Blangis opines that Nature teaches us to hate our mothers. He later adds that crime is in itself pleasurable and thus in accordance with Nature. Curval, however, opines that after one commits the two or three greatest crimes, the pleasure palls. He would love to destroy the sun or use that star to burn the world.
* Part Two. December, the complex passions. These anecdotes, written in note form, involve acts such as men who vaginally rape children as young as three and indulge in incest and flagellation. There are tales of men who indulge in sacrilegious activities, such as having sex with prostitutes during Mass. The female children are raped vaginally during the evening orgies. Other elements of that month&#x27;s stories, such as whipping, are enacted.
* Part Three. January, the criminal passions. The notes outline tales of libertines who indulge in criminal activities, albeit stopping short of murder. They include men who sodomise girls as young as three, men who prostitute their daughters to others and watch the proceedings, and others who mutilate women by tearing off their fingers or burning them with red-hot pokers. During the month, the four libertines have anal sex with the sixteen male and female children, who, along with the other victims, are treated more brutally as time goes on, with regular beatings, whippings, and torture.
* Part Four. February, the murderous passions. The final 150 anecdotes, mostly written in note form, involve murder. They include libertines who skin children alive, disembowel pregnant women, burn entire families alive, and kill newborn babies in front of their mothers. The final tale is the only one written in detail since the simple passions of November: it features the &quot;hell libertine&quot;, who is manually stimulated by servants while watching 15 teenage girls being simultaneously tortured to death. During this month, the libertines kill three of their four daughters along with four of the female children, two of the male ones, and one &quot;fucker&quot;. The torture, murder, and mutilation of one of the girls is described in detail.
** March. Sade lists those who have been murdered during the 120 days. The libertines decide to spare 12 of the survivors and murder the rest. The ones spared are the four storytellers, four of the fuckers, the three cooks, and Julie. They draw up a schedule of executions, one to be carried out each day. Sade then presents a final tally: 10 were murdered in the course of the orgies, 20 were killed from 1 March, and 16 returned to Paris.

==Characters==
Four male libertines:

* The Duc de Blangis is a 50-year-old aristocrat who acquired his wealth by poisoning his mother for her inheritance. He also murdered his sister and three wives. He is tall, strong, and has a large penis and a voracious sexual appetite. He has murdered women during sexual intercourse but is a coward.
* The Bishop of X*** is Blangis&#x27;s 45-year-old brother. He acquired his wealth by murdering two youths in his care and stealing their inheritance. He shares his brother&#x27;s vices but is scrawny and weak. His passion is active and passive sodomy, and he also enjoys combining murder with sex. He is a misogynist who refuses to have vaginal intercourse.
* The Président de Curval is 60, lanky and &quot;frightfully dirty about his body&quot;. He is a mysophiliac. He is a former judge who enjoyed sentencing the innocent to death. He once raped a young girl and forced her and her mother to watch the execution of the girl&#x27;s father. He then murdered the two females.
* Durcet is a banker aged 53. He is short, chubby and pale, with a woman&#x27;s figure. He murdered his mother, wife, and her niece to obtain a sizable inheritance. He is effeminate and his main passions are passive sodomy and fellatio. He has been in a sexual relationship with Blangis since their adolescence.

Their accomplices are:

* The storytellers. Four middle-aged female debauchées who will relate anecdotes of their depraved careers to inspire the four principal characters into similar acts of depravity.
** Madame Duclos is 48, witty, and still fairly attractive and well-kept.
** Madame Champville is 50, a lesbian, and likes having her clitoris tickled. She is a vaginal virgin, but her rear is flabby and worn from use, so much so that she feels nothing there.
** Madame Martaine is 52 and prefers anal sex. A natural deformity prevents her from having vaginal intercourse.
** Madame Desgranges is 56, pale and emaciated, with dead eyes, whose anus is so enlarged she does not feel anything there. She is missing one nipple, three fingers, six teeth, and an eye. She is witty and the most depraved of the four; a murderer, rapist, and general criminal.
* Eight &quot;fuckers&quot; who are chosen chiefly because of their large penises. The four who are not identified by name are referred to only as &quot;second-rank fuckers&quot;, and are killed in the final massacres during March.
** Hercule, 26
** Antinoüs, 30
** Bum-Cleaver (French: &quot;Brise-Cul&quot;, &quot;Break-Arse&quot;)
** Invictus (French: &quot;Bande-au-ciel&quot;, &quot;Erect-to-the-sky&quot;)

The victims are:

* The daughters of the four principal characters, whom they have been sexually abusing for years. All of them are murdered except Julie, who is spared after proving herself a libertine.

:* Constance is 22. She is the daughter of Durcet and married to Blangis. She is tall, black-haired, attractive and completely ignorant of religion.
:* Adelaide is 20. She is the daughter of Curval and married to Durcet. She is small, slightly built, blonde, romantic, virtuous and devoutly religious.
:* Julie is 24. She is the daughter of Blangis and married to Curval. She is tall, plump and brown-haired. She has a stinking mouth and very poor anal and vaginal hygiene. She is corrupt.
:* Aline is 18. She is the daughter of the Bishop and mistress of Blangis. She is tall and shapely, healthy, sober, clean, practically illiterate, and totally ignorant of religion.

* Eight boys and eight girls aged from 12 to 15, chosen for their beauty, virginity and high social status.
:The girls:
::*Augustine, 15
::*Fanny, 14
::*Zelmire, 15
::*Sophie, 14
::*Colombe, 13
::*Hébé, 12
::*Rosette, 13
::*Michette, 12

:The boys:
::*Zélamir, 13
::*Cupidon, 13
::*Narcisse, 12
::*Zéphyr, 12
::*Céladon, 14
::*Adonis, 15
::*Hyacinthe, 14
::*Giton, 12
* Four middle-aged women, chosen for their ugliness to stand in contrast to the children, are brought along to serve as duennas.
** Marie, 58, who strangled all 14 of her children and one of whose buttocks is consumed by an abscess.
** Louison, 60, stunted, hunchbacked, blind in one eye and lame.
** Thérèse, 62, has no hair or teeth. Her anus is dirty and resembles the mouth of a volcano. All of her orifices stink.
** Fanchon, 69, is short and heavy, with large haemorrhoids. She is usually drunk, vomits constantly, and has faecal incontinence.

The libertines also recruit three female cooks (who are spared because of their skill) and three scullery maids.

==Manuscript history==
Sade wrote &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot; over 37 days in 1785 while he was imprisoned in the Bastille. Being short of writing materials and fearing confiscation, he wrote it in tiny writing on a continuous roll of paper, made up of individual small pieces of paper smuggled into the prison and glued together. The result was a scroll long and wide that Sade would hide by rolling it tightly and placing it inside his cell wall. As revolutionary tension grew in Paris, Sade incited a riot among the people gathered outside the Bastille when he shouted to them that the guards were murdering inmates; as a result, two days later on 4 July 1789, he was transferred to the asylum at Charenton, &quot;naked as a worm&quot; and unable to retrieve the novel in progress. Sade believed the work was destroyed when the Bastille was stormed and looted on 14 July 1789, at the beginning of the French Revolution. He was distraught over its loss and wrote that he &quot;wept tears of blood&quot; in his grief.
However, the scroll was found and removed by a citizen named Arnoux de Saint-Maximin two days before the storming. Historians know little about him or why he took the manuscript. It was passed to the Villeneuve-Trans family and sold to a German collector around 1900. It was first published in 1904 by the Berlin psychiatrist and sexologist Iwan Bloch (who used a pseudonym, &quot;Dr. Eugen Dühren&quot;, to avoid controversy). Viscount Charles de Noailles, whose wife Marie-Laure was a direct descendant of Sade, bought the manuscript in 1929. It was inherited by their daughter Natalie, who kept it in a drawer on the family estate. She would occasionally bring it out and show it to guests, among them the writer Italo Calvino. Natalie de Noailles later entrusted the manuscript to a friend, Jean Grouet. In 1982, Grouet betrayed her trust and smuggled the manuscript into Switzerland, where he sold it to Gérard Nordmann for $60,000. An international legal wrangle ensued, with a French court ordering it to be returned to the Noailles family, only to be overruled in 1998 by a Swiss court that declared it had been bought by the collector in good faith.

It was first put on display near Geneva in 2004. Gérard Lhéritier bought the scroll for his investment company for €7 million, and in 2014 put it on display at his Musée des Lettres et Manuscrits (Museum of Letters and Manuscripts) in Paris. In 2015, Lhéritier was charged with fraud for allegedly running his company as a Ponzi scheme. The manuscripts were seized by French authorities and were due to be returned to their investors before going to auction. In December 2017, the French government recognised the original manuscript as a National Treasure giving the government time to raise funds to purchase it. The government offered tax benefits to donors to help buy the manuscript for the National Library of France by sponsoring a sum of €4.55 million. The French Government acquired the manuscript in July 2021.

== Reception ==
The first published versions of the novel, edited by Iwan Bloch (1904) and Maurice Heine (3 volumes, 1931–35), were limited editions intended as a compendium of sexual perversions for the use of sexologists. Sade&#x27;s critical reputation as a novelist and thinker, however, remained poor prior to World War II. In 1938, Samuel Beckett wrote, &quot;not 1 in 100 will find literature in the pornography, or beneath the pornography, let alone one of the capital works of the eighteenth century, which it is for me.&quot;

Sade received more critical attention after the war. Simone de Beauvoir in her essay &quot;Must we burn Sade?&quot; (published in 1951–52) argued that although Sade is a writer of the second rank and &quot;unreadable&quot;, his value is making us rethink &quot;the true nature of man&#x27;s relationship to man&quot;.

Georges Bataille, writing in 1957, stated:

Gilbert Lely considered the introduction to &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot; to be Sade&#x27;s masterpiece, although he thought the rest of the novel was marred by Sade&#x27;s emphasis on coprophilia. Phillips, and Wainhouse and Seaver, consider that Sade&#x27;s later libertine novels have more literary merit and philosophical depth. Nevertheless, Wainhouse and Seaver conclude, &quot;It is perhaps his masterpiece; at the very least, it is the cornerstone on which the massive edifice he constructed was founded.&quot; In contrast, Melissa Katsoulis, writing in &quot;The Times&quot; of London, called the novel &quot;a vile and universally offensive catalogue of depravity that goes far beyond kinky sex to the realms of paedophilia, torture and various other stomach-churning activities that we&#x27;re all probably better off not knowing about.&quot;

The novel was banned in France, the United States and the United Kingdom until the 1960s. In 1947, Jean-Jacques Pauvert published the first commercial French edition. He was prosecuted for obscenity in the 1950s but continued to publish. In 1954, Olympia Press in Paris published an English edition translated by Austryn Wainhouse which was not sold openly in English-speaking countries. The first commercial English edition was published in the United States by Grove Press in 1966. In 1990 the novel was published in the prestigious French Pléiade edition, which Phillips calls a mark of &quot;classic status&quot;. In 2016, a contemporary English translation of the novel was published as a Penguin Classic.

== Themes and analysis ==
Academic John Phillips classifies &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot; as a libertine novel. According to Phillips, Sade&#x27;s intention was avowedly pornographic but he also intended the novel as social satire, a parody of the encyclopaedia and the scientific method, a didactic text expounding a theory of libertinage, and a fantasy of total power and sexual licence. The novel displays typical Sadeian themes including an obsession with categorisation, order and numbers; an alternating presentation of dissertations and orgies; and a desire to catalogue all sexual practices.

Phillips links the novel&#x27;s emphasis on order, categorisation, numbers and coprophilia with the Freudian anal phase of human sexuality. He also suggests that the novel&#x27;s theme of mother hatred can be interpreted in Freudian terms as an unconscious erotic desire for the mother, with the Château de Silling as a womb symbol.

Sade biographer Neil Schaeffer sees the main theme in the novel as rebellion against God, authority and sexual gender. Against these, Sade posits hedonism and an amoral, materialist view of nature. Biographer Francine du Plessix Gray sees the novel as a dystopia, calling it &quot;the crudest, most repellent fictional dystopia ever limned&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
The final scene of Luis Buñuel&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930) shows the Duc de Blangis emerging from the château de Seligny. Buñuel had read the &quot;120 Days&quot; and had been deeply impressed by its anti-clericalism and focus on sexuality.

In 1975, Pier Paolo Pasolini made &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; (). The setting is transposed from 18th-century France to the last days of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime in the Republic of Salò. &quot;Salò&quot; is commonly listed among the most controversial films ever made.

<doc id="154531" wikidata="Q455874" url="?curid=154531" title="Regino of Prüm">
<text>Regino of Prüm or of Prum (, ; died 915 AD) was a Benedictine monk, who served as abbot of Prüm (892–99) and later of Saint Martin&#x27;s at Trier, and chronicler, whose &quot;Chronicon&quot; is an important source for late Carolingian history.

==Biography==
According to the statements of a later era, Regino was the son of noble parents and was born at the stronghold of Altrip on the Rhine near Speyer at an unknown date. From his election as abbot and from his writings, it is evident that he had entered the Benedictine Order, probably at Prüm itself, and that he had been a diligent student. The rich and celebrated Imperial Abbey of Prüm suffered greatly during the 9th century from the marauding incursions of the Norsemen. It had been twice seized and ravaged, in 882 AD and 892 AD. After its second devastation by the Danes, the abbot Farabert resigned his office and Regino was elected his successor in 892 AD. His labours for the restoration of the devastated abbey were hampered by the struggle between contending parties in Lorraine.

In 899 AD Regino was driven from his office by Richarius, later Bishop of Liège, the brother of Count Gerhard and count Mattfried of Hainaut. Richarius was made abbot; Regino had lost the position and relocated to Trier, where he was honourably received by Archbishop Ratbod and was appointed abbot of St Martin&#x27;s, a house which he later reformed. He supported the archbishop in the latter&#x27;s efforts to carry out ecclesiastical reforms in that troubled era, rebuilt the Abbey of St. Martin that had been laid waste by the Norsemen, accompanied the archbishop on visitations, and used his leisure for writing. Regino died at Trier in 915 AD and was buried in St. Maximin&#x27;s Abbey, Trier, his tomb being discovered there in 1581.

==Works==
Regino&#x27;s works are edited in volume 132 of Migne&#x27;s Patrologia Latina.

===&quot;De harmonica institutione&quot; and &quot;Tonarius&quot;===
Regino&#x27;s earliest work was &quot;Epistola de harmonica institutione&quot;, a treatise on music which he wrote in the form of a letter to Archbishop Radbod. Its primary objective was to improve the liturgical singing in the churches of the diocese and probably to ensure Radbod&#x27;s support for this. He also wrote the &quot;Tonarius&quot;, a collection of chants.

===&quot;Chronicon&quot;===
Regino&#x27;s most influential work is his &quot;Chronicon&quot;, a universal history from the Incarnation of Jesus Christ to 906 AD. The &quot;Chronicon&quot;″s focus is a history of the Carolingian empire that connected the rise and fall of the Carolingian dynasty with his own affairs. The work&#x27;s intended recipient is unknown, but may have been Louis the Child (), and was dedicated to Adalberon, bishop of Augsburg (†909), someone personally close to the child king. The &quot;Chronicon&quot; was later continued from 906 until 967 (known as the &quot;Continuatio Reginonis&quot;), and edited by a certain Adalbert, a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Saint Maximinus in Trier, possibly Adalbert, Archbishop of Magdeburg.

The first book contains broad narratives on the fortunes of various rulers and church men, which are organised against the regnal spans of Roman and Byzantine emperors, and ends in the year 741 with the death of Charles Martel. It consists of extracts taken from Bede, Paulus Diaconus, the &quot;Deeds of Dagobert&quot;, the Annals of Saint-Amand and the chronicle &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;. Of the second book (741–906), the first part is a long excerpt of the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; down to 813. From 814 onwards, however, the work is made up of eyewitness accounts, Paulus Diaconus and in relation to events in Lotharingia, the work of Adventius, Bishop of Metz. In the later sections of book two, Regino discusses and deals with the various kings attempting to take power in Lotharingia, in particular criticising Zwentibald, the son of powerful magnate and later king Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. The chronological accuracy of the work has been questioned, however; Regino had adapted and changed Bede&#x27;s Anno Mundi dating system to Anno Domini to reflect the works starting point of the Incarnation of Jesus. The work is deemed important by modern scholars due to the fact it is the first chronicle to conventionally apply the AD dating system.

Regino&#x27;s chronicle is an important source on Bulgarian medieval history in that it is the only contemporary text hinting at the organisation of the Council of Preslav (&quot;… Boris I] gathered his entire empire and placed his younger son Simeon I] as prince…&quot;).

Historians who made use of Regino&#x27;s chronicle include Cosmas of Prague.

The chronicle was first printed at Mainz in 1521.

=== &quot;De ecclesiasticis disciplinis&quot; ===
Regino also drew up, at the request of his friend and patron Radbod, Archbishop of Trier (d. 915), a collection of canons, &quot;Libri duo de synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis&quot;, dedicated to Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz. It was a work on ecclesiastical discipline for use in ecclesiastical visitations. The work is divided into 434 sections. The title of the work in Migne&#x27;s edition is &quot;Libellus DE ECCLESIASTICIS DISCIPLINIS ET RELIGIONE CHRISTIANA, COLLECTUS Ex jussu domini metropolitani Rathbodi Trevericae urbis episcopi, a Reginone quondam abbate Prumiensis monasterii, ex diversis sanctorum Patrum conciliis et decretis Romanorum pontificum&quot;. Substantial portions of this work were included in the &quot;Decretum Burchardi&quot; of 1012.

Section 364 (corresponding to Burchard 10.1) is the so-called &quot;Canon Episcopi&quot; (after its incipit &quot;Ut episcopi episcoporumque ministri omnibus viribus elaborare studeant&quot;) dealing with popular superstition.

==== Miscellaneous ====
Around 900, Regino lists four distinctive features of ethnicity: (origin, race), (customs, behavior), (language), and (law). These categories would be considered key nominal qualifiers for ethnic identity from the Carolingian period onwards.

<text>Chimaltenango is a city in Guatemala with a population of 96,985 (2018 census). It serves as both the capital of the department of Chimaltenango and the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. Chimaltenango stands some west of Guatemala City, on the Pan-American Highway. The municipal capital produces textiles and pottery.

==History==

In Pre-Columbian times, what is now the city of Chimaltenango was known to its native inhabitants as B&#x27;oko&#x27;. Like many other cities in the area, the Spanish Conquistadores used the name given by their Nahuatl speaking allies from central Mexico. The Nahuatl name was Chīmaltenānco, meaning &quot;Shield City&quot;. The current town was founded in 1526 by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Portocarrero, and shortly after it was assigned by Bishop Francisco Marroquín to the Order of Preachers, along with Jocotenango, Jilotepeque, Sumpango, Candelaria, Amatitlán, Petapa, Mixco, and Pinula. These were the general areas under the jurisdiction of &quot;Valle de Pasuya&quot; (English: Pasuya Valley) in those days (which had nine valleys), among them the Chimaltenango Valley. This valley bordered with Xilotepeque valley on the northwest, with Mixco valley on the East, with Guatemala on the North, and with Sololá Prinvice on the West. Furthermore, the Valle of Pasuya had two mayor municipalities: Chimaltenango (which included the Chimaltenango, Xilotepeque, and Alotenango valleys), and Sacatepéquez (which included the remainder).

After independence from Spain in 1821, the town was elevated to &quot;Villa&quot; status in 1825 but apparently lost some luster, as one can infer from archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay wife&#x27;s description from a trip there in 1895. Anne Cary Maudslay, wrote: &quot;We were not tempted to loiter for long, and rode on again over the dull plain to the uninteresting town of Chimaltenango, where we proposed to spend the night. The hotel was dirty and the bedrooms so unpleasant that we would have none of them, and sent Gorgonio to hunt for an empty room in which we could put up our own beds. This he found in a &quot;meson&quot;, or caravanserai, attached to the hotel, where there was a good-sized room and a rough kitchen opening on a patio in which we could turn the beasts loose for the night. A sprinkling with water, a good sweeping, and a free use of Keating&#x27;s powder, soon made the room habitable. The supper at the hotel was, however, far above the average, and the only thing to complain of was the poor forage supplied to the mules.&quot; 

==Sports==
América de Chimaltenango football club has played the 2009 - 2010 season in Guatemala&#x27;s second division. They play their home games in the Estadio Municipal de Chimaltenango.

== Famous citizens==

* Natalia Górriz de Morales, teacher. She was the director of &quot;Instituto Normal Central para Señoritas&quot; (English: Normal Central Institute for Girls) and Elementary School Inspector during General José María Reina Barrios&#x27; presidency and was married to the Minister of Economy, Colonel Próspero Morales.In 1897, he resigned his position and raised arms as one of the leaders of the Quetzaltenango Revolution against his former boss General Reina Barrios, after he tried to extend his presidential term to 1902 after the failure of the Central American Expo and the acute economic crisis that mired Guatemala. After the Reina Barrios murder in February 1898, Morales ran for office in the 1898 presidential elections. When he realized that those were rigged in favor of Interim President Manuel Estrada Cabrera, he tried to invade Guatemala from Mexico, but died in the attempt. Natalia Górriz de Morales then started teaching again and became one of the more representative women of the early 20th century in Guatemala.

==Climate==

Chimaltenango has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;).
== Geographic location ==

It is completely surrounded by Chimaltenango Department municipalities:

<doc id="154538" wikidata="Q1226130" url="?curid=154538" title="Athelm">
<text>Athelm (or Æthelhelm; died 926) was an English churchman, who was the first Bishop of Wells, and later Archbishop of Canterbury. His translation, or moving from one bishopric to another, was a precedent for later translations of ecclesiastics, because prior to this time period such movements were considered illegal. While archbishop, Athelm crowned King Æthelstan, and perhaps wrote the coronation service for the event. An older relative of Dunstan, a later Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm helped promote Dunstan&#x27;s early career. After Athelm&#x27;s death, he was considered a saint, with his feast day being on 8 January.

==Background==

Athelm was a monk of Glastonbury Abbey before his elevation in 909 to the see of Wells, of which he was the first occupant. The see was founded to divide up the diocese of Sherborne, which was very large, by creating a bishopric for the county of Somerset. Wells was likely chosen as the seat because it was the center of the county. Some scholarly works suggest that Athelm may be the same person as Æthelhelm, son of King Æthelred of Wessex, but this is not accepted by most historians. A few sources state that Athelm was Abbot of Glastonbury before he became bishop, but other sources disagree and do not give him that office. This traces to later medieval chroniclers, not to contemporary accounts. His brother was Heorstan, who held land near Glastonbury.

==Archbishopric==

Between August 923 and September 925 he became archbishop. His translation from the see of Wells set a precedent for the future, and marks a break with historical practice. Previously the moving of a bishop from one see to another had been held to be against canon, or ecclesiastical, law. Recently, however, the popes had themselves been translated, and this practice was to become common in England after Athelm&#x27;s time. He was West Saxon, unlike his predecessor, Plegmund, who was Mercian, reflecting the shift in power to Wessex. Athelm was a paternal uncle of Dunstan, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. It was Athelm who brought Dunstan to the king&#x27;s court.

Athelm presided at the coronation of King Athelstan of England on 4 September 925, and probably composed or organised the new &quot;Ordo&quot; (order of service) in which for the first time the king wore a crown instead of a helmet. He also attested the king&#x27;s first grant to St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury. It is unclear if the reason that no coins were minted with his name was his short term of office or a change in policy towards the Archbishop of Canterbury minting coins in his own name. Nothing else is known of Athelm&#x27;s brief time as archbishop.

==Death and burial==

Athelm died on 8 January 926. He was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 8 January. He was buried at first the church of St John the Baptist near the Saxon-era Canterbury Cathedral. When a new cathedral was constructed under Archbishop Lanfranc after the Norman Conquest of England, the earlier archbishops of Canterbury were moved to the north transept of the new cathedral. Later, Athelm and his successor as archbishop Wulfhelm were moved to a chapel dedicated to St Benedict, which later was incorporated into the Lady Chapel constructed by Prior Thomas Goldstone (d. 1468).

<text>Charles Thomas Longley (28 July 1794 – 27 October 1868) was a bishop in the Church of England. He served as Bishop of Ripon, Bishop of Durham, Archbishop of York and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1862 until his death.

==Life==
He was born at Rochester, Kent, the fifth son of the late John Longley, Recorder of Rochester, and educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1812, graduating B.A. 1815 (M.A. 1818), B.D. and D.D. 1829.

At Christ Church, Longley was reader in Greek 1822, tutor and censor 1825–8, and proctor 1827. He was ordained in 1818, and was appointed vicar of Cowley, Oxford, in 1823. In 1827, he received the rectory of West Tytherley, Hampshire, and two years later he was elected headmaster of Harrow School. He held this office until 1836, when he was consecrated bishop of the new see of Ripon. In 1856 he became Bishop of Durham, and in 1860 he became Archbishop of York.

In 1862, he succeeded John Bird Sumner as Archbishop of Canterbury. Soon afterwards the questions connected with the deposition of John William Colenso were referred to Longley but, while regarding Colenso&#x27;s opinions as heretical and his deposition as justifiable, he refused to pronounce upon the legal difficulties of the case.

The chief event of his primacy was the meeting at Lambeth, in 1867, of the first Pan-Anglican conference of British, colonial and foreign bishops. His published works included numerous sermons and addresses. He died at Addington Park, near Croydon.

Like Sumner, he was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848.

==Family==

As Headmaster of Harrow School, he married the Hon. Caroline Sophia Parnell on 15 December 1831. Her brother the Hon. George Damer Parnell was the curate of Ash, 1859–1861. Parnell was the daughter of Henry Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton. They had seven children, three sons and four daughters, of whom:

1. Henry Longley (28 November 1833 – 25 December 1899), served as Chief Charity Commissioner for England and Wales. He married Diana Eliza Davenport (fl. 1905), daughter of John Davenport of Foxley, Herefordshire, on 17 September 1861.

2. George Longley, born 8 March 1835 at Harrow, Middlesex.

3. Mary Henrietta Longley (born 2 May 1837 in Ramsgate, Kent) married – on 9 December 1858 – George Winfield Bourke (died 9 October 1903), Honorary Chaplain to the Monarch, and son of Robert Bourke, 5th Earl of Mayo. Their only child was Walter Longley Bourke, 8th Earl of Mayo (28 November 1859 – 1939); from 1891 to 1903, he was a Trustee of the Bridgewater Estates. Walter had married in 1887, and had four sons and two daughters, by 1905. Walter&#x27;s second son was Ulick Henry Bourke, 9th Earl of Mayo (1890–1962), and third son Bryan Longley Bourke (1897–1961) was father of Terence Bourke, 10th Earl of Mayo (1929–2006), himself father of the present Earl.

4. Frances Elizabeth Longley (born 3 July 1839)

5. Arthur Longley (born 1841 in Ripon, Yorkshire)

6. Caroline Georgina Longley (died 30 October 1867) married, on 6 November 1862, (as his 1st wife) Edward Levett (18 December 1832 – 28 December 1899), major in the 10th Royal Hussars, of Wychnor Park and Packington Hall, Staffordshire, third son of John Levett and his wife Sophia Kennedy, granddaughter of Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis. They had two daughters, both of whom married and had children.
7. Rosamond Esther Harriett Longley (died 1936) married, 1870, Cecil Thomas Parker (1845–1931), 2nd son of Thomas Parker, 6th Earl of Macclesfield by his 2nd wife Mary Frances Grosvenor, a sister of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, and had four sons and two daughters. Their elder daughter Caroline Beatrix Parker (1873–1961) married, 1895, William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman, of Leigh, Shropshire in 1929, PC (1864–1935), only child of John Orlando Bridgeman, Rector of Weston-under-Lizard (himself 3rd and youngest son of George Bridgeman, 2nd Earl of Bradford) by his wife Marianne Caroline Clive, daughter of William Clive, and left children, including the present Viscount. The fourth and youngest son Wilfrid Parker (1883–1966) became Bishop of Pretoria, South Africa. A granddaughter (by the 3rd son Geoffrey) Isolda Rosamond Parker (1918–2014) married, 1940, David Pollock, 2nd Viscount Hanworth (1916–1996) and is mother of the present peer.

<text>The nickelodeon was the first type of indoor exhibition space dedicated to showing projected motion pictures in the United States and Canada. Usually set up in converted storefronts, these small, simple theaters charged five cents for admission (a &quot;nickel&quot;, hence the name) and flourished from about 1905 to 1915. American cable station Nickelodeon was named after the theater.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nickelodeon&quot; was concocted from &quot;nickel&quot;, the name of the U.S. five-cent coin, and the ancient Greek word &quot;odeion&quot;, a roofed-over theater, the latter indirectly by way of the &quot;Odéon&quot; in Paris, emblematic of a very large and luxurious theater, much as the &quot;Ritz&quot; was of a grand hotel.

==History==
The earliest films had been shown in &quot;peep show&quot; machines or projected in vaudeville theaters as one of the otherwise live acts. Nickelodeons drastically altered film exhibition practices and the leisure-time habits of a large segment of the American public. Although they were characterized by continuous performances of a selection of short films, added attractions such as illustrated songs were sometimes an important feature. Regarded as disreputable and dangerous by some civic groups and municipal agencies, crude, ill-ventilated nickelodeons with hard wooden seats were outmoded as longer films became common and larger, more comfortably furnished motion-picture theaters were built, a trend that culminated in the lavish &quot;movie palaces&quot; of the 1920s.

Film historian Charles Musser wrote: &quot;It is not too much to say that modern cinema began with the nickelodeons.&quot;

The name &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; was first used in 1888 by Colonel William Austin for his &quot;Austin&#x27;s Nickelodeon&quot;, a dime museum located in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The term was popularized by Harry Davis and John P. Harris. On June 19, 1905, they opened a small storefront theater with the name on Smithfield Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although it was not the first theater to show films, a 1919 news article claimed that it was the first theater in the world &quot;devoted exclusively to exhibition of moving picture spectacles&quot;. 

Davis and Harris found such great success with their operation that their concept of a five-cent theater showing movies continuously was soon imitated by hundreds of ambitious entrepreneurs, as was the name of the theater itself. Statistics at the time show that the number of nickelodeons in the United States doubled between 1907 and 1908 to around 8,000, and it was estimated that by 1910 as many as 26 million Americans visited these theaters weekly. 
Nickelodeons in converted storefronts typically seated fewer than 200 – the patrons often sat on hard wooden chairs, with the screen hung on the back wall. A piano (and maybe a drum set) would be placed to the side of, or below the screen. Larger nickelodeons sometimes had the capacity for well over 1,000 people. 

In 1905, William Fox started his first nickelodeon in Brooklyn. He owned numerous theaters in New York and New Jersey.

In 1906, Carl Laemmle opened his first nickelodeon, The White Front on Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago) and a second one, The Family Theatre soon after.

In 1907, Louis B. Mayer renovated the Gem Theater in Haverhill, Massachusetts, converting it into a nickelodeon, which he opened as the Orpheum Theater, announcing that it would be &quot;the home of refined entertainment devoted to Miles Brothers moving pictures and illustrated songs&quot;. Other well-known nickelodeon owners were the Skouras Brothers of St. Louis.

== Changes in film distribution and exhibition ==
Nickelodeons radically changed the modes of distribution and the types of films being made. Around 1903, longer multi-shot films became more prevalent, and this shift brought about important innovations in the distribution of films with the establishment of film exchanges. Film exchanges would buy films from manufacturers and then rent them out to exhibitors. With a steady supply of different films, exhibitors finally had the possibility to open venues, where films were the central attraction. They did not have to worry about finding new audiences because the same audience would return again and again to watch different films. Exhibition practices greatly varied and programs lasted anywhere from ten minutes to an hour and a half or more in length. Often, programs ran continuously and patrons would join a program already in progress when they arrived and stay as long as they liked. While some nickelodeons only showed films, others offered shows that combined films with vaudeville acts or illustrated songs.

The desirability of longer films, which enabled nickelodeons to grow as they would, was the result of many factors. Economic competition between film production companies put pressure on them to create more elaborate, and often longer, films, to differentiate one film from another. Longer films were also more attractive, as the price paid by exhibitors depended on a film&#x27;s length and the longer a film, the more profit there was to be made. Some exhibitors found longer films more desirable since it made programming easier, faster, and possibly cheaper, as they no longer had to organize their own programs by editing together a variety of short films. Directors had a great desire to make longer films, because it meant greater artistic innovation as they tried to find new ways to engage audiences. The popularity of longer films also meant an increase in production of fictional films as actualities decreased. One of the possible reasons for this shift is that fiction films were often easier to plan and cheaper to film than actualities, which were subject to various location-related difficulties. Fiction films quickly became standardized, and the popularity of longer films meant they outperformed actualities, which were usually short.

==Audience==
Early writers on American cinema history assumed that audiences at nickelodeons were primarily working-class people who could not afford a higher ticket price. 

At the heart of the image of nickelodeons in traditional histories is the belief that movies were a simple amusement for the working class, and that the middle-class stayed away until after World War I. This idea was reflected in Lewis Jacobs&#x27; 1939 survey, where he wrote: &quot;concentrated largely in poorer shopping districts and slum neighborhoods, nickelodeons were disdained by the well-to-do. But, the workmen and their families who patronized the movies did not mind the crowded, unsanitary, and hazardous accommodations most of the nickelodeons offered.&quot; 

More recent historians argue the rise of the middle class audiences throughout the nickelodeon era and into the later 1910s belief to expand the business. In 1985, Robert C. Allen debated whether movies attracted a middle-class audience as illustrated by the location of earlier movie theaters in traditional entertainment districts, where more nickelodeons were located in or near middle-class neighborhoods than in the Lower East Side ghetto.

The nickelodeon boom in Manhattan between 1905 and 1907 often functioned as historical shorthand for the rise of the movies in general. In 2004, Ben Singer wrote in his analysis of Manhattan nickelodeons; &quot;for most people ... the image of cramped, dingy nickelodeons in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side ghetto stands as a symbol for the cinema&#x27;s emergence in America.&quot; Nickelodeons consistently appeared in the densest areas of the city in terms of residential concentration and the amount of pedestrian traffic. Areas such as Union Square, Herald Square, 23rd Street, and 125th Street were typical locations and the larger movie theaters were set up there. Neighborhood nickelodeons, which were the majority of movie theaters in Manhattan, were almost always located in neighborhoods with high residential densities and spread over a substantial number of blocks.

==Types of nickelodeon programs==
Nickelodeons usually showed films about ten to fifteen minutes in length, and in a variety of styles and subjects, such as short narratives, &quot;scenics&quot; (views of the world from moving trains), &quot;actualities&quot; (precursors of later documentary films), illustrated songs, local or touring song and dance acts, comedies, melodramas, problem plays, stop-action sequences, sporting events and other features which allowed them to compete with vaudeville houses.

The titles of a few of the films released in 1907 and distributed to nickelodeons by the Miles Brothers (Herbert, Harry and Earl C.) partially illustrate this diversity.
These are taken from a 1907 article published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;:
* &quot;Catch the Kid&quot; (directed by Alf Collins; comedy)
* &quot;The Coroner&#x27;s Mistake&quot; (comic ghost story)
* &quot;The Fatal Hand&quot; (directed by J. H. Martin; drama)
* &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Run&quot; (directed by Frank Mottershaw; comedy)
* &quot;Knight-Errant&quot; (directed by J. H. Martin; old historical drama)
* &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Sin&quot; (directed by J. H. Martin; drama)
* &quot;The Romany&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (directed by Frank Mottershaw; drama)
* &quot;Roof to Cellar&quot; (comedy)
* &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Return&quot; (drama)
* &quot;Village Fire Brigade&quot; (directed by James Williamson; comedy)
* &quot;Wizard&#x27;s World&quot; (comedy)

Other 1907 films also distributed to nickelodeons by the Miles Brothers:

* &quot;Anarchist&#x27;s Mother-in-Law&quot;
* &quot;Boss Away, Choppers Play&quot;
* &quot;Cambridge-Oxford Race&quot;
* &quot;Cheekiest Man on Earth&quot;
* &quot;Female Wrestlers&quot;
* &quot;Great Lion Hunt&quot;
* &quot;Indian Basket Weavers&quot;
* &quot;International Contest for the Heavyweight Championship: Squires vs. Burns&quot;
* &quot;Jim Jeffries on His California Ranch&quot;
* &quot;Life and Customs in India&quot;
* &quot;The Naval Nursery&quot;
* &quot;The Petticoat Regiment&quot;
* &quot;Shriners&#x27; Conclave at Los Angeles&quot;
* &quot;Squires, Australian Champion, in His Training Quarters&quot;
* &quot;That Awful Tooth&quot;
* &quot;The White Slave&quot;
* &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Duel&quot;

==Decline==

Though strong throughout the years from 1905 to 1913, nickelodeons became victims of their own success as attendance grew rapidly, necessitating larger auditoriums. Nickelodeons further declined with the advent of the feature film, and as cities grew and industry consolidation led to larger, more comfortable, better-appointed movie theaters. Longer films caused ticket prices to double from five cents to ten cents. Although their heyday was relatively brief, nickelodeons played an important part in creating a specialized spectator, &quot;the moviegoer&quot;, who could now integrate going to the movies into their life in a way that was impossible before. Miriam Hansen has noted that the term &quot;spectator&quot; had become common by 1910. The nickelodeon explosion also increased the demand for new films, as thousands of theaters needed new product. The growth of longer films, which nickelodeons played a large part in stimulating, also led to the development of intertitles, which appeared in 1903 and helped make actions and scenes clearer as storylines became more complicated. A side-effect of this change was that it minimized the role of exhibitors, since they no longer had the editorial control of organizing single-shot films into programs, and now their narrative responsibility (some exhibitors would talk and help explain narratives as they unfolded) was also minimized by this &quot;internal narration&quot; in the film.

<text>Quetzaltenango (, also known by its Maya name Xelajú or Xela ) is both the seat of the namesake Department and municipality, in Guatemala. The city is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of above sea level at its lowest part. It may reach above within the city.

The Municipality of Quetzaltenango consists of an area of . Municipalities abutting the municipality of Quetzaltenango include Salcajá, Cantel, Almolonga, Zunil, El Palmar, Concepción Chiquirichapa, San Mateo, La Esperanza, and Olintepeque in Quetzaltenango department and San Andrés Xecul in Totonicapán department.

==History==

In pre-Columbian times, Quetzaltenango was a city of the Mam Maya people called Xelajú, although by the time of the Spanish Conquest it had become part of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; Kingdom of Q&#x27;umarkaj. The name may be derived from &quot;xe laju&#x27; noj&quot; meaning &quot;under ten mountains&quot;. The city was said to have already been over 300 years old when the Spanish first arrived. With the help of his allies, Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado defeated and killed the Maya ruler Tecún Umán here.

When Alvarado conquered the city for Spain in the 1520s, he called it by the Nahuatl name used by his Central Mexican Indian allies, &quot;Quetzaltenango&quot;, generally considered to mean &quot;the place of the quetzal bird.&quot; Quetzaltenango became the city&#x27;s official name in colonial times. However, many people (especially the indigenous population) continue to call the city &quot;Xelajú&quot; or more commonly &quot;Xela&quot; for short, and some proudly, but unofficially, consider it the &quot;capital of the Mayas&quot;.

From 1838 to 1840 Quetzaltenango was the capital of the state of Los Altos, one of the states or provinces of the Federal Republic of Central America. As the union broke up, the army of Rafael Carrera conquered Quetzaltenango making it part of Guatemala. In 1850, the city had a population of approximately 20,000.

During the 19th century, coffee was introduced as a major crop in the area. As a result, the economy of Xela prospered. Much fine Belle Époque architecture can still be found in the city.

On October 24, 1902, at 5:00 pm, the Santa María Volcano erupted. Rocks and ash fell on Quetzaltenango at 6 PM, only one hour after the eruption.

In the 1920s, a young Romani woman named Vanushka Cardena Barajas died and was buried in the Xela city cemetery. An active legend has developed around her tomb that says those who bring flowers or write a request on her tomb will be reunited with their former romantic partners. The Guatemalan songwriter Alvaro Aguilar wrote a song based on this legend.

In 1930 the only electric railway in Guatemala, the &quot;Ferrocarril de Los Altos&quot;, was inaugurated. It was built by AEG and Krupp and had 14 train cars. The track connected Quetzaltenango with San Felipe, Retalhuleu. It was soon destroyed by mudslides and finally demolished in 1933. The people of Quetzaltenango are still very proud of the railway. A railway museum has been established in the city center.

Since the late 1990s Quetzaltenango has been having an economic boom, which makes it the city with the second-highest contribution to the Guatemalan economy. With its first high-rise buildings being built, it is expected by 2015 to have a more prominent skyline, with buildings up to 15 floors tall.
In 2008, the Central American Congress PARLACEN announced that every September 15, Quetzaltenango will be Central America&#x27;s capital of culture.

Quetzaltenango was supposed to host 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games but dropped out due to a lack of funding for the event.

In March 2022, indigenous activists began blockading the central waste deposit near Valle de Palajunoj to protest a city development plan enacted by the municipal authorities in June 2017.
==Climate==

According to Köppen climate classification, Quetzaltenango features a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;). In general, the climate in Quetzaltenango can go from mild to chilly, with occasional sporadic warm episodes. The daily high is usually reached around noon. From then on, temperatures decrease exceptionally fast. The city is quite dry, except during the rainy season. Quetzaltenango is the coolest major city in Guatemala.

There are two main seasons in Quetzaltenango (as in all of Guatemala); the rainy season, which generally runs from late May through late October, and the dry season, which runs from early November until April. During the rainy season, rain falls consistently, usually in the afternoons, but there are occasions in which it rains all day long or at least during the morning. During the dry season, the city frequently will not receive a single drop of rain for months on end.

The coldest months are November through February, with minimum temperatures averaging , and maximum temperatures averaging . The warmest months are March through July, with minimum temperatures averaging and maximum temperatures averaging . Yearly, the average low is and the average high is .

==Economy==
Historically, the city produced wheat, maize, fruits, and vegetables. It also had a healthy livestock industry. Livestock was exported throughout the country and to El Salvador. As of 1850, wheat was the largest export, followed by cacao, sugar, wool and cotton.

== Sports ==
Quetzaltenango is home to the Club Xelajú MC soccer team. The team competes at Estadio Mario Camposeco which has a capacity of 13,500 and is the most successful non-capital team in the Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala.

Due to the city&#x27;s high altitude many athletes have prepared themselves here such as Olympic silver medalist Erick Barrondo and the 2004 Cuban volleyball team.

The swimming team has enjoyed success in national and international events.

Quetzaltenango withdrew from hosting the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games. It planned to build a 30,000-seat stadium by 2016, as well seven new facilities for indoor sports and aquatics.

==Transportation==

The city has a system of micro-buses for quick and cheap movement. A micro-bus is essentially a large van stuffed with seats. Micro-buses are numbered based on the route they take (e.g., &quot;Ruta 7&quot;). There is no government-run mass transport system in the city. The sole public means of transport is the bus or micro-buses. Transportation to other cities is provided by bus. Bicycling is a way to get around and to travel to (and in) rural areas. Quetzaltenango Airport provides air service to the city.
