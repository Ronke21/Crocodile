<text>Sodium carbonate (also known as washing soda, soda ash and soda crystals) is the inorganic compound with the formula and its various hydrates. All forms are white, odourless, water-soluble salts that yield alkaline solutions in water. Historically, it was extracted from the ashes of plants grown in sodium-rich soils, and because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of wood (once used to produce potash), sodium carbonate became known as &quot;soda ash&quot;. It is produced in large quantities from sodium chloride and limestone by the Solvay process, as well as by carbonating sodium hydroxide which is made using the chloralkali process.

==Hydrates==
Sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt:
* sodium carbonate decahydrate (natron), Na2CO3·10H2O, which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate.
* sodium carbonate heptahydrate (not known in mineral form), Na2CO3·7H2O.
* sodium carbonate monohydrate (thermonatrite), Na2CO3·H2O. Also known as crystal carbonate.
* anhydrous sodium carbonate (natrite), also known as calcined soda, is formed by heating the hydrates. It is also formed when sodium hydrogencarbonate is heated (calcined) e.g. in the final step of the Solvay process.
The decahydrate is formed from water solutions crystallizing in the temperature range −2.1 to +32.0 °C, the heptahydrate in the narrow range 32.0 to 35.4 °C and above this temperature the monohydrate forms. In dry air the decahydrate and heptahydrate lose water to give the monohydrate. Other hydrates have been reported, e.g. with 2.5 units of water per sodium carbonate unit (&quot;Penta hemihydrate&quot;).

===Washing soda===
Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O), also known as washing soda, is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization. Soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda.

It is one of the few metal carbonates that is soluble in water.

==Applications==
Some common applications of sodium carbonate include:
* As a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes. Sodium carbonate is a component of many dry soap powders. It has detergent properties through the process of saponification, which converts fats and grease to water-soluble salts (specifically, soaps).
* It is used for lowering the hardness of water (see ).
* It is used in the manufacture of glass, soap, and paper (see ).
* It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds like borax (sodium borate).

===Glass manufacture===
Sodium carbonate serves as a flux for silica (SiO2, melting point 1,713 °C), lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials. This &quot;soda glass&quot; is mildly water-soluble, so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass insoluble. Bottle and window glass (&quot;soda–lime glass&quot; with transition temperature ~570 °C) is made by melting such mixtures of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and silica sand (silicon dioxide (SiO2)). When these materials are heated, the carbonates release carbon dioxide. In this way, sodium carbonate is a source of sodium oxide. Soda–lime glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries. It is also a key input for tableware glass manufacturing.

===Water softening===

Hard water usually contains calcium or magnesium ions. Sodium carbonate is used for removing these ions and replacing them with sodium ions.

Sodium carbonate is a water-soluble source of carbonate. The calcium and magnesium ions form insoluble solid precipitates upon treatment with carbonate ions:

The water is softened because it no longer contains dissolved calcium ions and magnesium ions.

===Food additive and cooking===
Sodium carbonate has several uses in cuisine, largely because it is a stronger base than baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) but weaker than lye (which may refer to sodium hydroxide or, less commonly, potassium hydroxide). Alkalinity affects gluten production in kneaded doughs, and also improves browning by reducing the temperature at which the Maillard reaction occurs. To take advantage of the former effect, sodium carbonate is therefore one of the components of , a solution of alkaline salts used to give Japanese ramen noodles their characteristic flavour and chewy texture; a similar solution is used in Chinese cuisine to make lamian, for similar reasons. Cantonese bakers similarly use sodium carbonate as a substitute for lye-water to give moon cakes their characteristic texture and improve browning. In German cuisine (and Central European cuisine more broadly), breads such as pretzels and lye rolls traditionally treated with lye to improve browning can be treated instead with sodium carbonate; sodium carbonate does not produce quite as strong a browning as lye, but is much safer and easier to work with.

Sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder. The cooling and fizzing sensation results from the endothermic reaction between sodium carbonate and a weak acid, commonly citric acid, releasing carbon dioxide gas, which occurs when the sherbet is moistened by saliva.

Sodium carbonate also finds use in the food industry as a food additive (European Food Safety Authority number E500) as an acidity regulator, anticaking agent, raising agent, and stabilizer. It is also used in the production of to stabilize the pH of the final product.

While it is less likely to cause chemical burns than lye, care must still be taken when working with sodium carbonate in the kitchen, as it is corrosive to aluminum cookware, utensils, and foil.

===Other applications===
Sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various fields. As a common alkali, it is preferred in many chemical processes because it is cheaper than sodium hydroxide and far safer to handle. Its mildness especially recommends its use in domestic applications.

For example, it is used as a pH regulator to maintain stable alkaline conditions necessary for the action of the majority of photographic film developing agents. It is also a common additive in swimming pools and aquarium water to maintain a desired pH and carbonate hardness (KH). In dyeing with fiber-reactive dyes, sodium carbonate (often under a name such as soda ash fixative or soda ash activator) is used as mordant to ensure proper chemical bonding of the dye with cellulose (plant) fiber. It is also used in the froth flotation process to maintain a favourable pH as a float conditioner besides CaO and other mildly basic compounds.

===Precursor to other compounds===
Sodium (NaHCO3) or baking soda, also a component in fire extinguishers, is often generated from sodium carbonate. Although NaHCO3 is itself an intermediate product of the Solvay process, the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some NaHCO3, making it more economical to react finished Na2CO3 with CO2:
In a related reaction, sodium carbonate is used to make sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), which is used for the &quot;sulfite&quot; method of separating lignin from cellulose. This reaction is exploited for removing sulfur dioxide from flue gases in power stations:

This application has become more common, especially where stations have to meet stringent emission controls.

Sodium carbonate is used by the cotton industry to neutralize the sulfuric acid needed for acid delinting of fuzzy cottonseed.

It is also used to form carbonates of other metals by ion exchange, often with the other metals&#x27; sulphates.

===Miscellaneous===
Sodium carbonate is used by the brick industry as a wetting agent to reduce the amount of water needed to extrude the clay. In casting, it is referred to as &quot;bonding agent&quot; and is used to allow wet alginate to adhere to gelled alginate. Sodium carbonate is used in toothpastes, where it acts as a foaming agent and an abrasive, and to temporarily increase mouth pH.

Sodium carbonate is also used in the processing and tanning of animal hides.

==Physical properties==
The integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 kJ/mol for a 10% w/w aqueous solution. The Mohs hardness of sodium carbonate monohydrate is 1.3.

==Occurrence as natural mineral==
Sodium carbonate is soluble in water, and can occur naturally in arid regions, especially in mineral deposits (&quot;evaporites&quot;) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate. Deposits of the mineral natron have been mined from dry lake bottoms in Egypt since ancient times, when natron was used in the preparation of mummies and in the early manufacture of glass.

The anhydrous mineral form of sodium carbonate is quite rare and called natrite. Sodium carbonate also erupts from Ol Doinyo Lengai, Tanzania&#x27;s unique volcano, and it is presumed to have erupted from other volcanoes in the past, but due to these minerals&#x27; instability at the Earth&#x27;s surface, are likely to be eroded. All three mineralogical forms of sodium carbonate, as well as trona, trisodium hydrogendi carbonate dihydrate, are also known from ultra-alkaline pegmatitic rocks, that occur for example in the Kola Peninsula in Russia.

Extra terrestrially, known sodium carbonate is rare. Deposits have been identified as the source of bright spots on Ceres, interior material that has been brought to the surface. While there are carbonates on Mars, and these are expected to include sodium carbonate, deposits have yet to be confirmed, this absence is explained by some as being due to a global dominance of low pH in previously aqueous Martian soil.

==Production==
The initial large-scale chemical procedure was established in England in 1823 to manufacture soda ash.

===Mining===
Trona, also known as trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate (Na3HCO3CO3·2H2O), is mined in several areas of the US and provides nearly all the US consumption of sodium carbonate. Large natural deposits found in 1938, such as the one near Green River, Wyoming, have made mining more economical than industrial production in North America. There are important reserves of trona in Turkey; two million tons of soda ash have been extracted from the reserves near Ankara.

===Barilla and kelp===
Several &quot;halophyte&quot; (salt-tolerant) plant species and seaweed species can be processed to yield an impure form of sodium carbonate, and these sources predominated in Europe and elsewhere until the early 19th century. The land plants (typically glassworts or saltworts) or the seaweed (typically &quot;Fucus&quot; species) were harvested, dried, and burned. The ashes were then &quot;lixivated&quot; (washed with water) to form an alkali solution. This solution was boiled dry to create the final product, which was termed &quot;soda ash&quot;; this very old name derives from the Arabic word &quot;soda&quot;, in turn applied to &quot;Salsola soda&quot;, one of the many species of seashore plants harvested for production. &quot;Barilla&quot; is a commercial term applied to an impure form of potash obtained from coastal plants or kelp.

The sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely, from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form (&quot;kelp&quot;), to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in Spain. Plant and seaweed sources for soda ash, and also for the related alkali &quot;potash&quot;, became increasingly inadequate by the end of the 18th century, and the search for commercially viable routes to synthesizing soda ash from salt and other chemicals intensified.

===Leblanc process===

In 1792, the French chemist Nicolas Leblanc patented a process for producing sodium carbonate from salt, sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal. In the first step, sodium chloride is treated with sulfuric acid in the Mannheim process. This reaction produces sodium sulfate (&quot;salt cake&quot;) and hydrogen chloride:
The salt cake and crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) was reduced by heating with coal. This conversion entails two parts. First is the carbothermic reaction whereby the coal, a source of carbon, reduces the sulfate to sulfide:
The second stage is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide:

This mixture is called &quot;black ash&quot;. The soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water. Evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate. This extraction process was termed lixiviating.

The hydrochloric acid produced by the Leblanc process was a major source of air pollution, and the calcium sulfide byproduct also presented waste disposal issues. However, it remained the major production method for sodium carbonate until the late 1880s.

===Solvay process===
In 1861, the Belgian industrial chemist Ernest Solvay developed a method for making sodium carbonate by first reacting sodium chloride, ammonia, water, and carbon dioxide to generate sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride:

The resulting sodium bicarbonate was then converted to sodium carbonate by heating it, releasing water and carbon dioxide:

Meanwhile, the ammonia was regenerated from the ammonium chloride byproduct by treating it with the lime (calcium oxide) left over from carbon dioxide generation:

The Solvay process recycles its ammonia. It consumes only brine and limestone, and calcium chloride is its only waste product. The process is substantially more economical than the Leblanc process, which generates two waste products, calcium sulfide and hydrogen chloride. The Solvay process quickly came to dominate sodium carbonate production worldwide. By 1900, 90% of sodium carbonate was produced by the Solvay process, and the last Leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s.

The second step of the Solvay process, heating sodium bicarbonate, is used on a small scale by home cooks and in restaurants to make sodium carbonate for culinary purposes (including pretzels and alkali noodles). The method is appealing to such users because sodium bicarbonate is widely sold as baking soda, and the temperatures required ( to ) to convert baking soda to sodium carbonate are readily achieved in conventional kitchen ovens.

===Hou&#x27;s process===
This process was developed by Chinese chemist Hou Debang in the 1930s. The earlier steam reforming by-product carbon dioxide was pumped through a saturated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia to produce sodium bicarbonate by these reactions:


The sodium bicarbonate was collected as a precipitate due to its low solubility and then heated up to approximately or to yield pure sodium carbonate similar to last step of the Solvay process. More sodium chloride is added to the remaining solution of ammonium and sodium chlorides; also, more ammonia is pumped at 30–40 °C to this solution. The solution temperature is then lowered to below 10 °C. Solubility of ammonium chloride is higher than that of sodium chloride at 30 °C and lower at 10 °C. Due to this temperature-dependent solubility difference and the common-ion effect, ammonium chloride is precipitated in a sodium chloride solution.

The Chinese name of Hou&#x27;s process, &quot;lianhe zhijian fa&quot; (), means &quot;coupled manufacturing alkali method&quot;: Hou&#x27;s process is coupled to the Haber process and offers better atom economy by eliminating the production of calcium chloride, since any ammonia generated gets used by the reaction. The by-product ammonium chloride can be sold as a fertilizer.

<text>Thutmose III (variously also spelt Tuthmosis or Thothmes), sometimes called Thutmose the Great, (1481-1425 BC) was the fifth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. A brilliant military commander who created the ancient world&#x27;s first navy, he conducted campaigns that brought ancient Egypt&#x27;s empire to its zenith.

Officially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt from his coronation on 28 April 1479 BC at the age of two until his death on 11 March 1425 BC. But for the first 22 years of his reign, he was coregent with his stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. He became sole ruler after Hatshepsut&#x27;s death in 1458. Two years before his own death, and after the death of his firstborn son and heir Amenemhat, Thutmose III appointed his son and successor Amenhotep II as junior co-regent.

Thutmose III, who commanded Hatshepsut&#x27;s armies, is regarded as one of the greatest warriors, military commanders, and military strategists of all time; as Egypt&#x27;s preeminent warrior pharaoh and conqueror; and as a dominant figure in the New Kingdom period, itself considered the height of Egyptian power. He conducted between 17 and 20 campaigns, all victorious, while expanding Egypt&#x27;s empire to its largest extent. He also created the ancient Egyptian navy, the first navy in the ancient world. His military campaigns are detailed in the inscriptions known as the Annals of Thutmose III. Historian Richard A. Gabriel referred to Thutmose III as the &quot;Napoleon of Egypt&quot;.

== Name ==

Thutmose&#x27;s two main names transliterate as mn-ḫpr-rꜥ ḏḥwtj-ms. The first name is usually transcribed as &quot;Menkheperre&quot; and means &quot;the Established One of the Manifestation of Ra&quot;. The second name is transliterated as &quot;Thutmose&quot; or &quot;Tuthmosis&quot; and means &quot;Born of Thoth&quot; or &quot;Thoth is born.&quot; Manetho in his &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (&quot;History of Egypt&quot;) written in Greek and paraphrased by Eusebius called him &quot;Miphrês&quot; () and &quot;Misphragmuthôsis&quot; (.

==Family==


Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II by a secondary wife, Iset (or Aset). His father&#x27;s Great Royal Wife was Hatshepsut. Her daughter, Neferure, was Thutmose&#x27;s half-sister.

When Thutmose II died, Thutmose III was too young to rule. Hatshepsut became his regent, soon his co-regent, and shortly after that, declared herself pharaoh while never denying kingship to Thutmose III. During his childhood, Hatshepsut ruled Egypt in practice and name, achieving prosperity and success. While Thutmose is depicted as the first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other.

When Thutmose III reached a suitable age and demonstrated his capacity, Hatshepsut appointed him to head her armies, and at her death in 1458, he was ready to rule.

Some Egyptologists speculate that Thutmose married his half-sister, Neferure, but there is no conclusive evidence. Neferure may have been the mother of Thutmose&#x27;s firstborn son, Amenemhat, or alternatively his mother might have been the Great Royal Wife Satiah. Amenemhat predeceased his father.

Surviving records attest to several other wives of Thutmose. He is known to have at least three foreign wives, Menhet, Menwi and Merti, who were buried together. At least one other wife, Nebtu, is known from a pillar in Thutmose&#x27;s tomb. Following the death of Satiah, a woman named Merytre-Hatshepsut became the Great Royal Wife. She was the mother of several of his children, including the future king Amenhotep II and another son, Menkheperre, and at least four daughters: Nebetiunet, Meritamen C and D and Iset.

==Dates and length of reign==

Thutmose III reigned from 1479 BC to 1425 BC according to the Low Chronology of Ancient Egypt. This has been the conventional Egyptian chronology in academic circles since the 1960s, though in some circles the older dates 1504 BC to 1450 BC are preferred from the High Chronology of Egypt. These dates, just as all the dates of the Eighteenth Dynasty, are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a Heliacal Rise of Sothis in the reign of Amenhotep I. A papyrus from Amenhotep I&#x27;s reign records this astronomical observation which theoretically could be used to perfectly correlate the Egyptian chronology with the modern calendar; however, to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known. This document has no note of the place of observation, but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a Delta city, such as Memphis or Heliopolis, or in Thebes. These two latitudes give dates 20 years apart, the High and Low chronologies, respectively.

=== Year 54 ===
The length of Thutmose III&#x27;s reign is known to the day thanks to findings in the tomb of the military commander Amenemheb-Mahu. Amenemheb-Mahu records Thutmose III&#x27;s death to his master&#x27;s 54th regnal year, on the 30th day of the third month of &quot;Peret&quot;. The day of Thutmose III&#x27;s accession is known to be I Shemu day four, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of the king&#x27;s reign (assuming the low chronology) from 28 April 1479 BC to 11 March 1425 BC respectively.

==Military campaigns==
Thutmose III conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years. American Egyptologist James Breasted referred to him as &quot;the Napoleon of Egypt&quot; for his conquests and expansionism. He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia. He was the first pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were inscribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak (transcribed in Urkunden IV). He transformed Egypt into an international superpower, an empire stretching from the Asian regions of Syria in the North, to Upper Nubia in the south.

Much is known about Thutmose III as a warrior and ruler, through the writings of his royal scribe and army commander Thanuny. The pharoah was able to conquer so many lands because of revolutionary developments in military technology. The Hyksos may have brought advanced weaponry, such as horse-drawn chariots, around 1650 BC, which the Egyptians adopted in the process of driving them out. Thutmose III encountered little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm easily. His army also portaged boats over dry land.

===Campaign 1: Battle of Megiddo===
When Hatshepsut died on the 10th day of the sixth month of Thutmose III&#x27;s 21st year, according to a stela from Armant, the king of Kadesh advanced his army to Megiddo. Thutmose III mustered his own army and marched from Egypt, passing through the border fortress of Tjaru (Sile) on the 25th day of the eighth month. The army moved through the coastal plain as far as Jamnia, then turned inland, reaching Yehem, a small city near Megiddo, in the middle of the ninth month of the same year.

The ensuing Battle of Megiddo was likely the largest battle of Thutmose&#x27;s 17 campaigns. A ridge of mountains jutting inland from Mount Carmel stood between Thutmose and Megiddo and he had three attack routes to choose from. The northern and southern routes around the mountain were judged by his generals to be safest, but Thutmose (as he boasted in an inscription) called them cowards and took the dangerous route through the Aruna mountain pass, which he said was only wide enough for single-file &quot;horse after horse and man after man.&quot; Such a pass does exist, although it is not as narrow as Thutmose claims. The army emerged on the plain of Esdraelon, brilliantly cutting between the rear of the Canaanite forces and Megiddo city. According to Thutmose III&#x27;s Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the battle occurred on &quot;Year 23, I Shemu [day] 21, the exact day of the feast of the new moon&quot;, a lunar date. This date corresponds to 9 May 1457 BC, based on Thutmose III&#x27;s accession in 1479 BC. In the battle, Thutmose routed the Canaanite forces, but allowed many to escape into Megiddo while his troops stopped to plunder. Thutmose was forced to besiege the city, and finally took it after a siege of seven or eight months.

The size of the two forces is difficult to determine. Most scholars believe that the Egyptian army was more numerous. Redford uses the time to march the army through the pass estimate the Egyptian numbers, and the number of sheep and goats captured in the battle to estimate the Canaanite force, concluding both armies were around 10,000 men. 

This campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient Near East. By taking Megiddo, Thutmose gained control of all of northern Canaan, forcing the Syrian princes to send tribute and noble hostages to Egypt. Beyond the Euphrates, the Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite kings honored Thutmose with gifts, which he claimed as &quot;tribute&quot; on the walls of Karnak. The only notable absence was Mitanni, which would bear the brunt of subsequent Egyptian campaigns into Western Asia.

===Campaigns 2-4: Tours of Canaan and Syria===

Thutmose&#x27;s second, third, and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of Syria and Canaan to collect tribute. Traditionally, the material directly after the text of the first campaign has been considered to be the second campaign. This text records tribute from the area which the Egyptians called Retjenu (roughly equivalent to Canaan) and it was also at this time that Assyria paid a second &quot;tribute&quot; to Thutmose III. It is probable that these texts come from Thutmose&#x27;s 40th year or later and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all. If so, no records of this campaign have been found. Thutmose&#x27;s third campaign was not considered significant enough to appear in his otherwise extensive Annals at Karnak. A survey was made of the animals and plants he found in Canaan, which was illustrated on the walls of a special room at Karnak. This survey is dated to Thutmose&#x27;s 25th year. No record remains of Thutmose&#x27;s fourth campaign, but at some point a fort was built in lower Lebanon and timber was cut for construction of a processional barque, and this probably fits best during this time frame.

===Campaigns 5-7: Conquest of Syria===
The fifth, sixth and seventh campaigns of Thutmose III were directed against the Phoenician cities in Syria and against Kadesh on the Orontes. In Thutmose&#x27;s 29th year, he began his fifth campaign, where he first took an unknown city (the name falls in a lacuna) which had been garrisoned by Tunip. He then moved inland and took the city and territory around Ardata; the town was pillaged and its wheatfields burned. Unlike previous plundering raids, Thutmose III garrisoned Djahy, a name which probably refers to southern Syria. This would have permitted him to ship supplies and troops between Syria and Egypt, and some have supposed that Thutmose&#x27;s sixth campaign, in his thirtieth year, commenced with naval transport of troops directly to Byblos, bypassing Canaan. After the troops arrived in Syria, they proceeded into the Jordan River valley and moved north, pillaging Kadesh&#x27;s lands. Turning west again, Thutmose took Simyra and quelled a rebellion in Ardata, which apparently had rebelled again. To stop such rebellions, Thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in Syria. The policy of these cities was driven by their nobles, aligned to Mitanni and typically consisting of a king and a small number of foreign Maryannu. Thutmose III found that taking hostages from these noble families largely ensured their loyalty. Syria rebelled again in Thutmose&#x27;s 31st year and he returned for his seventh campaign, taking the port city of Ullaza and the smaller Phoenician ports, and imposing more measures to prevent rebellion. By taking away the grain stores of Syria to his recently conquered harbors for support of his occupying troops and administrators, he left the famished cities of Syria without the means to fund further rebellions.

===Campaign 8: Attack on Mitanni===
After Thutmose III had taken control of the Syrian cities, the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of Mitanni, a Hurrian country with an Indo-Aryan ruling class. However, to reach Mitanni, he had to cross the Euphrates River. He sailed directly to Byblos and made boats which he took with him over land on what appeared to otherwise be just another tour of Syria, and he proceeded with the usual raiding and pillaging as he moved north through the lands he had already taken. He continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish and quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise. It appears that Mitanni was not expecting an invasion, so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against Thutmose, although their ships on the Euphrates did try to defend against the Egyptian crossing. Thutmose III then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves, or at least this is the typically propagandistic way Egyptian records chose to record it. During this period of no opposition, Thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the Euphrates next to the stele his grandfather, Thutmose I, had put up several decades earlier. A militia was raised to fight the invaders, but it fared very poorly. Thutmose III then returned to Syria by way of Niy, where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt. He collected tribute from foreign powers and returned to Egypt in victory.
===Campaigns 9-16: Tours of Syria===
Thutmose III returned to Syria for his ninth campaign in his 34th year, but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called Nukhashshe, a region populated by semi-nomadic people. The plunder recorded is minimal, so it was probably just a minor raid. Records from his 10th campaign indicate much more fighting. By Thutmose&#x27;s 35th year, the king of Mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the Egyptians around Aleppo. As usual for any Egyptian king, Thutmose boasted a total crushing victory, but this statement is suspect due to the very small amount of plunder taken. Thutmose&#x27;s annals at Karnak indicate he only took a total of 10 prisoners of war. He may have fought the Mitannians to a stalemate, yet he did receive tribute from the Hittites after that campaign, which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in Thutmose&#x27;s favor.

The details about his next two campaigns are unknown. His 11th is presumed to have happened in his 36th regnal year and his 12th is presumed to have happened in his 37th year since his 13th is mentioned at Karnak as happening in his 38th regnal year. Part of the tribute list for his 12th campaign remains immediately before his 13th begins, and the contents recorded, specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification, might indicate that it took place on the steppe around Nukhashshe, but this remains mere speculation.

In Year 38, Thutmose III conducted his 13th military campaign returning to Nuhašše for a very minor campaign.

His 14th campaign, waged during his 39th year, was against the Shasu. The location of this campaign is impossible to determine since the Shasu were nomads who could have lived anywhere from Lebanon to the Transjordan to Edom. After this campaign, the numbers given by Thutmose&#x27;s scribes to his campaigns all fall in lacunae, so they can only be counted by date.

In his 40th year, tribute was collected from foreign powers, but it is unknown if this was considered a campaign (i.e. if the king went with it or if it was led by an official).

Only the tribute list remains from Thutmose&#x27;s next campaign, and nothing may be deduced about it except that it was probably another raid to the frontiers around Niy.

His final Asian campaign is better documented. Sometime before Thutmose&#x27;s 42nd year, Mitanni apparently began spreading revolt among all the major cities in Syria. Thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the Arka plain (&quot;Arkantu&quot; in Thutmose&#x27;s chronicle) and moved on Tunip. After taking Tunip, his attention turned to Kadesh again. He engaged and destroyed three surrounding Mitannian garrisons and returned to Egypt in victory. His victory in this final campaign was neither complete nor permanent since he did not take Kadesh, and Tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long, certainly not beyond his own death. This victory however, must have had quite an impact, for the next tribute lists include Adana, a Cilician city.

===Campaign 17: Nubian campaign===
In Year 50, Thutmose III waged his last military campaign. He attacked Nubia, but only went so far as the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated so far with an army, previous kings&#x27; campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal dates from three years &quot;before&quot; Thutmose&#x27;s campaign.

==Monuments==
Thutmose III, a great builder, constructed more than 50 temples. Some are now lost, recorded only in written records. He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. His reign saw stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings and reliefs associated with construction, much of it beginning during the reign of Hatshepsut.


===Artistic developments===
Thutmose&#x27;s architects and artisans followed traditional relief styles for most of his reign. But after his 42nd year he is depicted wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and a šndyt-kilt, an unprecedented style. Architecturally, his use of pillars was unprecedented. He built Egypt&#x27;s only known set of heraldic pillars, two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof. His jubilee hall was arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style. Thutmose&#x27;s artisans achieved new heights of skill in painting, and tombs from his reign were the earliest to be entirely painted instead of painted reliefs. It appears that Thutmose&#x27;s artisans learned glass-making skills, developed in the early 18th Dynasty, to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method.

===Karnak===
Thutmose dedicated far more attention to Karnak than any other site. In the Iput-isut, the temple proper in the center, he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather Thutmose I, dismantled the red chapel of Hatshepsut, built Pylon VI, a shrine for the bark of Amun in its place, and built an antechamber in front of it, the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars. He built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels, along with workshops and storerooms. East of the main sanctuary, he built a jubilee hall in which to celebrate his Sed festival. The main hall was built in basilica style with rows of pillars supporting the ceiling on each side of the aisle. The central two rows were higher than the others to create windows where the ceiling was split. Two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of Canaan which he took in his third campaign.

East of the Iput-Isut, he erected another temple to Aten, where he was depicted as being supported by Amun. It was inside this temple that Thutmose planned on erecting his &quot;tekhen waty&quot;, or &quot;unique obelisk.&quot; The &quot;tekhen waty&quot; was designed to stand alone instead as part of a pair and is the tallest obelisk ever successfully cut. It was not, however, erected until Thutmose IV raised it 35 years later. It was later moved to Rome by Emperor Constantius II and is now known as the Lateran Obelisk.

In 390 AD, Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius I re-erected another obelisk from the Temple of Karnak in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, now known as the Obelisk of Theodosius.

Thutmose also undertook building projects to the south of the main temple between the sanctuary of Amun and the temple of Mut. Immediately to the south of the main temple, he built the seventh pylon on the north–south road which entered the temple between the fourth and fifth pylons. It was built for use during his jubilee and was covered with scenes of defeated enemies. He set royal colossi on both sides of the pylon and put two more obelisks on the south face in front of the gateway. The eastern obelisk&#x27;s base remains in place, but the western obelisk was transported to the Hippodrome in Constantinople. Farther south along the road, he put up Pylon VIII, which Hatshepsut had begun. East of the road, he dug a sacred lake of 250 by 400 feet and placed another alabaster bark shrine near it. He commissioned royal artists to depict his extensive collections of fauna and flora in the Botanical garden of Thutmosis III.

===Other Attestations===
At Heliopolis, a stela dated to year 47 of Tuthmosis III.

===Defacing of Hatshepsut&#x27;s monuments===

For many years, egyptologists theorized that following the death of Thutmose II, his queen Hatshepsut usurped the throne from her stepson Thutmose III. Although Thutmose III was co-regent during this time, early historians have speculated that he never forgave his stepmother for overshadowing him. Some time after her death, many of Hatshepsut&#x27;s monuments and depictions were defaced or destroyed, including those in her famous mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. These were interpreted by early modern scholars as &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; (erasure from recorded existence) by Thutmose III in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession.

However, recent research casts serious doubt upon the popular theory of Thutmose III&#x27;s vengeance. Scholars such as Charles Nims and Peter Dorman have re-examined the erasures and found that those which could be dated only began during year 46 or 47, toward the end of Thutmose&#x27;s reign (). Also the monuments of Hatshepsut&#x27;s chief steward, Senenmut, closely associated with her rule, were similarly defaced where they were found. Furthermore, it is known that Hatshepsut trusted Thutmose III to command her armies. No strong evidence has been found that Thutmose III sought to claim the throne, and after her death he kept her religious and administrative leaders. He even built his mortuary temple directly next to Hatshepsut&#x27;s, showing no grudge against her.

By the time the monuments of Hatshepsut were damaged, at least 25 years after her death, the elderly Thutmose III was in a coregency with his son Amenhotep II. Currently, the purposeful destruction of the memory of Hatshepsut is seen as an attempt to ensure a smooth succession for Amenhotep II, as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of Hatshepsut with an equal or better claim to the throne. Amenhotep II would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. Later, Amenhotep II even claimed that he had built the structures he defaced. It may also be that the attack on Hatshepsut&#x27;s memory could not be taken until the death of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.

==Death and burial==

Thutmose&#x27;s tomb (KV34) was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898 in the Valley of the Kings. Its plan is typical of 18th Dynasty tombs, with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule, which is preceded by a quadrangular shaft or &quot;well&quot;.

A complete version of Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text, is in the vestibule, making it the first tomb where the complete text was found. The burial chamber, supported by two pillars, is oval-shaped and its ceiling decorated with stars, symbolizing the cave of the deity Sokar. In the middle lies a large red quartzite sarcophagus in the shape of a cartouche. On the two pillars in the middle of the chamber are passages from the Litanies of Re celebrating the later sun deity, who was identified with the pharaoh at this time. On the other pillar is a unique image depicting Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the guise of the tree.

The wall decorations are executed in a simple &quot;diagrammatic&quot; way, imitating the manner of the cursive script of a funerary papyrus rather than the more lavish wall decorations typical of most other royal tombs. The colouring is similarly muted, executed in simple black figures accompanied by text on a cream background with highlights in red and pink. The decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the deities in defeating Apep, the serpent of chaos, thereby helping to ensure the daily rebirth of the sun as well as the pharaoh&#x27;s own resurrection.

According to Peter Der Manuelian, a statement in the tomb biography of the official Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died in Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his reign after ruling Egypt for &quot;53 years, 10 months and 26 days&quot; (Urk. 180.15). Thutmose III died one month and four days before the start of his 54th regnal year. When the co-regencies with Hatshepsut and Amenhotep II are deducted, he ruled as sole pharaoh for just over 30 years.

===Mummy===

Thutmose III&#x27;s mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in 1881. He was interred along with those of other 18th and 19th Dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st Dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II and Siamun.
While it is popularly thought that his mummy originally was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero in 1886, it was in fact first unwrapped by Émile Brugsch, the Egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache in 1881. It was unwrapped soon after its arrival in the Boulak Museum while Maspero was away in France, and the Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service ordered the mummy re-wrapped. So when it was &quot;officially&quot; unwrapped by Maspero in 1886, he almost certainly knew it was in relatively poor condition.

The mummy had been damaged extensively in antiquity by tomb robbers and its wrappings subsequently cut into and torn by the Rassul family, who had rediscovered the tomb and its contents only a few years before. Maspero&#x27;s description of the body provides an idea as to the severity of the damage:
His mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.

Of the face, which was undamaged, Maspero says the following:
Happily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Thûtmosis II, though with a greater show of energy.

Maspero was so disheartened at the state of the mummy and the prospect that all of the other mummies were similarly damaged (as it turned out, few were in so poor a state) that he would not unwrap another for several years.

Unlike many other examples from the Deir el-Bahri Cache, the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh, though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity.

In his examination of the mummy, the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith stated the height of Thutmose III&#x27;s mummy to be , but the mummy was missing its feet, so Thutmose III was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by Smith. It resided in the Royal Mummies Hall of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, catalog number CG 61068, until April 2021 when the mummy was moved to National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and four queens in the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<text>Orishas (singular: orisha) are divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba religion of West Africa and several religions of the African diaspora that derive from it, such as Haitian Vaudou, Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican Santería and Brazilian Candomblé. The preferred spelling varies depending on the language in question: òrìṣà is the spelling in the Yoruba language, orixá in Portuguese, and orisha, oricha, orichá or orixá in Spanish-speaking countries.

According to the teachings of these religions, the orishas are spirits sent by the supreme creator, Olodumare, to assist humanity and to teach them to be successful on &quot;Ayé&quot; (Earth). Rooted in the native religion of the Yoruba people, most orishas are said to have previously existed in òrún—the spirit world—and then became Irúnmọlẹ̀—spirits or divine beings incarnated as human on Earth. Irunmole took upon a human identity and lived as ordinary humans in the physical world, but because they had their origin in the divine, they had great wisdom and power at the moment of their creation.

The orishas found their way to most of the New World as a result of the Atlantic slave trade and are now expressed in practices as varied as Haitian Vodou, Santería, Candomblé, Trinidad Orisha, Umbanda, and Oyotunji, among others. The concept of òrìṣà is similar to those of deities in the traditional religions of the Bini people of Edo State in southern Nigeria, the Ewe people of Benin, Ghana, and Togo, and the Fon people of Benin.

==Number==
Yoruba tradition often says that there are 400 + 1 orishas, which is associated with a sacred number. Other sources suggest that the number is &quot;as many as you can think of, plus one more – an innumerable number&quot;. Different oral traditions refer to 400, 700, or 1,440 orishas.

==Beliefs==

Practitioners traditionally believe that daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one&#x27;s &quot;Orí&quot;. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean a portion of the soul that determines personal destiny.

Some orishas are rooted in ancestor worship; warriors, kings, and founders of cities were celebrated after death and joined the pantheon of Yoruba deities. The ancestors did not die but were seen to have &quot;disappeared&quot; and become orishas. Some orishas based on historical figures are confined to worship in their families or towns of origin; others are venerated across wider geographic areas.

===Ase===

&quot;Ase&quot; is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate, and is described as the power to make things happen. It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Orìṣà devotees strive to obtain Ase through &quot;iwa-pele&quot;, gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ase is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity, and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the Sun. Without the Sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ase is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger orisha. For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the orishas, and the ancestors.

The concept is regularly referenced in Brazilian capoeira. Axé in this context is used as a greeting or farewell, in songs and as a form of praise. Saying that someone &quot;has axé&quot; in capoeira is complimenting their energy, fighting spirit, and attitude.

== Pantheon ==

The orisa are grouped as those represented by the color white, who are characterized as &quot;tutu&quot; &quot;cool, calm, gentle, and temperate&quot;; and those represented by the colors red or black, who are characterized as &quot;gbigbona&quot; &quot;bold, strong, assertive, and easily annoyed&quot;. Like humans, orishas may have a preferred color, food, or object. The traits of the orishas are documented through oral tradition.

<doc id="155736" wikidata="Q134180" url="?curid=155736" title="Truman Capote">
<text>Truman Garcia Capote ( ; born Truman Streckfus Persons; September 30, 1924 – August 25, 1984) was an American novelist, screenwriter, playwright, and actor. Several of his short stories, novels, and plays have been praised as literary classics, and he is regarded as one of the founders of New Journalism, along with Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, and Tom Wolfe. His work and his life story have been adapted into and have been the subject of more than 20 films and television productions.

Capote had a troubled childhood caused by his parents&#x27; divorce, a long absence from his mother, and multiple moves. He was planning to become a writer by the time he was eight years old, and he honed his writing ability throughout his childhood. He began his professional career writing short stories. The critical success of &quot;Miriam&quot; (1945) attracted the attention of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf and resulted in a contract to write the novel &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (1948). He achieved widespread acclaim with &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1958)—a novella about a fictional New York café society girl named Holly Golightly, and the true crime novel &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1966)—a journalistic work about the murder of a Kansas farm family in their home. Capote spent six years writing the latter, aided by his lifelong friend Harper Lee, who wrote &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960).

== Early life ==
Truman Capote was born at Touro Infirmary in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Lillie Mae Faulk (1905–1954) and salesman Archulus Persons (1897–1981). He was sent to Monroeville, Alabama, where, for the following four to five years, he was raised by his mother&#x27;s relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother&#x27;s distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called &quot;Sook&quot;. &quot;Her face is remarkable – not unlike Lincoln&#x27;s, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind&quot;, is how Capote described Sook in &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; (1956). In Monroeville, Capote was a neighbor and friend of Harper Lee, who would also go on to become an acclaimed author and a lifelong friend of Capote&#x27;s. Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; likely models Dill&#x27;s characterization upon Capote.

As a lonely child, Capote taught himself to read and write before he entered his first year of school. Capote was often seen at age five carrying his dictionary and notepad, and began writing fiction at age 11. He was given the nickname &quot;Bulldog&quot; around this age.

On Saturdays, he made trips from Monroeville to the nearby city of Mobile on the Gulf Coast, and at one point submitted a short story, &quot;Old Mrs. Busybody&quot;, to a children&#x27;s writing contest sponsored by the &quot;Mobile Press Register&quot;. Capote received recognition for his early work from The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards in 1936.

In 1932, he moved to New York City to live with his mother and her second husband, José García Capote. José was a former Spanish colonel who became a landlord at Union de Reyes, Cuba.

Of his early days, Capote related, &quot;I was writing really sort of serious when I was about eleven. I say seriously in the sense that like other kids go home and practice the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it.&quot; In 1932, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school&#x27;s literary journal, &quot;The Green Witch&quot;, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1941, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1942. That was the end of his formal education.

While still attending Franklin in 1942, Capote began working as a copy boy in the art department at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a job he held for two years before being fired for angering poet Robert Frost. Years later, he reflected, &quot;Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, I was fortunate to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn&#x27;t a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, at least in my own case.&quot; He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and began writing his first novel, &quot;Summer Crossing&quot;.

He was called for induction into the armed services during World War II, but he later told a friend that he was &quot;turned down for everything, including the WACS&quot;. He later explained that he was found to be &quot;too neurotic&quot;.

=== Friendship with Harper Lee ===
Capote based the character of Idabel in &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; on his Monroeville, Alabama neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee&#x27;s mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; I&#x27;m a character in that book, which takes place in the same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies.&quot; After Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and Capote published &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.

== Writing career ==
=== Short story phase ===

Capote began writing short stories around the age of eight. In 2013, the Swiss publisher Peter Haag discovered fourteen unpublished stories, written when Capote was a teenager, in the New York Public Library Archives. Random House published these in 2015, under the title &quot;The Early Stories of Truman Capote&quot;.

Between 1943 and 1946, Capote wrote a continual flow of short fiction, including &quot;Miriam&quot;, &quot;My Side of the Matter&quot;, and &quot;Shut a Final Door&quot; (for which he won the O. Henry Award in 1948, at the age of 24). His stories were published in both literary quarterlies and well-known popular magazines, including &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot;, and &quot;Story&quot;. In June 1945, &quot;Miriam&quot; was published by &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and went on to win a prize, Best First-Published Story, in 1946. In the spring of 1946, Capote was accepted at Yaddo, the artists and writers colony at Saratoga Springs, New York. (He later endorsed Patricia Highsmith as a Yaddo candidate, and she wrote &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; while she was there.)

During an interview for &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in 1957, Capote said this of his short story technique:

Random House, the publisher of his novel &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (see below), moved to capitalize on this novel&#x27;s success with the publication of &quot;A Tree of Night and Other Stories&quot; in 1949. In addition to &quot;Miriam&quot;, this collection also includes &quot;Shut a Final Door&quot;, first published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; (August 1947).

After &quot;A Tree of Night&quot;, Capote published a collection of his travel writings, &quot;Local Color&quot; (1950), which included nine essays originally published in magazines between 1946 and 1950.

&quot;A Christmas Memory&quot;, a largely autobiographical story taking place in the 1930s, was published in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine in 1956. It was issued as a hard-cover standalone edition in 1966, and has since been published in many editions and anthologies.

=== Posthumously published early novel ===
Some time in the 1940s, Capote wrote a novel set in New York City about the summer romance of a socialite and a parking lot attendant. Capote later claimed to have destroyed the manuscript of this novel; but twenty years after his death, in 2004, it came to light that the manuscript had been retrieved from the trash back in 1950 by a house sitter at an apartment formerly occupied by Capote. The novel was published in 2006 by Random House under the title &quot;Summer Crossing&quot;.

As of 2013, the film rights to &quot;Summer Crossing&quot; had been purchased by actress Scarlett Johansson, who reportedly planned to direct the adaptation.

=== First novel, &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; ===
The critical success of one of his short stories, &quot;Miriam&quot; (1945), attracted the attention of the publisher Bennett Cerf, resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of $1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;, continuing to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Saratoga Springs, New York, and North Carolina, eventually completing it in Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was published in 1948. Capote described this symbolic tale as &quot;a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion&quot;. The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote&#x27;s Alabama childhood. Decades later, writing in &quot;The Dogs Bark&quot; (1973), he commented:
:&quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable.

The story focuses on thirteen-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from New Orleans to live with his father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully&#x27;s Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched transvestite Randolph, and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral &quot;queer lady&quot; with &quot;fat dribbling curls&quot; watching him from a top window. Despite Joel&#x27;s queries, the whereabouts of his father remains a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph. Joel runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing, where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the &quot;queer lady&quot; beckoning from the window is Randolph in his old Mardi Gras costume. Gerald Clarke, in &quot;Capote: A Biography&quot; (1988) described the conclusion:
:Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. &quot;I am me&quot;, he whoops. &quot;I am Joel, we are the same people.&quot; So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity.
==== Harold Halma photograph ====

&quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; made &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list and stayed there for nine weeks, selling more than 26,000 copies. The promotion and controversy surrounding this novel catapulted Capote to fame. A 1947 Harold Halma photograph used to promote the book showed a reclining Capote gazing fiercely into the camera. Gerald Clarke, in &quot;Capote: A Biography&quot; (1988), wrote, &quot;The famous photograph: Harold Halma&#x27;s picture on the dustjacket of &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (1948) caused as much comment and controversy as the prose inside. Truman claimed that the camera had caught him off guard, but in fact he had posed himself and was responsible for both the picture and the publicity.&quot; Much of the early attention to Capote centered on different interpretations of this photograph, which was viewed as a suggestive pose by some. According to Clarke, the photo created an &quot;uproar&quot; and gave Capote &quot;not only the literary, but also the public personality he had always wanted&quot;. The photo made a huge impression on the twenty-year-old Andy Warhol, who often talked about it and wrote fan letters to Capote. When Warhol moved to New York in 1949, he made numerous attempts to meet Capote, and Warhol&#x27;s fascination with the author led to Warhol&#x27;s first New York one-man show, &quot;Fifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote&quot; at the Hugo Gallery (June 16 – July 3, 1952).
When the photograph was reprinted along with reviews in magazines and newspapers, some readers were amused, but others were outraged and offended. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Capote looked &quot;as if he were dreamily contemplating some outrage against conventional morality&quot;. The novelist Merle Miller issued a complaint about the photograph at a publishing forum, and it was satirized in the third issue of &quot;Mad&quot; (making Capote one of the first four celebrities to be spoofed in &quot;Mad&quot;). The humorist Max Shulman struck an identical pose for the dustjacket photo on his collection, &quot;Max Shulman&#x27;s Large Economy Size&quot; (1948). The Broadway stage revue &quot;New Faces&quot; (and the subsequent film version) featured a skit in which Ronny Graham parodied Capote, deliberately copying his pose in the Halma photograph. Random House featured the Halma photograph in its &quot;This is Truman Capote&quot; ads, and large blowups were displayed in bookstore windows. Walking on Fifth Avenue, Halma overheard two middle-aged women looking at a Capote blowup in the window of a bookstore. When one woman said, &quot;I&#x27;m telling you: he&#x27;s just young&quot;, the other woman responded, &quot;And I&#x27;m telling you, if he isn&#x27;t young, he&#x27;s dangerous!&quot; Capote delighted in retelling this anecdote.

=== Stage, screen, and magazine work ===
In the early 1950s, Capote took on Broadway and films, adapting his 1951 novella, &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;, into a 1952 play of the same name (later a 1971 musical and a 1995 film), followed by the musical &quot;House of Flowers&quot; (1954), which spawned the song &quot;A Sleepin&#x27; Bee&quot;.

In fall of 1952, the same year as his first play, film producer David O. Selznick hired Capote alongside two Hollywood screenwriters for the script of &quot;Terminal Station&quot;. A few months later in early 1953, John Huston hired him for &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;. In 1960, while writing &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, Jack Clayton approached him to rewrite the script for &quot;The Innocents&quot;. Capote set aside his novel and in eight weeks produced the script used for the final film.

Traveling through the Soviet Union with a touring production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, he produced a series of articles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that became his first book-length work of nonfiction, &quot;The Muses Are Heard&quot; (1956).

In this period he also wrote an autobiographical essay for &quot;Holiday Magazine&quot;—one of his personal favorites—about his life in Brooklyn Heights in the late 1950s, titled &quot;Brooklyn Heights: A Personal Memoir&quot; (1959). In November 2015, The Little Bookroom issued a new coffee-table edition of that work, which includes David Attie&#x27;s previously-unpublished portraits of Capote as well as Attie&#x27;s street photography taken in connection with the essay, entitled &quot;Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, With The Lost Photographs of David Attie&quot;. This edition was well-reviewed in America and overseas, and was also a finalist for a 2016 Indie Book Award.

In 1961 he signed an advertisement for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He later expressed regret for this, as he had genuinely believed Castro was not a communist.

=== &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; ===

&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s: A Short Novel and Three Stories&quot; (1958) brought together the title novella and three shorter tales: &quot;House of Flowers&quot;, &quot;A Diamond Guitar&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot;. The heroine of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, Holly Golightly, became one of Capote&#x27;s best known creations, and the book&#x27;s prose style prompted Norman Mailer to call Capote &quot;the most perfect writer of my generation&quot;.

The novella itself was originally supposed to be published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; July 1958 issue, several months before its publication in book form by Random House. The publisher of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, the Hearst Corporation, began demanding changes to Capote&#x27;s tart language, which he reluctantly made because he had liked the photos by David Attie and the design work by Harper&#x27;s art director Alexey Brodovitch that were to accompany the text. But despite his compliance, Hearst ordered Harper&#x27;s not to run the novella anyway. Its language and subject matter were still deemed &quot;not suitable&quot;, and there was concern that Tiffany&#x27;s, a major advertiser, would react negatively. An outraged Capote resold the novella to &quot;Esquire&quot; for its November 1958 issue; by his own account, he told &quot;Esquire&quot; he would only be interested in doing so if Attie&#x27;s original series of photos was included, but to his disappointment, the magazine ran just a single full-page image of Attie&#x27;s (another was later used as the cover of at least one paperback edition of the novella). The novella was published by Random House shortly afterwards.

For Capote, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was a turning point, as he explained to Roy Newquist (&quot;Counterpoint&quot;, 1964):

=== &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; ===
The &quot;new book&quot;, &quot;In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences&quot; (1965), was inspired by a 300-word article that ran in the November 16, 1959, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The story described the unexplained murder of the Clutter family in rural Holcomb, Kansas, and quoted the local sheriff as saying, &quot;This is apparently the case of a psychopathic killer.&quot; Fascinated by this brief news item, Capote traveled with Harper Lee to Holcomb and visited the scene of the massacre. Over the course of the next few years, he became acquainted with everyone involved in the investigation and most of the residents of the small town and the area. Rather than taking notes during interviews, Capote committed conversations to memory and immediately wrote quotes as soon as an interview ended. He claimed his memory retention for verbatim conversations had been tested at &quot;over 90%&quot;. Lee made inroads into the community by befriending the wives of those Capote wanted to interview.

Capote recalled his years in Kansas when he spoke at the 1974 San Francisco International Film Festival:

&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was published in 1966 by Random House after having been serialized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The &quot;nonfiction novel&quot;, as Capote labeled it, brought him literary acclaim and became an international bestseller, but Capote would never complete another novel after it.

A feud between Capote and British arts critic Kenneth Tynan erupted in the pages of &quot;The Observer&quot; after Tynan&#x27;s review of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; implied that Capote wanted an execution so the book would have an effective ending. Tynan wrote:

=== Veracity of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and other nonfiction ===
&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; brought Capote much praise from the literary community, but there were some who questioned certain events as reported in the book. Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1966, Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies after he traveled to Kansas and spoke to some of the same people interviewed by Capote. In a telephone interview with Tompkins, Mrs. Meier denied that she heard Perry cry and that she held his hand as described by Capote. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; indicates that Meier and Perry became close, yet she told Tompkins she spent little time with Perry and did not talk much with him. Tompkins concluded:

Capote has, in short, achieved a work of art. He has told exceedingly well a tale of high terror in his own way. But, despite the brilliance of his self-publicizing efforts, he has made both a tactical and a moral error that will hurt him in the short run. By insisting that &quot;every word&quot; of his book is true he has made himself vulnerable to those readers who are prepared to examine seriously such a sweeping claim.

True crime writer Jack Olsen also commented on the fabrications:

Alvin Dewey, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation detective portrayed in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, later said that the last scene, in which he visits the Clutters&#x27; graves, was Capote&#x27;s invention, while other Kansas residents whom Capote interviewed have claimed they or their relatives were mischaracterized or misquoted. Dewey and his wife Marie became friends of Capote during the time Capote spent in Kansas gathering research for his book. Dewey gave Capote access to the case files and other items related to the investigation and to the members of the Clutter family, including Nancy Clutter&#x27;s diary. When the film version of the book was made in 1967, Capote arranged for Marie Dewey to receive $10,000 from Columbia Pictures as a paid consultant to the making of the film.

Another work described by Capote as &quot;nonfiction&quot; was later reported to have been largely fabricated. In a 1992 piece in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, reporters Peter and Leni Gillman investigated the source of &quot;Handcarved Coffins&quot;, the story in Capote&#x27;s last work &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; subtitled &quot;a nonfiction account of an American crime&quot;. They found no reported series of American murders in the same town that included all of the details Capote described – the sending of miniature coffins, a rattlesnake murder, a decapitation, etc. Instead, they found that a few of the details closely mirrored an unsolved case on which investigator Al Dewey had worked. Their conclusion was that Capote had invented the rest of the story, including his meetings with the suspected killer, Quinn.

=== Years following &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; ===
Now more sought after than ever, Capote wrote occasional brief articles for magazines, and also entrenched himself more deeply in the world of the jet set. Gore Vidal once observed, &quot;Truman Capote has tried, with some success, to get into a world that I have tried, with some success, to get out of.&quot;

In the late 1960s, he became friendly with Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Radziwill was an aspiring actress and had been panned for her performance in a production of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; in Chicago. Capote was commissioned to write the teleplay for a 1967 television production starring Radziwill: an adaptation of the classic Otto Preminger film &quot;Laura&quot; (1944). The adaptation, and Radziwill&#x27;s performance in particular, received indifferent reviews and poor ratings; arguably, it was Capote&#x27;s first major professional setback. Radziwill supplanted the older Babe Paley as Capote&#x27;s primary female companion in public throughout the better part of the 1970s.

On November 28, 1966, in honor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; publisher Katharine Graham, Capote hosted a now-legendary masked ball, called the Black and White Ball, in the Grand Ballroom of New York City&#x27;s Plaza Hotel. It was considered the social event of not only that season but of many to follow, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other publications giving it considerable coverage. Capote dangled the prized invitations for months, snubbing early supporters like fellow Southern writer Carson McCullers as he determined who was &quot;in&quot; and who was &quot;out&quot;.

Despite the assertion earlier in life that one &quot;lost an IQ point for every year spent on the West Coast&quot;, he purchased a home in Palm Springs and began to indulge in a more aimless life and heavy drinking. This resulted in bitter quarreling with Jack Dunphy, with whom he had shared a nonexclusive relationship since the 1950s. Their partnership changed form and continued as a nonsexual one, and they were separated during much of the 1970s.

Capote never finished another novel after &quot;In Cold Blood.&quot; The dearth of new prose and other failures, including a rejected screenplay for Paramount Pictures&#x27;s 1974 adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, were counteracted by Capote&#x27;s frequenting of the talk show circuit. In 1972, Capote accompanied The Rolling Stones on their first American tour since 1969 as a correspondent for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He ultimately refused to write the article, so the magazine recouped its interests by publishing in April 1973 an interview of the author conducted by Andy Warhol. A collection of previously published essays and reportage, &quot;The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places&quot;, appeared later that year.

In July 1973, Capote met John O&#x27;Shea, the middle-aged vice president of a Marine Midland Bank branch on Long Island, while visiting a New York bathhouse. The married father of three did not identify as homosexual or bisexual, perceiving his visits as being a &quot;kind of masturbation&quot;. However, O&#x27;Shea found Capote&#x27;s fortune alluring and harbored aspirations to become a professional writer. After consummating their relationship in Palm Springs, the two engaged in a war of jealousy and manipulation for the remainder of the decade. Longtime friends were appalled when O&#x27;Shea, who was officially employed as Capote&#x27;s manager, attempted to take control of the author&#x27;s literary and business interests.

=== &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; ===
Through his jet set social life Capote had been gathering observations for a tell-all novel, eventually to be published as &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;. The book, which had been in the planning stages since 1958, was intended to be the American equivalent of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; and a culmination of the &quot;nonfiction novel&quot; format. Initially scheduled for publication in 1968, the novel was eventually delayed, at Capote&#x27;s insistence, to 1972. Because of the delay, he was forced to return money received for the film rights to 20th Century Fox. Capote spoke about the novel in interviews, but continued to postpone his manuscript&#x27;s delivery date.

Capote permitted &quot;Esquire&quot; to publish four chapters of the unfinished novel in 1975 and 1976. The first to appear, &quot;Mojave&quot;, ran as a self-contained short story and was favorably received, but the second, &quot;La Côte Basque 1965&quot;, based in part on the dysfunctional personal lives of Capote&#x27;s friends William S. Paley and Babe Paley, generated controversy. The issue featuring &quot;La Côte Basque&quot; sold out immediately upon publication; its much-discussed betrayal of confidences alienated Capote from his established base of middle-aged, wealthy female friends, who feared the intimate and often sordid details of their ostensibly glamorous lives would be exposed to the public. Another two chapters – &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot; and &quot;Kate McCloud&quot; – appeared subsequently. These texts were intended to form the long opening section of the novel. They displayed a marked shift in narrative voice, introduced a more elaborate plot structure, and together formed a novella-length mosaic of fictionalized memoir and gossip. &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot;, which by itself was almost as long as &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, contained a thinly veiled satire of Tennessee Williams, whose friendship with Capote had become strained.

As much as Capote had completed of the novel was published after his death as &quot;Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel&quot; in 1986 in the UK and in the US in 1987. It comprised &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot;, &quot;Kate McCloud&quot;, and &quot;La Cote Basque 1965&quot;, but not &quot;Mojave&quot;, which Capote had &quot;removed from the novel&#x27;s master plan&quot; and instead published in the collection &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; in 1980.

=== &quot;La Côte Basque 1965&quot; ===
&quot;La Côte Basque 1965&quot; was published as a standalone chapter in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in November 1975. The catty beginning to his still-unfinished novel, &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;, was the catalyst of Capote&#x27;s social suicide. Many of Capote&#x27;s circle of high-society female friends, whom he called his &quot;swans&quot;, were featured in the text, some under pseudonyms and others by their real names. The chapter is said to have revealed the dirty secrets of these women, and aired the &quot;dirty laundry&quot; of New York City&#x27;s elite. As a result Capote was ostracized from New York society and from many of his former friends.

&quot;La Côte Basque&quot; begins as Jonesy, the main character, said to be based on a mixture of Capote himself and Herbert Clutter, the serial killer victim at the center of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, has a rendezvous with Lady Ina Coolbirth on a New York City street. Described as &quot;an American married to a British chemicals tycoon and a lot of woman in every way&quot;, she is widely rumoured to be based on New York socialite Slim Keith. Coolbirth invites Jonesy to lunch at La Côte Basque. A gossipy tale of New York&#x27;s elite ensues.

The characters of Gloria Vanderbilt and Carol Matthau are encountered first, the two women gossiping about Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and the rest of the British royal family. An awkward moment occurs when Vanderbilt has a run-in with her first husband and fails to recognize him. It is only at Mrs. Matthau&#x27;s prompting that Vanderbilt realizes who he is. Both women brush the incident aside and chalk it up to ancient history.

The characters of Lee Radziwill and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis are then encountered when they enter the restaurant together. Sisters, they draw the attention of the room although they speak only to each other. Coolbirth describes Lee as &quot;marvelously made, like a Tanagra figurine&quot; and Jacqueline as &quot;photogenic&quot; yet &quot;unrefined, exaggerated&quot;.

The character of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously walks into the restaurant and sits down with a pastor. Hopkins is likened to Ann Woodward. Coolbirth relates the story of how Hopkins murdered her husband. When he threatened to divorce her, she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while she and her husband were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic, she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or William Woodward, Jr.). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins&#x27; family that any charges or whispers of murder simply floated away at the inquest. It is rumoured that Ann Woodward was warned prematurely of the publication and content of Capote&#x27;s &quot;La Côte Basque&quot; and proceeded to kill herself with cyanide as a result.

An incident regarding the character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon is said to have told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends the rest of the night and early morning washing the sheet by hand, with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.

The aftermath of the publication of &quot;La Côte Basque&quot; is said to have pushed Truman Capote to new levels of drug abuse and alcoholism, mainly because he claimed not to have anticipated the backlash it would cause in his personal life.

=== Last years ===
Capote was in and out of drug rehabilitation clinics in the late 1970s, and news of his various breakdowns frequently reached the public. During a 1978 on-air interview with Stanley Siegel, an extraordinarily intoxicated Capote confessed he had been awake for 48 hours, and when Siegel asked &quot;What&#x27;s going to happen unless you lick this problem of drugs and alcohol?&quot; Capote responded, &quot;The obvious answer is that eventually, I mean, I&#x27;ll kill myself...without meaning to.&quot; The live broadcast made national headlines. One year later, feeling betrayed by Lee Radziwill in a feud with perpetual nemesis Gore Vidal, Capote arranged a return visit to Stanley Siegel&#x27;s show, delivering a bizarrely comic performance revealing an incident wherein Vidal was thrown out of the Kennedy White House due to intoxication (later refuted in detail by Vidal in his memoir &quot;Palimpsest&quot;). Capote also shared salacious details regarding the personal life of Radziwill and her sister, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

Capote and artist Andy Warhol had mutual admiration for each other. They often partied together New York&#x27;s Studio 54 and Warhol painted Capote&#x27;s portrait. In 1979, Capote wrote a monthly column, &quot;Conversations with Capote,&quot; for Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine in exchange for the copyright. Initially the pieces were to consist of tape-recorded conversations, but soon Capote eschewed the tape recorder in favor of semi-fictionalized &quot;conversational portraits&quot;. These pieces formed the basis for the bestselling &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; (1980).

In 1979, Capote underwent a facelift, lost weight, and experimented with hair transplants. Despite this, Capote was unable to overcome his reliance upon drugs and liquor and had grown bored with New York by the beginning of the 1980s. After the revocation of his driver&#x27;s license (the result of speeding near his Long Island residence) and a hallucination-based seizure in 1980 that required hospitalization, Capote became fairly reclusive. These hallucinations continued unabated; medical scans eventually revealed that his brain mass had perceptibly shrunk. 

In December 1980, Capote read some of his writings at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Mitzi Newhouse Theater in New York City.

On the rare occasions when he was lucid, he continued to promote &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; as being nearly complete and was reportedly planning a reprise of the Black and White Ball to be held either in Los Angeles or a more exotic locale in South America. In 1982, a new short story, &quot;One Christmas&quot;, appeared in the December issue of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;; the following year it became, like its predecessors &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; and &quot;The Thanksgiving Visitor,&quot; a holiday gift book. In 1983, &quot;Remembering Tennessee&quot;, an essay in tribute to Tennessee Williams, who had died in February of that year, appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

== Death ==
Capote died in Bel Air, Los Angeles, on August 25, 1984. According to the coroner&#x27;s report, the cause of death was &quot;liver disease complicated by phlebitis and multiple drug intoxication&quot;. He died at the home of his old friend Joanne Carson, ex-wife of late-night TV host Johnny Carson, on whose program Capote was a frequent guest. Gore Vidal responded to news of Capote&#x27;s death by calling it &quot;a wise career move&quot;.

Capote was cremated and his remains were reportedly divided between Carson and Jack Dunphy (although Dunphy maintained that he received all the ashes).
Carson said she kept the ashes in an urn in the room where he died. The ashes were reported stolen during a Halloween party in 1988 along with $200,000 in jewels but were then returned six days later, having been found in a coiled-up garden hose on the back steps of Carson&#x27;s Bel Air home. The ashes were reportedly stolen again when taken to a production of &quot;Tru&quot;, but the thief was caught before leaving the theatre. Carson bought a crypt at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Dunphy died in 1992, and in 1994, both his and Capote&#x27;s ashes were reportedly scattered at Crooked Pond, between Bridgehampton, New York, and Sag Harbor, New York on Long Island, close to Sagaponack, New York, where the two had maintained a property with individual houses for many years. Crooked Pond was chosen because money from the estate of Dunphy and Capote was donated to the Nature Conservancy, which in turn used it to buy 20 acres around Crooked Pond in an area called &quot;Long Pond Greenbelt&quot;. A stone marker indicates the spot where their mingled ashes were thrown into the pond. In 2016, some of Capote&#x27;s ashes previously owned by Joanne Carson were auctioned by Julien&#x27;s Auctions.

Capote also maintained the property in Palm Springs, a condominium in Switzerland that was mostly occupied by Dunphy seasonally, and a primary residence at 860 United Nations Plaza in New York City. Capote&#x27;s will provided that after Dunphy&#x27;s death, a literary trust would be established, sustained by revenues from Capote&#x27;s works, to fund various literary prizes, fellowships and scholarships, including the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in Memory of Newton Arvin, commemorating not only Capote but also his friend Newton Arvin, the Smith College professor and critic who lost his job after his homosexuality was revealed. As such, the Truman Capote Literary Trust was established in 1994, two years after Dunphy&#x27;s death.

== Personal life ==

=== Sexuality ===
Capote was openly gay. Although Capote never embraced the Gay Rights Movement, his own openness about homosexuality and his encouragement for openness in others made him an important player in the realm of gay rights. In his piece &quot;Capote and the Trillings: Homophobia and Literary Culture at Midcentury&quot;, Jeff Solomon details an encounter between Capote and Lionel and Diana Trilling – two New York intellectuals and literary critics – in which Capote questioned the motives of Lionel, who had recently published a book on E. M. Forster but had ignored the author&#x27;s homosexuality. Solomon argues:

=== Relationships ===
One of his first serious lovers was Smith College literature professor Newton Arvin, who won the National Book Award for his Herman Melville biography in 1951 and to whom Capote dedicated &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;.

Capote spent over two decades partnered with Jack Dunphy, a fellow writer. In his book, &quot;&quot;Dear Genius ...&quot; A Memoir of My Life with Truman Capote,&quot; Dunphy attempts both to explain the Capote he knew and loved within their relationship and the very success-driven and, eventually, drug- and alcohol-addicted person who existed outside of their relationship. Their separate living quarters allowed autonomy within the relationship and, as Dunphy admitted, &quot;spared [him] the anguish of watching Capote drink and take drugs&quot;. Their relationship ultimately became platonic after Truman’s story &quot;La Côte Basque, 1965&quot; was published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1975, but their lives remained intertwined. Dunphy was named the chief beneficiary in Capote&#x27;s will.

In 1973, Capote met John O&#x27;Shea, a married banker from Long Island, who became his business manager and lover. They had a toxic relationship as both men were heavy drinkers. Reportedly, O&#x27;Shea would become verbally and emotionally abusive when intoxicated.

Capote was often seen with his companion Bob MacBride, a computer engineer for IBM and sculptor. In the book &quot;The Andy Warhol Diaries,&quot; Capote&#x27;s friend Andy Warhol referred to MacBride as Capote&#x27;s boyfriend and mentioned that MacBride had left his wife and children in a June 1978 diary entry. Their relationship was a &quot;bond of brothers rather than of lovers&quot; according to MacBride. They met at a bookstore in 1972, but Capote distanced himself from MacBride after he met O&#x27;Shea. Capote rekindled his relationship with MacBride in 1978.

=== Public persona ===
Capote was well known for his distinctive, high-pitched voice and odd vocal mannerisms, his offbeat manner of dress, and his fabrications. He often claimed to know intimately people whom he had never met, such as Greta Garbo. He professed to have had numerous liaisons with men thought to be heterosexual, including, he claimed, Errol Flynn. He traveled in an eclectic array of social circles, hobnobbing with authors, critics, business tycoons, philanthropists, Hollywood and theatrical celebrities, royalty, and members of high society, both in the U.S. and abroad. Part of his public persona was a longstanding rivalry with writer Gore Vidal. Their rivalry prompted Tennessee Williams to complain: &quot;You would think they were running neck-and-neck for some fabulous gold prize.&quot; Apart from his favorite authors (Willa Cather, Isak Dinesen, and Marcel Proust), Capote had faint praise for other writers. However, one who did receive his favorable endorsement was journalist Lacey Fosburgh, author of &quot;Closing Time: The True Story of the Goodbar Murder&quot; (1977).

== Legacy ==

Capote&#x27;s childhood is the focus of a permanent exhibit in Monroeville, Alabama&#x27;s Old Courthouse Museum, covering his life in Monroeville with his Faulk cousins and how those early years are reflected in his writing. The exhibit brings together photos, letters and memorabilia to paint a portrait of Capote&#x27;s early life in Monroeville. Jennings Faulk Carter donated the collection to the Museum in 2005. The collection comprises 12 handwritten letters (1940s–60s) from Capote to his favorite aunt, Mary Ida Carter (Jennings&#x27; mother). Many of the items in the collection belonged to his mother and Virginia Hurd Faulk, Carter&#x27;s cousin with whom Capote lived as a child. 

The exhibit features many references to Sook, but two items in particular are always favorites of visitors: Sook&#x27;s &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; and Truman&#x27;s baby blanket. Truman&#x27;s first cousin recalls that as children, he and Truman never had trouble finding Sook in the darkened house on South Alabama Avenue because they simply looked for the bright colors of her coat. Truman&#x27;s baby blanket is a &quot;granny square&quot; blanket Sook made for him. The blanket became one of Truman&#x27;s most cherished possessions, and friends say he was seldom without it – even when traveling. In fact, he took the blanket with him when he flew from New York to Los Angeles to be with Joanne Carson on August 23, 1984. According to Joanne Carson, when he died at her home on August 25, his last words were, &quot;It&#x27;s me, it&#x27;s Buddy,&quot; followed by, &quot;I&#x27;m cold.&quot; Buddy was Sook&#x27;s name for him.

== Capote on film ==
* In 1961, Capote&#x27;s novel &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1958), about a flamboyant New York party girl named Holly Golightly, was filmed by director Blake Edwards and starred Audrey Hepburn in what many consider her defining role, though Capote never approved of the many changes to the story, made to appeal to mass audiences.
* Capote&#x27;s childhood experiences are captured in the memoir &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; (1956), which he adapted for television and narrated. Directed by Frank Perry, it aired on December 21, 1966, on &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, and featured Geraldine Page in an Emmy Award-winning performance.
* When Richard Brooks directed &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, the 1967 adaptation of the novel, with Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, he filmed at the actual Clutter house and other Holcomb, Kansas, locations.
* Capote narrated his &quot;The Thanksgiving Visitor&quot; (1967), a sequel to &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot;, filmed by Frank Perry in Pike Road, Alabama. Geraldine Page again won an Emmy for her performance in this hour-long teleplay.
* The &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot; teleplay was later incorporated into Perry&#x27;s 1969 anthology film &quot;Trilogy&quot; (aka &quot;Truman Capote&#x27;s Trilogy&quot;), which also includes adaptations of &quot;Miriam&quot; and &quot;Among the Paths to Eden&quot;.
* Neil Simon&#x27;s murder mystery spoof &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976) provided Capote&#x27;s main role as an actor, portraying reclusive millionaire Lionel Twain who invites the world&#x27;s leading detectives together to a dinner party to have them solve a murder. The performance brought him a Golden Globe Award nomination (Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture). Early in the film, it is alleged that Twain has ten fingers but no pinkies. In truth, Capote&#x27;s pinkie fingers were unusually large. In the film, Capote&#x27;s character is highly critical of detective fiction from the likes of Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett.
* Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) includes a scene in which Alvy (Allen) and Annie (Diane Keaton) are observing passersby in the park. Alvy comments, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s the winner of the Truman Capote Look-Alike Contest&quot;. The passerby is actually Truman Capote (who appeared in the film uncredited).
* &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (1995) stars David Speck in the lead role of Joel Sansom. Reviewing this atmospheric Southern Gothic film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote:
One of the things the movie does best is transport you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt&#x27;s home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that&#x27;s familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabel (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.
* In 1995, Capote&#x27;s novella &quot;The Grass Harp&quot; (1951), which he later turned into a 1952 play, was made into a film version with a screenplay by Stirling Silliphant and directed by Charles Matthau, Walter Matthau&#x27;s son. This story is somewhat autobiographical of Capote&#x27;s childhood in Alabama.
* Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts headed the cast of the 1996 &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; miniseries, directed by Jonathan Kaplan.
* The TV movie &quot;Truman Capote&#x27;s A Christmas Memory&quot; (1997), with Patty Duke and Piper Laurie, was a remake of the 1966 television show, directed by Glenn Jordan.
* In 2002, director Mark Medoff brought to film Capote&#x27;s short story &quot;Children on Their Birthdays&quot;, another look back at a small-town Alabama childhood.

=== Documentaries ===
* &quot;With Love from Truman&quot; (1966), a 29-minute documentary by David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, shows a &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter interviewing Capote at his beachfront home in Long Island. Capote talks about &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, his relationship with the murderers, and his coverage of the trial. He is also seen taking Alvin Dewey and his wife around New York City for the first time. Originally titled &quot;A Visit with Truman Capote&quot;, this film was commissioned by National Educational Television and shown on the NET network.
* &quot;Truman Capote: The Tiny Terror&quot; (original airdate December 17, 1997) is a documentary that aired as part of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; series, followed by a 2005 DVD release.
* &quot;The Capote Tapes&quot; (2019), directed by Ebs Burnough. Using &quot;never-before-heard&quot; audio archives and interviews with Capote and his associates, the film centers around Capote&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;.

== Portrayals of Capote ==
===Theatre===
* In 1990, Robert Morse received both a Tony and a Drama Desk Award for his portrayal of Capote in the one-man show &quot;Tru&quot;.
* In 1994, actor-writer Bob Kingdom created the one-man theatre piece &quot;The Truman Capote Talk Show&quot;, in which he played Capote looking back over his life. Originally performed at the Lyric Studio Theatre, Hammersmith, London, the show has toured widely within the UK and internationally.
* In 1996, Louis Negin appeared in a Toronto production of &quot;Tru&quot;.
* In 2022, &quot;The Wind Is Us: The Death that Killed Capote&quot;, a play by Mike Broemmel and starring Eddie Schumacher, went into production.

===Film===
* In &quot;54&quot; (1998), with Louis Negin in the role of Capote, a reference is made to Capote just having had a face lift, and the song &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; is dedicated to him.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}
* In &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot; (2000), Sam Street is seen briefly as Capote. The film is a biographical comedy-drama about Jacqueline Susann.
* In &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot; (2000), Michael J. Burg played Capote; and again in &quot;The Hoax&quot; (2006) (in deleted scenes).
* In &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), Capote was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman with Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. The biographical film is the dramatic feature debut of director Bennett Miller. Spanning the years Capote spent researching and writing &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, the film depicts Capote&#x27;s conflict between his compassion for his subjects and self-absorbed obsession with finishing the book. &quot;Capote&quot; garnered much critical acclaim when it was released (September 30, 2005, in the US and February 24, 2006, in the UK). Dan Futterman&#x27;s screenplay was based on the book &quot;Capote: A Biography&quot; by Gerald Clarke (1988).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} &quot;Capote&quot; received five Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Hoffman&#x27;s performance earned him many awards, including an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Independent Spirit Award.
* &quot;Infamous&quot; (2006), directed by Douglas McGrath and starring Toby Jones as Capote and Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, is an adaptation of George Plimpton&#x27;s &quot;Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career&quot; (1997). On the DVD commentary track, McGrath admits to the occasional scene being compiled and drawn together by using the truth and blended with his own &quot;imagination&quot; of how the actual story evolved.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Television===
* In 1992, Robert Morse recreated his role as Capote in the play &quot;Tru&quot; for the PBS series &quot;American Playhouse&quot; and won an Emmy Award for his performance.
* Michael J. Burg appeared as Capote in an episode of ABC-TV&#x27;s short-lived series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (2009).
* Tom Hollander portrays Capote in &quot;&quot; (2024), the second season of the anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;, based on Laurence Leamer&#x27;s book &quot;Capote&#x27;s Women: A True Story of Love, Betrayal and a Swan Song for an Era&quot;, and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his portrayal.

===Literature===
* &quot;The Swans of Fifth Avenue: A Novel&quot; (2016) by Melanie Benjamin tells the story of the evolution of Capote&#x27;s friendship with Babe Paley and the New York &quot;swans&quot;, and his fallout from high society after the publication of &quot;La Côte Basque 1965&quot;.

<text>Biological control or biocontrol is a method of controlling pests, whether pest animals such as insects and mites, weeds, or pathogens affecting animals or plants by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It can be an important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.

There are three basic strategies for biological control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.

Natural enemies of insects play an important part in limiting the densities of potential pests. Biological control agents such as these include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores, and plant pathogens.

Biological control can have side-effects on biodiversity through attacks on non-target species by any of the above mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without a thorough understanding of the possible consequences.

==History==

The term &quot;biological control&quot; was first used by Harry Scott Smith at the 1919 meeting of the Pacific Slope Branch of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, in Riverside, California. It was brought into more widespread use by the entomologist Paul H. DeBach (1914–1993) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life. However, the practice has previously been used for centuries. The first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from &quot;Nanfang Caomu Zhuang&quot; (南方草木狀 &quot;Plants of the Southern Regions&quot;) (), attributed to Western Jin dynasty botanist &quot;Ji Han&quot; (嵇含, 263–307), in which it is mentioned that &quot;Jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged&quot;. The ants used are known as &quot;huang gan&quot; (&quot;huang&quot; = yellow, &quot;gan&quot; = citrus) ants (&quot;Oecophylla smaragdina&quot;). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late Tang dynasty or Early Five Dynasties), in &quot;Ji Le Pian&quot; by &quot;Zhuang Jisu&quot; (Southern Song dynasty), in the &quot;Book of Tree Planting&quot; by Yu Zhen Mu (Ming dynasty), in the book &quot;Guangdong Xing Yu&quot; (17th century), &quot;Lingnan&quot; by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing dynasty), in &quot;Nanyue Miscellanies&quot; by Li Diao Yuan, and others.

Biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the US, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as a biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites &quot;Tyroglyphus phylloxera&quot; to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (&quot;Daktulosphaira vitifoliae&quot;) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid &quot;Cotesia glomerata&quot; in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, &quot;Pieris rapae&quot;. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, &quot;Novius cardinalis&quot;, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, &quot;Icerya purchasi&quot;. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, but by the end of 1889, the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the US.

In 1905 the USDA initiated its first large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan to look for natural enemies of the spongy moth, &quot;Lymantria dispar dispar&quot;, and the brown-tail moth, &quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of the spongy moth, seven of the brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the US. Although the spongy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also led to the development of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.

Prickly pear cacti were introduced into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning, and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant, the cactus moth &quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot;, and the scale insect &quot;Dactylopius&quot;. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.

The first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in Canada involves the parasitoidal wasp &quot;Trichogramma minutum&quot;. Individuals were caught in New York State and released in Ontario gardens in 1882 by William Saunders, a trained chemist and first Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, for controlling the invasive currantworm &quot;Nematus ribesii&quot;. Between 1884 and 1908, the first Dominion Entomologist, James Fletcher, continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in Canada.

==Types of biological pest control==
There are three basic biological pest control strategies: importation (classical biological control), augmentation and conservation.

===Importation===

Importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest&#x27;s natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.

To be most effective at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.

One of the earliest successes was in controlling &quot;Icerya purchasi&quot; (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect &quot;Rodolia cardinalis&quot; (the vedalia beetle). This success was repeated in California using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly, &quot;Cryptochaetum iceryae&quot;. Other successful cases include the control of &quot;Antonina graminis&quot; in Texas by &quot;Neodusmetia sangwani&quot; in the 1960s.

Damage from &quot;Hypera postica&quot;, the alfalfa weevil, a serious introduced pest of forage, was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.

Alligator weed was introduced to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (&quot;Salvinia molesta&quot;) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (&quot;Cyrtobagous salviniae&quot;) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (&quot;Samea multiplicalis)&quot; is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.

Small, commercially-reared parasitoidal wasps, &quot;Trichogramma ostriniae&quot;, provide limited and erratic control of the European corn borer (&quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot;), a serious pest. Careful formulations of the bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; are more effective. The O. nubilalis integrated control releasing &quot;Tricogramma brassicae&quot; (egg parasitoid) and later &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis subs. kurstaki&quot; (larvicide effect) reduce pest damages more than insecticide treatments 

The population of &quot;Levuana iridescens&quot;, the Levuana moth, a serious coconut pest in Fiji, was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s.

===Augmentation===

Augmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.

An example of inoculative release occurs in the horticultural production of several crops in greenhouses. Periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp, &quot;Encarsia formosa&quot;, are used to control greenhouse whitefly, while the predatory mite &quot;Phytoseiulus persimilis&quot; is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite.

The egg parasite &quot;Trichogramma&quot; is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths. New way for inundative releases are now introduced i.e. use of drones. Egg parasitoids are able to find the eggs of the target host by means of several cues. Kairomones were found on moth scales. Similarly, &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for &quot;Trichogramma&quot; in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according to the level of pest infestation. Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.

===Conservation===

The conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control.
Natural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest, and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centers of fields. Control was improved by planting a meter-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centers, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.

Cropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies, a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allow insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators that can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.

In cotton production, the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated with increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.

==Biological control agents==

===Predators===
Predators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (&quot;Coleomegilla maculata&quot;) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (&quot;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&quot;).

The larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their effectiveness in commercial crops has not been studied.

The running crab spider &quot;Philodromus cespitum&quot; also prey heavily on aphids, and act as a biological control agent in European fruit orchards.

Several species of entomopathogenic nematode are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Entomopathogenic nematodes form a stress–resistant stage known as the infective juvenile. These spread in the soil and infect suitable insect hosts. Upon entering the insect they move to the hemolymph where they recover from their stagnated state of development and release their bacterial symbionts. The bacterial symbionts reproduce and release toxins, which then kill the host insect. &quot;Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita&quot; is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective stage in the soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as &quot;Moraxella osloensis&quot;. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, but it is the bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil. Entomopathogenic nematodes have a limited shelf life because of their limited resistance to high temperature and dry conditions. The type of soil they are applied to may also limit their effectiveness.

Species used to control spider mites include the predatory mites &quot;Phytoseiulus persimilis&quot;, &quot;Neoseilus californicus,&quot; and &quot;Amblyseius cucumeris&quot;, the predatory midge &quot;Feltiella acarisuga&quot;, and a ladybird &quot;Stethorus punctillum&quot;. The bug &quot;Orius insidiosus&quot; has been successfully used against the two-spotted spider mite and the western flower thrips (&quot;Frankliniella occidentalis&quot;).

Predators including &quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot; (mentioned above) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (&quot;Agonopterix alstroemeriana)&quot; can be used to control poison hemlock (&quot;Conium maculatum&quot;). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.

For rodent pests, cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of &quot;harborage&quot;/hiding locations. While cats are effective at preventing rodent &quot;population explosions&quot;, they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations. Barn owls are also sometimes used as biological rodent control. Although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose, they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes.

In Honduras, where the mosquito &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; was transmitting dengue fever and other infectious diseases, biological control was attempted by a community action plan; copepods, baby turtles, and juvenile tilapia were added to the wells and tanks where the mosquito breeds and the mosquito larvae were eliminated.

Even amongst arthropods usually thought of as obligate predators of animals (especially other arthropods), floral food sources (nectar and to a lesser degree pollen) are often useful adjunct sources. It had been noticed in one study that adult &quot;Adalia bipunctata&quot; (predator and common biocontrol of &quot;Ephestia kuehniella&quot;) could survive on flowers but never completed its life cycle, so a meta-analysis was done to find such an overall trend in previously published data, if it existed. In some cases floral resources are outright necessary. Overall, floral resources (and an imitation, i.e. sugar water) increase longevity and fecundity, meaning even predatory population numbers can depend on non-prey food abundance. Thus biocontrol population maintenance – and success – may depend on nearby flowers.

===Parasitoids===
Parasitoids lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcidoid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs. Parasitoids are most effective at reducing pest populations when their host organisms have limited refuges to hide from them.


Parasitoids are among the most widely used biological control agents. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems. In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.

&quot;Encarsia formosa&quot; is a small parasitoid wasp attacking whiteflies, sap-feeding insects which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a long period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly &#x27;scales&#x27;, turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. &quot;Gonatocerus ashmeadi&quot; (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter &quot;Homalodisca vitripennis&quot; (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.

The eastern spruce budworm is an example of a destructive insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the &quot;Trichogramma minutum&quot;, a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.

There are a number of recent studies pursuing sustainable methods for controlling urban cockroaches using parasitic wasps. Since most cockroaches remain in the sewer system and sheltered areas which are inaccessible to insecticides, employing active-hunter wasps is a strategy to try and reduce their populations.

===Pathogens===
Pathogenic micro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, but may also be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.

The use of pathogens against aquatic weeds was unknown until a groundbreaking 1972 proposal by Zettler and Freeman. Up to that point biocontrol of any kind had not been used against any water weeds. In their review of the possibilities, they noted the lack of interest and information thus far, and listed what was known of pests-of-pests – whether pathogens or not. They proposed that this should be relatively straightforward to apply in the same way as other biocontrols. And indeed in the decades since, the same biocontrol methods that are routine on land have become common in the water.

====Bacteria====

Bacteria used for biological control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, a soil-dwelling bacterium, is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium&#x27;s toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; will become useless in organic farming also.
The bacterium &quot;Paenibacillus popilliae&quot; which causes milky spore disease has been found useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very specific to its host species and is harmless to vertebrates and other invertebrates.

&quot;Bacillus&quot; spp., fluorescent Pseudomonads, and Streptomycetes are controls of various fungal pathogens.

==== Colombia mosquito control ====
The largest-ever deployment of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected &quot;A. aegypti&quot; mosquitoes reduced dengue incidence by 94–97% in the Colombian cities of Bello, Medellín, and Itagüí. The project was executed by non-profit World Mosquito Program (WMP). Wolbachia prevents mosquitos from transmitting viruses such as dengue and zika. The insects pass the bacteria on to their offspring. The project covered a combined area of , home to 3.3 million people. Most of the project area reached the target of infecting 60% of local mosquitoes. The technique is not endorsed by WHO.

=== Fungi ===
Entomopathogenic fungi, which cause disease in insects, include at least 14 species that attack aphids. &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; is mass-produced and used to manage a wide variety of insect pests including whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. &quot;Lecanicillium&quot; spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. &quot;Metarhizium&quot; spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. &quot;Paecilomyces fumosoroseus&quot; is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; &quot;Purpureocillium lilacinus&quot; is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 &quot;Trichoderma&quot; species against certain plant pathogens. &quot;Trichoderma viride&quot; has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus &quot;Chondrostereum purpureum&quot;.

Pathogenic fungi may be controlled by other fungi, or bacteria or yeasts, such as: &quot;Gliocladium&quot; spp., mycoparasitic &quot;Pythium&quot; spp., binucleate types of &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot; spp., and &quot;Laetisaria&quot; spp.

The fungi &quot;Cordyceps&quot; and &quot;Metacordyceps&quot; are deployed against a wide spectrum of arthropods. &quot;Entomophaga&quot; is effective against pests such as the green peach aphid.

Several members of Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota have been explored as agents of biological control. From Chytridiomycota, &quot;Synchytrium solstitiale&quot; is being considered as a control agent of the yellow star thistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;) in the United States.

====Viruses====
Baculoviruses are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the spongy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.

A mammalian virus, the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus was introduced to Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.
RNA mycoviruses are controls of various fungal pathogens.

==== Oomycota ====
&quot;Lagenidium giganteum&quot; is a water-borne mold that parasitizes the larval stage of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This mold has the advantages of a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.

===Competitors===
The legume vine &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot; is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot; is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. &quot;Desmodium uncinatum&quot; can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (&quot;Striga&quot;).

The Australian bush fly, &quot;Musca vetustissima&quot;, is a major nuisance pest in Australia, but native decomposers found in Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.

===Combined use of parasitoids and pathogens===

In cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests, techniques of pest control are often used in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, &quot;Agrilus planipennis&quot;, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely &quot;Tetrastichus planipennisi&quot;, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, &quot;Oobius agrili&quot;, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and &quot;Spathius agrili&quot;, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for &quot;Tetrastichus planipennisi&quot; have shown promise, and it is now being released along with &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.

=== Secondary plants ===

In addition, biological pest control sometimes makes use of plant defenses to reduce crop damage by herbivores. Techniques include polyculture, the planting together of two or more species such as a primary crop and a secondary plant, which may also be a crop. This can allow the secondary plant&#x27;s defensive chemicals to protect the crop planted with it.

==Target pests==
===Fungal pests===
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; on lettuce, by &quot;Fusarium&quot; spp. and &quot;Penicillium claviforme&quot;, on grape and strawberry by &quot;Trichoderma&quot; spp., on strawberry by &quot;Cladosporium herbarum&quot;, on Chinese cabbage by &quot;Bacillus brevis&quot;, and on various other crops by various yeasts and bacteria. &quot;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&quot; by several fungal biocontrols. Fungal pod infection of snap bean by &quot;Trichoderma hamatum&quot; if before or concurrent with infection. &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot;, &quot;Gaeumannomyces graminis&quot;, &quot;Sclerotinia&quot; spp., and &quot;Ophiostoma novo-ulmi&quot; by viruses. Various powdery mildews and rusts by various &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. and fluorescent Pseudomonads. &quot;Colletotrichum orbiculare&quot; will suppress further infection by itself if manipulated to produce plant-induced systemic resistance by infected the lowest leaf.

==Difficulties==
Many of the most important pests are exotic, invasive species that severely impact agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and urban environments. They tend to arrive without their co-evolved
parasites, pathogens and predators, and by escaping from these, populations may soar. Importing the natural enemies of these pests may seem a logical move but this may have unintended consequences; regulations may be ineffective and there may be unanticipated effects on biodiversity, and the adoption of the techniques may prove challenging because of a lack of knowledge among farmers and growers.

===Side effects===

Biological control can affect biodiversity through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative impact on the native ecosystem; however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.

Vertebrate animals tend to be generalist feeders, and seldom make good biological control agents; many of the classic cases of &quot;biocontrol gone awry&quot; involve vertebrates. For example, the cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) was intentionally introduced to Australia to control the greyback cane beetle (&quot;Dermolepida albohirtum&quot;), and other pests of sugar cane. 102 toads were obtained from Hawaii and bred in captivity to increase their numbers until they were released into the sugar cane fields of the tropic north in 1935. It was later discovered that the toads could not jump very high and so were unable to eat the cane beetles which stayed on the upper stalks of the cane plants. However, the toad thrived by feeding on other insects and soon spread very rapidly; it took over native amphibian habitat and brought foreign disease to native toads and frogs, dramatically reducing their populations. Also, when it is threatened or handled, the cane toad releases poison from parotoid glands on its shoulders; native Australian species such as goannas, tiger snakes, dingos and northern quolls that attempted to eat the toad were harmed or killed. However, there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting, both physiologically and through changing their behaviour, so in the long run, their populations may recover.

&quot;Rhinocyllus conicus&quot;, a seed-feeding weevil, was introduced to North America to control exotic musk thistle (&quot;Carduus nutans&quot;) and Canadian thistle (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;). However, the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte thistle (&quot;Cirsium neomexicanum&quot;) by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species&#x27; survival. Similarly, the weevil &quot;Larinus planus&quot; was also used to try to control the Canadian thistle, but it damaged other thistles as well. This included one species classified as threatened.

The small Asian mongoose (&quot;Herpestus javanicus&quot;) was introduced to Hawaii in order to control the rat population. However, the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; the mongoose, therefore, preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.

The sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia holbrooki&quot;) is a native of the southeastern United States and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and &#x27;40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria. However, it has thrived at the expense of local species, causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources, as well as through eating their eggs and larvae. In Australia, control of the mosquitofish is the subject of discussion; in 1989 researchers A. H. Arthington and L. L. Lloyd stated that &quot;biological population control is well beyond present capabilities&quot;.

===Grower education===
A potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is that growers may prefer to stay with the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early-season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.

==Related techniques==
Related to biological pest control is the technique of introducing sterile individuals into the native population of some organism. This technique is widely practised with insects: a large number of males sterilized by radiation are released into the environment, which proceed to compete with the native males for females. Those females that copulate with the sterile males will lay infertile eggs, resulting in a decrease in the size of the population. Over time, with repeated introductions of sterile males, this could result in a significant decrease in the size of the organism&#x27;s population. A similar technique has recently been applied to weeds using irradiated pollen, resulting in deformed seeds that do not sprout.

<text>Sir Arthur William Fadden (13 April 189421 April 1973) was an Australian politician and accountant who served as the 13th prime minister of Australia from 29 August to 7 October 1941. He held office as the leader of the Country Party from 1940 to 1958 and served as treasurer of Australia from 1940 to 1941 and 1949 to 1958.

Fadden was born in Ingham, Queensland, to Irish immigrant parents. He was raised in Walkerston, and left school at the age of 15. He was appointed town clerk of Mackay in 1916, but following the 1918 cyclone moved to Townsville and opened an accountancy firm. He was elected to the Townsville City Council in 1930, and in 1932 was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the Country and Progressive National Party. Fadden lost his seat in 1935, but the following year won a by-election to the federal Division of Darling Downs.

In March 1940, Fadden was named a minister without portfolio in the government of Robert Menzies, who led the United Australia Party in a coalition with the Country Party. A few months later, following the deaths of three senior ministers in an air crash, he took over as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation. In October 1940, Fadden was elected acting leader of the Country Party as a compromise candidate, following a deadlocked leadership vote between Earle Page and John McEwen. He became the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister and was promoted by Menzies to treasurer.

Fadden was acting prime minister for four months early in 1941 (while Menzies was away in Europe), and became popular for his conciliatory manner. He became the official leader of the Country Party following a ballot in March 1941. In August 1941, Menzies resigned as prime minister after losing the confidence of his ministry. Fadden was elected leader of the UAP–Country coalition in his place, and consequently became prime minister. However, he held office for just 39 days before being replaced by John Curtin, whose Labor Party had successfully moved a motion of no confidence. After losing the prime ministership, Fadden continued on as leader of the opposition for two more years. In that capacity, he eventually resigned in favour of Menzies following the coalition&#x27;s massive defeat at the 1943 election.

When Menzies returned as prime minister in 1949, Fadden became treasurer and &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister for a second time, holding office until his retirement from politics in 1958. Only Peter Costello has served in the position for longer. Fadden enjoyed one of the most rapid rises in Australian political history, moving from private citizen to the prime ministership in just 11 years. He was the first prime minister born in Queensland, and the first and only member of the Country Party to become prime minister with his own mandate (rather than just serving as a caretaker after the death of a predecessor).

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Fadden was born in Ingham, Queensland, on 13 April 1894. He was the eldest of ten children – seven sons and three daughters – born to Annie (née Moorhead) and Richard John Fadden. His parents were both born in Ireland, his mother in County Tyrone and his father in County Galway. Fadden moved to Walkerston at a young age, where his father was officer-in-charge of the local police station. He had a &quot;typical country childhood&quot;, but suffered the deaths of three of his younger siblings in separate accidents. Fadden received his only formal education at the Walkerston State School, except for a brief period at Te Kowai while his usual school was being renovated. His first jobs included collecting cane beetles and performing sound effects at the local cinema. Fadden left school at the age of 15 and began working as a &quot;billy boy&quot; (odd-job man) on a cane-cutting gang at Pleystowe. He later secured an indoor job as an office boy at the Pleystowe Sugar Mill, where his colleagues include two future Labor MPs – Maurice Hynes and George Martens. In his spare time, he developed an interest in the theatre, both as a performer and treasurer of the local company.

===Professional career===
In April 1913, Fadden moved to Mackay to become assistant town clerk of the Mackay Town Council. He defeated 56 other applicants for the position. In 1916, his superior, Frederick Morley, was dismissed as town clerk over allegations of theft, which Fadden himself had uncovered. Morley eventually received a two-year jail term, and Fadden was promoted in his place, again defeating more than 50 other applicants; he was reputedly the &quot;youngest town clerk in Australia&quot;. He had attempted to enlist in the Australian Army the previous year, but was rejected on health grounds. In 1918, Fadden served on the committee of the relief fund for the Mackay cyclone, which devastated the town and killed thirty people. However, he resigned as town clerk in September of that year and moved to Townsville (the largest settlement in North Queensland), where he established his own accountancy firm. He had qualified as an accountant through a correspondence course from a school in Melbourne.

According to his memoirs, Fadden initially struggled to make ends meet as an accountant, and considered relocating to Brisbane. However, he eventually found an unused loophole in the tax code that allowed him to gain a competitive advantage. His business prospered thereafter, and he was able to take on partners and opened a second office in Brisbane. In 1930, Fadden was elected to the Townsville City Council as part of a non-partisan grouping calling themselves the &quot;serviceable six&quot;. He developed a feud with the city&#x27;s chief engineer, Sidney Roberts, whom he publicly criticised for using coal from New South Wales instead of from the local Bowen Basin mines. He was once again able to use his auditing skills to his advantage, getting Roberts fired for inconsistencies in his balance sheets. The resulting publicity was a springboard for his political career.

== Early political career ==

=== State politics ===
At the 1932 Queensland state election, Fadden was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly as a member of the Country and Progressive National Party (CPNP). Aided by a favourable redistribution, he won the seat of Kennedy from the Australian Labor Party by just 62 votes. He was the only candidate from his party to win a seat from Labor, which won majority government on a swing of almost 10 points. In parliament, Fadden came to notice as a critic of the new government&#x27;s financial operations. He accused the government of lacking transparency and accountability, particularly in its use of trust funds which he said had been used to cover up revenue deficiencies. His speeches impressed both his party and political correspondents, and he was asked to write a series of articles for &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;.

Fadden was the CPNP&#x27;s lead speaker in the 1934 budget debates, effectively making him the chief financial spokesman for the opposition (which would be considered today as Shadow Treasurer). In the lead-up to the 1935 state election, a redistribution turned Kennedy into a safe Labor seat. It was alleged by the opposition that the government had specifically targeted Fadden&#x27;s seat in order to remove him as a political threat. Faced with certain defeat, he chose to run in the neighbouring seat of Mirani. However, he lost to Labor&#x27;s Ted Walsh by 224 votes, as the government won a landslide victory. In his memoirs, he accused Labor of having pork-barreled Mirani in the lead-up to the election to ensure his defeat.

=== Move to federal politics ===

After losing his seat in state parliament, Fadden moved to Brisbane, and initially returned to his accounting practice. In early 1936, he joined the Queensland Country Party, which had split from the CPNP in order to align with the federal Country Party. Later that year, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives at a by-election for the Division of Darling Downs. It was caused by the death of the previous member, Littleton Groom, who was a member of the United Australia Party (UAP). Fadden, who had no previous connection with the area, was the first member of his party to contest the seat; the UAP suffered a negative swing of over 40 points. He consolidated his hold on the seat at the 1937 federal election, held less than a year later.

==Menzies Government==
===Country Party tensions===
In April 1939, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons died in office and was replaced by Country Party leader Earle Page on an interim basis. When Robert Menzies was elected by the United Australia Party (UAP) as Lyons&#x27; replacement, Page gave a speech accusing Menzies of disloyalty and questioning his record of military service. As a result of Page&#x27;s attacks, which they deemed unfair, Fadden and Bernard Corser resigned from the parliamentary Country Party to sit as &quot;Independent Country&quot; members; they were soon followed by Oliver Badman and Thomas Collins. Fadden was generally seen as the leader of the group. When Page was forced out of the leadership in September 1939, they attempted to re-join the party, but the remaining members opted – by a single vote – not to re-admit them. Archie Cameron, generally seen as Page&#x27;s ally, was elected as the party&#x27;s new leader. Fadden did not regard Cameron favourably, in one debate stating: &quot;I take this opportunity to declare without the slightest degree of reservation that the honourable gentleman is not my leader&quot;. When asked in another debate if he were still a member of the Country Party, he replied &quot;no, I am not, thank goodness, as it is now constituted and under its present leadership&quot;. However, in early November 1939, Cameron invited the four breakaways to rejoin the party in the interests of unity, which they accepted.

The Country Party&#x27;s coalition with the UAP had lapsed following Menzies&#x27; elevation to the prime ministership. In March 1940, Menzies and Cameron agreed to resume the coalition, providing an opportunity for five Country Party members to be added to the ministry. Cameron somewhat unexpectedly nominated Fadden as a Country Party representative, and he was appointed as an assistant minister to the Treasurer of Australia (Percy Spender) and the Minister for Supply and Development (Frederick Stewart). In August 1940, Fadden narrowly escaped being killed in the Canberra air disaster, which claimed the lives of three government ministers and the Chief of the General Staff. He was scheduled to be aboard the flight, which was transporting the ministers back to Canberra after a cabinet meeting in Melbourne, but instead took an overnight train. He traded places with Richard Elford (James Fairbairn&#x27;s private secretary), who had wanted to stay in Melbourne to celebrate a wedding anniversary; both Elford and Fairbairn were among those killed. After the crash, Fadden replaced Fairbairn as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation; he also continued as assistant minister to the Treasurer.

===Ascension to deputy prime minister===
The 1940 Australian federal election resulted in a hung parliament. The UAP–Country coalition was able to remain in power with the support of two independent MPs, Alexander Wilson and Arthur Coles. The Country Party lost three seats to the Labor Party, and on 16 October the parliamentary party voted to remove Archie Cameron as leader. John McEwen and Earle Page both nominated for the leadership, and Fadden intended to nominate for the deputy leadership. McEwen and Page were tied at eight votes each after three separate ballots. During a break for dinner, Fadden was asked to become interim leader as a compromise between the two candidates, with the intention that another leadership ballot would be held in a few months. He was then elected unopposed as deputy leader and thus acting leader of the party. According to his biographer Tracey Arklay, &quot;Fadden was selected because the majority in the party room considered that he was the man most likely to be able to broker deals and negotiate with Menzies and the UAP&quot;. Edgar Holt believed Fadden&#x27;s personality was a major factor – &quot;he had no obvious ambitions and he suffered from no delusions of grandeur [...] he was amiable and gregarious&quot; – but also thought that Page had allowed Fadden to assume the leadership in order to deny it to McEwen.

As the acting leader of his party, Fadden became the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister and joined the Advisory War Council. He was sworn in as Treasurer on 28 October 1940, succeeding Percy Spender, and presented his first budget less than a month later on 21 November. The budget featured increased levels of spending due to the ongoing war, offset by significant increases in taxation – including a reduction in the tax-free threshold, increased company taxes, and a tax on undistributed profits. In presenting the budget, Fadden noted that it brought about &quot;the heaviest financial imposts ever placed upon the people of Australia&quot;. It was highly unpopular among the general public, which up until that point had perceived the war to be still quite distant. The independent MPs contemplated voting with the opposition to reject the budget, but after negotiations and some amendments it was able to be passed, allowing the government to continue in power.

Fadden was formally elected to the leadership of the Country Party on 12 March 1941, winning the ballot unopposed with the support of both McEwen and Page.

==Prime Minister, 1941==

===Swearing in and cabinet===
In August 1941 Robert Menzies resigned as Prime Minister. Although the non-Labor Coalition had been in power for a decade, the UAP was so bereft of leadership that on 28 August a joint UAP-Country meeting chose Fadden as Coalition leader even though the Country Party was the smaller of the two non-Labor parties. Fadden was duly sworn in as Prime Minister the next day, and also remained Treasurer. He was the only member of the Country/National Party to serve as Prime Minister without an expectation of a short tenure (the other two Country/National Prime Ministers, Page and McEwen, were caretakers).

Nevertheless, Fadden&#x27;s term of office was troubled from the start. Even parliamentarians in his own party feared the worst. It was later reported that Fadden decided against moving into The Lodge, the official Prime Minister&#x27;s residence in Canberra, after his predecessor as Country Party leader, Cameron, crudely told him that he would &quot;scarcely have enough time to wear a track from the backdoor to the shithouse before you’ll be out&quot;.

Fadden made only minor changes to Menzies&#x27; final ministry, continuing as treasurer and allowing Menzies to continue as Minister for Defence Co-ordination. He was one of six members of the Country Party in cabinet, with the other thirteen being UAP members.

===War policy===

Fadden&#x27;s brief term as prime minister was marked by continued tension with the British government over the conduct of the war in Europe and the deployment of Australian military assets. One of his first actions as prime minister was to appoint Earle Page as a special envoy to the British war cabinet in London, an attempt to secure greater Australian involvement in British military policy. In a telegram shortly after his appointment, British prime minister Winston Churchill assured Fadden that &quot;we shall never let you down if real danger comes&quot;. Fadden and Churchill subsequently came into conflict over the Australian troops at the Siege of Tobruk – the so-called &quot;Rats of Tobruk&quot; – who had been placed under British command. At the request of Australian general Thomas Blamey, Fadden ordered that the troops at Tobruk be returned to sole Australian control, stating to Churchill that it was &quot;vital to [the] Australian people to have concentrated control and direction of its Expeditionary Forces&quot;. Churchill and the British government attempted to stall against passing on the orders and they were not carried out until Curtin succeeded as prime minister and reaffirmed Fadden&#x27;s stance.

===Winkler case===
Parliament resumed three weeks after Fadden&#x27;s appointment as prime minister. While continuing to govern in minority, he initially enjoyed the support of independents Arthur Coles and Alexander Wilson on the floor of the House. Their support proved crucial during the so-called &quot;Winkler case&quot;, when ALP frontbencher Eddie Ward raised allegations made by journalist Joseph Winkler, who had been briefly employed in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office under Menzies and then been dismissed by Fadden. Winkler alleged that Attorney-General Billy Hughes, with Fadden&#x27;s knowledge, had made illegal payments to trade union leaders to prevent industrial unrest during war.

Fadden addressed the allegations in an &quot;in camera&quot; session of parliament, during which he disclosed that the government had established a secret fund in 1916 to finance matters relating to national security, including payments to the anti-communist Australian Democratic Front. He subsequently established a royal commission into Winkler&#x27;s allegations to satisfy opposition concerns. The commission, chaired by Percival Rogers, delivered its report after the government&#x27;s defeat and found no evidence of illegal activity, although some concerns were noted over the evidence given by Hughes. Journalist Alan Reid nonetheless later suggested that the Winkler case had precipitated the government&#x27;s defeat.

===Budget===
Fadden presented his second federal budget as treasurer and first as prime minister on 25 September 1941. The budget focused on raising additional revenue, as by that time he viewed war with Japan as inevitable. It included a major increase in military spending, from A£170 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) to A£217 million (equivalent to $ billion in ). Novel features of the budget were the institution of a system of post-war credits – effectively compulsory loans to the government – and the planned introduction of a national mortgage bank. The post-war credits were levied in a manner similar to income tax – up to 90 percent for the highest brackets – but accrued interest of two percent and would be repaid after the war. The budget also included an excess profits tax on corporations with a margin over eight percent.

In his memoirs, Fadden recalled the 1941–42 budget as one of the best two budgets he delivered as treasurer. He was particularly proud of the post-war credits scheme, which was based on a suggestion by John Maynard Keynes, but it was ultimately one of the few inclusions dropped by incoming ALP treasurer Ben Chifley after the government&#x27;s defeat. Fadden later pointedly noted that, while his government had failed to pass its budget, the opposition had made no substantive criticisms of the budget itself.

===Defeat===
On 1 October 1941, during debate on the budget, opposition leader John Curtin moved that the &quot;budget should be recast to ensure a more equitable distribution of the national burden&quot;, which the government treated as a loss of supply and therefore a confidence motion. The motion was fiercely debated until 3 October, when independent MP Arthur Coles rose and announced that he would vote against the government. The motion then proceeded to a vote which the government lost by 36 votes to 33, Coles and Wilson voting in favour. Fadden returned his commission to the Governor-General Lord Gowrie, who swore in Curtin as prime minister on 7 October after receiving confirmations from Coles and Wilson that they would support an ALP government.

Fadden&#x27;s term in office lasted only 42 days and he later joked that, like the Great Flood, he had &quot;reigned for forty days and forty nights&quot;. The defeat of the Fadden government is the most recent occasion on which an Australian government was forced to resign after being defeated on the floor of the House of Representatives. While apparently unsurprised and circumspect about his defeat, he was critical of Coles&#x27; role in voting down his budget and later alleged in parliament that Coles had only shifted his vote because Fadden had refused to appoint him to a cabinet post; Coles denied Fadden&#x27;s account. Fadden had previously slighted Coles by ignoring a memorandum Coles had drafted on wartime policy, while both Coles and Wilson had been aggrieved with the handling of Menzies&#x27; departure and also had concerns over the Winkler allegations.

==Opposition (1941–1949)==
===Leader of the Opposition (1941–1943)===

Following the fall of his ministry, a joint UAP-Country Party meeting endorsed Fadden as Leader of the Opposition, even though the UAP was nominally the senior coalition partner. As a result, Menzies resigned as UAP leader. The UAP was so bereft of leadership that it was forced to elect 79-year-old former Prime Minister Billy Hughes as its new leader. The Coalition sank into near-paralysis in opposition. Even allowing for Curtin&#x27;s personal popularity, as well as the significant advantages which an incumbent government in a Westminster system has in wartime, Fadden proved a disappointment as Leader of the Opposition; he was unable to get the better of Curtin. The Coalition suffered a crushing loss in the 1943 election. It was reduced to 19 seats, including a mere seven for Fadden&#x27;s Country Party. Accepting responsibility for this severe defeat, Fadden then handed the Opposition leadership back to Menzies, who had resumed the UAP leadership.

===Rebuilding the Coalition (1943–1949)===

After the 1943 election, the Country Party resolved to sit &quot;as a separate party with its own leader, who shall be that leader alone&quot;, rather than continuing the joint opposition with the UAP. Fadden was re-elected as party leader with John McEwen as his deputy; both continued to sit on the Advisory War Council. They remained on the council after the UAP&#x27;s withdrawal in 1944 and continued to attend meetings until its dissolution after the end of the war in 1945.

In parliament, Fadden and Menzies formed an initially uneasy partnership in their criticism of the Curtin government, with Fadden continuing to concentrate on financial matters. He and the Country Party initially supported the government&#x27;s 1944 referendum giving the federal government expanded wartime powers, supporting the bill on its first reading; he had been a member of the drafting committee for a similar bill in 1942. However, by the third reading they joined Menzies and the UAP in voting against the referendum bill. Fadden subsequently played a leading role in the &quot;No&quot; campaign, arguing that its provisions were &quot;dangerously wide&quot; and would pave the way for socialism and an authoritarian government where Australians would &quot;work under government compulsion [...] eat and wear what the bureaucrats ration out to them [...] live in mass-produced dwellings and [...] work wherever the bureaucrats tell them to work&quot;. The referendum failed and the campaign conducted by Fadden and Menzies has been cited as a template for later anti-Labor campaigns.

Fadden kept a distance as Menzies worked to create the new Liberal Party of Australia as a combination of the UAP and other right-wing organisations, preferring to preserve the separate identity of the Country Party. He and Menzies served as pallbearers at Curtin&#x27;s funeral in July 1945, and in his memoirs Fadden stated that there was &quot;no greater figure in Australian public life in my lifetime than Curtin&quot;. On a personal level Fadden felt greater affinity with Curtin and his successor Ben Chifley, each being the children of working-class Irish immigrants with limited academic training. However, his opposition to socialism ensured he never considered an alliance with the Labor Party, as had occurred at state level in Victoria where the Country Party governed with Labor support in the early 1940s.

===Legal issues===
In December 1943, Fadden sued the Australian Workers&#x27; Union and its affiliated newspaper &quot;The Worker&quot; for defamation, over a story alleging Fadden employed &quot;enemy aliens&quot; on illegally low wages on his sugar farms. He was awarded damages of £1,000 () and &quot;cherished the moral victory&quot;, choosing to frame and display the cheque in his house rather than cashing it.

During the parliamentary debate over the 1948–49 budget, Fadden alleged that the U.S. government was unwilling to share information with Australia due to the presence of &quot;fifth columnists&quot; in the government, citing confidential statements Chifley had made to British officials. In response, Chifley ordered the Commonwealth Investigation Branch to interview Fadden about how he had obtained the documents. Fadden refused to do so and subsequently moved a motion in the House of Representatives claiming a breach of parliamentary privilege, during which he compared the CIB to the Gestapo. His motion was defeated on party lines, while &quot;the issue of whether police could question a member about his speeches in parliament remained unresolved&quot;.

==Treasurer, 1949–1958==
===Post-war recovery===

Fadden transferred to the new seat of McPherson at the 1949 election, with the Coalition returning to power in a landslide victory. He was reappointed treasurer in the fourth Menzies ministry on 19 December 1949. He was credited with developing the Coalition&#x27;s popular policy of abolishing petrol rationing, a legacy from the war.

The Coalition won a massive victory in the 1949 election, and Fadden, who transferred to the newly created seat of the Division of McPherson on the Gold Coast, became Treasurer in the second Menzies government. Although inflation was high in the early 1950s, forcing him to impose several &quot;horror budgets&quot; (such as in 1951, increasing overall taxation by 33% in response to a wool price boom), he generally presided over a booming economy, with times especially good for farmers. 

===Acting prime minister===
As deputy prime minister, Fadden often deputised for Menzies during his frequent overseas trips. He served as acting prime minister for a record total of 676 days, both before and after his own stint as prime minister. In July 1950, while Menzies was in the United States, Fadden announced that Australia would commit ground troops to the United Nations Command in Korea. The decision was made at the urging of external affairs minister Percy Spender and without prior consultation with Menzies. Fadden was also acting prime minister when Menzies was travelling during the Suez Crisis, during which he announced Australian support for U.S. secretary of state John Foster Dulles&#x27; Suez Canal Users&#x27; Association proposal.

===Final years in office===
On the night before the 1954 federal election, Fadden was seriously injured in a car accident while travelling back to Brisbane from Dalby. Near Grantham, the car in which he was travelling failed to negotiate a curve on a slippery road, and rolled three times. Fadden, who had been sitting next to the driver, was pulled from the car unconscious and spent election day in hospital, unable to cast his vote. He was left with injuries to his face, head, and legs, and required five separate operations.

Fadden resigned as leader of the Country Party on 26 March 1958, with John McEwen elected unopposed as his successor. At the same time, he announced that he would retire from politics at the 1958 election. He delivered his eleventh and final budget on 5 August. Although the election was held on 22 November, he did not resign from the ministry until 9 December, remaining in office as treasurer for over two weeks while not being a member of parliament.

==Final years==
After leaving parliament, Fadden pursued business interests across a wide range of industries. He visited Japan twice in 1959, and was appointed as the representative of a Japanese company hoping to acquire a licence to export iron ore from Western Australia. The deal fell through, which he attributed to political interference. Fadden was chairman of Centenary Estates Limited, which built the housing development that became known as the Centenary Suburbs. He took up several company directorships, including with the real estate firm Hooker Finance and the ice-cream manufacturer Toppa. He also worked as a consultant for a sugar mill in Tully, Queensland, and invested in an iron ore deposit at Mourilyan, Queensland. In 1960, he was commissioned by the state government to produce a report into the viability of Central Queensland ports.

In 1969, Fadden published a memoir titled &quot;They Called Me Artie&quot;. Reviewing the book for &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, Don Aitkin observed that Fadden had &quot;the reputation of a political buffoon, a man of earthy wit and hail-fellow-well-metness who survived in politics because he knew more and better stories than the next man [...] his autobiography does little to destroy that picture&quot;. Shortly before his death in 1973 he also published a nine-page account of his prime ministership in &quot;Australian Outlook&quot;, titled &quot;Forty days and forty nights&quot;.

Fadden suffered from ill health during his retirement, including a bout of hepatitis and a vision defect that left him blind in one eye and required an operation to correct. He died of leukaemia on 21 April 1973, aged 79, at St Andrew&#x27;s War Memorial Hospital in Brisbane. A state funeral was held at the Toowong Presbyterian Church on 27 April, followed by cremation at Mt Thompson Crematorium.

==Personal life==

On 27 December 1916, Fadden married Ilma Nita Thornber (2 April 1895 – 14 May 1987), who worked as a milliner. Her father James Thornber and brother-in-law George Fay both served periods as mayor of Mackay. The couple had four children together – Gordon, John, Mavis, and Betty. His oldest son Gordon predeceased him, dying in 1956 at the age of 34. Arthur Fadden was initiated as a Freemason in Lodge Caledonia, No. 737 S.C. (Mackay, Qld), on 29 July 1915. After being elected to the Australian Parliament on 19 December 1936, he joined Lamington Lodge, No. 110 U.G.L.Q.(Brisbane, Qld), on 4 February 1937. Bro. Sir Arthur Fadden remained a member of Lamington Lodge, No. 110 U.G.L.Q., until he resigned in March 1973, a month before his passing.

Arthur Fadden was once a member of an acting group in Mackay called the &quot;Nigger Minstrel Troupe&quot;.

==Honours==

Fadden was appointed to the Privy Council in 1942, which granted him the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1951. He was knighted in person by King George VI in London on 31 January 1952, only a week before the King&#x27;s death, and formally sworn of the Privy Council the following day. In his memoirs he recalled that the King had accidentally knighted him as &quot;Sir William&quot; (his middle name). He corrected the King who knighted him again as &quot;Sir Arthur&quot;. Fadden was raised to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the order in 1958, to mark his retirement from politics. In 1972, he was made a Doctor of Laws &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Queensland.

After Fadden&#x27;s death, the Canberra suburb of Fadden and the federal electoral Division of Fadden in Queensland were named in his honour, as is traditional for Australian prime ministers. In 1975 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post. In 1976, the Sir Arthur Fadden Memorial Garden was established in the Brisbane suburb of Mount Ommaney, consisting of 3,000 trees.

<text>West Friesland () is a contemporary region in the Northwest of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland.

==History==

The River Vlie (also called Fli), is an extension of the IJssel branch of the Rhine River. The river divides the northern Netherlands into two parts, the western and the eastern part. In the eleventh century, heavy rainfall caused the river to flood over large parts of the land. The Zuiderzee bay (previously a lake called Lacus Flevo by Roman authors) was formed, separating West Friesland from the contemporary Province of Friesland. In the Middle Ages, the Westflinge area of West Friesland became an island, bordered on the north by the Medem and Zijpe inlets, and to the south by various interconnecting lakes (now polder land) that were connected with the Zuiderzee. Because of this, the toponym &quot;West Friesland&quot; was applied more to the Westflinge area than to the original West Friesland.

For approximately 300 years, West Friesland operated as an autonomous area as the West Frisians did not wish to be vassals of lords from Holland. Floris V, Count of Holland, attempted to unite Holland and West Friesland during his reign and he succeeded in annexing West Frisia. It was his successor, John I, who achieved ultimate victory over the West Frisians in 1297. West Friesland formed a united province with Holland in the Dutch Republic, though it was recognized an autonomous region, and the parliament of said province, commonly known as Holland, was formally known as the States of Holland and West Friesland. During the time of the United Provinces, West Friesland had its own independent Admiralty of the Northern Quarter. Any admiral serving within this admiralty or the two other Hollandic admiralties (Amsterdam and the Admiralty of de Maze) had the title of &quot;Admiral of Holland and West Frisia&quot;.

===Early Medieval Vroonen===

The first inhabitants of Alkmaar, Oudorp, and St Pancras likely settled along the high beach ridges of the Vroonermeer in the 9th century AD. Better known as Vroonen, this settlement subsequently grew into a village. In the late 13th century, when the Dutch conquered West Frisians, the victors crossed the village and set it on fire. The few surviving inhabitants fled the region. After a long time, people returned to Vroonen and a chapel was built. The village of St Pancras was founded around this church [1484]. Vroonermeer was drained in 1561.

The reclamation of the North Holland lakes was a purely private business affair intended for the establishment of new tracts of fertile land. Investors financed the operation and leased their new land to farmers.

==Geography==
The exact location of West Friesland is not clearly defined, but it has been suggested that it comprised the area north of an imaginary line through Hoorn and Alkmaar. Within this historical region is the contemporary region of West Friesland, a smaller area based on a dyke system on the Westfriese Omringdijk that lay in West Friesian district (&quot;gouw&quot;) of Westflinge.

The area between the rivers Vlie and IJ consists of the present-day municipalities of Alkmaar, Amsterdam (Landelijk Noord), Beemster, Bergen, Castricum, Den Helder, Drechterland, Edam-Volendam, Enkhuizen, Heerhugowaard, Heiloo, Hollands Kroon, Hoorn, Koggenland, Landsmeer, Langedijk, Medemblik, Purmerend, Oostzaan, Opmeer, Schagen, Stede Broec, Texel, Uitgeest, Vlieland, Waterland, Wognum, Wormerland, and Zaanstad.

=== Municipalities ===
The region covers an area of about , delineated by the Westfriese Omringdijk. It consists of the following municipalities:

Major cities include Hoorn (which was the capital of West-Friesland) and Alkmaar.

==Dialect==
The traditional dialect of the region is the West Frisian dialect of Hollandic Dutch. The contemporary region is similar in size and location to the historical district (&quot;gouw&quot;) of Westflinge which itself was a part of a much larger historical region of West Friesland.

The West Frisian language has disappeared from the region and the later West Frisian dialects are now slowly disappearing. Although these dialects are subdialects of Hollandic Dutch, they were strongly influenced in vocabulary and grammar by a West Frisian substratum.

<text>Annapolis County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia located in the western part of the province located on the Bay of Fundy. The county seat is Annapolis Royal.

==History==
Established August 17, 1759, by Order in Council, Annapolis County took its name from the town of Annapolis Royal which had been named in honour of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. The town was the successor to the French settlement of Port Royal, the chief Acadian settlement in the area. The Acadians had been forcibly removed by British government officials in the 1755 Grand Dérangement.

In 1817 the population of the county was 9,817, and that had grown to 14,661 by 1827. At that time, the county was divided into six townships: Annapolis, Granville, Wilmot, Clements, Digby and Clare.

By 1833, a number of reasons had been advanced for making two counties out of Annapolis County. Two petitions were presented to the House of Assembly in that year requesting that the county be divided. However, it was not until 1837 that Annapolis County was divided into two distinct and separate counties - Annapolis and Digby.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Annapolis County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Forming the majority of the Annapolis County census division, the Municipality of the County of Annapolis, including its Subdivisions A, B, C, and D, had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="155744" wikidata="Q2658942" url="?curid=155744" title="Cape Breton County">
<text>Cape Breton County is one of eighteen counties in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is located on Cape Breton Island.

From 1879 to 1995, the area of the county excluded from towns and cities was incorporated as the Municipality of the County of Cape Breton to provide local government services. Since 1995 the only municipality in the county has been a single-tier municipality called Cape Breton Regional Municipality. For statistical purposes, the First Nations reserves of Eskasoni 3 and Membertou 28B are included in the county, but are separate entities.

==History==
Taking its name from Cape Breton, the most easterly point of the island which was called after the Bretons of Brittany, the county has what is probably the oldest surviving European name to have been used to designate part of North America.

By proclamation of October 17, 1763 after termination of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Cape Breton Island was formally annexed to Nova Scotia. For a time thereafter Cape Breton Island was part of Halifax County. On December 10, 1765, Cape Breton Island was set apart as a separate county under the name Cape Breton County.

From 1784 to 1820, Cape Breton Island was established as a separate colony with a Lieutenant Governor and a nominated Executive Council, but without an elected house of assembly. Not until after Cape Breton Island was re-annexed to Nova Scotia in 1820 did it receive representation in an elected legislature.

Although subdivided into three districts in 1824, Cape Breton County was co-extensive with Cape Breton Island from 1820 to 1835 when the county was divided into three separate and distinct counties:

* Cape Breton (Northeastern District)
* Richmond (Southern District) later called Richmond County
* Juste au Corps (Northwest District) later called Inverness County

In 1851, Victoria County was formed out of the northeastern part of Cape Breton County and a year later, in 1852, the present boundaries of Cape Breton County were defined by the colonial government in Halifax.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cape Breton County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Municipal government ==
Cape Breton County had several incorporated municipalities within its boundaries:

* City of Sydney (1904–1995)
* Town of Glace Bay (1901–1995)
* Town of New Waterford (1913–1995)
* Town of North Sydney (1885–1995)
* Town of Sydney Mines (1889–1995)
* Town of Louisbourg (1901–1995)
* Town of Dominion (1906–1995)
* Municipality of the County of Cape Breton (1879–1995)

In the early 1990s the provincial government began to examine duplication of municipal services in Nova Scotia. One of the recommendations arising from this study was that all of Cape Breton County be amalgamated. On August 1, 1995, all seven municipal units in the county were dissolved and replaced by a single tier municipality called the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM).

The new regional municipality&#x27;s boundary included all of Cape Breton County except for the Eskasoni and Membertou First Nations.

Cape Breton County continues to exist as a county in Nova Scotia, but all municipal government and service delivery is provided by either the Cape Breton Regional Municipality or the First Nations, with no additional county level government or administration or any lower-level town or city-level government or administration.

<text>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word &quot;travel&quot; is most likely lost to history. The term &quot;travel&quot; may originate from the Old French word &quot;travail&quot;, which means &#x27;work&#x27;. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word &quot;travel&quot; was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English , (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French (which means to work strenuously, toil).

In English, people still occasionally use the words , which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book &quot;The Best Travelers&#x27; Tales (2004)&quot;, the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;travail&quot; both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the (in Latin it means &quot;three stakes&quot;, as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.

==Purpose and motivation==

Reasons for traveling include recreation, holidays, rejuvenation, tourism or vacationing, research travel, the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, obtaining health care, waging or fleeing war, for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons. Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships and airplanes.

Motives for travel include:

* Pleasure
* Relaxation
* Discovery and exploration
* Adventure
* Intercultural communications
* Taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships.
* Avoiding stress
* Forming memories
* Cultural experiences
* Volunteering
* Festivals and events

== History ==
Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.

Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars. Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally.

In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.

Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots. Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.

== Geographic types ==
Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport, while international travel typically requires a passport and visa. Tours are a common type of travel. Examples of travel tours are expedition cruises, small group tours, and river cruises.

== Safety ==


Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety. When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence. Some safety considerations include being aware of one&#x27;s surroundings, avoiding being the target of a crime, leaving copies of one&#x27;s passport and itinerary information with trusted people, obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with one&#x27;s national embassy when arriving in a foreign country. Many countries do not recognize drivers&#x27; licenses from other countries; however most countries accept international driving permits. Automobile insurance policies issued in one&#x27;s own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited. It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and regulations of destination countries. Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.

There are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel (based on a Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions survey in October 2000):

<text>ATPases (, Adenosine 5&#x27;-TriPhosphatase, adenylpyrophosphatase, ATP monophosphatase, triphosphatase, SV40 T-antigen, ATP hydrolase, complex V (mitochondrial electron transport), (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase, HCO3−-ATPase, adenosine triphosphatase) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free phosphate ion or the inverse reaction. This dephosphorylation reaction releases energy, which the enzyme (in most cases) harnesses to drive other chemical reactions that would not otherwise occur. This process is widely used in all known forms of life.

Some such enzymes are integral membrane proteins (anchored within biological membranes), and move solutes across the membrane, typically against their concentration gradient. These are called transmembrane ATPases.

==Functions==

Transmembrane ATPases import metabolites necessary for cell metabolism and export toxins, wastes, and solutes that can hinder cellular processes. An important example is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ATPase) that maintains the cell membrane potential. Another example is the hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ATPase or gastric proton pump) that acidifies the contents of the stomach. ATPase is genetically conserved in animals; therefore, cardenolides which are toxic steroids produced by plants that act on ATPases, make general and effective animal toxins that act dose dependently.

Besides exchangers, other categories of transmembrane ATPase include co-transporters and pumps (however, some exchangers are also pumps). Some of these, like the Na+/K+ATPase, cause a net flow of charge, but others do not. These are called electrogenic transporters and electroneutral transporters, respectively.

==Structure==
The Walker motifs are a telltale protein sequence motif for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Beyond this broad function, the Walker motifs can be found in almost all natural ATPases, with the notable exception of tyrosine kinases. The Walker motifs commonly form a Beta sheet-turn-Alpha helix that is self-organized as a Nest (protein structural motif). This is thought to be because modern ATPases evolved from small NTP-binding peptides that had to be self-organized.

Protein design has been able to replicate the ATPase function (weakly) without using natural ATPase sequences or structures. Importantly, while all natural ATPases have some beta-sheet structure, the designed &quot;Alternative ATPase&quot; lacks beta sheet structure, demonstrating that this life-essential function is possible with sequences and structures not found in nature.

==Mechanism==
ATPase (also called F0F1-ATP Synthase) is a charge-transferring complex that catalyzes ATP to perform ATP synthesis by moving ions through the membrane.

The coupling of ATP hydrolysis and transport is a chemical reaction in which a fixed number of solute molecules are transported for each ATP molecule hydrolyzed; for the Na+/K+ exchanger, this is three Na+ ions out of the cell and two K+ ions inside per ATP molecule hydrolyzed.

Transmembrane ATPases make use of ATP&#x27;s chemical potential energy by performing mechanical work: they transport solutes in the opposite direction of their thermodynamically preferred direction of movement—that is, from the side of the membrane with low concentration to the side with high concentration. This process is referred to as active transport.

For instance, inhibiting vesicular H+-ATPases would result in a rise in the pH within vesicles and a drop in the pH of the cytoplasm.

All of the ATPases share a common basic structure. Each rotary ATPase is composed of two major components: F0/A0/V0 and F1/A1/V1. They are connected by 1-3 stalks to maintain stability, control rotation, and prevent them from rotating in the other direction. One stalk is utilized to transmit torque. The number of peripheral stalks is dependent on the type of ATPase: F-ATPases have one, A-ATPases have two, and V-ATPases have three. The F1 catalytic domain is located on the N-side (negative-side) of the membrane and is involved in the synthesis and degradation of ATP and is involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The F0 transmembrane domain is involved in the movement of ions across the membrane.

The bacterial F0F1-ATPase consists of the soluble F1 domain and the transmembrane F0 domain, which is composed of several subunits with varying stoichiometry. There are two subunits, γ, and ε, that form the central stalk and they are linked to F0. F0 contains a c-subunit oligomer in the shape of a ring (c-ring). The α subunit is close to the subunit b2 and makes up the stalk that connects the transmembrane subunits to the α3β3 and δ subunits. F-ATP synthases are identical in appearance and function except for the mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase, which contains 7-9 additional subunits.

The electrochemical potential is what causes the c-ring to rotate in a clockwise direction for ATP synthesis. This causes the central stalk and the catalytic domain to change shape. Rotating the c-ring causes three ATP molecules to be made, which then causes H+ to move from the P-side (positive-side) of the membrane to the N-side (negative-side) of the membrane. The counterclockwise rotation of the c-ring is driven by ATP hydrolysis and ions move from the N-side to the P-side, which helps to build up electrochemical potential.

==Transmembrane ATP synthases==
The ATP synthase of mitochondria and chloroplasts is an anabolic enzyme that harnesses the energy of a transmembrane proton gradient as an energy source for adding an inorganic phosphate group to a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

This enzyme works when a proton moves down the concentration gradient, giving the enzyme a spinning motion. This unique spinning motion bonds ADP and P together to create ATP.

ATP synthase can also function in reverse, that is, use energy released by ATP hydrolysis to pump protons against their electrochemical gradient.

==Classification==
There are different types of ATPases, which can differ in function (ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis), structure (F-, V- and A-ATPases contain rotary motors) and in the type of ions they transport.

* Rotary ATPases
**F-ATPases (F1FO-ATPases) in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacterial plasma membranes are the prime producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts).
*** F-ATPases lacking a delta/OSCP subunit move sodium ions instead. They are proposed to be called N-ATPases, since they seem to form a distinct group that is further apart from usual F-ATPases than A-ATPases are from V-ATPases.
**V-ATPases (V1VO-ATPases) are primarily found in eukaryotic vacuoles, catalysing ATP hydrolysis to transport solutes and lower pH in organelles like proton pump of lysosome.
**A-ATPases (A1AO-ATPases) are found in Archaea and some extremophilic bacteria. They are arranged like V-ATPases, but function like F-ATPases mainly as ATP synthases.
**Many homologs that are not necessarily rotaty exist. See .
*P-ATPases (E1E2-ATPases) are found in bacteria, fungi and in eukaryotic plasma membranes and organelles, and function to transport a variety of different ions across membranes.
*E-ATPases are cell-surface enzymes that hydrolyze a range of NTPs, including extracellular ATP. Examples include ecto-ATPases, CD39s, and ecto-ATP/Dases, all of which are members of a &quot;GDA1 CD39&quot; superfamily.
*AAA proteins are a family of ring-shaped P-loop NTPases.

===P-ATPase===

P-ATPases (sometime known as E1-E2 ATPases) are found in bacteria and also in eukaryotic plasma membranes and organelles. Its name is due to short time attachment of inorganic phosphate at the aspartate residues at the time of activation. Function of P-ATPase is to transport a variety of different compounds, like ions and phospholipids, across a membrane using ATP hydrolysis for energy. There are many different classes of P-ATPases, which transports a specific type of ion. P-ATPases may be composed of one or two polypeptides, and can usually take two main conformations, E1 and E2.

<text>Vladimir Davidovich Ashkenazy (, &quot;Vladimir Davidovich Ashkenazi&quot;; born 6 July 1937) is a Soviet-born Icelandic pianist, chamber music performer, and conductor. Ashkenazy has collaborated with well-known orchestras and soloists. In addition, he has recorded a large repertoire of classical and romantic works. His recordings have earned him seven Grammy Awards and Iceland&#x27;s Order of the Falcon.

== Early life and education ==
Vladimir Ashkenazy was born in Gorky, Soviet Union (now Nizhny Novgorod, Russia), to pianist and composer David Ashkenazi and to actress Yevstolia Grigorievna (born Plotnova). His father was Jewish and his mother came from a Russian Orthodox family. Ashkenazy was christened in a Russian Orthodox church. He began playing piano at the age of six and was accepted to the Central Music School at age eight, studying with Anaida Sumbatyan.

Ashkenazy attended the Moscow Conservatory where he studied with Lev Oborin and Boris Zemliansky. He won second prize in the V International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1955 and the first prize in the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels in 1956. He shared the first prize in the 1962 International Tchaikovsky Competition with British pianist John Ogdon. As a student, like many in that period, he was harassed by the KGB to become an &quot;informer&quot;.

== Career ==

Ashkenazy has recorded a wide range of piano repertoire, both solo works and concerti. His recordings include:
* Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;
* Bach&#x27;s &quot;French Suites&quot; 
* 24 Preludes and Fugues of Shostakovich
* complete sonatas by Beethoven
* complete sonatas by Scriabin
* the complete works for piano by Rachmaninoff
* the complete works for solo piano by Chopin
* the (almost) complete works for piano by Schumann
His concerto recordings include:
* the complete piano concertos of Mozart (conducting from the keyboard with the Philharmonia Orchestra)
* three cycles of the 5 Beethoven concerti
::(a) with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Sir Georg Solti
::(b) with Zubin Mehta and the Vienna Philharmonic
::(c) conducting from the piano with the Cleveland Orchestra
* Brahms with Bernard Haitink (No. 1 with the Concertgebouw Orchestra; No. 2 with the Vienna Philharmonic)
* Bartók (with Georg Solti and the London Philharmonic Orchestra)
* Prokofiev (with André Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra)
* two cycles of the Rachmaninoff concerti
::(a) with André Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra
::(b) with Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebouw Orchestra

In public piano performances, Ashkenazy was known for rejecting a tie and button shirt in favor of a white turtleneck and for running (not walking) onstage and offstage. He has also performed and recorded chamber music. Moreover, Ashkenazy has had an acclaimed collaborative career, including an acclaimed recording of Beethoven&#x27;s complete violin sonatas with Itzhak Perlman, as well as the cello sonatas with Lynn Harrell, and the piano trios with Harrell and Perlman.

Midway through his international pianistic career, Ashkenazy branched into conducting. In Europe, Ashkenazy was principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1987 to 1994, 1989-1999 Chief Conductor and Artistic Director of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin (initial name was Radio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin)and of the Czech Philharmonic from 1998 to 2003. Ashkenazy is also conductor laureate of the Philharmonia Orchestra, conductor laureate of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and music director of the European Union Youth Orchestra. In July 2013 he became director of the &quot;Accademia Pianistica Internazionale di Imola&quot;, succeeding its founder and director Franco Scala. His recordings as a conductor include complete cycles of the symphonies of Sibelius and of Rachmaninoff, as well as orchestral works of Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Scriabin, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky.

Outside of Europe, Ashkenazy served as music director of the NHK Symphony Orchestra from 2004 to 2007. He was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra from 2009 to 2013.

Ashkenazy has recorded for Decca since 1963; in 2013, Decca celebrated his 50th anniversary with the label with the box set &#x27;Vladimir Ashkenazy: 50 Years on Decca&#x27;, including 50 of Ashkenazy&#x27;s recordings as both pianist and conductor. As part of Ashkenazy&#x27;s 80th birthday celebrations, Decca is releasing the &#x27;Complete Piano Concerto Recordings&#x27; and &#x27;Ashkenazy on Vinyl&#x27; in July 2017. In other media, Ashkenazy has also appeared in several films on music by Christopher Nupen. He interpreted the soundtrack of the film Piano Forest: works from the repertoire of Bach, Mozart, Chopin and Beethoven. He has also made his own orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1982). There has been a CD produced of his works named &#x27;The Art of Ashkenazy&#x27;, and a biography of Ashkenazy, &#x27;Beyond Frontiers&#x27;, has been published.

On 17 January 2020 the artist management agency Harrison Parrott announced Ashkenazy&#x27;s retirement from public performance.
==Personal life==

In 1961, he married the Iceland-born Þórunn Jóhannsdóttir, who studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory. To marry Ashkenazy, Þórunn was forced to give up her Icelandic citizenship and declare that she wanted to live in the USSR. Her name is usually transliterated as &quot;Thorunn&quot;; her nickname is Dódý, so she is called Dódý Ashkenazy.

After numerous bureaucratic procedures, the Soviet authorities agreed to allow the Ashkenazys to visit the West for musical performances and for visits to his parents-in-law with their first grandson. In his memoirs, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recollected that Ashkenazy on a visit to London had refused to return to the Soviet Union. Khrushchev mentioned that Ashkenazy then sought advice from the Soviet Embassy in London, who in turn referred the matter to Moscow. Khrushchev said he was of the opinion that to require Ashkenazy to return to the USSR would have made him an &quot;Anti-Soviet&quot;. He further said that this was a good example of an artist being able to come and go in and out of the USSR freely, which Ashkenazy said was a gross &quot;distortion of the truth&quot;. In 1963, Ashkenazy decided to leave the USSR permanently, establishing residence in London, where his wife&#x27;s parents lived.

The couple moved to Iceland in 1968 where, in 1972, Ashkenazy became an Icelandic citizen. In 1970 he helped to found the Reykjavík Arts Festival, of which he remains Honorary President. In 1978 the couple and their (then) four children (Vladimir Stefan, Nadia Liza, Dimitri Thor, and Sonia Edda) moved to Lucerne, Switzerland. Their fifth child, Alexandra Inga, was born in 1979. Beginning in 1989, Ashkenazy resided in Meggen, Switzerland, on Lake Lucerne. His eldest son Vladimir, who uses his nickname &#x27;Vovka&#x27; as a stage name, is a pianist, as well as a teacher at the Imola International Piano Academy. His second son, Dimitri, is a clarinetist.

=== Critical reception ===

&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2018 that Ashkenazy conducted pieces by Prokofiev and Glière as if he had been &quot;born to do it&quot; during a concert series that explored the musical response to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, including composer Alexander Mosolov&#x27;s &quot;Iron Foundry&quot; (1927) and the suite from &quot;The Red Poppy&quot;, a ballet with music by Glière.

<text>The Amazing 3, or , is a Japanese comic series and a black-and-white Japanese animated television series created by Osamu Tezuka in the 1960s. It involves the adventures of three agents from outer space who are sent to Earth to determine whether the planet, a potential threat to the universe, should be destroyed. Landing on Earth, the characters take the form of a rabbit, a horse, and a duck, and make friends with a young human boy.

The series was first published in print format as manga in Japan in 1965, and then spawned an animated television version, with different stories. The latter was dubbed in English and broadcast in the United States with a different theme song, as well as different closing and opening elements, under the title &quot;The Amazing 3&quot;. The American version was also aired in Australia in 1969 and in Spanish-speaking countries as &quot;Los tres espaciales&quot;. The Japanese-language animated version was first released on DVD in 2002, and then a full 10-DVD set in 2005.

The series tackles a number of issues that were unusual in animated cartoons of that period: in particular, ecological concerns and poverty and racial diversity.

In 2017, a Kickstarter campaign for an English translation of the manga from Digital Manga made $82,137. The manga was released in 2020, under the title &quot;Wonder 3&quot;.

==Plot==

The Galactic Federation is concerned about the number of wars on the Planet Earth. It sends three agents to determine if the planet is a potential threat to the universe, and whether it should be destroyed. The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. The agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, but upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).

After landing, they are befriended by Shinichi Hoshi, a young boy who becomes their ally throughout the series. The series also features Shinichi&#x27;s older brother, Kōichi, who is a member of the secret intelligence agency &quot;Phoenix&quot;, formed to protect the peace of the world. The Wonder 3 are initially repulsed by the violence of the earthlings, especially Pukko, but gradually change their thinking after being touched by the kind personality of Shinichi.

In the final episode of the series the decision is made by the galactic council that mankind is irredeemable and that the Earth is to be destroyed. Although Pukko is in favor of this as much as ever, Bokko puts off the order as long as possible, and eventually decides to disobey the council&#x27;s decision. However, prior to Bokko&#x27;s decision to disobey her orders, Shinichi is appalled at the likelihood that his friends would obey the order and runs to Kōichi to ask Phoenix to intervene.

Although dozens of Phoenix agents fight the Amazing 3 in their saucer, they are unable to destroy it, and Shinichi appeals to Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko to take him back to their home planet to plead Earth&#x27;s case. During the trip Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko revert to their humanoid forms for the first time, much to the surprise of Shinichi, who had never seen their true appearances before (perhaps not clearly, anyway – he had also seen them through the window of their saucer in the first episode, though it&#x27;s suggested in the episode that he could only see their silhouettes).

Shinichi is particularly surprised by Bokko&#x27;s beauty in her actual form. A3 are presented to the galactic council on charges of disobeying orders. Shinichi is given a chance to plead Earth&#x27;s case and the council offers him the opportunity to stay on their planet with all the rights and privileges of other citizens. Shinichi becomes angry and attacks a guard, thus proving mankind&#x27;s inherently violent nature to many there. 
The order is given to wipe out Shinichi&#x27;s memories, but before this can be done Bokko pleads for him to be released, and for the Earth to be given more time to develop. The council eventually decides to return A3 to the Earth and re-examine the matter when Shinichi reaches adulthood.

Upon their return to Earth Pukko is ashamed of his attitude toward humans before that point, Shinichi is reunited with Kōichi, and Bokko is transformed by Nokko and Pukko into an Earth girl so she&#x27;ll have a chance to be with Shinichi as the human girl she really wants to be – for a short time, anyway. The closing shot of the series is of the now-human Bokko walking towards Shinichi&#x27;s home to find him.

==Characters==

 is the cute one, and the brains of the group. She is capable of great powers of telepathy, telekinesis and hypnosis, has extremely sensitive hearing, and can also control the inner workings of machines by pressing her ears against them. She likes humans and sees no need to destroy the planet because of the actions of a few bad eggs. Despite the fact that in her humanoid form she is somewhat older than Shinichi (their human friend who is probably in his early teens, while she is probably in her 20s), and the fact that she&#x27;s a rabbit in her animal form, her feelings for Shinichi are considerably more than platonic. Her deepest desire is to be an Earth girl so she can be with Shinichi. 

 is capable of creating inventions incredibly quickly, and is intensely speedy and tough in his horse appearance. Nokko would also prefer to see the Earth not destroyed – largely because he likes the food. He has a girlfriend named Felina who is also a member of the Galactic Patrol. She is seen once in the series when sent to Earth on a mission and takes on the form of a cat. 

 is a with an occasional heart of gold, can generate shockwaves with his wings, and is also quite a capable guitarist. He is also quite a bit stronger than his duck appearance would suggest. He is the member of the Amazing 3 who is most in favor of destroying the Earth, and this increasingly brings him into conflict with Bokko as the series progresses, also criticizing her for her feelings regarding Shinichi (it&#x27;s implied on occasion that he harbors his own feelings for Bokko). However, despite his attitude towards earthlings, Pukko is always willing to help the Amazing 3 and protect Shinichi. Pukko has what appears to be either a haircut or wig that resembles that worn by the Beatles or Moe Howard from the Three Stooges; probably added by Tezuka due to the Beatles&#x27; enormous popularity in Japan at the time. 

Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko are all conversant in Japanese – and apparently English – and can also talk to other animals. They also possess a gun called the time reversal gun. It can be used to reverse the flow of time in a small area.

 is an Earth boy (named after Tezuka&#x27;s longtime friend, the Japanese science fiction writer Shinichi Hoshi) who becomes their ally throughout the series. He is the only person who knows what they really are, or that they can talk. Shinichi&#x27;s girlfriend Kanoko also figures prominently in the manga, but is absent from the anime, possibly because her presence would have detracted from Tezuka&#x27;s plan for the ending of the series. 

, Shinichi&#x27;s older brother, is a secret agent for an organization called &quot;Phoenix&quot;, whose cover is a manga artist. His primary adversary is &quot;Interspy&quot;, though he also fights against others as well. He sometimes uses guns, but primarily relies on martial arts and his watch, which contains a small hammer and chain, a radar, and a flashlight, which can also be used as a beam to blind his opponents. His pipe also contains a smoke gas which can conceal his whereabouts. Within Phoenix, he is known as Agent P77. He is also a master of disguise. Kōichi joined Phoenix in order to avenge the death of a friend (who had previously been Agent P77) who had been killed by Interspy. The policy of Phoenix is to avoid violence when possible, but recognizes that it&#x27;s sometimes unavoidable. 

There are three main supporting characters. Shinichi and Kōichi&#x27;s mother is voiced by Ryoko Sakurai in the Japanese version. She is a heavyset and domineering woman. Shinichi and Kōichi&#x27;s father and mother operate a small hotel. Their father is something of a . The third major supporting character is the mysterious M, the head of Phoenix and the person from whom Kōichi takes orders. Only the back of his head is ever seen.

==Anime==

&quot;W3&quot; aired in Japan on Fuji TV from June 6, 1965, until June 27, 1966, for a total of 52 episodes. The American version of the series, &quot;The Amazing 3&quot;, was released in syndication through Erika Productions in 1967. It aired on KCOP-TV (Channel 13) in Los Angeles, California, and on WPIX-TV (Channel 11) in New York, New York. The series was also dubbed into Spanish and broadcast in Spanish-speaking countries as &quot;Los tres espaciales&quot;.

This series was the first Tezuka production in which Tezuka adopted a method of animation which had long been used by Disney and Warner Brothers in which each animator was responsible for drawing a single character instead of the team of animators each taking a piece of a show and drawing everything.

The premise of both the manga and the anime was the same, and the characters looked nearly identical in both, but the stories differed greatly. Stories which appeared in the manga were not used again for the anime – and vice versa. In addition, the manga version has Shinichi&#x27;s school friends and teachers playing more of a role than they would in the anime.

===Pilot===

In the pilot for the series, a few characters looked slightly different. Bokko&#x27;s appearance was more rabbit-like and less feminine, and she didn&#x27;t yet have the black tips on her ears, or the tuft of black hair on her head. Pukko didn&#x27;t have his Beatle haircut. And Kōichi looked much the same, but his face was altered slightly for the series. The pilot for the series is largely the same as the first episode – and some footage was reused for the first episode – but differs in a few respects; mostly with regards to how Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko first meet Shinichi. It is also only about 15 minutes long, and ends with Kōichi&#x27;s discovery of a hidden base, which isn&#x27;t part of the first episode.

===Theme music===

Unlike &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, where the opening theme music was the same in both the Japanese and American versions (with only the lyrics changed), the Japanese and American versions of &quot;The Amazing 3&quot; had different theme music, as well as considerably different opening and closing segments. The American version borrowed part of its melody from the Japanese version. The Japanese theme (sung by a group called Vocal Shop) was considerably more playful and complex than the American version.

===Episodes===

===Revival attempt===
There was a brief report from the 2000 Anime Expo in Anaheim, California, that Studio Pierrot and a newer company called Digital Manga were considering the idea of teaming up and producing a new version of the series to be streamed on the Internet. The product was released by eManga as &#x27;Wonder 3 Omnibus&#x27;.

==Availability==

The complete Japanese-language manga is available in two volumes. A late 1970s three-volume set can also sometimes be found.

During the 1990s, the series was available in Japan both on two sets of laserdiscs and on a series of thirteen VHS videocassettes. The series was first released on DVD in Japan in two volumes in 2002 and 2003. A complete single-volume 10-DVD set was released in 2005. A lower priced (¥15,000) 10-DVD set was released for a limited time in 2008 in honor of what would have been Tezuka&#x27;s 80th birthday. Though the negatives for the series were damaged in a warehouse flood, the episodes on the Japanese DVDs were taken from the best existing sources.

Many of the American (English-dubbed) episodes are considered lost. The English dubbed version had aired on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles from 1967 to 1970. as of June 2020, 30 of the 52 translated episodes have been found. The English-dubbed version of the series also aired on Australia&#x27;s Channel 9 beginning in 1969. Anime Sols, which closed officially on May 1, 2015, attempted to crowdfund the streaming rights for an official English-subtitled version of the show.

==Other appearances==

* Pukko had made a brief appearance (recolored brown) in Episode 26 of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1980). The story also brought together an adult Princess Sapphire with guest appearances by Black Jack and Pinoko. The episode was notable for being Black Jack&#x27;s third televised appearance and for bringing a belated unofficial closure to the series &quot;Princess Knight&quot; (although how Pukko ended up in 15th Century Europe is anyone&#x27;s guess).

* Pukko also made background cameo appearances in two television movies, first as one of Ban&#x27;s puppets (this time, recolored green) in the 1981 television film &quot;Bremen 4: Angels in Hell&quot;, the fourth Tezuka Productions special, and then as one of the denizens of the border planet Scarabe in the 1986 film &quot;Galaxy Investigation 2100: Border Planet&quot;, the seventh Tezuka Productions special (he was with the cantina patrons on the newly constructed transporter ship that was to take them off the planet and journey to a new home among the stars).

* Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko make a cameo appearance in the 2004 game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot;. this time with a more antagonistic role compared to his despiction in the manga and television series and with a circle-shaped spaceship instead of their UFO.

<text>A gravity assist, gravity assist maneuver, swing-by, or generally a gravitational [[slingshot]] in orbital mechanics, is a type of spaceflight flyby which makes use of the relative movement (e.g. orbit around the Sun) and gravity of a planet or other astronomical object to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically to save propellant and reduce expense.

Gravity assistance can be used to accelerate a spacecraft, that is, to increase or decrease its speed or redirect its path. The &quot;assist&quot; is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft. Any gain or loss of kinetic energy and linear momentum by a passing spacecraft is correspondingly lost or gained by the gravitational body, in accordance with Newton&#x27;s Third Law. The gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when the Soviet probe Luna 3 photographed the far side of Earth&#x27;s Moon, and it was used by interplanetary probes from Mariner 10 onward, including the two Voyager probes&#x27; notable flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.

==Explanation==

A gravity assist around a planet changes a spacecraft&#x27;s velocity (relative to the Sun) by entering and leaving the gravitational sphere of influence of a planet. The sum of the kinetic energies of both bodies remains constant (see elastic collision). A slingshot maneuver can therefore be used to change the spaceship&#x27;s trajectory and speed relative to the Sun.

A close terrestrial analogy is provided by a tennis ball bouncing off the front of a moving train. Imagine standing on a train platform, and throwing a ball at 30 km/h toward a train approaching at 50 km/h. The driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80 km/h and then departing at 80 km/h after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train. Because of the train&#x27;s motion, however, that departure is at 130 km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train&#x27;s velocity to its own.

Translating this analogy into space: in the planet reference frame, the spaceship has a vertical velocity of &quot;v&quot; relative to the planet. After the slingshot occurs the spaceship is leaving on a course 90 degrees to that which it arrived on. It will still have a velocity of &quot;v&quot;, but in the horizontal direction. In the Sun reference frame, the planet has a horizontal velocity of v, and by using the Pythagorean Theorem, the spaceship initially has a total velocity of &quot;v&quot;. After the spaceship leaves the planet, it will have a velocity of &quot;v + v =&quot; 2&quot;v&quot;, gaining approximately 0.6&quot;v&quot;.

This oversimplified example cannot be refined without additional details regarding the orbit, but if the spaceship travels in a path which forms a hyperbola, it can leave the planet in the opposite direction without firing its engine. This example is one of many trajectories and gains of speed the spaceship can experience.

This explanation might seem to violate the conservation of energy and momentum, apparently adding velocity to the spacecraft out of nothing, but the spacecraft&#x27;s effects on the planet must also be taken into consideration to provide a complete picture of the mechanics involved. The linear momentum gained by the spaceship is equal in magnitude to that lost by the planet, so the spacecraft gains velocity and the planet loses velocity. However, the planet&#x27;s enormous mass compared to the spacecraft makes the resulting change in its speed negligibly small even when compared to the orbital perturbations planets undergo due to interactions with other celestial bodies on astronomically short timescales. For example, one metric ton is a typical mass for an interplanetary space probe whereas Jupiter has a mass of almost 2 x 1024 metric tons. Therefore, a one-ton spacecraft passing Jupiter will theoretically cause the planet to lose approximately 5 x 10−25 km/s of orbital velocity for every km/s of velocity relative to the Sun gained by the spacecraft. For all practical purposes the effects on the planet can be ignored in the calculation.

Realistic portrayals of encounters in space require the consideration of three dimensions. The same principles apply as above except adding the planet&#x27;s velocity to that of the spacecraft requires vector addition as shown below.


Due to the reversibility of orbits, gravitational slingshots can also be used to reduce the speed of a spacecraft. Both Mariner 10 and MESSENGER performed this maneuver to reach Mercury.

If more speed is needed than available from gravity assist alone, a rocket burn near the periapsis (closest planetary approach) uses the least fuel. A given rocket burn always provides the same change in velocity (Δv), but the change in kinetic energy is proportional to the vehicle&#x27;s velocity at the time of the burn. Therefore the maximum kinetic energy is obtained when the burn occurs at the vehicle&#x27;s maximum velocity (periapsis). The Oberth effect describes this technique in more detail.

==Historical origins==
In his paper &quot;To Those Who Will Be Reading in Order to Build&quot; (), published in 1938 but dated 1918–1919, Yuri Kondratyuk suggested that a spacecraft traveling between two planets could be accelerated at the beginning and end of its trajectory by using the gravity of the two planets&#x27; moons. The portion of his manuscript considering gravity-assists received no later development and was not published until the 1960s. In his 1925 paper &quot;Problems of Flight by Jet Propulsion: Interplanetary Flights&quot; (), Friedrich Zander showed a deep understanding of the physics behind the concept of gravity assist and its potential for the interplanetary exploration of the solar system.

Italian engineer Gaetano Crocco was first to calculate an interplanetary journey considering multiple gravity-assists.

The gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when the Soviet probe Luna 3 photographed the far side of the Moon. The maneuver relied on research performed under the direction of Mstislav Keldysh at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics.

In 1961, Michael Minovitch, UCLA graduate student who worked at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), developed a gravity assist technique, that would later be used for the Gary Flandro&#x27;s Planetary Grand Tour idea.

During the summer of 1964 at the NASA JPL, Gary Flandro was assigned the task of studying techniques for exploring the outer planets of the solar system. In this study he discovered the rare alignment of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and conceived the Planetary Grand Tour multi-planet mission utilizing gravity assist to reduce mission duration from forty years to less than ten.

==Purpose==

A spacecraft traveling from Earth to an inner planet will increase its relative speed because it is falling toward the Sun, and a spacecraft traveling from Earth to an outer planet will decrease its speed because it is leaving the vicinity of the Sun.

Although the orbital speed of an inner planet is greater than that of the Earth, a spacecraft traveling to an inner planet, even at the minimum speed needed to reach it, is still accelerated by the Sun&#x27;s gravity to a speed notably greater than the orbital speed of that destination planet. If the spacecraft&#x27;s purpose is only to fly by the inner planet, then there is typically no need to slow the spacecraft. However, if the spacecraft is to be inserted into orbit about that inner planet, then there must be some way to slow it down.

Similarly, while the orbital speed of an outer planet is less than that of the Earth, a spacecraft leaving the Earth at the minimum speed needed to travel to some outer planet is slowed by the Sun&#x27;s gravity to a speed far less than the orbital speed of that outer planet. Therefore, there must be some way to accelerate the spacecraft when it reaches that outer planet if it is to enter orbit about it.

Rocket engines can certainly be used to increase and decrease the speed of the spacecraft. However, rocket thrust takes propellant, propellant has mass, and even a small change in velocity (known as Δ&quot;v&quot;, or &quot;delta-&quot;v&quot;&quot;, the delta symbol being used to represent a change and &quot;v&quot; signifying velocity) translates to a far larger requirement for propellant needed to escape Earth&#x27;s gravity well. This is because not only must the primary-stage engines lift the extra propellant, they must also lift the extra propellant beyond that which is needed to lift &quot;that&quot; additional propellant. The liftoff mass requirement increases exponentially with an increase in the required delta-&quot;v&quot; of the spacecraft.

Because additional fuel is needed to lift fuel into space, space missions are designed with a tight propellant &quot;budget&quot;, known as the &quot;delta-v budget&quot;. The delta-v budget is in effect the total propellant that will be available after leaving the earth, for speeding up, slowing down, stabilization against external buffeting (by particles or other external effects), or direction changes, if it cannot acquire more propellant. The entire mission must be planned within that capability. Therefore, methods of speed and direction change that do not require fuel to be burned are advantageous, because they allow extra maneuvering capability and course enhancement, without spending fuel from the limited amount which has been carried into space. Gravity assist maneuvers can greatly change the speed of a spacecraft without expending propellant, and can save significant amounts of propellant, so they are a very common technique to save fuel.

==Limits==
The main practical limit to the use of a gravity assist maneuver is that planets and other large masses are seldom in the right places to enable a voyage to a particular destination. For example, the Voyager missions which started in the late 1970s were made possible by the &quot;Grand Tour&quot; alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. A similar alignment will not occur again until the middle of the 22nd century. That is an extreme case, but even for less ambitious missions there are years when the planets are scattered in unsuitable parts of their orbits.

Another limitation is the atmosphere, if any, of the available planet. The closer the spacecraft can approach, the faster its periapsis speed as gravity accelerates the spacecraft, allowing for more kinetic energy to be gained from a rocket burn. However, if a spacecraft gets too deep into the atmosphere, the energy lost to drag can exceed that gained from the planet&#x27;s velocity. On the other hand, the atmosphere can be used to accomplish aerobraking. There have also been theoretical proposals to use aerodynamic lift as the spacecraft flies through the atmosphere. This maneuver, called an aerogravity assist, could bend the trajectory through a larger angle than gravity alone, and hence increase the gain in energy.

Even in the case of an airless body, there is a limit to how close a spacecraft may approach. The magnitude of the achievable change in velocity depends on the spacecraft&#x27;s approach velocity and the planet&#x27;s escape velocity at the point of closest approach (limited by either the surface or the atmosphere.)

Interplanetary slingshots using the Sun itself are not possible because the Sun is at rest relative to the Solar System as a whole. However, thrusting when near the Sun has the same effect as the powered slingshot described as the Oberth effect. This has the potential to magnify a spacecraft&#x27;s thrusting power enormously, but is limited by the spacecraft&#x27;s ability to resist the heat.

A rotating black hole might provide additional assistance, if its spin axis is aligned the right way. General relativity predicts that a large spinning frame-dragging—close to the object, space itself is dragged around in the direction of the spin. Any ordinary rotating object produces this effect. Although attempts to measure frame dragging about the Sun have produced no clear evidence, experiments performed by Gravity Probe B have detected frame-dragging effects caused by Earth. General relativity predicts that a spinning black hole is surrounded by a region of space, called the ergosphere, within which standing still (with respect to the black hole&#x27;s spin) is impossible, because space itself is dragged at the speed of light in the same direction as the black hole&#x27;s spin. The Penrose process may offer a way to gain energy from the ergosphere, although it would require the spaceship to dump some &quot;ballast&quot; into the black hole, and the spaceship would have had to expend energy to carry the &quot;ballast&quot; to the black hole.

==Notable examples of use==
;&quot;Luna 3&quot;
The gravity assist maneuver was first attempted in 1959 for Luna 3, to photograph the far side of the Moon. The satellite did not gain speed, but its orbit was changed in a way that allowed successful transmission of the photos.

;&quot;Pioneer 10&quot;
NASA&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; is a space probe launched in 1972 that completed the first mission to the planet Jupiter. Thereafter, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; became the first of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System. In December 1973, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; spacecraft was the first one to use the gravitational slingshot effect to reach escape velocity to leave Solar System.

;&quot;Pioneer 11&quot;
Pioneer 11 was launched by NASA in 1973, to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter and Saturn, solar winds, and cosmic rays. It was the first probe to encounter Saturn, the second to fly through the asteroid belt, and the second to fly by Jupiter. To get to Saturn, the spacecraft got a gravity assist on Jupiter.

;&quot;Mariner 10&quot;
The Mariner 10 probe was the first spacecraft to use the gravitational slingshot effect to reach another planet, passing by Venus on 5 February 1974 on its way to becoming the first spacecraft to explore Mercury.

;&quot;Voyager 1&quot;
&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. It gained the energy to escape the Sun&#x27;s gravity by performing slingshot maneuvers around Jupiter and Saturn. Having operated for as of , the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data is provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance of from Earth as of January 12, 2020, it is the most distant human-made object from Earth.

;&quot;Voyager 2&quot;
&quot;Voyager 2&quot; was launched by NASA on August 20, 1977, to study the outer planets. Its trajectory took longer to reach Jupiter and Saturn than its twin spacecraft but enabled further encounters with Uranus and Neptune.

;&quot;Galileo&quot;
The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft was launched by NASA in 1989 and on its route to Jupiter got three gravity assists, one from Venus (February 10, 1990), and two from Earth (December 8, 1990 and December 8, 1992). Spacecraft reached Jupiter in December 1995. Gravity assists also allowed &quot;Galileo&quot; to flyby two asteroids, 243 Ida and 951 Gaspra.

;&quot;Ulysses&quot;
In 1990, NASA launched the ESA spacecraft &quot;Ulysses&quot; to study the polar regions of the Sun. All the planets orbit approximately in a plane aligned with the equator of the Sun. Thus, to enter an orbit passing over the poles of the Sun, the spacecraft would have to eliminate the speed it inherited from the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun and gain the speed needed to orbit the Sun in the pole-to-pole plane. It was achieved by a gravity assist from Jupiter on February 8, 1992.

;&quot;MESSENGER&quot;
The MESSENGER mission (launched in August 2004) made extensive use of gravity assists to slow its speed before orbiting Mercury. The MESSENGER mission included one flyby of Earth, two flybys of Venus, and three flybys of Mercury before finally arriving at Mercury in March 2011 with a velocity low enough to permit orbit insertion with available fuel. Although the flybys were primarily orbital maneuvers, each provided an opportunity for significant scientific observations.

;&quot;Cassini&quot;
The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft was launched from Earth on 15 October 1997, followed by gravity assist flybys of Venus (26 April 1998 and 21 June 1999), Earth (18 August 1999), and Jupiter (30 December 2000). Transit to Saturn took 6.7 years, the spacecraft arrived at 1 July 2004. Its trajectory was called &quot;the Most Complex Gravity-Assist Trajectory Flown to Date&quot; in 2019.

After entering orbit around Saturn, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft used multiple Titan gravity assists to achieve significant changes in the inclination of its orbit as well so that instead of staying nearly in the equatorial plane, the spacecraft&#x27;s flight path was inclined well out of the plane of the rings. A typical Titan encounter changed the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity by 0.75 km/s, and the spacecraft made 127 Titan encounters. These encounters enabled an orbital tour with a wide range of periapsis and apoapsis distances, various alignments of the orbit with respect to the Sun, and orbital inclinations from 0° to 74°. The multiple flybys of Titan also allowed Cassini to flyby other moons, such as Rhea and Enceladus.

;&quot;Rosetta&quot;

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe, launched in March 2004, used four gravity assist maneuvers (including one just 250 km from the surface of Mars, and three assists from Earth) to accelerate throughout the inner Solar System. That enabled it to flyby the asteroids 21 Lutetia and 2867 Šteins as well as eventually match the velocity of the 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko comet at the rendezvous point in August 2014.

;&quot;New Horizons&quot;
&quot;New Horizons&quot; was launched by NASA in 2006, and reached Pluto in 2015. In 2007 it performed a gravity assist on Jupiter.

;&quot;Juno&quot;
The Juno spacecraft was launched on August 5, 2011 (UTC). The trajectory used a gravity assist speed boost from Earth, accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013, two years after its launch on August 5, 2011. In that way &quot;Juno&quot; changed its orbit (and speed) toward its final goal, Jupiter, after only five years.

;Parker Solar Probe


The Parker Solar Probe, launched by NASA in 2018, has seven planned Venus gravity assists. Each gravity assist brings the Parker Solar Probe progressively closer to the Sun. As of 2022, the spacecraft has performed five of its seven assists. The Parker Solar Probe&#x27;s mission will make the closest approach to the Sun by any space mission. The mission&#x27;s final planned gravity assist maneuver, completed on November 6, 2024, prepared it for three final solar flybys reaching just 3.8 million miles of the surface of the sun on December 24, 2024 (see figure).

;Solar Orbiter
Solar Orbiter was launched by ESA in 2020. In its initial cruise phase, which lasts until November 2021, Solar Orbiter performed two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System. The first close solar pass will take place on 26 March 2022 at around a third of Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun.

;&quot;BepiColombo&quot;
BepiColombo is a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to the planet Mercury. It was launched on 20 October 2018. It will use the gravity assist technique with Earth once, with Venus twice, and six times with Mercury. It will arrive in 2025. BepiColombo is named after Giuseppe (Bepi) Colombo who was a pioneer thinker with this way of maneuvers.

;&quot;Lucy&quot;
&quot;Lucy&quot; was launched by NASA on 16 October 2021. It gained one gravity assist from Earth on the 16th of October, 2022, and after a flyby of the main-belt asteroid 152830 Dinkinesh it will gain another in 2024. In 2025, it will fly by the inner main-belt asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson. In 2027, it will arrive at the Trojan cloud (the Greek camp of asteroids that orbits about 60° ahead of Jupiter), where it will fly by four Trojans, 3548 Eurybates (with its satellite), 15094 Polymele, 11351 Leucus, and 21900 Orus. After these flybys, &quot;Lucy&quot; will return to Earth in 2031 for another gravity assist toward the Trojan cloud (the Trojan camp which trails about 60° behind Jupiter), where it will visit the binary Trojan 617 Patroclus with its satellite Menoetius in 2033.

In fiction

In the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey – but not the movie – Discovery performs such a manoeuvre to gain speed as it goes around Jupiter. As Arthur C. Clarke made clear at various times, the location of TMA-2 was switched from near Saturn (in the novel) to near Jupiter (in the movie).

<doc id="155759" wikidata="Q855377" url="?curid=155759" title="Launch window">
<text>In the context of spaceflight, launch period is the collection of days, and launch window is the time period on a given day, during which a particular rocket must be launched in order to reach its intended target. If the rocket is not launched within a given window, it has to wait for the window on the next day of the period. Launch periods and launch windows are dependent on both the rocket&#x27;s capability and the orbit to which it is going.

A launch &quot;period&quot; refers to the days that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit. A mission could have a period of 365 days in a year, a few weeks each month, a few weeks every 26 months (e.g. Mars launch periods), or a short period time that won&#x27;t be repeated.

A launch &quot;window&quot; indicates the time frame on a given day within the launch period that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit. This can be as short as a second (referred to as an instantaneous window) or as long as the entire day. The launch window can straddle two calendar days (for example, starting at 11:46 p.m. and ending at 12:14 a.m.). Launch windows are rarely at exactly the same times each day. For operational reasons, the window almost always is limited to no more than a few hours.

Launch windows and launch periods are often used interchangeably in the public sphere, even within the same organization. The definitions given here are as used by launch directors and trajectory analysts at NASA and other space agencies.

==Launch period==

To go to another planet using the simple low-energy Hohmann transfer orbit, if eccentricity of orbits is not a factor, launch periods are periodic according to the synodic period; for example, in the case of Mars, the period is 780 days (2.1 years). In more complex cases, including the use of gravitational slingshots, launch periods are irregular. Sometimes rare opportunities arise, such as when &quot;Voyager 2&quot; took advantage of a planetary alignment occurring once in 175 years to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. When such an opportunity is missed, another target may be selected. For instance, ESA&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission was originally intended for comet 46P/Wirtanen, but a launcher problem delayed it and a new target had to be selected (comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko).

Launch periods are often calculated from porkchop plots, which show the delta-v needed to achieve the mission plotted against the launch time.

==Launch window==
The launch window is defined by the first launch point and ending launch point. It may be continuous (i.e. able to launch every second in the launch window) or may be a collection of discrete instantaneous points between the open and close. Launch windows and days are usually calculated in UTC and then converted to the local time of where the rocket and spacecraft operators are located (frequently multiple time zones for USA launches).

For trips into largely arbitrary Earth orbits, no specific launch time is required. But if the spacecraft intends to rendezvous with an object already in orbit, the launch must be carefully timed to occur around the times that the target vehicle&#x27;s orbital plane intersects the launch site.

Earth observation satellites are often launched into sun-synchronous orbits which are near-polar. For these orbits, the launch window occurs at the time of day when the launch site location is aligned with the plane of the required orbit. To launch at another time would require an orbital plane change maneuver which would require a large amount of propellant.

For launches above low Earth orbit (LEO), the actual launch time can be somewhat flexible if a parking orbit is used, because the inclination and time the spacecraft initially spends in the parking orbit can be varied. See the launch window used by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; spacecraft to the planet Mars at .

==Instantaneous launch window==

Achieving the correct orbit requires the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). RAAN is set by varying a launch time, waiting for the earth to rotate until it is in the correct position. For missions with very specific orbits, such as rendezvousing with the International Space Station, the launch window may be a single moment in time, known as an instantaneous launch window.
Trajectories are programmed into a launch vehicle prior to launch. The launch vehicle will have a target, and the guidance system will alter the steering commands to attempt to get to the final end state. At least one variable (apogee, perigee, inclination, etc.) must be left free to alter the values of the others, otherwise the dynamics would be overconstrained. An instantaneous launch window allows the RAAN be the uncontrolled variable. While some spacecraft, such as the Centaur upper stage, can steer and adjust its RAAN after launch, choosing an instantaneous launch window allows the RAAN to be pre-determined for the spacecraft&#x27;s guidance system.

==Specific issues==
Space Shuttle missions to the International Space Station were restricted by beta angle cutout. Beta angle (formula_1) is defined as the angle between the orbit plane and the vector from the Sun. Due to the relationship between an orbiting object&#x27;s beta angle (in this case, the ISS) and the percent of its orbit that is spent in sunlight, solar power generation and thermal control are affected by that beta angle. Shuttle launches to the ISS were normally attempted only when the ISS was in an orbit with a beta angle of less than 60 degrees.

<doc id="155760" wikidata="Q723861" url="?curid=155760" title="Hohmann transfer orbit">
<text>In astronautics, the Hohmann transfer orbit () is an orbital maneuver used to transfer a spacecraft between two orbits of different altitudes around a central body. For example, a Hohmann transfer could be used to raise a satellite&#x27;s orbit from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit. In the idealized case, the initial and target orbits are both circular and coplanar. The maneuver is accomplished by placing the craft into an elliptical transfer orbit that is tangential to both the initial and target orbits. The maneuver uses two impulsive engine burns: the first establishes the transfer orbit, and the second adjusts the orbit to match the target.

The Hohmann maneuver often uses the lowest possible amount of impulse (which consumes a proportional amount of delta-v, and hence propellant) to accomplish the transfer, but requires a relatively longer travel time than higher-impulse transfers. In some cases where one orbit is much larger than the other, a bi-elliptic transfer can use even less impulse, at the cost of even greater travel time.

The maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann, the German scientist who published a description of it in his 1925 book &quot;Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper&quot; (&quot;The Attainability of Celestial Bodies&quot;). Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author Kurd Lasswitz and his 1897 book &quot;Two Planets&quot;.

When used for traveling between celestial bodies, a Hohmann transfer orbit requires that the starting and destination points be at particular locations in their orbits relative to each other. Space missions using a Hohmann transfer must wait for this required alignment to occur, which opens a launch window. For a mission between Earth and Mars, for example, these launch windows occur every 26 months. A Hohmann transfer orbit also determines a fixed time required to travel between the starting and destination points; for an Earth-Mars journey this travel time is about 9 months. When transfer is performed between orbits close to celestial bodies with significant gravitation, much less delta-v is usually required, as the Oberth effect may be employed for the burns.

They are also often used for these situations, but low-energy transfers which take into account the thrust limitations of real engines, and take advantage of the gravity wells of both planets can be more fuel efficient.

== Example ==
The diagram shows a Hohmann transfer orbit to bring a spacecraft from a lower circular orbit into a higher one. It is an elliptic orbit that is tangential both to the lower circular orbit the spacecraft is to leave (cyan, labeled &quot;1&quot; on diagram) and the higher circular orbit that it is to reach (red, labeled &quot;3&quot; on diagram). The transfer orbit (yellow, labeled &quot;2&quot; on diagram) is initiated by firing the spacecraft&#x27;s engine to add energy and raise the apoapsis. When the spacecraft reaches the apoapsis, a second engine firing adds energy to raise the periapsis, putting the spacecraft in the larger circular orbit.
Due to the reversibility of orbits, a similar Hohmann transfer orbit can be used to bring a spacecraft from a higher orbit into a lower one; in this case, the spacecraft&#x27;s engine is fired in the opposite direction to its current path, slowing the spacecraft and lowering the periapsis of the elliptical transfer orbit to the altitude of the lower target orbit. The engine is then fired again at the lower distance to slow the spacecraft into the lower circular orbit. 
The Hohmann transfer orbit is based on two instantaneous velocity changes. Extra fuel is required to compensate for the fact that the bursts take time; this is minimized by using high-thrust engines to minimize the duration of the bursts. For transfers in Earth orbit, the two burns are labelled the &quot;perigee burn&quot; and the &quot;apogee burn&quot; (or &quot;apogee kick&quot;); more generally, for bodies that are not the Earth, they are labelled &quot;periapsis&quot; and &quot;apoapsis&quot; burns. Alternatively, the second burn to circularize the orbit may be referred to as a &quot;circularization burn&quot;.

===Type I and Type II===

An ideal Hohmann transfer orbit transfers between two circular orbits in the same plane and traverses exactly 180° around the primary. In the real world, the destination orbit may not be circular, and may not be coplanar with the initial orbit. Real world transfer orbits may traverse slightly more, or slightly less, than 180° around the primary. An orbit which traverses less than 180° around the primary is called a &quot;Type I&quot; Hohmann transfer, while an orbit which traverses more than 180° is called a &quot;Type II&quot; Hohmann transfer.

Transfer orbits can go more than 360° around the primary. These multiple-revolution transfers are sometimes referred to as Type III and Type IV, where a Type III is a Type I plus 360°, and a Type IV is a Type II plus 360°.

=== Uses ===
A Hohmann transfer orbit can be used to transfer an object&#x27;s orbit toward another object, as long as they co-orbit a more massive body. In the context of Earth and the Solar System, this includes any object which orbits the Sun. An example of where a Hohmann transfer orbit could be used is to bring an asteroid, orbiting the Sun, into contact with the Earth.

== Calculation ==
For a small body orbiting another much larger body, such as a satellite orbiting Earth, the total energy of the smaller body is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, and this total energy also equals half the potential at the average distance formula_1 (the semi-major axis):
formula_2

Solving this equation for velocity results in the vis-viva equation,
formula_3
where:
* formula_4 is the speed of an orbiting body,
* formula_5 is the standard gravitational parameter of the primary body, assuming formula_6 is not significantly bigger than formula_7 (which makes formula_8), (for Earth, this is &quot;μ&quot;~3.986E14 m3 s−2)
* formula_9 is the distance of the orbiting body from the primary focus,
* formula_1 is the semi-major axis of the body&#x27;s orbit.

Therefore, the delta-&quot;v&quot; (Δv) required for the Hohmann transfer can be computed as follows, under the assumption of instantaneous impulses:
formula_11
to enter the elliptical orbit at formula_12 from the formula_13 circular orbit, where formula_14 is the aphelion of the resulting elliptical orbit, and
formula_15
to leave the elliptical orbit at formula_16 to the formula_14 circular orbit,
where formula_13 and formula_14 are respectively the radii of the departure and arrival circular orbits; 
the smaller (greater) of formula_13 and formula_14 corresponds to the periapsis distance (apoapsis distance) of the Hohmann elliptical transfer orbit. Typically, formula_22 is given in units of m3/s2, as such be sure to use meters, not kilometers, for formula_13 and formula_14. The total formula_25 is then:

formula_26

Whether moving into a higher or lower orbit, by Kepler&#x27;s third law, the time taken to transfer between the orbits is

formula_27
(one half of the orbital period for the whole ellipse), where formula_28 is length of semi-major axis of the Hohmann transfer orbit.

In application to traveling from one celestial body to another it is crucial to start maneuver at the time when the two bodies are properly aligned. Considering the target angular velocity being
formula_29
angular alignment α (in radians) at the time of start between the source object and the target object shall be
formula_30

== Example ==

Consider a geostationary transfer orbit, beginning at &quot;r&quot;1 = 6,678 km (altitude 300 km) and ending in a geostationary orbit with &quot;r&quot;2 = 42,164 km (altitude 35,786 km).

In the smaller circular orbit the speed is 7.73 km/s; in the larger one, 3.07 km/s. In the elliptical orbit in between the speed varies from 10.15 km/s at the perigee to 1.61 km/s at the apogee.

Therefore the Δv for the first burn is 10.15 − 7.73 = 2.42 km/s, for the second burn 3.07 − 1.61 = 1.46 km/s, and for both together 3.88 km/s.

This is &quot;greater&quot; than the Δv required for an escape orbit: 10.93 − 7.73 = 3.20 km/s. Applying a Δv at the Low Earth orbit (LEO) of only 0.78 km/s more (3.20−2.42) would give the rocket the escape velocity, which is less than the Δv of 1.46 km/s required to circularize the geosynchronous orbit. This illustrates the Oberth effect that at large speeds the same Δv provides more specific orbital energy, and energy increase is maximized if one spends the Δv as quickly as possible, rather than spending some, being decelerated by gravity, and then spending some more to overcome the deceleration (of course, the objective of a Hohmann transfer orbit is different).

== Worst case, maximum delta-&quot;v&quot; ==
As the example above demonstrates, the Δ&quot;v&quot; required to perform a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits is not the greatest when the destination radius is infinite. (Escape speed is times orbital speed, so the Δv required to escape is  − 1 (41.4%) of the orbital speed.) The Δv required is greatest (53.0% of smaller orbital speed) when the radius of the larger orbit is 15.5817... times that of the smaller orbit. This number is the positive root of , which is formula_31. For higher orbit ratios the required for the second burn decreases faster than the first increases.

== Application to interplanetary travel ==

When used to move a spacecraft from orbiting one planet to orbiting another, the Oberth effect allows to use less delta-&quot;v&quot; than the sum of the delta-&quot;v&quot; for separate manoeuvres to escape the first planet, followed by a Hohmann transfer to the second planet, followed by insertion into an orbit around the other planet.

For example, consider a spacecraft travelling from Earth to Mars. At the beginning of its journey, the spacecraft will already have a certain velocity and kinetic energy associated with its orbit around Earth. During the burn the rocket engine applies its delta-&quot;v&quot;, but the kinetic energy increases as a square law, until it is sufficient to escape the planet&#x27;s gravitational potential, and then burns more so as to gain enough energy to get into the Hohmann transfer orbit (around the Sun). Because the rocket engine is able to make use of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant, far less delta-&quot;v&quot; is required over and above that needed to reach escape velocity, and the optimum situation is when the transfer burn is made at minimum altitude (low periapsis) above the planet. The delta-&quot;v&quot; needed is only 3.6 km/s, only about 0.4 km/s more than needed to escape Earth, even though this results in the spacecraft going 2.9 km/s faster than the Earth as it heads off for Mars (see table below).

At the other end, the spacecraft must decelerate for the gravity of Mars to capture it. This capture burn should optimally be done at low altitude to also make best use of the Oberth effect. Therefore, relatively small amounts of thrust at either end of the trip are needed to arrange the transfer compared to the free space situation.

However, with any Hohmann transfer, the alignment of the two planets in their orbits is crucial – the destination planet and the spacecraft must arrive at the same point in their respective orbits around the Sun at the same time. This requirement for alignment gives rise to the concept of launch windows.

The term lunar transfer orbit (LTO) is used for the Moon.

It is possible to apply the formula given above to calculate the Δv in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled &quot;Δv to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth&#x27;s orbit&quot; gives the change from Earth&#x27;s velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the Sun. The column labeled &quot;LEO height&quot; gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the escape velocity (10.9 km/s) from this height. The column &quot;LEO&quot; is simply the previous speed minus the LEO orbital speed of 7.73 km/s.

Note that in most cases, Δ&quot;v&quot; from LEO is less than the Δ&quot;v&quot; to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth&#x27;s orbit.

To get to the Sun, it is actually not necessary to use a Δ&quot;v&quot; of 24 km/s. One can use 8.8 km/s to go very far away from the Sun, then use a negligible Δ&quot;v&quot; to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the Sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the Moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the Sun.

==Comparison to other transfers==

=== Bi-elliptic transfer ===

The bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half-elliptic orbits. From the initial orbit, a first burn expends delta-v to boost the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an apoapsis at some point formula_32 away from the central body. At this point a second burn sends the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with periapsis at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third burn is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.

While they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally require a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial semi-major axis is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.

The idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first published by Ary Sternfeld in 1934.

=== Low-thrust transfer ===

Low-thrust engines can perform an approximation of a Hohmann transfer orbit, by creating a gradual enlargement of the initial circular orbit through carefully timed engine firings. This requires a change in velocity (delta-&quot;v&quot;) that is greater than the two-impulse transfer orbit and takes longer to complete.

Engines such as ion thrusters are more difficult to analyze with the delta-&quot;v&quot; model. These engines offer a very low thrust and at the same time, much higher delta-&quot;v&quot; budget, much higher specific impulse, lower mass of fuel and engine. A 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver would be impractical with such a low thrust; the maneuver mainly optimizes the use of fuel, but in this situation there is relatively plenty of it.

If only low-thrust maneuvers are planned on a mission, then continuously firing a low-thrust, but very high-efficiency engine might generate a higher delta-&quot;v&quot; and at the same time use less propellant than a conventional chemical rocket engine.

Going from one circular orbit to another by gradually changing the radius simply requires the same delta-&quot;v&quot; as the difference between the two speeds. Such maneuver requires more delta-&quot;v&quot; than a 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver, but does so with continuous low thrust rather than the short applications of high thrust.

The amount of propellant mass used measures the efficiency of the maneuver plus the hardware employed for it. The total delta-&quot;v&quot; used measures the efficiency of the maneuver only. For electric propulsion systems, which tend to be low-thrust, the high efficiency of the propulsive system usually compensates for the higher delta-V compared to the more efficient Hohmann maneuver.

Transfer orbits using electrical propulsion or low-thrust engines optimize the transfer time to reach the final orbit and not the delta-v as in the Hohmann transfer orbit. For geostationary orbit, the initial orbit is set to be supersynchronous and by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee, the transfer orbit transforms to a circular geosynchronous one. This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit.

===Interplanetary Transport Network===

In 1997, a set of orbits known as the Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) was published, providing even lower propulsive delta-&quot;v&quot; (though much slower and longer) paths between different orbits than Hohmann transfer orbits. The Interplanetary Transport Network is different in nature than Hohmann transfers because Hohmann transfers assume only one large body whereas the Interplanetary Transport Network does not. The Interplanetary Transport Network is able to achieve the use of less propulsive delta-&quot;v&quot; by employing gravity assist from the planets.

<doc id="155761" wikidata="Q584017" url="?curid=155761" title="Staatskapelle Dresden">
<text>The Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden (), or Saxon State Orchestra Dresden, is one of the oldest orchestras in the world, created by order of Maurice, Elector of Saxony in 1548. Under communist East Germany and until 1992 it was called Staatskapelle Dresden; an earlier name was Kurfürstlich-Sächsische und Königlich-Polnische Kapelle, or Electoral Saxon and Royal Polish Orchestra. It is a constituent body of the Semper Opera House, along with two choruses and a ballet troupe, where it plays in the pit for opera and on a platform for its own concert series.

==History==
Heinrich Schütz was associated with the orchestra early in its existence. In the 19th century, Carl Maria von Weber and Richard Wagner each served as &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot;.

In the 20th century, Richard Strauss became closely associated with the orchestra as both conductor and composer, which premiered several of his works. Karl Böhm and Hans Vonk were notable among the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductors in that they served as chief conductors of both the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden and the State Opera simultaneously. Herbert Blomstedt was musical director of the Staatskapelle from 1975 to 1985, and now has the title of &quot;Ehrendirigent&quot; (honorary conductor) with the orchestra. Hiroshi Wakasugi had served as a regular conductor with the orchestra since 1982, and was elected as the successor to Hans Vonk, but the reunification of West Germany and East Germany caused the contract to be annulled.

Giuseppe Sinopoli was chief conductor from 1992 until his sudden death in 2001. Bernard Haitink replaced him in August 2002, but resigned in 2004 over disputes with the Staatskapelle&#x27;s &quot;Intendant&quot;, Gerd Uecker, on the orchestra&#x27;s choice of successor. In August 2007 Fabio Luisi began his tenure as chief conductor after having been appointed as far back as January 2004. He shared with Böhm and Vonk the historic distinction of being chief conductor of both the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden and the Sächsische Staatsoper simultaneously. Luisi was scheduled to step down as chief conductor in 2012 in accord with the October 2009 announcement of Christian Thielemann as the orchestra&#x27;s next chief conductor, effective with the 2012–2013 season. However, Luisi resigned as chief conductor of the Staatskapelle in February 2010, effective immediately, after reports that the management had secured a contract with the ZDF network for a scheduled televised concert on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2011 without consulting him at all in his capacity as the orchestra&#x27;s GMD. Thielemann was initially contracted with the orchestra through 2019. In November 2017, the orchestra announced the extension of Thielemann&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through 31 July 2024. In May 2021, Barbara Klepsch, the Culture Minister of Saxony, announced that Thielemann is to conclude his tenure with the Staatskapelle Dresden at the close of his current contract, at the end of July 2024.

Sir Colin Davis held the title of &#x27;conductor laureate&#x27; from 1990 until his death in 2013, the first and only to-date conductor to be granted this title by the orchestra. The orchestra named Myung-Whun Chung as its first-ever principal guest conductor, effective as of the 2012–2013 season.

In 2007, the orchestra inaugurated the post of &quot;Capell-Compositeur&quot; or composer-in-residence, with each appointed composer installed for one concert season. The first &quot;Capell-Compositeur&quot; was Isabel Mundry. Sofia Gubaidulina was &quot;Capell-Compositrice&quot; for the 2014–2015 and 2016–2017 seasons, the first composer to hold the title more than once. Arvo Pärt held the title of &quot;Capell-Compositeur&quot; for the 2017–2018 season. The orchestra featured Sinopoli as its &quot;Capell-Compostiteur&quot; for the 2020–2021 season as a posthumous tribute.

In April 2007, the European Cultural Foundation awarded the orchestra a prize &quot;zur Bewahrung des musikalischen Weltkulturerbes&quot; (for preservation of the world&#x27;s musical heritage&quot;). In June 2011, the orchestra was announced as the new resident orchestra of the Salzburg Easter Festival, as of 2013.

In 2000, Daniele Gatti first guest-conducted the orchestra. In June 2022, the orchestra announced its election of Gatti as its next chief conductor, effective in 2024.

The orchestra received the Herbert von Karajan Prize in 2022 and donated the prize money of 50,000 euros to the project Musaik – Grenzenlos musizieren.

<doc id="155763" wikidata="Q1989233" url="?curid=155763" title="Jack of Shadows">
<text>Jack of Shadows is a science fantasy novel by American author Roger Zelazny. It was serialized in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1971 and published in book form that same year. 

==Plot==
The novel is set in a world that is tidally locked. Thus one side of the planet is always in light, and the other in darkness. Science rules on the dayside, while magic holds sway in the night.

Powerful magical entities live on the night side of the planet, and for the most part the entities&#x27; magical powers emanate from distinct loci. Jack of Shadows (also known as Shadowjack), the main character, is unique among the magical beings in that he draws his power not from a physical location but from shadow itself. He is nearly incapacitated in complete light or complete darkness, but given access to even a small area of shadow, his potency is unmatched.

Jack&#x27;s only friend, the creature Morningstar, is punished by being trapped in stone at the edge of the night, to be released when dawn comes. His torso and head protrude from the rock, and he awaits the sun that will never rise.

Jack seeks &quot;The Key That Was Lost&quot;, Kolwynia. The Key itself and the consequences of its use parallel Jack&#x27;s progress in his own endeavors. Ultimately, the Key will be responsible for Jack&#x27;s salvation and his doom.

Fleeing the dark side, Jack gets access to a computer and uses it to recover Kolwynia. This makes him unbeatable, but not all-powerful. Having made a mess of ruling with his new powers, he seeks the advice of Morningstar, who advises him to destroy The Machine at the Heart of the World, which maintains the world&#x27;s stability, and set it rotating.

==Inspiration==
Zelazny intended the name, but not the titular character, as an homage to Jack Vance. In his introduction to the novel he mentioned that he tried to capture some of the exotic landscapes that are frequent in Vance&#x27;s work. Zelazny wrote it in first draft, with no rewrites. The novel was serialized in the &quot; Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1971 and published in book form that same year. It was nominated for a 1972 Hugo Award 

==Variant text==
The serialized version and the later book are slightly different. A copy-editing error garbled a conversation between Jack and Morningstar in chapter 6; the correct version appeared in the original magazine appearance and has been reprinted on pages 511–512 of &quot;The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain&quot;, NESFA Press, 2009.

==Reception==
Lester del Rey received the novel unfavorably, noting that while the opening half was &quot;minor Zelazny, quite enjoyable&quot;, the conclusion was &quot;rather grim and ugly…[ultimately] dull&quot;. He concluded that, with the essentials of the hero&#x27;s biography left unrevealed, &quot;the whole thing seems rather pointless&quot;. 

Reader response was largely favorable, as evidenced by the fact that the novel was nominated for two major speculative fiction awards (the Hugo Award and the Locus Award). The novel finished #4 in the 1972 Locus Poll for Best Novel.

==Related fiction==
Zelazny was pressured by fans to write a sequel but he declined, saying “I didn’t really intend to continue that one. I liked ending it with that sort of ambiguous ending.” Instead, he wrote several prequels.

&quot;The Illustrated Roger Zelazny&quot; includes a prequel short story, &quot;Shadowjack&quot;, illustrated by Gray Morrow. Zelazny&#x27;s collection &quot;The Last Defender of Camelot&quot; (1981, Underwood-Miller) reprints the tale &quot;Shadowjack&quot; but without the illustrations. This was in the Underwood-Miller edition of the collection, but not the Pocket Books version. It also appears in &quot;Last Exit to Babylon: Volume 4: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny&quot;, NESFA Press, 2009.

&quot;Wizards&quot;, edited by Bill Fawcett in 1983, contains the character biography entitled &quot;Shadowjack&quot;, written by Roger Zelazny and including details aspects of the character&#x27;s history that were not in the novel or in the short story of the same name. It has also been reprinted in &quot;Last Exit to Babylon&quot;.

&quot;Shadowland&quot; was another prequel, written by Zelazny as the outline for an unproduced animated movie. It takes place prior to events of the novel and the short story, and describes how the strange half magic/half science world of Jack of Shadows came into existence. It was later developed and in production as a graphic novel before Zelazny died but the project was abandoned. The story first appears in &quot;The Road to Amber: Volume 6: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny&quot;, NESFA Press, 2009.

==Allusions and references in other works==
A song, &quot;Jack of Shadows&quot;, based on the novel and written by then-current Hawkwind members Dave Brock, Robert Calvert, Simon King and Simon House, appears on the 1979 album &quot;PXR5&quot;.

In Daniel Keys Moran’s novel &quot;The Long Run&quot;, the protagonist Trent Castanaveras is rescued from a low Lunar orbit by a stealth spacecraft from the Spacefarers Collective called &quot;Jack of Shadows&quot;.

*Hugo Award nominee, 1972
*Locus Award nominee, 1972

<doc id="155764" wikidata="Q153643" url="?curid=155764" title="Heinrich Schütz">
<text>Heinrich Schütz (; 6 November 1672) was a German early Baroque composer and organist, generally regarded as the most important German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach and one of the most important composers of the 17th century. He is credited with bringing the Italian style to Germany and continuing its evolution from the Renaissance into the early Baroque. Most of his surviving music was written for the Lutheran church, primarily for the Electoral Chapel in Dresden. He wrote what is traditionally considered the first German opera, &quot;Dafne&quot;, performed at Torgau in 1627, the music of which has since been lost, along with nearly all of his ceremonial and theatrical scores. Schütz was a prolific composer, with more than 500 surviving works.

He is commemorated as a musician in the Calendar of Saints of some North American Lutheran churches on 28 July with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.

==Early life and education==

Schütz was born in Köstritz, the eldest son of Christoph Schütz and Euphrosyne Bieger.

In 1590 the family moved to Weißenfels, where his father managed the inn &quot;Zum güldenen Ring&quot;. His father eventually served as burgomaster in Weißenfels, and in 1615 purchased another inn known as both &quot;Zur güldenen Sackpfeife&quot; and &quot;Zum güldenen Esel&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Zum Schützen&quot;.

While Schütz was living with his parents, his musical talents were discovered by Landgrave Moritz von Hessen-Kassel in 1598 during an overnight stay in Christoph Schütz&#x27;s inn. Upon hearing young Heinrich sing, the landgrave requested that his parents allow the boy to be sent to his noble court for further education and instruction. His parents initially resisted the offer, but after much correspondence they took Heinrich to the landgrave&#x27;s seat at Kassel in August 1599.

After being a choirboy, Schütz studied law at Marburg before going to Venice from 1609 to 1612 to study music with Giovanni Gabrieli. Gabrieli is the only person Schütz ever called his teacher. He inherited a ring from Gabrieli shortly before the latter&#x27;s death. He was subsequently organist at Kassel from 1613 to 1615.

==Career==
After a prolonged negotiation between the landgrave and the elector, Schütz moved to Dresden in 1615 to work as court composer to the Elector of Saxony. In 1619 Schütz married Magdalena Wildeck (born 1601). She bore two daughters before her death in 1625: Anna Justina in 1621 and Euphrosyne in 1623.

In Dresden Schütz sowed the seeds of what is now the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, but left there on several occasions; in 1628 he went to Venice again, where he may have met Claudio Monteverdi. In 1633 he was invited to Copenhagen to compose the music for wedding festivities there, returning to Dresden in 1635. He again conducted an extended visit to Denmark in 1641, due to the devastation of the Electoral court. The Thirty Years&#x27; War ended in 1648, and he again became more active in Dresden. In 1655, the year his daughter Euphrosyne died, he accepted an &quot;ex officio&quot; post as Kapellmeister at Wolfenbüttel.

Schütz&#x27;s Dresden compositions during the Thirty Years&#x27; War were, by necessity of the times, smaller-scale than the often massive earlier works; this period produced much of his most charming music. After the war, Schütz again wrote larger-scale compositions culminating in the 1660s, when he composed the greatest Passionmusic before Bach.

His pupils included Heinrich Albert, Christoph Bernhard, Anton Colander, Constantin Christian Dedekind, Carlo Farina, Johann Wilhelm Furchheim, Johann Kaspar Horn, Caspar Kittel, Christoph Kittel, Johann Klemm, Adam Krieger, Johann Jakob Loewe (or Löwe), Johann Nauwach, David Pohle, Philipp Stolle, Johann Theile, Clemens Thieme, Johann Vierdanck, Matthias Weckmann, Friedrich Werner, and Friedrich von Westhoff. ()

==Later life==
Schütz moved back to Weißenfels, in a retirement he had to beg for, to live with his sister (the house is now a museum of his life), but the Electoral Court often called him back to Dresden. He died in Dresden of a stroke in 1672 at age 87. He was buried in the old Dresden Frauenkirche, but his tomb was destroyed in 1727 when the church was torn down to build the new Dresden Frauenkirche. (His longtime house on the same square has been reconstructed in the same style and is an apartment building with hotel rooms and a restaurant.)

==Style==
Schütz&#x27;s compositions show the influence of Gabrieli (most notably in Schütz&#x27;s use of polychoral and concertato styles) and Monteverdi. The influence of the Netherlandish composers of the 16th century is also prominent in his work. His best-known works are sacred, ranging from solo voice with instrumental accompaniment to a cappella choral music. Representative works include his Psalmen Davids&quot; (Psalms of David, Opus 2), Cantiones sacrae&quot; (Opus 4), three books of &quot;Symphoniae sacrae&quot;, &quot;Die sieben Worte Jesu Christi am Kreuz&quot; (&quot;The seven words of Jesus Christ on the Cross&quot;), three Passion settings, and the Christmas Story. Schütz&#x27;s music, while in the most progressive styles early in his career, eventually grew simple and almost austere, culminating in his late Passion settings. Practical considerations were certainly responsible for part of this change: the Thirty Years&#x27; War devastated Germany&#x27;s musical infrastructure, and it was no longer practical or even possible to put on the gigantic works in the Venetian style of his earlier period.

Schütz&#x27;s composition &quot;Es steh Gott auf&quot; (SWV 356) is in many respects comparable to Monteverdi. His funeral music &quot;Musikalische Exequien&quot; (1636) for his noble friend Heinrich Posthumus of Reuss is considered a masterpiece, and is known today as the first German Requiem. Schütz was equally fluent in Latin and Germanic styles.

Schütz was one of the last composers to write in a modal style. His harmonies often result from the contrapuntal alignment of voices rather than from any sense of &quot;harmonic motion&quot;; contrastingly, much of his music shows a strong tonal pull when approaching cadences. His music includes a great deal of imitation, but structured in such a way that the successive voices do not necessarily enter after the same number of beats or at predictable intervallic distances. This contrasts sharply with the manner of his contemporary Johann Hermann Schein and Samuel Scheidt, whose counterpoint usually flows in regularly spaced entries. Schütz&#x27;s writing often includes intense dissonances caused by the contrapuntal motion of voices moving in correct individual linear motion but resulting in startling harmonies. Above all, his music displays extreme sensitivity to the accents and meaning of the text, which is often conveyed using special technical figures drawn from &quot;musica poetica&quot;, themselves drawn from or created in analogy to the verbal figures of classical rhetoric. As noted above, Schütz&#x27;s style became simpler in his later works, which make less frequent use of the kind of distantly related chords and licences found in such pieces as &quot;Was hast du verwirket&quot; (SWV 307) from &quot;Kleine geistliche Konzerte II&quot;.

Beyond the early book of madrigals, almost no secular music by Schütz has survived, save for a few domestic songs (&quot;arien&quot;) and occasional commemorative items (such as &quot;Wie wenn der Adler sich aus seiner Klippe schwingt&quot; (SWV 434), and no purely instrumental music at all (unless one counts the short instrumental movement, &quot;sinfonia&quot;, that encloses the dialogue of &quot;Die sieben Worte&quot;), even though he had a reputation as one of Germany&#x27;s finest organists.

Schütz was of great importance in bringing new musical ideas to Germany from Italy, and thus had a large influence on the German music which was to follow. The style of the North German organ school derives largely from Schütz (as well as from the Dutchman Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck); a century later this music culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. After Bach, the most important composers Schütz influenced were Anton Webern and Brahms, who studied his work.

==Works==

The following are major published works; most of these contain multiple pieces of music; single published works are also listed in the complete work list, including major works such as the &quot;Seven Last Words&quot;, and the Passions (according to Matthew, Luke, and John). Over 500 individual pieces by Schütz survive.

<doc id="155770" wikidata="Q4775105" url="?curid=155770" title="Antiphonitis">
<text>Antiphonitis – more correctly the Church of Christ Antiphonitis (Χριστός Ἀντιφωνητής) – is a domed church in Cyprus, in Kyrenia District, located in the mountains near the village of Kalograia. It is reached from the network of tracks and small roads in the area of the Herbarium and Agios Amvrosios. It is under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Northern Cyprus.

The name Christ Antiphonitis means &quot;Christ who responds&quot; and a number of Greek churches are so designated. The epithet appears to derive from a miraculous icon of some kind which responded to prayers, but no account of this icon in Cyprus is known. The name is testified in the late medieval period. Writing in the sixteenth century, Stefano Lusignan in his &quot;Description de toute l&#x27;isle de Cypre&quot; (Paris, 1580) recalls that &quot;Antifoniti&quot; was a fief belonging to his family, that his maternal grandmother Isabella Perez Fabricius founded the monastery of &quot;Antifonite&quot; and that his brother John (who had become a monk under the name Hilarion) died there.

==Architecture==
The church—built on the site of a natural spring at the head of a valley—was constructed in the twelfth century and belonged originally to a Greek Orthodox monastery. It consists of a single building with a spacious dome carried on eight pillars and is the only surviving example of this type in Cyprus. A ruined and partly restored example is in Saint Hilarion Castle and there was once a similar church at the centre of the Monastery of St. John Chrysostomos at Koutsovendis before the church there was rebuilt at the end of the nineteenth century. The narthex on the western side and the arcade on the south were added a later time, probably in the fifteenth century when the building was under the Latin church. The irregular shape of the dome is perhaps due to damaged sustained during the 1222 Cyprus earthquake.

==Paintings==
The Church of Christ Antiphonitis is notable for the array of frescoes on the walls and on the pillars. The oldest paintings belong to the end of the twelfth century and are thought to be a local interpretation of the style of the late Comnenian period as it appears at Panagia tou Arakou at Lagoudera.

When first studied, the Virgin Mary and prelates in the apse were damaged, but the saints in the sanctuary were well preserved. Early painting also include decons, martyrs and stylites. There was a Baptism on the south-west pillar of the nave. 
The remaining paintings are later in date and belong to the 1400s. They are executed in a post-Byzantine local revival style. On the south wall was a Tree of Jesse, and on the north an elaborate Last Judgement or Μέλλουσα Κρίση. In the dome is Christ Pantocrator surround by angels. A. and J. Stylianou report that the paintings of the dome were already &quot;badly damaged&quot; at the time of their studies in the 1960s and 1970s.

The paintings in the narthex are faded due to sunlight, but include a notably large depiction of St. George.

Some time after 1975, some of the fresco paintings were stolen and sold on the international art market. The Last Judgement has been badly damaged, and the heads of the twelfth-century angels in the apse damaged and partly removed. The Tree of Jesse has also been removed.

==Iconostasis and icons==
Writing in the 1930s, Rupert Gunnis noted the iconostasis painted in blue and gold, the doors of which are dated 1650, thus during the reign of Mehmed IV when the tax burden appears to have been lightened. The majority of the icons were of the seventeenth century with one of the Archangel Michael dated 1659.

The iconostasis was removed after 1975 and some individual icons panels from it were found with a private collector in the Netherlands. The Government of Cyprus engaged in legal action to secure their restitution. Four icons were repatriated in September, 2013. Separately, an icon from the church showing the Virgin Mary and dating to the fifteenth century was located in Athens and returned to Cyprus on 14 September 1998.

==Graffiti==
The church is notable for the graffiti and pilgrim records scratched into the lower frescoes during the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They are predominantly in Greek but a few are also in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet. They are unique documents of popular history, telling us about the ordinary Cypriots who visited the building. Among the dates visible are 1803, 1888, 1891, 1896, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1910, 1911, 1919, 1930 and 1958.

==Jurisdiction==
In the 1930s, the Church of Christ Antiphonitis was the property of Kykkos Monastery.

Presently it is classed as a museum and appears in the List of museums in Northern Cyprus.

Antiphonitis monastery (Ιερά Μονή Αρχαγγέλου Αντιφωνητού) is listed as monastery of Church of Cyprus on its official website.

<text>Jean-Louis Xavier Trintignant (; 11 December 1930 – 17 June 2022) was a French actor. He made his theatrical debut in 1951, and went on to be regarded as one of the best French dramatic actors of the post-war era. He starred in many classic films of European cinema, and worked with many prominent auteur directors, including Roger Vadim, Costa-Gavras, Claude Lelouch, Claude Chabrol, Bernardo Bertolucci, Éric Rohmer, François Truffaut, Krzysztof Kieślowski, and Michael Haneke.

He made a critical and commercial breakthrough in &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956), followed by a starmaking romantic turn in &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (1966). He won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 1968 Berlin International Film Festival for his performance in &quot;The Man Who Lies&quot; and the Best Actor Award at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot;. Trintignant&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;The Great Silence&quot; (1968), &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; (1969), &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970), &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot; (1994), and &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995). He won the 2013 César Award for Best Actor for his role in Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Amour&quot;.

==Early life==
Trintignant was born on 11 December 1930 in Piolenc, Vaucluse. He had a brother four years older. During World War II, his father joined the resistance against the Nazi regime by aiding Jews, and his mother began an affair with Nazi officer. This horizontal collaboration affected Jean Louis his entire life.

He grew up with the intention of studying law, but he soon discovered an interest in acting and moved to Paris at the age of 20 to study drama, making his theatrical debut in 1951.

== Career ==
After touring in the early 1950s in several theater productions, his first motion picture appearance came in 1955, and the following year he gained stardom with his performance opposite Brigitte Bardot in Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;. Trintignant&#x27;s acting was interrupted for several years by mandatory military service. After serving in Algiers, he returned to Paris and resumed his work in film. He had the leading male role in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s film &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (&quot;Un homme et une femme&quot;, 1966), which was the most commercially successful French film internationally for some years.

In Italy, he was always dubbed into Italian, and he worked with Italian directors including Sergio Corbucci in &quot;The Great Silence&quot;, Valerio Zurlini in &quot;Violent Summer&quot; and &quot;The Desert of the Tartars&quot;, Ettore Scola in &quot;La terrazza&quot;, Bernardo Bertolucci in &quot;The Conformist&quot;, and Dino Risi in &quot;The Easy Life&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s, Trintignant starred in many films, including the English-language films &quot;The Outside Man&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Under Fire&quot; in 1983. Following this, he starred in François Truffaut&#x27;s final film, &quot;Confidentially Yours&quot;, and reprised his best-known role in the sequel &quot;A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later&quot; (&quot;Un homme et une femme, 20 ans dejà&quot;, 1986).

In 1994, he starred in Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s final film, &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot;. For the remainder of his career, he took an occasional film role but focused on stage work. After a 14-year gap, Trintignant came back to the screen for Michael Haneke&#x27;s film &quot;Amour&quot;. Haneke sent Trintignant the screenplay, which had been written specifically for him. Trintignant said he chose film projects on the basis of the director and said of Haneke that &quot;he has the most complete mastery of the cinematic discipline, from technical aspects like sound and photography to the way he handles actors&quot;. He worked with Haneke again in 2017 when he starred in &quot;Happy End&quot;.

On 20 July 2018, Trintignant announced his retirement from cinema, but, in March 2019, he accepted a role in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s film &quot;The Best Years of a Life&quot; (&quot;Les plus belles annees d&#x27;une vie&quot;), a follow-up to &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; and its sequel &quot;A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Trintignant came from a wealthy family. He was the nephew of racecar driver Louis Trintignant, who was killed in 1933 while practising on the Péronne racetrack in Picardy. Another uncle, Maurice Trintignant (1917–2005), was a Formula One driver who twice won the Monaco Grand Prix as well as the 24 hours of Le Mans. Jean-Louis himself was an enthusiastic amateur rally driver and competed in a number of high-level rallies in the 1970s and 1980s, including several rounds of the World Rally Championship; he finished first in his class in the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. Raised in and around automobile racing, Trintignant was the natural choice of film director Claude Lelouch for the starring role of a racecar driver in the 1966 film &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;. He suffered a leg injury from a motorbike accident in June 2007.

His first wife was actress Stéphane Audran. His second wife, Nadine Marquand, was an actress, screenwriter, and director. They had three children: Vincent, Pauline (who died of crib death in 1969), and Marie Trintignant (21 January 1962 – 1 August 2003). At age 17 Marie performed in &quot;La terrazza&quot; alongside her father and later became a successful actress. She was killed at age 41 by her boyfriend, rock musician Bertrand Cantat, in a hotel room in Vilnius, Lithuania.

In 2018, Trintignant announced that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and would not be seeking treatment. In November 2021, it was reported that he was gradually losing his sight and was in declining health. Trintignant died at his home on 17 June 2022, at the age of 91.

<text>Suggestibility is the quality of being inclined to accept and act on the suggestions of others. One may fill in gaps in certain memories with false information given by another when recalling a scenario or moment. Suggestibility uses cues to distort recollection: when the subject has been persistently told something about a past event, his or her memory of the event conforms to the repeated message.

A person experiencing intense emotions tends to be more receptive to ideas and therefore more suggestible. Generally, suggestibility decreases as age increases. However, psychologists have found that individual levels of self-esteem and assertiveness can make some people more suggestible than others; this finding led to the concept of a spectrum of suggestibility.

==Definition==
Attempts to isolate a global trait of &quot;suggestibility&quot; have not been successful, due to an inability of the available testing procedures to distinguish measurable differences between the following distinct types of &quot;suggestibility&quot;:
*To be affected by a communication or expectation such that certain responses are overtly enacted, or subjectively experienced, without volition, as in automatism.
*Deliberately to use one&#x27;s imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects (even if interpreted, eventually, as involuntary) in response to a communication or expectation.
*To accept what people say consciously, but uncritically, and to believe or privately accept what is said.
*To conform overtly to expectations or the views of others, without the appropriate private acceptance or experience; that is, to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief.

Wagstaff&#x27;s view is that, because &quot;a true response to [a hypnotic] suggestion is not a response brought about at any stage by volition, but rather a true non-volitional response, [and] perhaps even brought about despite volition&quot;, the first category really embodies the true domain of hypnotic suggestibility.

Self-report measures of suggestibility became available in 2004, and they made it possible to isolate and study the global trait.

== Examples ==
Suggestibility can be seen in people&#x27;s day-to-day lives:
* Someone witnesses an argument after school. When later asked about the &quot;huge fight&quot; that occurred, he recalls the memory, but unknowingly distorts it with exaggerated fabrications, because he now thinks of the event as a &quot;huge fight&quot; instead of a simple argument.
* Children are told by their parents they are good singers, so from then on they believe they are talented while their parents were in fact being falsely encouraging.
* A teacher could trick his AP Psychology students by saying, &quot;Suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation, right?&quot; It is likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he is a teacher and what he said sounds correct. However, the term is really the definition of the misinformation effect.
However, suggestibility can also be seen in extremes, resulting in negative consequences:
* A witness&#x27; testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview, which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories.
* A young girl begins suffering migraines which lead to sleep deprivation and depression. Her therapist, a specialist in cases involving child abuse, repeatedly asks her whether her father had sexually abused her. This suggestion causes the young girl to fabricate memories of her father molesting her, which lead to her being placed in foster care and her father being tried on charges of abuse.

==Hypnosis==

Hypnotic suggestibility is an individual trait reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions. Research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable.

The extent to which a subject may or may not be &quot;suggestible&quot; has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena. Most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility or that is, the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs, expectations and is a factor in inducing useful hypnotic states.

Dr. John Kappas (1925–2002) identified three different types of suggestibility in his lifetime that have improved hypnosis:

Emotional suggestibility – A suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to inferred suggestions that affect emotions and restrict physical body responses; usually associated with hypnoidal depth. Thus the emotional suggestible learns more by inference than by direct, literal suggestions.

Physical suggestibility – A suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body, and restriction of emotional responses; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper.

Intellectual suggestibility – The type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze, reject or rationalize everything the operator says. With this type of subject the operator must give logical explanations for every suggestion and must allow the subject to feel that he is doing the hypnotizing himself.

However, it is not clear or agreed what suggestibility (i.e., the factor on hypnosis) actually is. It is both the indisputable variable and the factor most difficult to measure or control.

What has not been agreed on is whether suggestibility is:
* a permanent fixed detail of character or personality;
* a genetic or chemical psychiatric tendency;
* a precursor to or symptom of an activation of such a tendency;
* a learned skill or acquired habit;
* synonymous with the function of learning;
* a neutral, unavoidable consequence of language acquisition and empathy;
* a biased terminology provoking one to resist new externally introduced ideas or perspectives;
* a mutual symbiotic relation to the Other, such as the African conception of uBunthu or Ubuntu;
* related to the capacity of empathy and communication;
* a matter of concordant personal taste between speaker and hypnotist, and between listener and listener&#x27;s like of, or use for, speaker&#x27;s ideas;
* a skill or a flaw or something neutral and universal.

Conceptually, hypnotizability has always been defined as the increase in suggestibility produced by hypnosis. In practice, hypnotizability is measured as suggestibility following a hypnotic induction. The data indicates that these are different constructs. Although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree, the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales. This indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability.

Existing research into the phenomena of hypnosis is extensive and randomized controlled trials predominantly support the efficacy and legitimacy of hypnotherapy, but without a clearly defined concept of the entity or aspect being studied, the level an individual is objectively &quot;suggestible&quot; cannot be measured empirically, and makes exact therapeutic outcomes impossible to forecast.

Moreover, it logically hinders the development of non-bespoke hypnotherapy protocol. On this latter point, it must be pointed out that while some persuasion methods are more universally effective than others, the most reliably effective method with individuals is to personalize the approach by first examining clients&#x27; motivational, learning, behavioral, and emotional styles, among others. Indeed, few hypnotherapists will not make taking case history from the clients they will be working with priority.

===Autonomy===
The intrigue of differences in individual suggestibility even crops up in the early Greek philosophers. Aristotle had an unconcerned approach:

This perhaps is a more accurate echo of the experience of practicing hypnotherapists and hypnotists. When anyone is absorbed in someone else&#x27;s inspiring words as they outline an idea or way of thinking, the subjective attention is held because of the logic, the aesthetic, and the relevance of the words to one&#x27;s own personal experience and motivations. In these natural trance states, like those orchestrated purposefully by a hypnotherapist, the &#x27;critical faculties&#x27; are naturally less active when there is less to be naturally critical of.

It is perhaps the &quot;necessarily believing it&quot; part of the Aristotelian quote above that is problematic, as this conception of suggestibility raises issues pertaining to the autonomy of attributing belief to an introduced idea, and how this comes to take place.

===Susceptibility===

Popular media and layman&#x27;s articles occasionally use the terms &quot;suggestible&quot; and &quot;susceptible&quot; interchangeably, with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another. The two terms are not synonymous, however, as the latter term carries inherent negative bias absent from the neutral psychological factor described by &quot;suggestibility&quot;.

In scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy, the term &quot;suggestibility&quot; describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena. This is distinct from the culturally biased common parlance of the term &quot;suggestible&quot;. The term &quot;susceptible&quot; implies weakness or some increased danger to which one is more likely to become a victim. It therefore has a negative effect on expectation and itself is a hypnotic suggestion that suggestions must be noticed and guarded against. Both terms are often bound with undeserved negative social connotations not inherent in the word meanings themselves.

To be suggestible is not to be gullible. The latter pertains to an empirical objective fact that can be shown accurate or inaccurate to any observer; the former term does not. To be open to suggestion has no bearing on the accuracy of any incoming suggestions, nor whether such an objective accuracy is possible, as is the case with metaphysical belief.

Some therapists may examine worries or objections to suggestibility before proceeding with therapy: this is because some believe there is a rational or learned deliberate will to hold a belief, even in the case of more convincing new ideas, when there is a compelling cognitive reason not to &#x27;allow oneself&#x27; to be persuaded. Perhaps this can be seen in historical cases of mass hypnosis where also there has been media suppression. In the individual, unexamined actions are sometimes described by hypno- and psycho-therapists based on outgrown belief systems.

Hypnotic suggestions include terms, phrases, or whole concepts where to understand the concept includes making sense of a subjective sensation, or a framework for the appropriate response... simple one-word forms of this include the word terrorism where to understand the concept, one must understand the notion of terror and then understand in the sentence that it is meant to refer to &quot;that&quot; given object.

===Language acquisition===

Cognition of a phrase must occur before the decision how to act next can occur: because the concepts must exist before the mind. Either they are suggested from the mind itself, or in response to introduced suggestions of concepts from outside – the world and its scenarios and facts, or suggestions from other people.

A suggestion may direct the thoughts to notice a new concept, focus on a specific area within the world, offer new perspectives that later may influence action-choices, offer triggers for automatic behavior (such as returning a smile), or indicate specific action types. In hypnotherapy the portrayed realistic experience of the client&#x27;s requested outcome is suggested with flattery or urgency, as well as personalized to the client&#x27;s own motivations, drives, and tastes.

===Common experience of suggestions===

Suggestions are not necessarily verbal, spoken, or read. A smile, a glare, a wink, a three-piece suit, a scientist&#x27;s white coat, are all suggestive devices that imply more than the immediate action. A hypnotist uses techniques that use these instinctive &quot;fillings-in of gaps&quot; and changes to how we respond to a scenario or moment. In the therapy setting, a hypnotist or hypnotherapist will likely evaluate these automatic cognitive leaps, or dogma, or any self-limiting or self-sabotaging beliefs.

Being under the influence of suggestion can be characterized as exhibiting behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief.
That is, actions being inconsistent with one&#x27;s own volition and belief system and natural unhindered action-motivations. This could hinder the autonomy, expression or self-determination of an individual. It could equally supersede emotions with rationally chosen, deliberate long-term results.

===Experimental vs. clinical===
The applications of hypnosis vary widely and investigation of responses to suggestion can be usefully separated into two non-exclusive broad divisions:
* Experimental hypnosis: the study of &quot;experimental suggestion&quot;, of the form:
::&quot;What is it that my group of test subjects actually do when I deliver the precise standard suggestion ABC to each of them in the same experimental context?&quot;
:: (i.e., given a fixed suggestion, what is the outcome?)

* Clinical hypnosis: the study of clinical suggestion directed at the question:
::&quot;What is it that I can possibly say to this particular subject, in this specific context, to generate my goal of having them do XYZ?&quot; (I.e., given a fixed outcome, what is the suggestion?)

==Non-state explanations of hypnotic responsiveness==
According to some theoretical explanations of hypnotic responses, such as the role-playing theory of Nicholas Spanos, hypnotic subjects do not actually enter a different psychological or physiological state; but, rather, simply acting on social pressure – and, therefore, it is easier for them to comply than to disobey. Whilst this view does not dispute that hypnotized individuals truly experience the suggested effects, it asserts that the mechanism this takes place by has, in part, been &quot;socially constructed&quot; and does not, therefore, require any explanation involving any sort of an &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot;.

==Child==
Children have developing minds that are constantly being filled with new information from sources all around them. This predisposes children towards higher levels of suggestibility, and as such children are an important area of suggestibility investigation. Researchers have identified key factors, both internal and external, that are strong markers for suggestibility in children.

===Internal===
*Age: Children have a remarkable ability to remember events in their lives. The real variability between ages in suggestibility is the amount of detail provided for an event. Memory detail will be great for older children. Some younger children may need help recalling past events with the help of an adult. The problem as it relates to suggestibility is when children, and even adults, blend previous knowledge of similar experiences into their recollection of a single event. Children, particularly younger children, are prone to including details that are similar yet unrelated to the specific event showing that the age of a person is critical in their susceptibility to influence.
*Prior knowledge: As mentioned before, the possession of prior knowledge that relates to an event can be particularly dangerous when dealing with child suggestibility. Prior knowledge, as it relates to suggestibility is the use of past experiences to help reconstruct past or current events. Prior knowledge of an event can actually be effective at producing accurate recall of a particular situation, but can also be equally as effective at producing false memories. Research showed that when presented with a previously familiar situation, children were likely to falsely recall events as if they had happened.
*Gist extraction: Although children are extremely likely to recall false memories when past events are similar to a current event, they will also recall false memory details that are seemingly unrelated to the event. Researchers named this phenomenon global gist, which is a representation that identifies connections across multiple events. Children will falsely recall information that fits with their representation of the events around them.

===External===
*Interviewer bias: Interviewer bias is the opinion or prejudice on the part of an interviewer, which is displayed during the interview process and thus affects the outcome of the interview. This happens when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. Interviewer bias is commonly experienced when extracting information from children.
*Repeated questions: It has been shown that asking children the same question over and over again in an interview will often cause the child to reverse their first answer, especially in yes or no questions. It is the child&#x27;s belief that since the question is being repeated that they must have not answered correctly and need to change their answer.
*Interviewer&#x27;s tone: Children are extremely perceptive of people&#x27;s tones, especially in an interview situation. When an interviewer&#x27;s tone dictates the questioning, a child is likely to construct memories of past events when they actually have no memory of that event. An example would be that when a positive tone is used, it has shown to produce more detailed accounts of events. However, it has also been shown to produce false information intended to appease the interviewer.
*Peer interactions: Children&#x27;s accounts of events can be greatly distorted by information from their peers. In some cases, children who were not present for an event will later recall witnessing the event as well as details about the event. This information come from hearing about the event as described by their peers. These children may speak up in order to feel included.
*Repeating misinformation: Repeating misinformation is simply when an interviewer gives a child incorrect details of an event. This technique is used over several interviews and occurs several times within a single interview. It has been shown to have a great effect on the accuracy of a child&#x27;s recollection of an event, and eventually, the misinformation will be included in the child&#x27;s account of a given event.

=== Extreme events ===
In extreme events such as sexual abuse, extreme anxiety or mistreatment, children can in fact be greatly subjected to suggestibility. It is possible that a child may recall something that didn&#x27;t actually happen or they are so traumatized that they do not want to think about what actually happened.

Little research has been carried out into the effects of anxious mood at the time of either the encoding of misleading post‐event information or the time of its possible retrieval, on subsequent suggestibility. Memory accuracy for non‐suggestible items was unaffected by the anxious mood induction. With respect to suggestibility, there was a strong effect of misleading information. This is just one example of how a highly emotional situation such as an anxiety attack can create suggestibility misconception.

Another example of research is that memory, suggestibility, stress arousal, and trauma-related psychopathology were examined in 328 3- to 16-year-olds involved in forensic investigations of abuse and neglect. Children&#x27;s memory and suggestibility were assessed for a medical examination and venipuncture. Being older and scoring higher in cognitive functioning were related to fewer inaccuracies. In addition, cortisol level and trauma symptoms in children who reported more dissociative tendencies were associated with increased memory error. This again proves how a stressful or traumatic experience in young children can be affected by suggestibility.

==Other cases==
It is claimed that sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative identity disorder (DID) are particularly suggestible. While it is true that DID sufferers tend to score to the higher end of the hypnotizability scale, there have not been enough studies done to support the claim of increased suggestibility.

Aspects of crowd dynamics and mob behavior, as well as the phenomenon of groupthink are further examples of suggestibility.

Common examples of suggestible behavior in everyday life include &quot;contagious yawning&quot; (multiple people begin to yawn after observing a person yawning) and the medical student syndrome (a person begins to experience symptoms of an illness after reading or hearing about it). Placebo response is also thought to be based on individual differences in suggestibility, at least in part. Suggestible individuals may be more responsive to various forms of alternative health practices that seem to rely upon patient belief in the intervention more than on any known mechanism. Studies of effects of health interventions can be enhanced by controlling for individual differences in suggestibility. A search of the &quot;Mental Measurements Yearbook&quot; shows no extant psychological test for this personality characteristic. The Gudjonsson suggestibility scale is questionable for this kind of purpose due to its narrow focus. In addition to health-related implications, persons who are highly suggestible may be prone to making poor judgments because they did not process suggestions critically and falling prey to emotion-based advertising.

<text>Charles Manners-Sutton (né Manners; 17 February 1755 – 21 July 1828) was a British clergyman in the Church of England who served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1805 to 1828.

==Life==
Manners-Sutton was the fourth son of Lord George Manners-Sutton (third son of John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland) and his wife Diana Chaplin, daughter of Thomas Chaplin. His younger brother was Thomas Manners-Sutton, 1st Baron Manners, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His father, Lord George, had assumed the additional surname of Sutton in 1762 on inheriting – from his elder brother Lord Robert – the estates of their maternal grandfather Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton. He was called Charles Manners before 1762.

Manners-Sutton was educated at Charterhouse School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge (matriculated 1773, graduated B.A. as 15th wrangler 1777, M.A. 1780, D.D. 1792).

He married at age 23, and probably eloped with, his cousin Mary Thoroton, daughter of Thomas Thoroton and his wife Mary (Levett) Thoroton of Screveton Hall, Nottinghamshire, in 1778. (Col. Thomas Blackborne Thoroton later moved to Flintham Hall, Flintham, near Screveton, Nottinghamshire. He was later known as Thomas Thoroton Hildyard. Both Thoroton and his stepbrother Levett Blackborne, Esq., a Lincoln&#x27;s Inn barrister, had long acted as advisers to John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland, and Col. Thoroton was often resided at Belvoir Castle, the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Rutland.)

In 1785, Manners-Sutton was appointed to the family living at Averham with Kelham, in Nottinghamshire, and in 1791, became Dean of Peterborough. He was consecrated Bishop of Norwich in 1792, and two years later received the appointment of Dean of Windsor &quot;in commendam&quot;.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
He had long been the favourite candidate for Canterbury. In late January 1805 in a standup furore at Windsor Castle, the King was furious to find out that the Prime Minister was trying to interfere. Manners Sutton was nevertheless chosen to succeed John Moore as Archbishop of Canterbury. During his primacy, the old archepiscopal palace at Croydon was sold and the country palace of Addington was bought with the proceeds. He presided over the first meeting which issued in the foundation of the National Society, and subsequently lent the scheme his strong support. He also exerted himself to promote the establishment of the Indian episcopate. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Manners-Sutton appointed his cousin, Evelyn Levett Sutton, a chaplain to Lord Manners, as one of six preachers of Canterbury Cathedral in 1811.

In 1819, he presided over the christening of the future Queen Victoria at Kensington Palace.

He died at Lambeth on 21 July 1828, and was buried on 29 July at Addington, in a family vault.

==Works==
His only published works are two sermons, one preached before the Lords (London, 1794), the other before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (London, 1797).

==Family==

In 1778 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Thoroton of Screveton, Nottinghamshire, by whom he had a family of two sons and ten daughters. His son Charles Manners-Sutton served as Speaker of the House of Commons and was created Viscount Canterbury in 1835. His grandson Henry Manners Chichester by his daughter Isabella was a prolific contributor to the Dictionary of National Biography.

<doc id="155785" wikidata="Q869993" url="?curid=155785" title="A Goofy Movie">
<text>A Goofy Movie is a 1995 American animated musical comedy-adventure film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. Directed by Kevin Lima, the film is based on The Disney Afternoon television series &quot;Goof Troop&quot; created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza, and serves as a standalone spin-off to the show. Taking place three years after the events of &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, the film follows Goofy and his now teenage son Max as they embark on a misguided cross-country father-son fishing trip across the United States.

Disney came up with the idea to make a theatrical animated film starring Goofy while considering ideas for a potential &quot;Goof Troop&quot; TV special. Lima wanted to expand Goofy as a character and &quot;give him an emotional side&quot; that would resonate with audiences. The film features the voices of Bill Farmer, Jim Cummings, and Rob Paulsen reprising their roles from the series as Goofy, Pete, and P.J., respectively, while Jason Marsden replaces Dana Hill as Max, alongside Kellie Martin, Wallace Shawn, and Pauly Shore as new characters. Furthermore, R&amp;B artist Tevin Campbell provides the vocals for Powerline, a fictional pop star who prominently appears in the film, performing the songs &quot;Stand Out&quot; and &quot;I 2 I&quot;.

&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on April 7, 1995, by Walt Disney Pictures. Because the film had been greenlit by the recently fired Jeffrey Katzenberg, the film&#x27;s release was deemed by Disney to be a contractual obligation. Upon release, it received mixed reviews from critics and made a meager impression at the box office, grossing $37.6 million against an $18 million production cost. However, with its home media release, the film garnered a cult following and has become a more prominent property within Disney. A direct-to-video sequel to the film titled &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; was released on February 29, 2000.

==Plot==

Max Goof is an average teenager who pines after his classmate Roxanne, worships the pop star Powerline, and has a tense relationship with his clumsy, old-fashioned father Goofy, whom he fears turning into. On the last day of school before summer vacation, Max, with help from his friends P.J. and Bobby, hijacks a school assembly and dances while lip syncing to a Powerline song. The performance succeeds in making Max a school celebrity, and he invites Roxanne with him to a viewing party of a live broadcast of Powerline&#x27;s upcoming concert in Los Angeles.

Goofy, after school principal Mazur warns him about Max&#x27;s potential juvenile delinquency, immediately plans a fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho, to curb his son&#x27;s behavior. Max attempts to cancel his date with Roxanne, but panics and tells her that not only are he and Goofy traveling to Los Angeles to personally see the concert, but that Powerline has invited them onstage.

Goofy and Max hit the road, visiting a run-down possum-themed amusement park where Goofy embarrasses Max. The next day, they run into P.J. and his father Pete while camping. Goofy takes his son fishing and shows him the &quot;Perfect Cast&quot; fishing technique, accidentally luring Bigfoot to their camp and forcing Goofy and Max to spend the night in the car with Bigfoot outside. While Goofy sleeps, Max alters the map&#x27;s route to Los Angeles.

The next morning, Goofy makes Max the navigator of the trip, and the two enjoy several stops together. That night, while staying at the same motel, Pete overhears a conversation between Max and P.J. and informs Goofy that Max has tricked him into traveling to Los Angeles. Goofy still believes Max will do the right thing, but the next morning, Max chooses the route to California, and Goofy stops the car at the Grand Canyon and thumps away. With the brake loose, the car rolls away; Goofy and Max chase after it and end up riding the car down the Colorado River. After a brief argument, Goofy says no matter how old Max gets he will always be his son, and the two finally reconcile. After learning about Max&#x27;s promise to Roxanne, Goofy decides to take him to the concert. The two nearly plummet down a waterfall, but Max rescues Goofy using the Perfect Cast technique.

In Los Angeles, Goofy and Max arrive at the concert, sneak on to the stage, and dance with Powerline, delighting Roxanne. Max and Goofy return home in their barely-functioning car and Max tells Roxanne the truth; she admits she always liked him and they make plans to go out. The car explodes, ejecting Goofy right into the air and falling through the porch roof of Roxanne&#x27;s house, and Max proudly introduces his father to his new girlfriend.

==Voice cast==

* Bill Farmer as Goofy Goof, a hard-working, clumsy single father who is a photographer at a photo studio in a mall department store.

==Production==
&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; is based on &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, an animated Disney Afternoon show created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza Jr., that centered around Goofy and his son, Max. When considering ideas for a TV special, Disney decided to produce a theatrical film based on the show, contracting Jymn Magon to write a feature-length script starring Goofy. The filmmakers chose to age up Max, who was portrayed as an 11-year-old in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, setting the film several years later and putting him in high school. The movie was the feature film directorial debut for Disney story artist and animator Kevin Lima, who went on to direct the Disney films &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000) and &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007). In 1995, Lima said that &quot;Instead of just keeping Goofy one-dimensional as he&#x27;s been in the past, we wanted to give an emotional side that would add to the emotional arc of the story. We wanted the audience to see his feelings instead of just his antics.&quot; Magon stated that the father-son dynamic of the film was inspired by a story from then-Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in which he and his daughter—with whom he had an estranged relationship at the time—went on a road trip together, during which they bonded and their relationship considerably improved.

While the work was a Disney production, it was considered far less essential than the studio&#x27;s mainstream works at the time such as &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and was given a far smaller budget compared to these films. Thus, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was jointly produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation, Walt Disney Television Animation, and Disney MovieToons and with outsourcing to Walt Disney Animation France and Walt Disney Animation Australia, along with additional Disney animation studios in Spain and Canada. Pre-production was done at the main Feature Animation studio in Burbank, California, starting as early as mid-1993. The animation work was done at Walt Disney Animation France in Paris supervised by Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, with additional scenes animated at Disney&#x27;s studio in Sydney, Australia, under the direction of Steve Moore, and clean-up work done at the main Burbank studio. Additional clean-up/animation was done by Phoenix Animation Studios in Canada, and digitally inked-and-painted by the Pixibox studio in France. The film&#x27;s planned release on Thanksgiving 1994 was delayed due to the monitor that they were using to capture the film&#x27;s animation having a single dead pixel, forcing them to recapture three-quarters of the film again with a non-defective monitor.

Several of the main voice cast from &quot;Goof Troop&quot; reprise their roles in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, including Bill Farmer as Goofy, Jim Cummings as Pete, and Rob Paulsen as P.J.. Max, whose unchanged voice was provided by Dana Hill in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, is voiced by Jason Marsden when speaking and Aaron Lohr when singing. Early in production, Katzenberg originally wanted Steve Martin to voice Goofy. Katzenberg initially asked Farmer to give Goofy a regular speaking voice as opposed to the character&#x27;s signature, cartoonish voice, much to the confusion of Farmer, who insisted that audiences wanted to hear the Goofy they were all familiar with. After a week of recording lines like this, Michael Eisner and Roy E. Disney told Farmer to speak in Goofy&#x27;s regular voice. Farmer stated that he used a &quot;mental image&quot; of his five-year-old son at the time in order to fully embrace his role as a loving father. Magon named Principal Mazur after his own high-school principal. The character of Powerline was heavily inspired by real-life pop stars, including Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bobby Brown. R&amp;B artist Tevin Campbell provided the singing voice for Powerline, recording the songs &quot;Stand Out&quot; and &quot;I 2 I&quot;. Campbell recorded the songs in front of a green screen while performing his own choreography. The film is dedicated to Pat Buttram, who voiced the emcee at the possum park, as he died after finishing his voice work for the film.

==Music==
The score for &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was provided by Carter Burwell. Burwell was the primary composer; after he had recorded his score with Shirley Walker orchestrating and conducting, Don Davis was hired to rework his score rather than write a completely new one. Burwell later wrote: &quot;My score had relied somewhat on unusual instrumentation – banjo, percussion and choir for example – and Disney wanted the sweeping scale and familiar affect of symphonic score&quot;. Davis is credited with &quot;additional music&quot; on the movie and the soundtrack album. The songs &quot;I 2 I&quot; and &quot;Stand Out&quot; were performed by R&amp;B singer Tevin Campbell, while &quot;After Today&quot;, &quot;On the Open Road&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Else But You&quot; were performed by Bill Farmer and Aaron Lohr. The soundtrack album for &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was released by Walt Disney Records on March 18, 1995. Mitchel Musso covered the song &quot;Stand Out&quot; for the &quot;Disneymania 7&quot; album, which was released on March 9, 2010. Magnolia Park covered the song &quot;I 2 I&quot; for the Disney pop-punk cover album &quot;A Whole New Sound&quot;, which was released on September 6, 2024.

===Track listing===
==Release==
===Theatrical===
Within Disney, prior to &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;″s release, the film was frequently associated with Katzenberg, and by April 1995, Katzenberg had been let go by Disney&#x27;s CEO Michael Eisner due to tensions between them. The company saw the release of &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; as fulfilling contractual obligations. &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in theaters on November 18, 1994. In order to avoid competition between &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; and &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;, and due to production setbacks, the released date was moved to April 1995. &quot;The Lion King&quot; was reissued to fill in for the film&#x27;s absence.

The film&#x27;s world premiere took place on April 5, 1995, at the AMC Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, and was attended by director Kevin Lima and voice stars Bill Farmer and Jenna von Oÿ; two days later, it was released nationwide. The film played a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from August 25 through September 4, 2017.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS and LaserDisc by Walt Disney Home Video in the United States and Canada on September 6, 1995. The American VHS release included a music video for the Parachute Express song &quot;Doctor Looney&#x27;s Remedy&quot; on their video, &quot;Come Sing with Us&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it was released in theaters on October 18, 1996 (with the Mickey Mouse short &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; preceding it), and on VHS in 1997. It was reissued on June 20, 2000, along with a DVD version, as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection series. The DVD edition includes the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; episode &quot;Calling All Goofs&quot;, the episode &quot;The Goofy Success Story&quot; from the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television series, and a &quot;Disney-fied&quot; edit of Lou Bega&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;Mambo No. 5.&quot; Not counting &quot;Doug&#x27;s 1st Movie&quot; (which was produced in open matte full screen but was cropped to widescreen for theaters), &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; is the only Disney animated feature film produced in widescreen that has pan and scan-only Region 1 DVD releases. The movie was released on Blu-ray as a Disney Movie Club exclusive alongside &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; on April 23, 2019, with several contents edited to make it more fitting for the intended audiences.

A 4K HDR resolution version of the film was completed as an educational project by the team at The Bigger Pictures Film Restoration in June 2023. An early version of the tests utilized AI upscaling technology to patch low-resolution line art in select shots but were not utilized in the final version. The film was used as a sample reel showcasing the ability of the team to remove dead pixels, debris, and hair from the transfer that were found on the negative and interpositive - a byproduct of the experimental animation system used on the film. During production, a 35mm camera captured the digitally composited PEGS/Pixibox renders at a resolution approaching 2K. The Pixibox renders were displayed on a high-definition commercial-grade calibrated monitor which was filmed in 35mm using the successive exposure technique, one frame at a time. As this project was created for educational/demo purposes - the restoration is not planned for released to the public. A documentary showing clips and the restoration process is available on YouTube. &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; was re-released on Blu-ray on November 14, 2023, as part of the &quot;Disney Legacy Animated Film Collection&quot;, which consists of 100 titles from both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar as part of the 100th anniversary celebration of the Disney company.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; opened in 2,159 theaters at second place on its opening weekend with $6.1 million—held from the number one spot because of the Will Smith blockbuster &quot;Bad Boys&quot; that opened the same weekend, with $15.5 million in box office returns. It ultimately ended its run at the US box office grossing $35.3 million. Internationally it grossed $2.3 million, partially due to the fact the film was not released theatrically in most overseas territories, for a worldwide total of $37.6 million.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; holds an approval rating of 59% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; offers enough of its titular ingredient to satisfy younger viewers, even if most parents will agree that this beloved character deserves better.&quot; On Metacritic, the movie has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

====Contemporary====
In contemporaneous reviews, the film received mixed responses from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, noting that he only got to see a portion of the film in his initial viewing before a technical problem in the projection booth ended the screening early (somewhere between 35 and 40 minutes into the film, based on information given in his review — much less than the approximate hour he believed he had seen). He later clarified the film was worthy of three after viewing the entire film stating, “Three stars is about right.” In his one-star review from &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Louis Black said &quot;The movie appears to have forgotten that [...] it is an adolescent angst drama about his son Max&#x27;s ambivalent feelings about having Goofy as a dad. This is a story about a boy and a dad [...] it is bland, a barely television-length cartoon stretched out to fill a feature, and not much fun.&quot; Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Peter Stack summarized it as &quot;brutal&quot;, and said that &quot;there&#x27;s no denying that &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; can&#x27;t be a proud moment for Walt Disney Pictures.&quot; While the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; questioned the overall tone of the film, &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s Bob McCabe gave the movie three stars out of five and the following verdict: &quot;Harmless enough day in the sun for Goofy; pity there&#x27;s an overwhelming feeling throughout that he deserves better.&quot;

From &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the film&#x27;s story &quot;too rambling and emotionally diffuse for the title character to come fully alive.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy criticized the film&#x27;s score, and felt that the personality of Goofy&#x27;s character, while agreeable enough in support, proved a bit over the top for a headliner, and that &quot;by any reasonable reckoning, he&#x27;s distinctly overbearing and selfish, and responds with a bland dismissal to any opinion offered up by his son&quot;.

====Retrospective====
Since its release, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; has undergone critical reevaluation and is now appreciated as a &quot;true cult classic&quot;. In a 2020 editorial for Rotten Tomatoes, Rafael Matomayor wrote: &quot;Featuring a small-scale story that kids can see themselves in, an excellent portrayal of teenage life and father-son relationships, and, crucially, a soundtrack filled with earworms to rival the work of Rice and Menken, the movie has something for everyone.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media praised the low-key tone and humor of the film, concluding: &quot;Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.&quot; The Mary Sue’s Princess Weekes cited the soundtrack and story as to why the film &quot;remains a perfect father/son film&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for &quot;Best Animated Feature&quot; in the production categories and &quot;Best Production Design&quot;, &quot;Best Storyboarding&quot;, &quot;Best Music&quot;, and &quot;Best Animation&quot; in the individual categories at the 23rd Annie Awards.

==Legacy==
After its meager box office performance during its theatrical release, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; started to gain success in 1995 due to home media sales, and soon gained a cult following. The interest in the film is attributed to a combination of the film&#x27;s catchy soundtrack as well as its story of cross-generational connections between parents and children. The newfound interest led to waves of new merchandise based on the film to be sold at major retailers.

In the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003) Max works as a valet for the titular club, and in the episode &quot;Max&#x27;s Embarrassing Date&quot; (2002), Max has a date with Roxanne at the club. Jason Marsden reprises his role of Max for the series, while Kellie Martin was replaced by Grey DeLisle as the voice of Roxanne.

On August 14, 2015, a 20th-anniversary reunion for the film was held at the D23 Expo at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. Those in attendance included Bill Farmer, Marsden, Jim Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Jenna von Oÿ and producer Don Hahn. Video messages were sent by Wallace Shawn, Pauly Shore and director Kevin Lima. The panel included musical performances from Farmer, Marsden, and Tevin Campbell. While the panel was not expected to be one of the largest panels at D23, it ended up with the largest attended, with around 1,000 fans attending, and forcing the expo to turn away some due to lack of seating.

In the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, Pete appears making some references to the film, wearing the same clothes and owning the same recreational vehicle with which he goes camping.

In 2016, Campbell uploaded a video of him partaking in a jam session with the band Enfield, in which he performed both &quot;I 2 I&quot; and &quot;Stand Out&quot;. In June 2018, a one-week event titled &quot;Disney FanDaze&quot; was opened in Disneyland Paris, featuring several dedicated performances paying tribute to Disney franchises. Among these was &quot;Max Live! Gettin&#x27; Goofy With It&quot;, which featured Max Goof performing songs from &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;. In April 2019, singer Uché performed &quot;I 2 I&quot; during the Top 10 Disney Night of &quot;American Idol&quot;″s 17th season. According to co-producer Frank Angones, the film was a strong influence during early development of the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, particularly on its version of Donald Duck, as the creators &quot;wanted [the] show to do for Donald what &quot;Goofy Movie&quot; did for Goofy&quot;. The series itself featured several references to the film, including the appearances of the song &quot;Stand Out&quot;, Lester&#x27;s Possum Park, pictures of Goofy, Max, and Roxanne and, in 2020, is considered canon to the series. In October 2021, Cody Rigsby and Cheryl Burke danced a Jive to &quot;Stand Out&quot; during night one of Disney Week on the 30th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. During an interview with i-D for Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;, lead actress Alana Haim called &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; her favorite movie of all time, stating &quot;If you haven&#x27;t seen it, you need to watch &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;. It&#x27;s the best movie of all time.&quot;

The visual design of a scene in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; where Goofy and Pete have a conversation in a hot tub was cited as an inspiration for a similar scene in the season 2 episode of &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; &quot;Roadside Attraction&quot; in the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary.

In 2022, Pixar director Domee Shi said she was inspired by &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; for the story of her directorial debut, &quot;Turning Red&quot; (2022).

The eighth episode of &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s fourth season in 2022, titled &quot;The Goof Who Sat By the Door&quot;, was a mockumentary about the making of the film.

In 2023, a newly orchestrated instrumental version of &quot;I 2 I&quot; was added as part of the new area music for the refurbished Mickey&#x27;s Toontown section of Disneyland, and one of the photos added inside of Goofy&#x27;s house in Mickey&#x27;s Toontown now includes a picture of Max dressed as Powerline for Halloween. Furthermore, Goofy&#x27;s yard now includes references to Bigfoot and Powerline as part of a play area. In addition, inside of the ticket booth of the land&#x27;s El CapiTOON Theater (which houses the Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway attraction) there are references to Lester&#x27;s Possum Park, Powerline, and a photo of the little girl that Max encounters at Lester&#x27;s. Inside of the attraction&#x27;s queue, there are parody movie posters including one featuring Goofy and Max (parodying the 1976 film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;) with the tagline &quot;Father and son who never saw eye to eye&quot;, and another (parodying the 2008 film &quot;High School Musical 3: Senior Year&quot;) featuring Max, P.J., Roxanne, Bobby, and Stacey, and a concession stand in the queue includes a brand of candy on display called Powerlimes, featuring Powerline on the wrapper, with an offer to win a trip to Lester&#x27;s Possum Park on the candy&#x27;s display box.

A documentary detailing the film&#x27;s production and eventual cult status premiered in May 2024 at the DocLands Film Festival. Entitled &quot;Not Just a Goof&quot;, the documentary is directed by fans Christopher Ninness and Eric Kimelton. In October 2024, four couples performed a team freestyle to &quot;I 2 I&quot; during Disney night on the 33rd season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

===Sequel===
A direct-to-video sequel, titled &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on February 29, 2000, and serves as the finale to the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; series as a whole. The film follows Goofy and Max as they become classmates at college and participate in the X Games.

<text>Colchester County (Scottish-Gaelic: Siorramachd Colchester) is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. With a population of 51,476 the county is the fourth largest in Nova Scotia. Colchester County is located in north central Nova Scotia.

The majority of the county is governed by the Municipality of the County of Colchester, the county also is home to two independent incorporated towns, Stewiacke and Truro, two village commissions in Bible Hill and Tatamagouche, and the Millbrook 27 First Nations reserve.

==History==
The glaciers began their retreat from in the Maritimes approximately 13,500 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation. The record of continuous habitation through the paleo and archaic period over ten thousand years culminated in the development of the culture, traditions, and language now known as the Mi&#x27;kmaq. For several thousand years the territory of the province has been a part of the territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki includes what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula. Colchester County is located in the traditional Mi&#x27;kmaw districts of Sipekni&#x27;katik to the south and west, and Epekwitk aq Piktuk to the north and east.

French colonization of the area began during the 1680s. Acadian settlers were farmers were accustomed to farming on dyked lands in France. They used normally salty but fertile marshes that were found on the banks of the Minas Basin and through the use of dykes and aboiteaux that allowed fresh water to enter but kept out the salt-water tide.

The appellation Colchester was applied in 1780 to the district previously called &quot;Cobequid,&quot; and was derived from the town of Colchester in Essex. The old name Cobequid was derived from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word &quot;Wagobagitk&quot; meaning &quot;the bay runs far up&quot;, in reference to the area surrounding the easternmost inlet of the Minas Basin, a body of water called Cobequid Bay.

The District of Colchester, which was at first part of Halifax County, was established as a county in its own right in 1835. In 1838 a distinct line of division between Cumberland County and Colchester County was established. Two years later, in 1840, the Township of Parrsboro was divided and part of it annexed to Colchester County. In 1871, the boundaries between the Counties of Hants and Colchester and between the Counties of Halifax and Colchester were established. In 1880 the boundary between the Counties of Halifax and Colchester was revised. Eventually in 1897 a portion of the boundary between the Counties of Colchester and Cumberland was fixed and defined.

The question of the boundary between Colchester and Cumberland Counties was the subject of a Commission of Inquiry established in 1946. The report was filed in the office of the Provincial Secretary and in the office of the Department of Lands and Forests in January 1959. Certified copies of it were sent to the Registrars of Deeds for the Counties of Colchester, Cumberland and Kings.

==Government==

The Municipality of the County of Colchester is governed by a municipal council composed of a Mayor elected at-large and 11 Councillors elected to represent districts. Municipal Council is responsible oversee the provision of the services of municipal government. Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are Council–manager governments, meaning that the Council provides policy direction and approves the budget, and the Chief Administrative Officer oversees the administrative operations and implement Council&#x27;s policies. Directly delivered services include services such as fire protection, public works, roads, and water. The municipality participates in shared services, such as police, solid waste management, library services, and the Rath Eastlink Community Centre.

The municipal operating budget was $29.1 million in 2017/18. The current mayor is Christine Blair. Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 15, 2016. The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.

While the majority of the land area of county is governed by the Municipal Council of the Municipality of the County of Colchester the county also includes two independently incorporated towns, Stewiacke and Truro, as well as the independently governed Millbrook First Nation. Within the county are also two communities with incorporated village commissions in Bible Hill and Tatamagouche which are a part of the county wide municipality but are created to provide additional village services. Colchester is represented by three ridings in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and two ridings in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons.

<doc id="155787" wikidata="Q2559621" url="?curid=155787" title="Cumberland County, Nova Scotia">
<text>Cumberland County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

Cumberland was named in 1755 in honour of the Duke of Cumberland to replace Beausejour. The historic county was founded in 1759 when the English system of administration was installed to complement settlement during the Charles Lawrence governorship, and was later divided at the partitioning of the province and in 1840. The area thrived in the 19th century with the development of lumbering, shipbuilding, and coal mining, but rural outmigration and deforestation led to some communities being abandoned in the 20th century. The county spans an area of 4,271.23 km2 making it Nova Scotia&#x27;s second largest county, with resources including extensive forest land, several mineral resources, and agricultural areas that concentrate on wild blueberry harvesting. As of the 2021 census, Cumberland County had a population of 30,538, with the majority residing in the Municipality of the County of Cumberland. The county includes two towns, Amherst and Oxford, and two large population centres, Parrsboro and Springhill.

==History==
The name Cumberland was applied by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Monckton to the captured Fort Beauséjour on June 18, 1755, in honour of the third son of King George II, William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, victor at Culloden in 1746 and Commander in Chief of the British forces. The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the area was &quot;Kwesomalegek&quot; meaning &quot;hardwood point&quot;.

Cumberland County was founded on August 17, 1759, the largest of Nova Scotia&#x27;s five original administrative divisions. It included the Passamoquody, Wolastoq and Mi&#x27;kmaq nations north of the Bay of Fundy which formed the mainland part of the province and former Acadia, including all of what would become the province of New Brunswick. 1765 saw for the partitioning of Sunbury County, Nova Scotia out of the western-most part of Cumberland, roughly dividing the county in half along Passamoquody/Wolastoqiyuk and Mi&#x27;kmaq territorial lines.

At the partitioning of the province, Cumberland county was severed by the provincial boundary at Chignecto isthmus, where the county now forms the northern-most part of the Province.

When the Township of Parrsboro was divided in 1840, one part was annexed to Cumberland County and the other part annexed to Colchester.

The dividing line between Cumberland and Colchester was established in 1840. In 1897, a portion of the boundary line between the Counties of Colchester and Cumberland was fixed and defined. The county thrived in the 19th century with the development of lumbering, shipbuilding and coal mining. Deforestation and rural outmigration in the 20th century led to the abandonment of some communities such as Eatonville and New Yarmouth.

==Geography==
The county has a total area of .

Cumberland County is rich in natural resources with extensive forest land supporting lumber mills and pulp contractors. It has many mineral resources, including 2 operating salt mines. Until the 1970s it also had several coal mines which extracted coal from seams that run from Joggins to River Hebert and on to Athol and Springhill.

Agriculture is concentrated on wild blueberry harvesting throughout the Cobequid Hills, as well as mixed farms located in the Tantramar Marshes region, the Northumberland Strait coastal plain, and the Wentworth Valley.

The northwestern edge of Cumberland County forms part of the Isthmus of Chignecto, the natural land bridge connecting the Nova Scotia peninsula to North America. As such, the county hosts several important transportation corridors, including Highway 104 (the Trans-Canada Highway) and CN Rail&#x27;s Halifax-Montreal railway line. The county line bordering New Brunswick is around 30 kilometres long (18.5 miles). Cumberland is the only county in Nova Scotia that borders another province.

Two towns are located in Cumberland County: Amherst and Oxford. Parrsboro and Springhill both have populations exceeding 1000 people, but lack their own town governments.

<text>Digby County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

==History==
It was named after the Township of Digby; this was named in honour of Rear Admiral Robert Digby, who dispatched HMS &quot;Atalanta&quot; to convey Loyalists from New York City in the spring of 1783 to Conway, which became known as Digby, as part of their evacuation and resettlement following the American Revolutionary War. The Crown resettled thousands of Loyalists in Nova Scotia and other areas of Canada. Digby County was established in 1837. Previously, from August 17, 1759, when Nova Scotia was first divided into counties, this area had been part of Annapolis County.

In 1861, Digby County was divided into two sessional districts: Digby and Clare. These were eventually incorporated as district municipalities in 1879.

In addition to these two district municipalities, the county contains the Town of Digby and part of the Bear River Indian (First Nations) reserve. Also, there is Digby Neck leading into the Bay of Fundy to Long Island and Brier Island.

<doc id="155790" wikidata="Q1537670" url="?curid=155790" title="An Extremely Goofy Movie">
<text>Disney&#x27;s An Extremely Goofy Movie is a 2000 American animated comedy film distributed by Walt Disney Home Video, produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, and directed by Douglas McCarthy. It is a sequel to the 1995 film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and the finale to the television series &quot;Goof Troop.&quot; The film was released on Blu-ray as a &quot;Disney Movie Club&quot; exclusive alongside &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; on April 23, 2019. Unlike its predecessor, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==

After Max Goof goes to college with his friends P.J. and Bobby Zimuruski, Goofy falters at work due to his empty nest syndrome, causing a massive explosion at the toy-assembly factory and resulting in his dismissal. At the unemployment office, Goofy is told that he needs a college degree to get another job. Max and his friends meet Bradley Uppercrust III, the leader of the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity and a veteran skateboarder. Bradley is impressed by Max&#x27;s own skateboarding talent and invites him to join the Gamma team and take part in the college&#x27;s X Games. Max declines the offer due to the condition that he cannot bring his friends along. Following a skirmish, the two parties place a bet in which the loser becomes the other group&#x27;s towel boy. To Max&#x27;s horror, Goofy begins attending the same college and interrupts the group&#x27;s down-time with chores. Max plots to distract his father by introducing him to the college librarian, Sylvia Marpole, with whom he has much in common. Goofy accidentally impresses Bradley with his clumsy attempt at skateboarding and is invited to join the Gamma team, which he accepts upon Max&#x27;s encouragement.

During the first qualifiers for the X Games, Bradley discreetly blinds Max with a pocket mirror during his performance and installs a rocket booster on Goofy&#x27;s skateboard. Goofy beats Max, and Max&#x27;s team barely makes the semi-finals. Eventually, Max lashes out at Goofy, telling him to stay out of his life. A depressed Goofy fails his first midterm exam and misses a date with Sylvia. Returning home, Goofy is motivated by his neighor Pete to regain his focus. He goes back to college and reconciles with Sylvia, who helps him ace the rest of his exams. As Goofy quits the Gamma team, he overhears the group plotting to cheat for the semi-finals, but Max, still angry with his father over beating him in the qualifiers, does not listen to his warnings.

At the semi-finals, all teams but Max&#x27;s and the Gamma&#x27;s are eliminated. Just before the final triathlon, Bradley eliminates P.J. from the games, leaving Max&#x27;s team short one player and spurring Max to recruit and apologize to Goofy via jumbotron. Throughout the race, Bradley and his team attempt to hinder Max&#x27;s team, but only manage to eliminate Bobby. Although Goofy temporarily knocks out Bradley with a horseshoe in the final section of the race, his final trick results in Max and Gamma member Tank getting trapped underneath a flaming collapsed X logo. As Bradley passes them by, Max and Goofy rescue Tank, who assists Max in winning the race. Afterwards, Bradley concedes his defeat. Max calls off the bet, but allows a vengeful Tank to slingshot Bradley into the X Games blimp overhead. During graduation day, Max gives Goofy his grand-prize trophy engraved with an affirmation of their bond, and Goofy drives away with Sylvia for their next date.

==Release and reception==
The film was released on February 29, 2000, to positive reviews from critics, who called it &quot;likable,&quot; &quot;fun,&quot; &quot;funny,&quot; &quot;ambitious and surprisingly good,&quot; and Goofy&#x27;s character in the film &quot;limber and funny as ever.&quot; On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 63% approval rating based on eight reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10, making it one of the few Disney sequels to be rated higher than its predecessor. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Bruce Westbrook praised its &quot;fluid&quot; animation, &quot;handsomely detailed&quot; backgrounds, and the &quot;charming&quot; sequences with the Beret Girl. Randy Myers of the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; complimented its positive take on the father-and-son relationship trope as &quot;refreshing&quot; compared to other films painting it in a negative manner. Many touches were positively noted, such as the elements of 1970s&#x27; culture, the soundtrack (particularly its 1970s tracks and the newly-recorded covers), movie parodies (such as &quot;The Gooffather&quot;, &quot;The Goofinator&quot; and &quot;Pup Fiction Too&quot;), and a line making fun of characters &quot;always wearing gloves&quot; in the Disney universe. Subplots such the skateboard competition and the &quot;sweet&quot; relationship between Goofy and Sylvia were highlighted as well.

&quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;″s less favorable reviews categorized the film as a weaker version of Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s &quot;Back to School&quot;. and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Susan King who wrote that despite &quot;some funny lines and scenes,&quot; it had too little emotionally due to a lack of character development for Goofy. Michael Scheinfeld of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; praised the film&#x27;s morals of &quot;the importance of education, of not cheating, and staying focused on one&#x27;s goals,&quot; but disliked its attempts to be hip and the &quot;less-than-exemplary character traits&quot; that paint an inaccurate picture of college students. Barbara Bova of &quot;Naples Daily News&quot; also dismissed the film for the immature behavior of the college students as well as the dysfunctional relationship between Max and Goofy and a &quot;depressing,&quot; humorless plot where &quot;the adults are no smarter than the kids&quot; and &quot;Goofy is the essential innocent who is stupid with a capital S.&quot; Scheinfeld also called the animation &quot;less sophisticated than Disney&#x27;s theatrical films, but features some amusing and stylish touches, such as a psychedelic dream sequence in the style of Yellow Submarine, and a school dance that Goofy turns into a disco inferno.&quot;

Petrana Radulovic of &quot;Polygon&quot;, in 2019, ranked &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; the sixth best Disney sequel, labeling it as &quot;all delightfully bonkers&quot; and claiming its best aspects to be the Beret Girl and Bobby&#x27;s poke on Disney characters wearing gloves; she also, however, criticized some of its content as &quot;stuck in a gnarly late-’90s vortex.&quot;

&quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; won the award for &quot;Best Animated Home Video Production&quot; and Bill Farmer was nominated for &quot;Best Voice Acting by a Male Performer&quot; at the 28th Annie Awards in 2000.

==Censorship==
Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the scene in which Goofy rescues Max and Tank from under the burning X Games logo structure was removed from television broadcasts of the film; the scene remains in all other versions of the movie, and the scene was still intact in the Disney+ version, but the broadcast version skips this scene entirely to show them skating out of the wreckage.

==History==
Deriving its name from George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax (1716–1771), Halifax County was established by order-in-council on August 17, 1759. The boundaries of four other counties – Annapolis, Kings, Cumberland and Lunenburg – were specifically defined at that time, with Halifax County comprising all the part of peninsular Nova Scotia that was not within their limits.

Following the Seven Years&#x27; War, Cape Breton Island was formally annexed to Nova Scotia. For a time it formed part of Halifax County.

The boundaries of Halifax County were modified in 1822. That part of St. Mary&#x27;s Township (established in 1818) which had been in Halifax County was annexed to and included within Sydney County.

The dividing line between the Districts of Halifax and Colchester was confirmed and established on May 3, 1828. In 1835, Halifax County was divided and the Counties of Colchester and Pictou County were created out of parts of what had previously been Halifax County. Eventually in 1880 the boundary between the Counties of Halifax and Colchester was fixed.

On April 1, 1996, Halifax County was dissolved and the Halifax Regional Municipality was created. The boundaries of the county and the regional municipality are the same. The county, however, also includes reserves of Cole Harbour, Sheet Harbour and Shubenacadie, parts of the Millbrook and Shubenacadie First Nations.

Halifax County continues to exist as a county in Nova Scotia, but all municipal government and service delivery is provided by either the Regional Municipality or the Indigenous Canadian Reserves, with no additional county level government or administration.

<text>John Tillotson (October 1630 – 22 November 1694) was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1691 to 1694.

==Curate and rector==
Tillotson was the son of a Puritan clothier at Haughend, Sowerby, Yorkshire. Little is known of his early youth; he studied at Colne Grammar School, before entering as a pensioner of Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 1647. His tutor was David Clarkson and he graduated in 1650, being made a fellow of his college in 1651.

In 1656 Tillotson became tutor to the son of Edmund Prideaux, attorney-general to Oliver Cromwell. About 1661 he was ordained without subscription by Thomas Sydserf, a Scottish bishop. Tillotson was present at the Savoy Conference in 1661, and remained identified with the Presbyterians until the passing of the Act of Uniformity 1662. Shortly afterwards he became curate of Cheshunt, Herts, and in June 1663, rector of Kedington, Suffolk.

He now devoted himself to an exact study of biblical and patristic writers, especially Basil and Chrysostom. The result of this reading, and of the influence of John Wilkins, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, was seen in the general tone of his preaching, which was practical rather than theological, concerned with issues of personal morality instead of theoretical doctrine. This plain style of preaching is reflective of the late 17th century, when the integration of reason into Protestant theology came to be seen as one of its finest attributes against Catholicism. Tillotson himself was personally tolerant enough towards Catholics, remarking in a famous sermon that while Popery was &quot;gross superstition&quot;, yet &quot;Papists, I doubt not, are made like other men&quot;. He was actually a latitudinarian, also known as &quot;Cambridge Arminianism&quot;. Besides, Tillotson adopted Arminian views.

He was a man of the world as well as a divine, and in his sermons, he exhibited a tact which enabled him at once to win the ear of his audience. In 1664 he became preacher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. The same year he married Elizabeth French, a niece of Oliver Cromwell; and he also became a Tuesday lecturer at St Lawrence, Jewry (where he was later buried). Tillotson employed his controversial weapons with some skill against atheism and Catholicism. In 1663 he published a characteristic sermon on &quot;The Wisdom of being Religious,&quot; and in 1666 replied to John Sergeant&#x27;s &quot;Sure Footing in Christianity&quot; by a pamphlet on the &quot;Rule of Faith.&quot; The same year he received the degree of D.D.

==Dean of Canterbury and Archbishop==

In 1670 he became prebendary and in 1672 dean of Canterbury. That latter year he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1675 he edited John Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Natural Religion&quot;, completing what was left unfinished of it, and in 1682 his Sermons. Along with Burnet, Tillotson attended William Russell, Lord Russell on the scaffold in 1683. In 1684, he wrote a &quot;Discourse against Transubstantiation&quot;. He afterwards enjoyed the friendship of Lady Russell, and it was partly through her that he obtained so much influence with Princess Anne, who followed his advice in regard to the settlement of the crown on William of Orange. He possessed the special confidence of William and Mary, and was made clerk of the closet to the king in March 1689.

It was chiefly through his advice that the king appointed an ecclesiastical commission for the reconciliation of the Dissenters. In August of this year, he was appointed by the chapter of his cathedral to exercise the archepiscopal jurisdiction of the province of Canterbury during the suspension of Sancroft. He was also, about the same time, named Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. Soon afterwards he was elected to succeed Sancroft as archbishop; but accepted the promotion with extreme reluctance, and it was deferred from time to time, at his request, until April 1691. In 1693 he published four lectures on the Socinian controversy, partly to clear his own name from charges of sympathy with Socinianism in his previous associations with Thomas Firmin, Stephen Nye and others.

His attempts to reform certain abuses of the Church of England, especially that of clerical non-residence, awakened much ill-will, and of this the Jacobites took advantage, pursuing him to the end of his life with insult and reproach. He died on 22 November 1694.

For his manuscript sermons, Tillotson&#x27;s widow received 2500 guineas. Ralph Barker edited some 250 of them together with the &quot;Rule of Faith&quot; (1695–1704). In 1752 an edition appeared in 3 vols., with &quot;Life by Thomas Birch&quot;, compiled from Tillotson&#x27;s original papers and letters. Various selections from his sermons and works have been published separately. AMS Press, New York, published a modern edition of his works in the 1980s. In his home town of Sowerby, a statue of Tillotson still exists in St. Peter&#x27;s church and an avenue is named after him in the lower end of the town.

He is buried in the church of St Lawrence Jewry just west of the Bank of England in the City of London.

Thomas Tillotson was his great great nephew.

<text>Inverness County is an historical county and census division of Nova Scotia, Canada located on Cape Breton Island. Local government is provided by the Municipality of the County of Inverness, the town of Port Hawkesbury and the Whycocomagh 2 Waycobah First Nation reserve.

==History==
Established as the County of Juste au Corps in 1835, Inverness County was given its present name in 1837. It was named after Sir Cameron Inverness of Scotland, the land from which many of the early settlers came. Agriculture and fishing dominated the economy with exports of butter and cattle to Newfoundland and Halifax for most of the nineteenth century. The construction of the Inverness and Richmond Railway in 1901, and the subsequent opening of coal mines at Port Hood, Mabou, and Inverness, created the &quot;only home market&quot; local farmers had ever had.

The boundaries of Inverness County had been previously defined when Cape Breton Island was divided by statute into three districts in 1823. In 1996, the county was amalgamated into a single municipality with the exception of Port Hawkesbury.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Inverness County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="155795" wikidata="Q671105" url="?curid=155795" title="Kings County, Nova Scotia">
<text>Kings County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. With a population of 62,914 in the 2021 Census, Kings County is the third most populous county in the province. It is located in central Nova Scotia on the shore of the Bay of Fundy, with its northeastern part forming the western shore of the Minas Basin.

Kings&#x27; economy and identity are tied into its current and historical role as the province&#x27;s agricultural heartland. A strong agricultural base has been bolstered by the farm-to-table movement and a growing and acclaimed Nova Scotia wine industry, and the success of both has also bolstered the area&#x27;s tourism industry. The county benefits from the profile, prestige and population gained from hosting both Acadia University in Wolfville and the NSCC Kingstec campus in Kentville. Canadian Forces Base Greenwood (the largest Royal Canadian Air Force base on Canada&#x27;s East Coast) and the Michelin tire plant in Waterville both provide significant positive economic impact in the county.

While the majority of the area of county is governed by the Municipality of the County of Kings, the county also includes three separately incorporated towns, Wolfville, Kentville, and Berwick, and two First Nations reserves.

==History==

The glaciers began their retreat from in the Maritimes approximately 13,500 years ago, with final deglaciation, post-glacial rebound, and sea level fluctuation ending and leaving the New England-Maritimes region virtually ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation. Evidence of settlement found in the Debert Palaeo-Indian Site dates to 10,600 before present, though settlement seems likely to have occurred earlier, following large game animals such as the caribou as they expanded into the land revealed by the retreating glaciers. The record of continuous habitation through the paleo and archaic period over ten thousand years culminated in the development of the culture, traditions, and language now known as the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

For several thousand years the territory of the province has been a part of the territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki includes what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula. King&#x27;s County is located in the traditional Mi&#x27;kmaw districts of Sipekni&#x27;katik and Kespukwitk.
The colonization of &quot;Les Mines&quot; and Grand Pre began in the 1680s when a few families relocated from the French settlement at Port Royal. These &quot;Acadian&quot; settlers were named after the French name for the land &quot;Acadie&quot; meaning &quot;land of plenty&quot;. These farmers were accustomed to farming on dyked lands, and did so here as well. This took place on the normally salty but fertile marshes that were found on the banks of the Minas Basin, through the use of dykes and aboiteaux that allowed fresh water to enter but kept out the salt-water tide. The Acadian farmers prospered in Kings County, and lived harmoniously with the Mi&#x27;kmaq. The Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq jointly fought numerous battles against the British in the Raid on Grand Pré, Battle of Grand Pré, and the Siege of Grand Pré.

After forcibly expelling the Acadians, British control of the land was secured by repopulating the former French lands with settlers from New England. The county was formed in 1759 and named for King George III. Between 1760 and 1768 some 8000 New England Planters arrived in Nova Scotia, the largest number settling in Kings County in three agricultural townships: Horton, Cornwallis, and Aylesford. The Planters revived and expanded the Acadian dykeland agriculture through projects such as the Wellington Dyke and cleared more upland fields, gradually moving west from the initial settlements along the Minas Basin Rivers. The legacy of the New England Planters is still a tangible part of the life in Kings County, and had an important influence on Nova Scotian ideas on democratic government, freedom of religion and equality of education.

The Planters were followed in the 1780s by further settlers from the United Empire Loyalists and significant numbers of Irish immigrants. The roots of Black heritage in Kings County began almost 250 years ago when the New England Planters were accompanied by slaves and freed Blacks to settle in Horton and Cornwallis townships. This initial African population increased with larger migrations of Black Loyalists following the American Revolution and especially Black refugees following the War of 1812. Further waves of immigration followed in the following two centuries, adding to the population and diversity of Kings County.

The county&#x27;s agricultural industry blossomed in the 19th century, especially after the arrival of the Dominion Atlantic Railway which led to a major expansion of exports, especially the apple industry. After the loss of the British export market for apples in World War II, Kings County farmers diversified into other crops and livestock. Agriculture remains a major industry, as the county has some of the best farmland in Nova Scotia, but farmland now faces pressure from suburban development around valley towns. The county also faces serious pollution problems in its major water artery, the Cornwallis River.

Kings County was a major wooden shipbuilding area in the 19th Century, including a four-masted barque built in Kingsport named &quot;Kings County&quot; which was one of the largest ever built in Canada. Today a number of light industrial factories are located in Coldbrook and Waterville.

The county&#x27;s history is preserved and interpreted at the Kings County Museum in Kentville and a number of Kings County towns have museums related to their specific stories such as the Wolfville Historical Society and the Apple Capital Museum in Berwick.

==Government==

The majority of the land area of county is governed by the Municipal Council of the Municipality of the County of Kings, though the county also includes three incorporated towns, Wolfville, Kentville, and Berwick, with their own independent municipal governments. In addition to municipal governments there are two First Nations reserves under 
band government, the Annapolis Valley First Nation Cambridge reserve and the Glooscap First Nation Glooscap reserve.

The Municipal Council for the county (outside of the Towns and Reserves) is composed of a Mayor elected at-large and 9 Councillors each elected to represent a separate district. Municipal Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including directly delivered and shared or regional services. Directly delivered services include services such as police and fire, public works, roads, and water. The municipality participates in shared services, such as the solid waste management, library services, and transit.

The municipal operating budget of $45.7 million and combined capital and water capital budget of $4.3 million in the 2017/18 fiscal year. The current mayor is Peter Muttart. Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place in October 2020. The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.

Kings is represented by three ridings in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The municipality shares representation by two ridings in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons.

==Economy==
Kings County is considered agricultural heartland of the province. The economy in Kings County is largely built on its diversified agricultural industry. Although agriculture is a dominant industry in the Kings economy, there are many emerging industries such as trade, health care, construction, and manufacturing. The largest employment sectors in the county include retail trade (3,621), health care and social assistance (3,352), public administration (2,659), manufacture (2,459), and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (2,064). Manufacturing employment is over 30% higher and agricultural employment more than double the provincial averages. Kings enjoys 33% of arable land used for agricultural production compared to the provincial average of 13%, and since 2006 the number of acres used for farming purposes and the number of farms have been on the rise.

While there are light industrial clusters throughout the county, the over half the manufacturing jobs are a result of the Michelin tire plant in Waterville, which opened in 1982. The plant employs about 1,300 people and is set to continue to expand its production capacity starting 2013 until 2018. Kings is home to Canadian Forces Base Greenwood, the east coast&#x27;s largest air force base. The county also benefits from the location of Acadia University in Wolfville and the NSCC Kingstec campus in Kentville. Nova Scotia&#x27;s federally funded agriculture and agri-food research centre, Kentville Research and Development Centre, supports the local economy through agriculture related research.
The region is also celebrated for its wineries, many located in the county communities of Gaspereau Valley, Canning, and Grand Pré. The recently launched Tidal Bay appellation, created in 2012, was the first wine appellation for Nova Scotia and has helped to raise Nova Scotia wines profile in Canada and around the world. The region&#x27;s sparking wine has been added to wine lists in high-profile restaurants and received acclaim around the world.

Tourism is also an important industry, and the county benefits from scenic farmland, increasing support for farm-to-table movement, and attractions including Cape Split, the look off at Blomodin, and the UNESCO World Heritage site at Grand-Pré. Farmers markets in Kentville, Kingsport, Berwick and Wolfville attract visitors with fresh produce and other fine goods throughout the growing season. Events such as the Apple Blossom Festival, the annual Steer Bar-B-Que in Kingston, Mud Creek Days, Deep Roots Music Festival and the Devour The Food Film Fest in Wolfville, and the Pumpkin People in Kentville draw tourist throughout the summer and fall.

<text>Lunenburg County is a historical county and census division on the South Shore of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Major settlements include Bridgewater, Lunenburg, and Mahone Bay.

==History==
Named in honour of the British king who was also the duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, it was established in 1759, when the Nova Scotia peninsula was divided into five counties. The county became smaller when new counties were created from its boundaries: Queens (1762), Hants (1781), Shelburne (1784), and Sydney (1784).

By Chapter 52 of the Statutes of 1863, Lunenburg County was divided into two districts for court sessional purposes – Chester and Lunenburg. That statute provided authority for the appointment of a Custos Rotulorum and for the establishment of a general sessions of the peace for the District of Chester, with the same powers as if it were a separate county. In 1879, the two districts were incorporated as district municipalities.

==Governance==
Today the county has no legal status, although its borders are coincident with the five municipalities contained within it:
* the municipality of the District of Chester
* the municipality of the District of Lunenburg
* the town of Bridgewater
* the town of Lunenburg
* the town of Mahone Bay
The above municipalities comprise the entire territory of the county.

There are three Sipekneꞌkatik First Nation reserves in the county:
*Gold River 21
*New Ross 20
*Pennal 19

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lunenburg County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="155798" wikidata="Q2092485" url="?curid=155798" title="Pictou County">
<text>Pictou County is a county in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. It was established in 1835, and was formerly a part of Halifax County from 1759 to 1835. It had a population of 43,657 people in 2021, a decline of 0.2 percent from 2016. Furthermore, its 2016 population is only 88.11% of the census population in 1991. It is the sixth most populous county in Nova Scotia.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Pictou&quot; is obscure. Possible Mi&#x27;kmaq derivations include &quot;Piktook&quot; meaning an explosion of gas, and &quot;Bucto&quot; meaning fire, possibly related to the coal fields in the area. It might also be a corruption of Poictou (Poitou), a former province of France. Nicolas Denys named the harbour &quot;La rivière de Pictou&quot; in the 1660s.

==History==
The area of the modern Pictou County was a part of the Miꞌkmaq nation of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki (&quot;mi&#x27;gama&#x27;gi&quot;) at the time of European contact.

In the early 1600s France claimed the area as a part of Acadia. By the 1760s, small French settlements existed along the coast in the eastern part of the county near the mouth of the French River. The largest of these was on the Big Island at Merigomish. By the conclusion of the French and Indian War in 1763, and the Expulsion of the Acadians, these had been abandoned.

Pictou came under the control of Britain in 1763 after the French and Indian War. In 1765 the first British land grants were issued, including a grant to the Philadelphia Company. A number of families from that company left Philadelphia aboard the &quot;Hope&quot; in May 1767, and arrived at Pictou Harbour in June. In 1770 there were 120 settlers living in Pictou, of whom 93 were American, 18 were Irish, five were Acadian, and two each were Scottish and English.

Pictou was a receiving point for many Scottish immigrants moving to a new home in northern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island following the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Consequently, the town&#x27;s slogan is &quot;The Birthplace of New Scotland&quot;; the first wave of immigrants from Scotland is acknowledged to have arrived on September 15, 1773, on the &quot;Hector&quot;.

Coal was first discovered in Pictou County in 1798. A number of different individuals and companies were involved in the nascent coal industry; however, in 1825 the majority of mining rights in Nova Scotia was obtained by the General Mining Association. After surveying mines in Nova Scotia, they chose to start at the East River of Pictou and in the summer of 1827 they began operations there. By the end of the year the first steam engine in Nova Scotia was operating at Albion Mines.

In 1839 the first locomotive in Canada to run on iron rails, the &quot;Samson&quot;, was put into service at Albion Mines. It is the oldest surviving locomotive in Canada.

==Geography==
Pictou County includes the towns of New Glasgow, Stellarton, Pictou, Westville and Trenton. It is bounded by the Northumberland Strait, Antigonish County, Guysborough County and Colchester County. Pictou Harbour and its three rivers played a vital role in the early days of settlement, as a port of entry, a means of transport and for the export of lumber and coal.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Pictou County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of −0.2% from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Forming the majority of the Pictou County census division, the Municipality of the County of Pictou, including its Subdivisions A, B, and C, had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of −0.1% from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Queens County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

==History==
Liverpool, the county seat of Queens County, was founded in 1759 by the New England Planters. Founded for the most part by New England settlers, Liverpool maintained strong ties with the American colonies until the sudden outbreak of the American Revolution.

On July 21, 1762 the Lieutenant Governor and Council of Nova Scotia declared that &quot;the Townships of Liverpool, Barrington and Yarmouth together with the intermediate lands should be erected into a county by the name of Queens County&quot;. Parts of the new county were taken from Lunenburg County, which now lies to the northeast.

In 1784, Shelburne County was formed in part from southwestern portions of Queens County. The new county boundaries were established by an Order-in-Council dated December 16, 1785.

Queens County contains substantial portions of Kejimkujik National Park, including the main body of the park inland north of Caledonia and the Seaside Adjunct near Port Joli and Port Mouton.

In 1996, the county&#x27;s municipal government merged with the town of Liverpool to form the Region of Queens Municipality, thus the county is contiguous with the boundaries of the regional municipality, minus First Nations reserves.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Queens County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Frederick Reines ( ; March 16, 1918 – August 26, 1998) was an American physicist. He was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics for his co-detection of the neutrino with Clyde Cowan in the neutrino experiment. He may be the only scientist in history &quot;so intimately associated with the discovery of an elementary particle and the subsequent thorough investigation of its fundamental properties.&quot;

A graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology and New York University, Reines joined the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory in 1944, working in the Theoretical Division in Richard Feynman&#x27;s group. He became a group leader there in 1946. He participated in a number of nuclear tests, culminating in his becoming the director of the Operation Greenhouse test series in the Pacific in 1951.

In the early 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan developed the equipment and procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956. Reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino&#x27;s properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come. This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.

== Early life ==
Frederick Reines was born in Paterson, New Jersey, one of four children of Gussie (Cohen) and Israel Reines. His parents were Jewish emigrants from the same town in Russia, but only met in New York City, where they were later married. He had an older sister, Paula, who became a doctor, and two older brothers, David and William, who became lawyers. He said that his &quot;early education was strongly influenced&quot; by his studious siblings. He was the great-nephew of the Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines, the founder of Mizrachi, a religious Zionist movement.

The family moved to Hillburn, New York, where his father ran the general store, and he spent much of his childhood. He was an Eagle Scout. Looking back, Reines said: &quot;My early childhood memories center around this typical American country store and life in a small American town, including Independence Day July celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand.&quot;

Reines sang in a chorus, and as a soloist. For a time he considered the possibility of a singing career, and was instructed by a vocal coach from the Metropolitan Opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them. The family later moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, residing on Kennedy Boulevard and 57th Street. Because North Bergen did not have a high school, he attended Union Hill High School in Union Hill, New Jersey (today Union City, New Jersey), from which he graduated in 1935.

From an early age, Reines exhibited an interest in science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that:

The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.

Ironically, Reines excelled in literary and history courses, but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school, though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory. This cultivated a love of science by his senior year. In response to a question seniors were asked about what they wanted to do for a yearbook quote, he responded: &quot;To be a physicist extraordinaire.&quot;

Reines was accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but chose instead to attend Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, where he earned his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in mechanical engineering in 1939, and his Master of Science (M.S.) degree in mathematical physics in 1941, writing a thesis on &quot;A Critical Review of Optical Diffraction Theory&quot;. He married Sylvia Samuels on August 30, 1940. They had two children, Robert and Alisa. He then entered New York University, where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1944. He studied cosmic rays there under Serge A. Korff, but wrote his thesis under the supervision of Richard D. Present on &quot;Nuclear fission and the liquid drop model of the nucleus&quot;. Publication of the thesis was delayed until after the end of World War II; it appeared in Physical Review in 1946.

== Los Alamos Laboratory ==
In 1944 Richard Feynman recruited Reines to work in the Theoretical Division at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory, where he would remain for the next fifteen years. He joined Feynman&#x27;s T-4 (Diffusion Problems) Group, which was part of Hans Bethe&#x27;s T (Theoretical) Division. Diffusion was an important aspect of critical mass calculations. In June 1946, he became a group leader, heading the T-1 (Theory of Dragon) Group. An outgrowth of the &quot;tickling the Dragon&#x27;s tail&quot; experiment, the Dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time, which could be used as a research tool or power source.

Reines participated in a number of nuclear tests, and writing reports on their results. These included Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll in 1946, Operation Sandstone at Eniwetok Atoll in 1948, and Operation Ranger and Operation Buster–Jangle at the Nevada Test Site. In 1951 he was the director of Operation Greenhouse series of nuclear tests in the Pacific. This saw the first American tests of boosted fission weapons, an important step towards thermonuclear weapons. He studied the effects of nuclear blasts, and co-authored a paper with John von Neumann on Mach stem formation, an important aspect of an air blast wave.

In spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler&#x27;s Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.

== Discovery of the neutrino and the inner workings of stars ==

The neutrino is a subatomic particle first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli on December 4, 1930. The particle was required to resolve the problem of missing energy in observations of beta decay, when a neutron decays into a proton and an electron. The new hypothetical particle was required to preserve the fundamental law of conservation of energy. Enrico Fermi renamed it the neutrino, Italian for &quot;little neutral one&quot;, and in 1934, proposed his theory of beta decay by which the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino:

The neutrino accounted for the missing energy, but Fermi&#x27;s theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that appeared to be impossible to observe directly. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, and concluded &quot;there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino.&quot;

In 1951, Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos and so prove their existence. At the conclusion of the Greenhouse test series, Reines had received permission from the head of T Division, J. Carson Mark, for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics. &quot;So why did we want to detect the free neutrino?&quot; he later explained, &quot;Because everybody said, you couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

According to Fermi&#x27;s theory, there was also a corresponding reverse reaction, in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron:

The positron would soon be annihilated by an electron and produce two 0.51 MeV gamma rays, while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a 2.2 MeV gamma ray. This would produce a distinctive signature that could be detected. They then realised that by adding cadmium salt to their liquid scintillator they would enhance the neutron capture reaction, resulting in a burst of gamma rays with a total energy of 9 MeV. For a neutrino source, they proposed using an atomic bomb. Permission for this was obtained from the laboratory director, Norris Bradbury. The plan was to detonate a &quot;20-kiloton nuclear bomb, comparable to that dropped on Hiroshima, Japan&quot;. The detector was proposed to be dropped at the moment of explosion into a hole 40 meters from the detonation site &quot;to catch the flux at its maximum&quot;; it was named &quot;El Monstro&quot;. Work began on digging a shaft for the experiment when J. M. B. Kellogg convinced them to use a nuclear reactor instead of a bomb. Although a less intense source of neutrinos, it had the advantage in allowing for multiple experiments to be carried out over a long period of time.

In 1953, they made their first attempts using one of the large reactors at the Hanford nuclear site in what is now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment; they named the experiment &quot;Project Poltergeist&quot;. Their detector included of scintillating fluid and 90 photomultiplier tubes, but the effort was frustrated by background noise from cosmic rays. With encouragement from John A. Wheeler, they tried again in 1955, this time using one of the newer, larger 700 MW reactors at the Savannah River Site that emitted a high neutrino flux of 1.2 x 1012 / cm2 sec. They also had a convenient, well-shielded location from the reactor and underground. On June 14, 1956, they were able to send Pauli a telegram announcing that the neutrino had been found. When Bethe was informed that he had been proven wrong, he said, &quot;Well, you shouldn&#x27;t believe everything you read in the papers.&quot;
From then on Reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino&#x27;s properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come. Cowan left Los Alamos in 1957 to teach at George Washington University, ending their collaboration. On the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino, Reines became the head of the physics department of Case Western Reserve University from 1959 to 1966. At Case, he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Reines had a booming voice, and had been a singer since childhood. During this time, besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department, Reines sang in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus under the direction of Robert Shaw in performances with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra.

In the early 1960s, Reines built a detector in the East Rand gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa. The site was chosen because of its depth, 3.5 km; on February 23, 1965, the new detector captured its first atmospheric neutrinos. Reines brought his friends, an engineer August &quot;Gus&quot; Hruschka from the US, they worked together with South African physicist Friedel Sellschop of the University of Witwatersrand. Equipment was made in the Case Institute, and 20 tonnes of scintillation fluid in 50 containment tanks were transported from the US. The decision to work in an apartheid racist country was challenged by many colleagues of Reines, he himself said that &quot;science transcended politics&quot;. The laboratory team in the mine was led by Reines&#x27; graduate students, first by William Kropp, and then by Henry Sobel. Experiment ran from 1963 and was closed in 1971, and captured 167 neutrino events.

In 1966, Reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new University of California, Irvine (UCI), becoming its first dean of physical sciences. At UCI, Reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors, such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy.

Reines had prepared for the possibility of measuring the distant events of a supernova explosion. Supernova explosions are rare, but Reines thought he might be lucky enough to see one in his lifetime, and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially-designed detectors. During his wait for a supernova to explode, he put signs on some of his large neutrino detectors, calling them &quot;Supernova Early Warning Systems&quot;. In 1987, neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A were detected by the Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven (IMB) Collaboration, which used an 8,000 ton Cherenkov detector located in a salt mine near Cleveland. Normally, the detectors recorded only a few background events each day. The supernova registered 19 events in just ten seconds. This discovery is regarded as inaugurating the field of neutrino astronomy.

In 1995 Reines was honored, along with Martin L. Perl, with the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work with Cowan in first detecting the neutrino. Unfortunately, Cowan had died in 1974 and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. Reines also received many other awards, including the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1981, the National Medal of Science in 1985, the Bruno Rossi Prize in 1989, the Michelson–Morley Award in 1990, the Panofsky Prize in 1992, and the Franklin Medal in 1992. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1980 and a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1994. He remained dean of physical sciences at UCI until 1974, and became a professor emeritus in 1988, but he continued teaching until 1991, and remained on UCI&#x27;s faculty until his death.

== Death ==

Reines died after a long illness at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center in Orange, California, on August 26, 1998. He was survived by his wife and children. His papers are compiled in the UCI Libraries. Frederick Reines Hall, which houses the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of California, Irvine, was named in his honor.

<text>Shelburne County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

==History==
Shelburne County was founded in 1784 shortly following the influx of Loyalist settlers evacuated from the newly independent United States. It was originally named Port Roseway, until it became a very busy town and was considered to be the capital of Nova Scotia, in which the name was changed to Shelburne in an attempt to please Lord Shelburne, the British Prime Minister from 1782 to 1783. The boundaries of Shelburne County were established by Governor and Council on December 16, 1785.

The first Loyalists arrived in May 1783. They were faced with a somewhat bleak environment in which to make their homes. The land is rocky with acidic soil. There is also much forest.

The area had previously been settled by French-speaking Catholic Acadians, many of whom had been deported to British Colonies. The new arrivals included Black Loyalists who were given substandard land, particularly around Birchtown. In 1796 about 600 Jamaican Maroons were deported to this area of Nova Scotia as well.

In 1824, at a time when the lines of a number of counties were being cut out and marked, the boundary between Queens and Shelburne Counties was surveyed.

In 1836 Shelburne County was divided into two separate and distinct counties with Yarmouth County being formed out of what had been part of Shelburne County.

In 1854, Shelburne County was divided into two districts for court sessional purposes - Shelburne and Barrington. In 1879, these districts were incorporated as district municipalities.

A 2023 wildfire near Barrington Lake became the largest wildfire in the history of Nova Scotia.

<doc id="155803" wikidata="Q767960" url="?curid=155803" title="William Sancroft">
<text>William Sancroft (30 January 161724 November 1693) was the 79th Archbishop of Canterbury, and was one of the Seven Bishops imprisoned in 1688 for seditious libel against King James II, over his opposition to the king&#x27;s Declaration of Indulgence. Deprived of his office in 1690 for refusing to swear allegiance to William and Mary, he later enabled and supported the consecration of new nonjuring bishops leading to the nonjuring schism.

== Life ==

Sancroft was born at Ufford Hall in Fressingfield, Suffolk, son of Francis Sandcroft (1580–1647) and Margaret Sandcroft née Butcher (1594–1631). He was educated at the Bury St Edmunds free grammar school before being admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in September 1633 and matriculating there in 1634. His uncle William Sancroft the Elder was then master of the college. He graduated B.A. in 1638, M.A. in 1641 and became a fellow in 1642, but was ejected in 1649 for refusing to accept the &quot;Engagement&quot;. He remained abroad till the Restoration, after which he was chosen one of the university preachers, and was elected Master of his &quot;alma mater&quot; Emmanuel College in 1662, serving until 1665. He began fundraising for a new chapel for the college in 1663 and contributed largely towards the cost. He continued to play a role in college affairs and the chapel was completed in 1667 to a design by Christopher Wren. 

In 1663 he was nominated to the deanery of York. He became Dean of St Paul&#x27;s in 1664, greatly assisting with the rebuilding of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral after the Great Fire of London, towards which he contributed £1400. He also rebuilt the deanery, and improved its revenue. He was criticized for leaving London during the Great Plague of 1665, though in his defence virtually all of the upper class did the same.

In 1668 he was admitted Archdeacon of Canterbury upon the king&#x27;s presentation, but he resigned the post in 1670. In 1677, being now prolocutor of the Convocation of the English Clergy, he was unexpectedly advanced to the archbishopric of Canterbury, at the express wish of the King, who trusted in his moderation. So unwilling was he to accept that the King only persuaded him by explaining that he had already appointed the new Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. He attended Charles II upon his deathbed, and &quot;made to him a very weighty exhortation, in which he used a good degree of freedom&quot;. He crowned King James II in 1685. Sancroft wrote with his own hand the petition presented in 1688 against the reading of the Declaration of Indulgence, which was signed by himself and six of his suffragans (collectively known as the Seven Bishops). For this, they (of whom Sancroft was oldest, at 71) were all committed to the Tower of London, but were acquitted.

===Nonjuring schism===

Upon the withdrawal of James II, Sancroft concurred with the Lords in a declaration to William III for a free parliament, and due indulgence to the Protestant dissenters. But, when William and his wife (James&#x27;s daughter) Mary were declared king and queen, he refused to take the oath to them, and was accordingly suspended and deprived in 1690. In August 1690 John Tillotson took over his duties. In April 1691 Tillotson officially became Sancroft&#x27;s successor.

Many years after it was composed, John Overall&#x27;s &quot;Convocation Book&quot; was published by Sancroft, to justify the principles of his Nonjuring party. The book was &quot;on the subject of Government, the divine institution of which was very positively asserted&quot;. It consisted partly of canons and partly of introductory and explanatory dissertations on the matter of the canons and had been duly sanctioned in the Convocation of 1610. It was, however, a strange oversight in Sancroft&#x27;s party to publish the book, as there are several canons in it which clearly lay down that a de facto government is, when completely established, to be held in the light of a de jure government; and it was upon the very grounds set forth in this book that William Sherlock took the oaths to King William.

Sancroft was a patron of Henry Wharton (1664–1695), the divine and church historian, to whom on his deathbed he entrusted his manuscripts and the remains of Archbishop Laud (published in 1695). Sancroft provided financial support to Mary Astell and an introduction to her future publisher; Astell later dedicated a collection of poetry to him.

From 5 August 1691 until his death two years later, he lived a very retired life in his native village of Fressingfield. He died at his family home, Ufford Hall, and was buried in the churchyard of Fressingfield, where there is a Latin epitaph to his memory.

<text>Victoria County is an historical county and census division of Nova Scotia, Canada. Local government is provided by the Municipality of the County of Victoria and the Wagmatcook 1 reserve.

==History==
Named after Queen Victoria, it was established by statute in 1851. Cape Breton County was divided into two separate counties in that year, with the northern portion becoming Victoria County.

Like other parts of Nova Scotia, the county was sparsely inhabited by the Miꞌkmaq, who hunted in the area.

The earliest settlers of Victoria County were almost exclusively Loyalists, with most arriving from the United States in the years following the American Revolutionary War. It was noted by historian G.G. Patterson in 1885 that &quot;In (Queen Victoria&#x27;s) broad domain upon which the sun never sets, we venture to say there dwell none more loyal than (Victoria County&#x27;s) few thousand inhabitants&quot;.

The man responsible for the early settling of Victoria County is widely considered to be Capt. Jonathan Jones, a Loyalist who originally captained a ship bringing applicants to the area who had received land grants in the late 1700s. Among these was a Mr. Cuyler, the former Mayor of Albany, NY, who had forfeited his holdings due to his loyalty to the British Crown and who was eager to settle in the Cape Breton colony. Cape Breton had been separated from the mainland and was declared a colony unto itself in 1784. Jones’ land grant bears the date 19 October 1790. Jones was appointed magistrate and given the land and all wood upon it with the exception of the white pine, which were reserved for the King&#x27;s use along with all mines and minerals. Jones was required to annually pay two shillings for every hundred acres to begin after the expiration of ten years. For every fifty acres of farmable land, Jones was required to clear and cultivate at least three acres and for every fifty acres of land deemed barren, he was required to keep upon it three cattle, until such time as three acres for every fifty be cleared. He was required also to erect a place of dwelling measuring no less than twenty feet in length and sixteen in breadth. Should any ground be rocky, he was by the terms of the grant compelled to employ a quarry or mine, employing one able man for every fifty acres. Should any of these conditions not be met, Jones’ grant would become void.
Any settler who wished to come into possession of a part of this land would make the following declaration, failure of which to do so resulted in the purchase being null and void:

Under Jones, many improvements were made, including the construction of Victoria County&#x27;s first sawmill, followed by a second sawmill at the mouth of the Baddeck River. Large crops of potatoes were subsequently produced in Victoria County, and ships would routinely carry this farm produce to Newfoundland for sale.

Though Jones is regarded as the first settler in Victoria County, local legend had some six or seven families settling at present-day Englishtown a few years prior to his arrival. An elderly Englishtown resident, well acquainted with the early history of the area, in the late 1880s told historian G.G. Patterson that the earliest settlers had arrived there between 1770 and 1780. Though Patterson believed these families had indeed settled there, he regarded the timeline as impossible, believing they could not have come before 1782 and that they most likely did not arrive until at least five years later. Patterson&#x27;s research indicated that these six or seven families reached St. Anne&#x27;s (as Englishtown was then known) at different times and by different routes in fishing vessels. They were chiefly English (surviving records identify two families as Guinn and Roberts), but records show one family from Ireland and a bachelor from Virginia who, a few years later, went insane and hung himself. Eight years later a German family named Willhausen arrived, and records show no further settlers arriving until an influx of Scots some 40 years later. Little attention was given to farming and the small community survived on the fishery. Little is known about these earliest settlers due to the fact that their immediate descendants subsequently emigrated to other areas in search of better conditions.

The chief means of transport was canoe by river and ship by sea, as no roads existed. A rather extensive network of paths and trails developed over time through the forests. Some communities such as Black Point were completely isolated, and remained so well into the twentieth century.

In a report dated 11 December 1861, it is noted that Victoria County at that time was settled largely by Scotch highlanders from the mainland and western islands of Scotland, with a few settlers from England, Ireland, and &quot;the low countries&quot;. The report noted &quot;a great want&quot; felt by these settlers for regular marts and fairs &quot;where seeds, cattle, etc. could be exchanged with mutual advantages, and possibly new articles of culture introduced, that for want of the facilities requisite for obtaining these, are never attempted to be raised by the county.&quot;

Though the census of 1818 gives no number, written accounts dating from 1820 state the population of the area from Cape North south to Big Bras d’Or as being &quot;no more than 100 families&quot; at that time.

<text>Yarmouth County is a rural county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It has both traditional Anglo-Scottish and Acadian French culture as well as significant inland wilderness areas, including over 365 lakes and several major rivers. It comprises three municipalities: the Town of Yarmouth, the Municipality of the District of Yarmouth, and the Municipality of the District of Argyle.

==History==
The name Yarmouth first appeared as a projected township in Nova Scotia in 1759. There is some speculation it was named after Yarmouth, Massachusetts, as some of the earliest English settlers arrived from Cape Cod on 9 June 1761. It is more likely the township was named after Lady Yarmouth, a mistress of King George II.

Originally the area was part of Lunenburg County. In 1761 it became part of Queens County; in 1784 it became part of Shelburne County and finally became a county on its own in 1836. The description of Yarmouth County was modified in 1846. It was then divided into two districts for court sessional purposes in 1856 – Yarmouth and Argyle. These two districts were subsequently incorporated as district municipalities in 1879. The county was a major international shipbuilding centre in the 19th century, producing hundreds of ships including the namesake County of Yarmouth in 1884.

In the second half of the 19th century, Yarmouth was the site of the creation of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.

==Geography==
The only town in the county is Yarmouth, which is one of three municipalities that comprise the county. The others are the Municipality of the District of Yarmouth and the Municipality of the District of Argyle. There are no incorporated villages in the county. The county also includes the Acadia First Nations, Yarmouth Reserve 33.

Bunker&#x27;s Island peninsula ia located in Yarmouth Harbour.

<text>William Whittlesey (or Whittlesea) (died 5 June 1374) was a Bishop of Rochester, then Bishop of Worcester, then finally Archbishop of Canterbury. He also served as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.

==Life==

Whittlesey was probably born in the Cambridgeshire village of Whittlesey, England.

Whittlesey was educated at Oxford, and owing principally to the fact that he was a nephew of Simon Islip, archbishop of Canterbury, he received numerous ecclesiastical preferments; he held prebends at Lichfield, Chichester and Lincoln, and livings at Ivychurch, Croydon and Cliffe.

Whittlesey was briefly appointed Master of Peterhouse on 10 September 1349 and resigned from that post in 1351. Later he was appointed vicar-general, and then dean of the court of arches by Islip. On 23 October 1360 he became Bishop of Rochester and was consecrated on 6 February 1362. Two years after his consecration he was transferred to the bishopric of Worcester on 6 March 1364. On 11 October 1368 Whittlesey was transferred to the archbishopric of Canterbury in succession to Simon Langham, but his term of office was very uneventful, a circumstance due partly, but not wholly, to his feeble health. He died at Lambeth on the 5th or 6 June 1374.

<text>Simon Langham (1310 – 22 July 1376) was an English clergyman who was Archbishop of Canterbury and a cardinal.

==Life==
Langham was born at Langham in Rutland. The manor of Langham was a property of Westminster Abbey, and he had become a monk in the Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at Westminster by 1346, and later prior and then abbot of this house. He was the son of Thomas Langham who was buried in the abbey.

===Treasurer of England===
In November 1360, Langham was made Treasurer of England and on 10 January 1362 he became Bishop of Ely and was consecrated on 20 March 1362. During his time as Bishop of Ely he was a major benefactor of Peterhouse, Cambridge, giving them the rectory of Cherry Hinton. He resigned the treasurership before 20 February 1363, and was appointed Chancellor of England on 21 February 1363.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
He was chosen Archbishop of Canterbury on 24 July 1366.

Perhaps the most interesting incident in Langham&#x27;s primacy was when he drove the secular clergy from Canterbury College, Oxford and filled their places with monks or friars in 1366. The expelled head of the seculars was a certain John de Wiclif, who has been identified with the reformer John Wycliffe. In 1371 Wycliffe&#x27;s appeal to Rome was decided and was unfavourable to him. The incident was typical of the ongoing rivalry between monks and secular clergy at Oxford University at this time.

Notwithstanding the part Langham as Chancellor had taken in the anti-papal measures of 1365 and 1366, he was made cardinal of San Sisto Vecchio by Pope Urban V in 1368. This lost him the favour of Edward III; two months later, he resigned his archbishopric and went to Avignon. He had already resigned the chancellorship on 18 July 1367. He was soon allowed to hold other although less exalted positions in England.

==Death==

In 1374, he was elected Archbishop of Canterbury for the second time, but he withdrew his claim and died at Avignon on 22 July 1376. He was buried in Avignon but his body was moved to Westminster Abbey in 1379. Langham&#x27;s tomb, in the chapel of St Benedict, is the work of Henry Yevele and Stephen Lote, and dates from 1389-1395. It is the oldest monument to an ecclesiastic in the Abbey.

Langham left the residue of his large estate and his library to Westminster Abbey, and has been called its second founder. His bequest paid for the building of the western section of the nave. The books he gave are listed in &quot;The Manuscripts of Westminster Abbey&quot; (1909) by J. A. Robinson and M. R. James.

<text>John de Stratford ( – 1348) was Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop of Winchester, Treasurer and Chancellor of England.

==Early life==
Stratford was born into the landed Stratford family of Stratford-on-Avon around 1275. His father was Robert de Stratford (not to be confused with John&#x27;s brother, Robert Stratford) and his mother was named Isabel. Robert senior has been identified as ‘Master’ Robert, co-founder and first master of the hospital of St Cross within the town, but in view of the title magister and the celibate status required, this appears unlikely. The family was related to the Hattons, important men in the town, Ralph Hatton ‘of Stratford’, the future bishop of London, being John&#x27;s nephew. He was a relative of Andrew De Stratford and of Thomas de Stratford and Henry de Stratford (whom he inducted as the rector of a vacant church in North Berkhamstead (Lincoln) on 16 February 1325). Nothing definite is known of Stratford&#x27;s schooling. He studied at Oxford (not at Merton College, as claimed by the 17th Century antiquarian Anthony Wood, but probably Baliol, whom he remembered in his will), and by 1312 he was entitled doctor of civil law. He entered the service of Worcester Priory, but initially his beneficial progress was slow. However, by 1317 he was rector of Holy Trinity, Stratford, and acting as official of Bishop John Dalderby of Lincoln (d. 1320), whose executor he became. From Lincoln he migrated to Canterbury, and the service of Archbishop Walter Reynolds (d. 1327). He was dean of the court of arches in the early 1320s, by which time he held a useful portfolio of benefices, including canonries at Lichfield, Lincoln, and York, as well as the archdeaconry of Lincoln.

==Career==

Stratford served as archdeacon of Lincoln, canon of York and dean of the court of arches before 20 June 1323, when he became Bishop of Winchester, an appointment which was made during his visit to Pope John XXII at Avignon and which was very much disliked by Edward II. In 1327 the bishop joined Queen Isabella&#x27;s partisans; he drew up the six articles against Edward II, and was one of those who visited the captive king at Kenilworth to urge him to abdicate in favour of his son. On 26 November 1326 he was appointed Lord Treasurer of England, a post he held until 28 January 1327.

Under Edward III, John de Stratford (Bishop of Winchester) became a member of the royal council from its inception in February 1327. Stratford is often regarded as the main clerical ally of the party of Earl Henry of Lancaster inside the council. Together with Thomas Wake, Stratford helped organize the London petition of grievances (27 September 1328) against the government of Mortimer &amp; Isabella. 

His high political importance dates from the autumn of 1330, the time when Roger Mortimer lost his power. Edward III appointed Stratford as his new chancellor on 28 November, 1330. For the next ten years Stratford was actively engaged in public business, being the king&#x27;s most prominent adviser and being politically, says Stubbs, the &quot;head of the Lancastrian or constitutional party.&quot;

In 1329 and 1332 he was involved in the case of Christina Carpenter who was an achoress in a cell in Shere in Kent. She escaped from her cell and asked to be readmitted so she could die as a recluse.

On 3 November 1333 Stratford was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury and he resigned the chancellorship in the following year (28 September, 1334). However, Stratford held the office of chancellor again for two years (from 6 June, 1335 to 24 March, 1337), when he was succeeded by his younger brother Robert de Stratford (then archdeacon of Canterbury), who had already acted frequently as &quot;locum tenens&quot; during his brother&#x27;s absences. The elder Stratford was appointed for a third time as chancellor on 28 April, 1340, serving for about two months before resigning because of ill health. He was succeeded again by his younger brother Robert (now Bishop of Chichester) on 20 June, 1340. 

In November 1340 Edward III, humiliated, impecunious and angry, returned suddenly to England from Flanders and vented his wrath upon the archbishop&#x27;s brother, the chancellor, Robert de Stratford, as well as briefly imprisoning Henry de Stratford. Fearing arrest the archbishop fled to Canterbury, and entered upon a violent war of words with the king, and by his firm conduct led to the establishment of the principle that peers were only to be tried in full parliament before their own order (&quot;en pleyn parlement et devant les piers&quot;). But good relations were soon restored between the two, and the archbishop acted as president of the council during Edward&#x27;s absence from England in 1345 and 1346, although he never regained his former position of influence.

==Later life and death==
Though Stratford&#x27;s political career was by now largely over, between 1342 and his death he continued to exert influence as an elder statesman, even being dubbed &quot;dux regis&quot; by Dene. In June 1348 he fell ill at Maidstone. He died on 23 August at his manor of Mayfield, Sussex, according to ‘Birchington’ in an aura of sanctity, and was buried in his cathedral on 9 September where his alabaster effigy, somewhat damaged, lies on a fine canopied tomb, in a prominent position on the south side of the choir next to Prior Eastry&#x27;s screen, as he had requested in his will.

==Legacy==

Stratford&#x27;s Canterbury register has not survived, but a large number of his acta can be gleaned from other sources. He was a notable legislator, drawing up detailed ordinances for the conduct of the court of Canterbury in 1342, while three sets of provincial constitutions, issued between 1341 and 1343, are attributed to him. The first set was clearly a draft, the second is particularly concerned with ecclesiastical administration and discipline, while the third was designed to preserve church liberties and deals with areas of friction between laymen and ecclesiastics. He was a notable benefactor to the hospital of St Thomas the Martyr at Canterbury, known as Eastbridge Hospital, but his efforts were principally directed towards his native Stratford, where he founded a chantry college with the same dedication. The initial foundation (1331) was for a warden, sub-warden, and three priests, but in 1336 an augmentation allowed for a further eight priests, though whether the full complement was ever achieved is uncertain. He secured the appropriation of the parish church to the foundation and a papal bull of confirmation was issued in 1345.

Opinion is divided as to Stratford&#x27;s character, intentions, and stature. He has been compared unfavourably with his predecessors John Pecham (d. 1292) and Robert Winchelsey (d. 1313), but it was partly due to his moderation and legal training that the change of monarch was accomplished so smoothly in 1326–7. He certainly had a concern for what have been called ‘Lancastrian’ principles, in particular the importance of parliament. During the regime of Isabella and Mortimer he hazarded his career, perhaps his life, to maintain them. Without question he was a staunch defender of the liberties of the English church. The fourth of the statutes of 1340, conceded by Edward III under constraint of circumstances, he circulated triumphantly as a ‘charter of liberties’. His clerical petitions of May 1341 were incorporated in modified form into statutes of that date, which were summarily revoked by the king a few months later as contrary to English law and his own prerogative. That he was ambitious is self-evident, but it would be indefensible to argue that he had no underlying convictions. Although he had laboured long in the cause of peace, by 1337 he was forced to accept the inevitability of war with France, though not at the price of oppression at home. Even then he was not prepared to organize opposition to Edward III, doubtless because he had no desire to renew the civil strife of the previous reign. He may have been guilty of pride (superbia), as the frustrated king alleged, but he was not a foolish man. His reasoned defence in 1340–41 taught Edward a lesson he had the good sense never to forget.

<text>Chip and Dale (also spelled Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale) are a cartoon duo of anthropomorphic chipmunks created by The Walt Disney Company, who debuted in the 1943 short film &quot;Private Pluto&quot;.

== Concept ==
The characters were first drawn by Bill Justice and introduced in the 1943 Pluto short &quot;Private Pluto&quot;, directed by Clyde Geronimi. In the short, they fight with Pluto about whether they can store their nuts in a military base cannon. Three years later, director Jack Hannah decided to use them as co-stars in Donald Duck shorts. Hannah said:

Of the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming. Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor. Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: Chip has a small black nose and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and a prominent gap between his buckteeth. Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale&#x27;s tends to be ruffled.

In most cartoons, they are paired with Mickey Mouse, or most often, Pluto and Donald Duck, whom they usually battle when they see an activity they do out of curiosity or when they try to get food without getting caught by them. They were given their own series in the 1950s, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: &quot;Chicken in the Rough&quot; (1951), &quot;Two Chips and a Miss&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Lone Chipmunks&quot; (1954). The duo was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film three times in four years: in 1946 for &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Rights&quot; (against Mickey and Pluto), in 1947 for &quot;Chip an&#x27; Dale&quot; and in 1949 for &quot;Toy Tinkers&quot; (both against Donald Duck). In the 1980s, they became the lead characters of a half-hour television series, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, in which they have adventures as leaders of a detective agency.

Their names may be a pun on the name of the 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale, as suggested by Bill &quot;Tex&quot; Henson, a story artist at the studio.

==List of Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale shorts==
Chip and Dale appear in the following 23 animated short films.

Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale also had their own comic book title, first from Dell Comics with &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #517, 581, and 636, then their own title for issues #4–30 (1955–62), which was then continued by Gold Key Comics with #1–64 (1967–80), and later under its brand Whitman with #65–83 (1980–84).

==TV series==
===&quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;===

In 1989, Chip and Dale became the title characters in a new animated television series, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, in which they formed a detective agency with new characters created for the show: female mouse inventor Gadget Hackwrench, muscular adventuring Australian mouse Monterey Jack and Zipper the fly. While in the original shorts, the duo is frequent troublemakers who are concerned only with themselves, in &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot;, they are crime fighters who help the less fortunate.

In this series, the personality differences between the two are more pronounced, with Chip as the serious, heroic leader and Dale as the quick-witted, hard partying reluctant hero. Additionally, they wear clothes in this series which reflect their personalities; Chip wears a leather jacket and fedora (much like Indiana Jones), while Dale wears a Hawaiian shirt (much like &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;).

===&quot;DuckTales&quot;===
Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, based on their &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot; iterations, made an appearance in the 2017 TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Making their debut in the season 3 episode, &quot;Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!&quot;, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale are depicted as ordinary chipmunks used as lab rats for an intelligence ray developed by the organization F.O.W.L. After becoming much smarter and anthropomorphic, they teamed up with two mice and a fly to escape their confines as well as help Launchpad McQuack defeat one of F.O.W.L.&#x27;s agents. They also make a cameo appearance alongside the other Rangers in the series finale, &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot;.

=== &quot;Chip &#x27;N Dale&#x27;s Nutty Tales&quot; ===

Chip &#x27;n Dale star in a CGI preschool short series, spin-off of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures.

===&quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Park Life&quot;===

The characters have a French-American animated series called &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Park Life&quot;, which was released on Disney+ on July 28, 2021, which was co-produced by The Walt Disney Company France and Xilam Animation. Unlike other iterations of the characters, the series is non-verbal, similarly to other shows produced by Xilam. The series portrays Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale&#x27;s adventures living in a park where they often interact with Clarice, Donald Duck, Pluto, and other mostly Duckburg-centric Disney characters. The chipmunks are portrayed in only semi-humanized form, much as in late-1940s cartoon shorts.

==Film==
A hybrid live-action/animated film, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, was released on May 16, 2022, with animation of the characters provided by Moving Picture Company and their voices by John Mulaney and Andy Samberg. The movie was released as a Disney+ original.
==Other appearances==
Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale were planned to appear as a cameo in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. They were supposed to be in the scene called &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot;. However, the scene was cut from the final film. Storyboard artwork for this sequence survives, where they can be seen alongside characters such as Goofy, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse, Herman and Katnip, Popeye, Bluto, Felix the Cat, Porky Pig, Petunia Pig, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Casper the Friendly Ghost and Droopy.

They can also be spotted in the 1983 featurette &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; where they are seen dancing to the music inside Fezziwigs. They also appear at all the Disney Parks as well. Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale occasionally appeared in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.

Chip and Dale are part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios characters that take a group photo at the end of the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. They also appear during the end credits along with Spike the Bee, another recurring rival of Donald Duck.

==Voice actors==
The classic voices of Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale were mostly provided by Jimmy MacDonald, Dessie (Flynn) Miller and Helen Silbert. The earliest voices were provided by female office staff, without credit. In &quot;Private Pluto&quot; their voices were created by speeding-up sound clips of normal speech. In a number of the shorts that followed, many of these same sound clips were used again, though later shorts used dialogue specifically recorded for that short.

At one point in &quot;Winter Storage&quot;, Chip and Dale get into an argument while being caught in a trap. When the scene switches to an outside view of the box (with Donald Duck sitting on the box), the dialogue being heard is actually a sped-up segment of the voice-over narration (done by John Brown) from the Goofy short &quot;A Knight for a Day&quot;.

Since 1988, Chip and Dale have been voiced by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton respectively, although MacNeille has provided the voice for both in &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. John Mulaney and Andy Samberg voiced the two in the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; live-action film. In the film, the high-pitched voices of the television series were explained as an act by the otherwise normally speaking chipmunks.

<text>Aspidistra is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted . &quot;Aspidistra elatior&quot; is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to .

==Description==

Species of &quot;Aspidistra&quot; are perennial herbaceous plants growing from rhizomes. The leaves are either solitary or are grouped in small &quot;tufts&quot; of two to four. They arise more or less directly from the rhizome, rather than being borne on stems. Each leaf has a long stalk (petiole) and a blade with many veins. The flowering stem (scape) is usually very short so that the flowers appear low down among the leaves. The fleshy flowers are bell-, urn- or cup-shaped. They vary considerably in size and shape, although few are showy. The flowers of &quot;A. longipedunculata&quot; are yellow and, unusually for the genus, are borne on scapes up to high. &quot;A. grandiflora&quot; has spider-like flowers up to across. The flower has a large stigma with a flattened top. The fruit is a berry, often with a single seed.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Aspidistra&quot; was named by the English botanist John Ker Gawler in 1822, as a blend of Greek ασπίς/ασπίδ- &quot;aspid-&quot;, meaning shield, and the name of the sister genus &quot;Tupistra&quot;. The genus was at one time placed in a broadly defined Liliaceae, along with many other lilioid monocots. It has also been placed in the families Convallariaceae and Ruscaceae. The APG III system of 2009 places it in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae.

===Species===

&quot;Aspidistra&quot; is a genus that was largely ignored by field botanists until the 1980s onwards, and there has been a rapid rise in the number of recognised species since then. Some 8 to 10 species were known in the late 1970s; 30 new species were described from China in the 1980s. Subsequently, more new species were found in Vietnam. The online &quot;Flora of China&quot; uses a narrow definition of species, producing a total of about 55, saying that the genus has &quot;never been well studied&quot;. In 2008, Tillich provided the key to the 93 species known at that time.

==Distribution and ecology==
Species of &quot;Aspidistra&quot; are part of the ground flora, growing in forests and under shrubs, in areas of high rainfall, from eastern India, Indochina and China through to Japan. The largest number of species are found in Guangxi Province, China, with Vietnam occupying second place. Few species have a broad distribution, with many being endemic to China or Vietnam.

It has long been said that slugs and snails pollinate &quot;Aspidistra&quot; flowers. This has been described as a &quot;myth&quot;. Amphipods, small terrestrial crustaceans, are responsible for pollinating &quot;A. elatior&quot; in Japan. Amphipods have also been shown to pollinate species of &quot;Aspidistra&quot; introduced to Australia. Springtails and fungus gnats have also been suggested as pollinators. The newly described Vietnamese species &quot;A. phanluongii&quot; is probably pollinated by flies of the genus &quot;Megaselia&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==

&quot;Aspidistra elatior&quot;, the &quot;cast-iron plant&quot;, is a popular houseplant, surviving shade, cool conditions and neglect. It is one of several species of &quot;Aspidistra&quot; that can be grown successfully outdoors in shade in temperate climates, where they will generally cope with temperatures down to , being killed by frosts of or below. In addition to shade, aspidistras require an open, acidic and humus-rich soil. Species suggested for growing outdoors in the UK include &quot;A. diabuensis&quot;, &quot;A. elatior&quot;, &quot;A. lurida&quot;, &quot;A. typica&quot;, &quot;A. zongbyi&quot; and their cultivars.

In Japan, leaves of &quot;A. elatior&quot; have traditionally been cut into pieces and used in bento and osechi boxes to keep each food separated. However, imitations called &quot;baran&quot; are commonly used now.

==In popular culture==

As a popular foliage houseplant, &quot;A. elatior&quot; became popular in late Victorian Britain and was so common that it became a &quot;symbol of dull middle-class respectability&quot;. As such, it was central to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, as a symbol of the need of the middle class to maintain respectability according to Gordon Comstock, the novel&#x27;s protagonist. It was further immortalised in the 1938 song &quot;The Biggest Aspidistra in the World&quot;, which, as sung by Gracie Fields, became a popular wartime classic. An aspidistra is mentioned in the Wallace and Gromit short, &quot;The Autochef&quot;, from the &quot;Cracking Contraptions&quot; series. In two Dorothy L. Sayers books from the mid-1930s, &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot;, characters make disparaging remarks about aspidistras.

Aspidistras can withstand deep shade, neglect, dry soil, hot temperatures and polluted indoor air (from burning coal or natural gas) but are sensitive to bright sunlight.

&quot;Aspidistra&quot; was the codename (inspired by the above song) of a very powerful British radio transmitter used for propaganda and deception purposes against Nazi Germany during World War II.

The 1980s British television show &quot;The Adventure Game&quot; featured a moving aspidistra called the Rangdo of Arg, operated by Kenny Baker.

<text>William de Corbeil or William of Corbeil (21 November 1136) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury. Very little is known of William&#x27;s early life or his family, except that he was born at Corbeil, south-east of Paris, and that he had two brothers. Educated as a theologian, he taught briefly before serving the bishops of Durham and London as a clerk and subsequently becoming an Augustinian canon. William was elected to the See of Canterbury as a compromise candidate in 1123, the first canon to become an English archbishop. He succeeded Ralph d&#x27;Escures who had employed him as a chaplain.

Throughout his archbishopric, William was embroiled in a dispute with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, over the primacy of Canterbury. As a temporary solution, Pope Honorius II appointed William the papal legate for England, giving him powers superior to those of York. William concerned himself with the morals of the clergy, and presided over three legatine councils, which among other things condemned the purchase of benefices or priesthoods, and admonished the clergy to live a celibate life. He was also known as a builder; among his constructions is the keep of Rochester Castle. Towards the end of his life William was instrumental in the selection of Count Stephen of Boulogne as King of England, despite his oath to the dying King Henry I that he would support the succession of his daughter, the Empress Matilda. Although some chroniclers considered him a perjurer and a traitor for crowning Stephen, none doubted his piety.

==Early life==
William de Corbeil was most likely born at Corbeil on the Seine, possibly in about 1070. He was educated at Laon, where he studied under Anselm of Laon, the noted scholastic and teacher of theology. William taught for a time at Laon, but nothing else is known of his early life. All that is known of his parents or ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot; his brothers appear as witnesses on William&#x27;s charters.

William joined the service of Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, as a clerk, and was present at the translation of the body of Saint Cuthbert in 1104. His name appears high in a list of those who were present at the event, implying that he may have held an important position in Flambard&#x27;s household, but appended to his name is &quot;subsequently archbishop&quot;, suggesting that his inclusion could have been a later interpolation. He was a teacher to Flambard&#x27;s children, probably in about 1107 to 1109, but at some unknown date William appears to have transferred to the household of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Between 1107 and 1112 he went to Laon and attended lectures given by Anselm of Laon. By 1116 he was a clerk for Ralph d&#x27;Escures, Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he travelled to Rome in 1117 when Ralph was in dispute with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, over the primacy of Canterbury.

In 1118, William entered the Augustinian order at Holy Trinity Priory in Aldgate, a house of canons rather than monks. Subsequently, he became prior of the Augustinian priory at St Osyth in Essex, appointed by Richard de Beaumis, Bishop of London, in 1121.

==Election as archbishop==

After the death of Ralph d&#x27;Escures in October 1122, King Henry I allowed a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom disagreed on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted that it should be a clerk (i.e. a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury&#x27;s monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d&#x27;Escures had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.

On 2 February or 4 February 1123, William was chosen from among four candidates to the See of Canterbury; the names of the three unsuccessful candidates are unknown. He appears to have been a compromise candidate, as he was at least a canon, if not the monk that the chapter had sought. William was the first Augustinian canon to become an archbishop in England, a striking break with the tradition that had favoured monks in the See of Canterbury. Although most contemporaries would not have considered there to be much of a distinction between monks and canons, William&#x27;s election still occasioned some trepidation among the monks of the Canterbury chapter, who were &quot;alarmed at the appointment, since he was a clerk&quot;.

==Primacy dispute==
William, like every other Canterbury archbishop since Lanfranc, maintained that Canterbury held primacy—in essence, overlordship—over all other dioceses in Great Britain, including the archbishopric of York. Thurstan had claimed independence, and refused to consecrate William when the latter demanded recognition of Canterbury&#x27;s primacy; the ceremony was performed instead by William&#x27;s own suffragan bishops on 18 February 1123. Previous popes had generally favoured York&#x27;s side of the dispute, and the successive popes Paschal II, Gelasius II, and Calixtus II had issued rulings in the late 1110s and early 1120s siding with York. Calixtus had also consecrated Thurstan when both King Henry and William&#x27;s predecessor had attempted to prevent Thurstan&#x27;s consecration unless Thurstan submitted to Canterbury.

After travelling to Rome to receive his pallium, the symbol of his authority as an archbishop, William discovered that Thurstan had arrived before him, and had presented a case against William&#x27;s election to Pope Callixtus II. There were four objections to William&#x27;s election: first that he was elected in the king&#x27;s court; second that the chapter of Canterbury had been coerced and was unwilling; third that his consecration was unlawful because it was not performed by Thurstan; and fourth that a monk should be elected to the See of Canterbury, which had been founded by Augustine of Canterbury, a monk. However, King Henry I and the Emperor Henry V, Henry I&#x27;s son-in-law, persuaded the pope to overlook the irregularities of the election, with the proviso that William swore to obey &quot;all things that the Pope imposed upon him&quot;. At the conclusion of the visit the pope denied the primacy of Canterbury over York, dismissing the Canterbury cathedral chapter&#x27;s supposed papal documents as forgeries. The outcome was in accordance with most earlier papal rulings on the primacy issue, which involved not taking sides and thus reinforcing papal supremacy. William returned to England, and was enthroned at Canterbury on 22 July 1123.

The archbishop&#x27;s next opponent was the papal legate of the new Pope Honorius II, Cardinal John of Crema, who arrived in England in 1125. A compromise between York and Canterbury was negotiated, which involved Canterbury allowing York the supervision of the dioceses of Bangor, Chester, and St Asaph in return for Thurstan&#x27;s verbal submission and the written submission of his successors. The pope, however, rejected the agreement, likely because he wished to preserve his own primacy, and substituted his own resolution. The papal solution was that Honorius would appoint William papal legate in England and Scotland, which was done in 1126, giving William the position over York, but it was dependent on the will of the pope, and would lapse on the pope&#x27;s death. The arrangement merely postponed the problem however, as neither Thurstan nor William renounced their claims. That Christmas, at a royal court, Thurstan unsuccessfully attempted to claim the right to ceremonially crown the king as well as have his episcopal cross carried before him in Canterbury&#x27;s province. As a result of his lengthy dispute with Thurstan, William travelled to Rome more frequently than any bishop before him except for Wilfrid in the 7th century.

==Archiepiscopal activities==

Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 were held in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the direction of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but also to publicise the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy&#x27;s households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William&#x27;s allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.

As well as the councils, William was active in his diocese, and was interested in reforming the churches in his diocese. A conflict with Alexander of Lincoln over a church in Alexander&#x27;s diocese led to further condemnation by Henry of Huntingdon and prompted Henry to write that &quot;no one can sing [William&#x27;s] praises because there&#x27;s nothing to sing about.&quot; William seems to have been somewhat eclipsed in ecclesiastical administration and appointments by Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and King Henry&#x27;s primary advisor. William reformed the nunnery of Minster-in-Sheppey however, and he installed a college of regular canons at the church of St. Gregory&#x27;s, in Canterbury. He also secured a profession of obedience from the newly installed abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury. His legateship from Honorius lapsed when the pope died in February 1130, but it was renewed by Honorius&#x27; successor Pope Innocent II in 1132.

During William&#x27;s last years he attempted to reform St Martin&#x27;s, Dover. The king had granted the church to the archbishop and the diocese of Canterbury in 1130, and William had a new church building constructed near Dover. The archbishop had planned to install canons regular into the church, and on William&#x27;s deathbed dispatched a party of canons from Merton Priory to take over St Martin&#x27;s. However, the party of canons, who had been accompanied by two bishops and some other clergy, were prevented from entering by a monk of Canterbury Cathedral, who claimed that St Martin&#x27;s belonged to the monks of the cathedral chapter. The canons from Merton did not press the issue in the face of the Canterbury chapter&#x27;s appeal to Rome, and after William&#x27;s death, the cathedral chapter sent 12 monks to St Martin&#x27;s instead.

The construction of the keep of Rochester Castle—at , the tallest Norman-built keep in England—was initiated at William&#x27;s orders. Built for King Henry, it is still intact, although it no longer has a roof or floors. The work at Rochester was built within the stone curtain walls that Gundulf of Rochester had erected in the late 11th century. The keep was designed for defence and also to provide comfortable living quarters, which were probably intended for use by the archbishops when they visited Rochester. In 1127, the custody of Rochester Castle was granted to William and his successors as archbishop by King Henry, including the right to fortify the place as the archbishops wished, and the right to garrison the castle with their own men. In the view of the historian Judith Green, the grant of the castle was partly to secure the loyalty of the archbishop to the king, and partly to help secure the defences of the Kent coast. William also completed the construction of Canterbury Cathedral, which was dedicated in May 1130.

==Final years==
The archbishop swore to Henry I that he would support Henry&#x27;s daughter Matilda&#x27;s claim to the English throne, but after Henry&#x27;s death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22 December 1135. He was persuaded to do so by Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen&#x27;s brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore he had been present at the king&#x27;s deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.

William did not long outlive Henry, dying at Canterbury on 21 November 1136. He was buried in the north transept of Canterbury Cathedral. Contemporaries were grudging in their praise, and William&#x27;s reputation suffered after the accession of Matilda&#x27;s son, Henry II, to the English throne. William of Malmesbury said that William was a courteous and sober man, with little of the flamboyant lifestyle of the more &quot;modern&quot; bishops. The author of the &quot;Gesta Stephani&quot; claimed that William was avaricious and hoarded money. None of the chroniclers doubted his piety, even when they named him a perjurer and a traitor for his coronation of Stephen.

<text>Irène Marie Jacob (born 15 July 1966) is a French-Swiss actress known for her work with Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski. She won the 1991 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for the Kieślowski film &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot;, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her 1994 film &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot;. Her other film appearances include &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993), &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot; (1995), &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998), and &quot;Eternity&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Irène Jacob was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a western suburb of Paris. The youngest child with three older brothers, she was raised in a highly educated and intellectual family and environment: her father, Maurice Jacob, was a physicist; her mother, a psychologist; one brother, Francis Jacob, a musician; and her other two brothers, scientists. In 1969, at the age of three, Irène moved with her family to Geneva, Switzerland, where she became interested in the arts.

Jacob developed an interest in performing after seeing the films of Charlie Chaplin. &quot;They took my heart&quot;, she has recalled. &quot;They made me laugh and cry, and that was exactly what I was waiting for in a film: to awaken me to my feelings.&quot;

She made her stage debut in 1977 at the age of 11. She attended the Geneva Conservatory of Music and earned a degree in languages (she speaks fluent French, English, German, and Italian). She also studied at the Drama Studio in London, England. In 1984, she moved to Paris, where she studied acting at the prestigious &quot;Rue Blanche&quot; (the French national drama academy).

==Career==
In Paris, the 21-year-old drama student obtained her first film role in the Louis Malle film &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot; (1987), playing the part of a piano teacher. She followed her film debut with several French movies—mostly minor roles—over the next four years.

Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski cast her in the lead role of his film &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; (1991), the allegorical story of two young women, one in Poland and the other in France, both of whom are played by Jacob. For her performance, Jacob won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.

From 1992 to 1993, despite numerous offers from Hollywood that came in the wake of her success, including the lead role in &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, Jacob focused on smaller French films.

Jacob gained international acclaim as the protagonist in Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot; (1994), which received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. The film was also named Best Film or Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle Awards, National Society of Film Critics Awards, and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. It received César Award nominations for Best Film, Best Actor (Jean-Louis Trintignant), Best Actress (Irène Jacob), Best Director (Krzysztof Kieślowski), Best Writing (Krzysztof Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz). &quot;The New York Times&quot; included the film in its list of &quot;The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made.&quot;

Naturally an introvert, Jacob has the remarkable ability to express the emotional turmoil of her characters with very few words. This was very evident in her performance in &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot;, the third part of Kieślowski&#x27;s trilogy. Jacob described her unique experience working with the Polish film director:

Her performance in &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot; gained huge international recognition, bringing further offers from major American motion-picture studios. Jacob retreated from public attention and took nine months off, spending most of her time reading Tolstoy, Balzac, Singer, and several autobiographies.

From 1995 to 1999, Jacob made a series of American and European films that met with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. In 1995, she appeared in six films, including &quot;Victory&quot;, with Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill; Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot;; and Oliver Parker&#x27;s adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, in which Jacob spoke all of her lines in English for the first time on film. In the following years, she made several moderately successful American films, including &quot;Incognito&quot; (1997); &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998), starring opposite Wesley Snipes and Tommy Lee Jones; &quot;The Big Brass Ring&quot; (1999), with William Hurt; and &quot;Spy Games&quot; (1999), with Bill Pullman and Bruno Kirby.

Beginning in 2000, Jacob&#x27;s film career slowed down, and after a series of independent, mostly European films, she revived her theatre career. In 2000, she played the title character in &quot;Madame Melville&quot; opposite Macaulay Culkin in London&#x27;s West End. In 2016, she began appearing as a featured character in Season 3 of the Showtime series &quot;The Affair&quot;.

In August 2018, Jacob appeared at the Edinburgh Festival in a one-hour dramatization of the novella &quot;La Maladie de la mort (The Malady of Death)&quot; by Marguerite Duras. Jacob played the role of the unseen narrator.

Jacob is author of the book &quot;Big Bang&quot; published in 2019.

<text>The sievert (symbol: Sv) is a unit in the International System of Units (SI) intended to represent the stochastic health risk of ionizing radiation, which is defined as the probability of causing radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage. The sievert is important in dosimetry and radiation protection. It is named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.

The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose, which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, and committed dose, which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), one sievert results in a 5.5% probability of eventually developing fatal cancer based on the disputed linear no-threshold model of ionizing radiation exposure.

To calculate the value of stochastic health risk in sieverts, the physical quantity absorbed dose is converted into equivalent dose and effective dose by applying factors for radiation type and biological context, published by the ICRP and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). One sievert equals 100 rem, which is an older, CGS radiation unit. 

Conventionally, deterministic health effects due to acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, produced by high dose rates of radiation, are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray (Gy).

==Definition==

===CIPM definition of the sievert===

The SI definition given by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) says:

&quot;The quantity dose equivalent &quot;H&quot; is the product of the absorbed dose &quot;D&quot; of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor &quot;Q&quot; (quality factor) defined as a function of linear energy transfer by the ICRU&quot;

:&quot;H&quot; = &quot;Q&quot; × &quot;D&quot;

The value of &quot;Q&quot; is not defined further by CIPM, but it requires the use of the relevant ICRU recommendations to provide this value.

The CIPM also says that &quot;in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose &quot;D&quot; and the dose equivalent &quot;H&quot;, the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose &quot;D&quot; and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent &quot;H&quot;&quot;.

In summary:

:gray: quantity &quot;D&quot;—absorbed dose
::1 Gy = 1 joule/kilogram—a physical quantity. 1 Gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter or tissue.

:sievert: quantity &quot;H&quot;—equivalent dose
::1 Sv = 1 joule/kilogram—a biological effect. The sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue. The ratio to absorbed dose is denoted by &quot;Q&quot;.

===ICRP definition of the sievert===
The ICRP definition of the sievert is:
: &quot;The sievert is the special name for the SI unit of equivalent dose, effective dose, and operational dose quantities. The unit is joule per kilogram.&quot;

The sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the ICRP and ICRU.

==External dose quantities==

When the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue, the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities. To relate these actual received doses to likely health effects, protection quantities have been developed to predict the likely health effects using the results of large epidemiological studies. Consequently, this has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the ICRU working with the ICRP.

The external dose quantities and their relationships are shown in the accompanying diagram. The ICRU is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities, based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology, and the ICRP is primarily responsible for the protection quantities, based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body.

===Naming conventions===
The ICRU/ICRP dose quantities have specific purposes and meanings, but some use common words in a different order. There can be confusion between, for instance, &quot;equivalent dose&quot; and &quot;dose equivalent&quot;.

Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function (Q) of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990 developed the &quot;protection&quot; dose quantities &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;equivalent&quot; dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase &quot;dose equivalent&quot; in their name. Only the operational dose quantities which still use Q for calculation retain the phrase &quot;dose equivalent&quot;. However, there are joint ICRU/ICRP proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities. These were outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015, and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing &quot;dose to lens of eye&quot; and &quot;dose to local skin&quot; as &quot;equivalent doses&quot;.

In the USA there are differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP nomenclature.

===Physical quantities===
These are directly measurable physical quantities in which no allowance has been made for biological effects. Radiation fluence is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time, kerma is the ionising effect on air of gamma rays and X-rays and is used for instrument calibration, and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass in the matter or tissue under consideration.

===Operational quantities===
Operational quantities are measured in practice, and are the means of directly measuring dose uptake due to exposure, or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment. In this way they are used for practical dose control, by providing an estimate or upper limit for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure. They are also used in practical regulations and guidance.

The calibration of individual and area dosimeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision &quot;air kerma free in air&quot; under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium. Then the appropriate operational quantity is derived applying a conversion coefficient that relates the air kerma to the appropriate operational quantity. The conversion coefficients for photon radiation are published by the ICRU.

Simple (non-anthropomorphic) &quot;phantoms&quot; are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation. The ICRU sphere phantom is based on the definition of an ICRU 4-element tissue-equivalent material which does not really exist and cannot be fabricated. The ICRU sphere is a theoretical 30 cm diameter &quot;tissue equivalent&quot; sphere consisting of a material with a density of 1 g·cm−3 and a mass composition of 76.2% oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen and 2.6% nitrogen. This material is specified to most closely approximate human tissue in its absorption properties. According to the ICRP, the ICRU &quot;sphere phantom&quot; in most cases adequately approximates the human body as regards the scattering and attenuation of penetrating radiation fields under consideration. Thus radiation of a particular energy fluence will have roughly the same energy deposition within the sphere as it would in the equivalent mass of human tissue.

To allow for back-scattering and absorption of the human body, the &quot;slab phantom&quot; is used to represent the human torso for practical calibration of whole body dosimeters. The slab phantom is depth to represent the human torso.

The joint ICRU/ICRP proposals outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015 to change the definition of operational quantities would not change the present use of calibration phantoms or reference radiation fields.

===Protection quantities===
Protection quantities are calculated models, and are used as &quot;limiting quantities&quot; to specify exposure limits to ensure, in the words of ICRP, &quot;that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided&quot;. These quantities cannot be measured in practice but their values are derived using models of external dose to internal organs of the human body, using anthropomorphic phantoms. These are 3D computational models of the body which take into account a number of complex effects such as body self-shielding and internal scattering of radiation. The calculation starts with organ absorbed dose, and then applies radiation and tissue weighting factors.

As protection quantities cannot practically be measured, operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses.

===Instrument and dosimetry response===
This is an actual reading obtained from such as an ambient dose gamma monitor, or a personal dosimeter. Such instruments are calibrated using radiation metrology techniques which will trace them to a national radiation standard, and thereby relate them to an operational quantity. The readings of instruments and dosimeters are used to prevent the uptake of excessive dose and to provide records of dose uptake to satisfy radiation safety legislation; such as in the UK, the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999.

==Calculating protection dose quantities==

The sievert is used in external radiation protection for equivalent dose (the external-source, whole-body exposure effects, in a uniform field), and effective dose (which depends on the body parts irradiated).

These dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the stochastic health effects of radiation, and use of the sievert implies that appropriate weighting factors have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation (expressed in grays).

The ICRP calculation provides two weighting factors to enable the calculation of protection quantities.
: 1. The radiation factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;R&quot;, which is specific for radiation type &quot;R&quot; – This is used in calculating the equivalent dose &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; which can be for the whole body or for individual organs.
: 2. The tissue weighting factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;T&quot;, which is specific for tissue type T being irradiated. This is used with &quot;W&quot;&quot;R&quot; to calculate the contributory organ doses to arrive at an effective dose &quot;E&quot; for non-uniform irradiation.

When a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;R&quot; is used, and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose. But if the irradiation of a body is partial or non-uniform the tissue factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;T&quot; is used to calculate dose to each organ or tissue. These are then summed to obtain the effective dose. In the case of uniform irradiation of the human body, these summate to 1, but in the case of partial or non-uniform irradiation, they will summate to a lower value depending on the organs concerned; reflecting the lower overall health effect. The calculation process is shown on the accompanying diagram. This approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body, taking into account complete or partial irradiation, and the radiation type or types.

The values of these weighting factors are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types, based on averages of those obtained for the human population.

===Radiation type weighting factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;R&quot;===
Since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy, a corrective radiation weighting factor &quot;WR&quot;, which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue, is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose. The result is given the unit sievert.

The equivalent dose is calculated by multiplying the absorbed energy, averaged by mass over an organ or tissue of interest, by a radiation weighting factor appropriate to the type and energy of radiation. To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy dose.

formula_1
where
: is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue &quot;T&quot;,
: is the absorbed dose in tissue &quot;T&quot; by radiation type &quot;R&quot; and
: is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation.
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1 Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20 Sv.

This may seem to be a paradox. It implies that the energy of the incident radiation field in joules has increased by a factor of 20, thereby violating the laws of conservation of energy. However, this is not the case. The sievert is used only to convey the fact that a gray of absorbed alpha particles would cause twenty times the biological effect of a gray of absorbed x-rays. It is this biological component that is being expressed when using sieverts rather than the actual energy delivered by the incident absorbed radiation.

===Tissue type weighting factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;T&quot;===
The second weighting factor is the tissue factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;T&quot;, but it is used only if there has been non-uniform irradiation of a body. If the body has been subject to uniform irradiation, the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose, and only the radiation weighting factor &quot;W&quot;&quot;R&quot; is used. But if there is partial or non-uniform body irradiation the calculation must take account of the individual organ doses received, because the sensitivity of each organ to irradiation depends on their tissue type. This summed dose from only those organs concerned gives the effective dose for the whole body. The tissue weighting factor is used to calculate those individual organ dose contributions.

The ICRP values for &quot;W&quot;&quot;T&quot; are given in the table shown here.
The article on effective dose gives the method of calculation. The absorbed dose is first corrected for the radiation type to give the equivalent dose, and then corrected for the tissue receiving the radiation. Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

In summary, the sum of tissue-weighted doses to each irradiated organ or tissue of the body adds up to the effective dose for the body. The use of effective dose enables comparisons of overall dose received regardless of the extent of body irradiation.

==Operational quantities==
The operational quantities are used in practical applications for monitoring and investigating external exposure situations. They are defined for practical operational measurements and assessment of doses in the body. Three external operational dose quantities were devised to relate operational dosimeter and instrument measurements to the calculated protection quantities. Also devised were two phantoms, The ICRU &quot;slab&quot; and &quot;sphere&quot; phantoms which relate these quantities to incident radiation quantities using the Q(L) calculation.

===Ambient dose equivalent===
This is used for area monitoring of penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity &quot;H&quot;*(10). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found 10 mm within the ICRU sphere phantom in the direction of origin of the field. An example of penetrating radiation is gamma rays.

===Directional dose equivalent===
This is used for monitoring of low penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity &quot;H&quot;&#x27;(0.07). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found at a depth of 0.07 mm in the ICRU sphere phantom. Examples of low penetrating radiation are alpha particles, beta particles and low-energy photons. This dose quantity is used for the determination of equivalent dose to such as the skin, lens of the eye. In radiological protection practice value of omega is usually not specified as the dose is usually at a maximum at the point of interest.

===Personal dose equivalent===
This is used for individual dose monitoring, such as with a personal dosimeter worn on the body. The recommended depth for assessment is 10 mm which gives the quantity &quot;H&quot;p(10).

==Proposals for changing the definition of protection dose quantities==
In order to simplify the means of calculating operational quantities and assist in the comprehension of radiation dose protection quantities, ICRP Committee 2 &amp; ICRU Report Committee 26 started in 2010 an examination of different means of achieving this by dose coefficients related to Effective Dose or Absorbed Dose.

Specifically;

1. For area monitoring of effective dose of whole body it would be:

:&quot;H&quot; = Φ × conversion coefficient

The driver for this is that &quot;H&quot;∗(10) is not a reasonable estimate of effective dose due to high energy photons, as a result of the extension of particle types and energy ranges to be considered in ICRP report 116. This change would remove the need for the ICRU sphere and introduce a new quantity called &quot;E&quot;max.

2. For individual monitoring, to measure deterministic effects on eye lens and skin, it would be:

:&quot;D&quot; = Φ × conversion coefficient for absorbed dose.

The driver for this is the need to measure the deterministic effect, which it is suggested, is more appropriate than stochastic effect. This would calculate equivalent dose quantities &quot;H&quot;lens and &quot;H&quot;skin.

This would remove the need for the ICRU Sphere and the Q-L function. Any changes would replace ICRU report 51, and part of report 57.

A final draft report was issued in July 2017 by ICRU/ICRP for consultation.

==Internal dose quantities==

The sievert is used for human internal dose quantities in calculating committed dose. This is dose from radionuclides which have been ingested or inhaled into the human body, and thereby &quot;committed&quot; to irradiate the body for a period of time. The concepts of calculating protection quantities as described for external radiation applies, but as the source of radiation is within the tissue of the body, the calculation of absorbed organ dose uses different coefficients and irradiation mechanisms.

The ICRP defines Committed effective dose, formula_2 as the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors formula_3, where formula_4 is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.

The ICRP further states &quot;For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients&quot;.

A committed dose from an internal source is intended to carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of effective dose applied to part of the body.

==Health effects==

Ionizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. Deterministic (acute tissue effect) events happen with certainty, with the resulting health conditions occurring in every individual who received the same high dose. Stochastic (cancer induction and genetic) events are inherently random, with most individuals in a group failing to ever exhibit any causal negative health effects after exposure, while an indeterministic random minority do, often with the resulting subtle negative health effects being observable only after large detailed epidemiology studies.

The use of the sievert implies that only stochastic effects are being considered, and to avoid confusion deterministic effects are conventionally compared to values of absorbed dose expressed by the SI unit gray (Gy).

===Stochastic effects===
Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as radiation-induced cancer. The consensus of nuclear regulators, governments and the UNSCEAR is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert. This is known as the linear no-threshold model (LNT model). Some argue that this LNT model is now outdated and should be replaced with a threshold below which the body&#x27;s natural cell processes repair damage and/or replace damaged cells. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.

===Deterministic effects===

The deterministic (acute tissue damage) effects that can lead to acute radiation syndrome only occur in the case of acute high doses (≳ 0.1 Gy) and high dose rates (≳ 0.1 Gy/h) and are conventionally not measured using the unit sievert, but use the unit gray (Gy).
A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose.

===ICRP dose limits===

The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of report 103. These limits are &quot;situational&quot;, for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for the following groups:

* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public 
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – All persons exposed

For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period, and for the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.

For comparison, natural radiation levels inside the United States Capitol are such that a human body would receive an additional dose rate of 0.85 mSv/a, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure. According to the conservative ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk (calculated as: 20 a·0.85 mSv/a·0.001 Sv/mSv·5.5%/Sv ≈ 0.1%). However, that &quot;existing risk&quot; is much higher; an average American would have a 10% chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation (see natural Epidemiology of cancer and cancer rates).

==Dose examples==


Significant radiation doses are not frequently encountered in everyday life. The following examples can help illustrate relative magnitudes; these are meant to be examples only, not a comprehensive list of possible radiation doses. An &quot;acute dose&quot; is one that occurs over a short and finite period of time, while a &quot;chronic dose&quot; is a dose that continues for an extended period of time so that it is better described by a dose rate.

===Dose examples===
===Dose rate examples===
All conversions between hours and years have assumed continuous presence in a steady field, disregarding known fluctuations, intermittent exposure and radioactive decay. Converted values are shown in parentheses. &quot;/a&quot; is &quot;per annum&quot;, which means per year. &quot;/h&quot; means &quot;per hour&quot;.
Notes on examples:
==History==
The sievert has its origin in the röntgen equivalent man (rem) which was derived from CGS units. The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) promoted a switch to coherent SI units in the 1970s, and announced in 1976 that it planned to formulate a suitable unit for equivalent dose. The ICRP pre-empted the ICRU by introducing the sievert in 1977.

The sievert was adopted by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in 1980, five years after adopting the gray. The CIPM then issued an explanation in 1984, recommending when the sievert should be used as opposed to the gray. That explanation was updated in 2002 to bring it closer to the ICRP&#x27;s definition of equivalent dose, which had changed in 1990. Specifically, the ICRP had introduced equivalent dose, renamed the quality factor (Q) to radiation weighting factor (WR), and dropped another weighting factor &quot;N&quot; in 1990. In 2002, the CIPM similarly dropped the weighting factor &quot;N&quot; from their explanation but otherwise kept other old terminology and symbols. This explanation only appears in the appendix to the SI brochure and is not part of the definition of the sievert.

==Common SI usage==
Frequently used SI prefixes are the millisievert (1 mSv = 0.001 Sv) and microsievert (1 μSv = 0.000 001 Sv) and commonly used units for time derivative or &quot;dose rate&quot; indications on instruments and warnings for radiological protection are μSv/h and mSv/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mSv/a or Sv/a, where they are understood to represent an average over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual limits. The conversion from hours to years varies because of leap years and exposure schedules, but approximate conversions are:

: 1 mSv/h = 8.766 Sv/a
: 114.1 μSv/h = 1 Sv/a

Conversion from hourly rates to annual rates is further complicated by seasonal fluctuations in natural radiation, decay of artificial sources, and intermittent proximity between humans and sources. The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:

: 8 h = 1 day
: 40 h = 1 week
: 50 weeks = 1 year

Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,

: 1 mSv/h = 2 Sv/a
: 500 μSv/h = 1 Sv/a

==Ionizing radiation quantities==

The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that their use for &quot;public health ... purposes&quot; be phased out by 31 December 1985.

===Rem equivalence===
An older unit for the dose equivalent is the rem, still often used in the United States. One sievert is equal to 100 rem:

<text>Kaspar Villiger (; born 5 February 1941) is a Swiss businessman, former tobacco manufacturer and politician. He served as a member of the Federal Council (Switzerland) since 1 February 1989 for The Liberals. Villiger served two terms as President of the Swiss Confederation in 1995 and again in 2002. He previously served on the Council of States (Switzerland) from 1987 to 1989 and on the National Council (Switzerland) from 1982 to 1987. 

Villiger was best known for his involvement into the Swissair bankruptcy in 2001, when he was among the members of the rescue plan task force, which ultimately failed. Between 2009 and 2012, Villiger was appointed chairman of UBS. He has also served on the board of directors at Nestlé, Swiss Re and Neue Zürcher Zeitung. He currently is the chairman of the UBS Foundation of Economics in Society, which invested 100 million Swiss Francs in the Department of Economics at the University of Zürich. He was a founding member of the Global Leadership Foundation in 2004.

== Early life and education ==
Villiger was born 5 February 1941 in Pfeffikon, Switzerland to Max and Dory (née Heiz) Villiger. He was the grandson of Jean Villiger (1860–1902), who founded the tobacco manufacturing concern Villiger Sons in 1888. He has one elder brother, Heinrich (born 1930), and sister Monika (born 1936).

He was raised in Pfeffikon and completed his Matura in Aarau. He then studied Mechanical Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich graduating in 1965.

== Career ==
In 1966, he entered the family business, after the sudden death of his father Max Villiger (1897–1966) alongside his elder brother Heinrich Villiger, who was responsible for the German market and his sister Monika Villiger, who was export director. He integrated bicycle manufacturer &quot;Kalt&quot; in Buttisholz and developed it under the new &quot;Villiger&quot; name. Villiger was also the vice president of the &quot;Chamber of Commerce of Central Switzerland&quot;, several years a member on the board committee of the &quot;Association of Employers in Central Switzerland&quot; and vice president of the &quot;Argovian Chamber of Industry and Commerce&quot;. 

In 2004, he became member of the board of directors of Nestlé and Swiss Re. On 15 April 2009, he was elected Chairman of the Board of Swiss banking giant UBS, holding this post until 3 May 2012. His successor was Axel A. Weber.

== Politics ==
On 1 February 1989, he was elected to the Swiss Federal Council. He is affiliated to the Free Democratic Party (Liberals).

During his time in office he headed the following departments:
* Federal Military Department (1989 – 1995)
* Federal Department of Finance (1996 – 2003)
He was President of the Confederation twice, in 1995 and again in 2002.

In 1995 Kaspar Villiger apologized on occasion of an official visit by Dan Culler who was an internee in the Wauwilermoos internment camp during World War II. Dwight Mears, a U.S. Army officer, covered the apology in his 2012 PhD thesis on the American internees in Switzerland.

In September 2003, he announced he was to resign on 31 December 2003.

== Other activities ==

Kaspar Villiger is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

<text>The curie (symbol Ci) is a non-SI unit of radioactivity originally defined in 1910. According to a notice in &quot;Nature&quot; at the time, it was to be named in honour of Pierre Curie, but was considered at least by some to be in honour of Marie Skłodowska-Curie as well, and is in later literature considered to be named for both.

It was originally defined as &quot;the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium (element)&quot;, but is currently defined as 1 Ci = decays per second after more accurate measurements of the activity of Ra (which has a specific activity of ).

In 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures gave the becquerel (Bq), defined as one nuclear decay per second, official status as the SI unit of activity. 
Therefore:
: 1 Ci = = 37 GBq 
and
: 1 Bq ≅ ≅ 27 pCi

While its continued use is discouraged by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other bodies, the curie is still widely used throughout government, industry and medicine in the United States and in other countries.

At the 1910 meeting, which originally defined the curie, it was proposed to make it equivalent to 10 nanograms of radium (a practical amount). But Marie Curie, after initially accepting this, changed her mind and insisted on one gram of radium. According to Bertram Boltwood, Marie Curie thought that &quot;the use of the name &#x27;curie&#x27; for so infinitesimally small [a] quantity of anything was altogether inappropriate&quot;.

The power emitted in radioactive decay corresponding to one curie can be calculated by multiplying the decay energy by approximately 5.93 mW / MeV.

A radiotherapy machine may have roughly 1000 Ci of a radioisotope such as caesium-137 or cobalt-60. This quantity of radioactivity can produce serious health effects with only a few minutes of close-range, unshielded exposure.

Radioactive decay can lead to the emission of particulate radiation or electromagnetic radiation. Ingesting even small quantities of some particulate emitting radionuclides may be fatal. For example, the median lethal dose (LD-50) for ingested polonium-210 is 240 μCi; about 53.5 nanograms.

The typical human body contains roughly 0.1 μCi (14 mg) of naturally occurring potassium-40. A human body containing of carbon (see &quot;Composition of the human body&quot;) would also have about 24 nanograms or 0.1 μCi of carbon-14. Together, these would result in a total of approximately 0.2 μCi or 7400 decays per second inside the person&#x27;s body (mostly from beta decay but some from gamma decay).

==As a measure of quantity==
Units of activity (the curie and the becquerel) also refer to a quantity of radioactive atoms. Because the probability of decay is a fixed physical quantity, for a known number of atoms of a particular radionuclide, a predictable number will decay in a given time. The number of decays that will occur in one second in one gram of atoms of a particular radionuclide is known as the specific activity of that radionuclide.

The activity of a sample decreases with time because of decay.

The rules of radioactive decay may be used to convert activity to an actual number of atoms. They state that 1 Ci of radioactive atoms would follow the expression
: &quot;N&quot; (atoms) × &quot;λ&quot; (s) = 1 Ci = 3.7 × 10 Bq,
and so
: &quot;N&quot; = 3.7 × 10 Bq / &quot;λ&quot;,
where &quot;λ&quot; is the decay constant in s−1.

Here are some examples, ordered by half-life:

<text>Moritz Leuenberger (born 21 September 1946) is a Swiss politician and lawyer who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1995 to 2010. A member of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS), he was President of the Swiss Confederation in 2001 and 2006. Leuenberger headed the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications for the whole of his tenure as a Federal Councillor.

==Career==
A lawyer by occupation, Moritz Leuenberger managed his firm in Zürich until 1991. He was successively elected to the Zürich City Council (1974–1983), National Council (1979–1995) and Zürich Cantonal Government (1991–1995), where he headed the Department of Home Affairs and Justice. He presided over Mieterverband, the Swiss tenants&#x27; association, from 1972 to 1991.

Leuenberger was elected to the Federal Council on 27 September 1995 as a member of the Social Democratic Party, succeeding Otto Stich. He became head of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications; the name of the department was changed in 1998 to incorporate the term &quot;Environment&quot;.

At a ceremony in Brussels, the Community of European Railways and Union des Industries Ferroviaires Européennes presented the 2009 European Railway Awards on 20 January 2009. Leuenberger was presented with the Political Award for his work to build and maintain a sustainable transportation policy.

On 9 July 2010, Leuenberger announced he would leave the Federal Council as of 31 December 2010. At this time Hans-Rudolf Merz had been expected to resign as well and there were talks between the two about resigning together. Leuenberger&#x27;s resignation however came as a surprise. One month later, on 6 August 2010, Merz also announced his resignation for October. This led to the situation that the parliament would have had to elect a new Federal Councillor both in September and November. To avoid this situation, Leuenberger then announced he would change his resignation to allow for just one election for both new Federal Councillors.

==Personal life==
Moritz Leuenberger is the son of theologian Robert Leuenberger. He has been married to architect Gret Loewensberg since 2003 and has two sons.
