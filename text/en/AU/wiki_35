==History==
Hickory owes its name to the Hickory Tavern, a log structure built in the 1850s underneath a hickory tree. 

Henry Link bought the first lot in the area for $45 in 1858. The house he built was later adapted as &quot;The 1859 Cafe,&quot; a restaurant which closed in 2011. 

The first train operated near Hickory Tavern in 1859. In 1868, Dr. Jeremiah Ingold, pastor of Corinth Reformed Church (then known as German Reformed Grace Church), established the Free Academy, the first school in the area. Hickory Tavern was incorporated as a town in 1870. Three years later, its name was officially changed to Hickory. In 1889, it became the City of Hickory.

Hickory grew rapidly in the 1880s. Electric lights were installed in 1888. A year later, the Elliott Opera House opened. Decorated in French renaissance style with mythological motifs, the opera house auditorium had seating for 750; the parquet balcony fit another 350. The opera house hosted touring out of town shows, the Hickory Amateurs (the city&#x27;s first acting troupe), and The Hickory Symphony Band. A fire destroyed the entire building in 1902, and it was never rebuilt. A municipal auditorium was constructed across the street in 1921, and now houses the Hickory Community Theatre. 

In 1891, four Lutheran pastors founded Highland Academy with 12 students. It has developed through the decades as Lenoir–Rhyne University.

Hickory built a sewage system in 1904. The city adopted the council-manager form of government in 1913. 

Hickory is home to one of the oldest furniture manufacturers in the United States that is still located and operated on the original site. Hickory White, formerly known as Hickory Manufacturing Company, was built in 1902 and has been in continuous operation ever since. During World War II, the factory made ammunition boxes for the U.S. military instead of furniture.

Hickory was known in the years after World War II for the &quot;Miracle of Hickory&quot;. In 1944 the area around Hickory (the Catawba Valley) became the center of one of the worst outbreaks of polio ever recorded. Residents who were then children recall summers of not being allowed to play outside or visit friends for fear of contracting the infectious disease. 

Since local facilities were inadequate to treat the victims, the citizens of Hickory and the March of Dimes decided to build a hospital to care for the children of the region. From the time the decision was made until equipment, doctors, and patients were in a new facility, took less than 54 hours. Several more buildings were quickly added. A Red Cross official on the scene praised the project &quot;as the most outstanding example of cooperative effort he has ever seen.&quot;

The city also came to national attention when the remains of a girl, Zahra Baker were found. Following the police investigation, Zahra&#x27;s stepmother, Elise Baker, was prosecuted and found guilty of second-degree murder. The Zahra Baker All Children&#x27;s playground, located in Kiwanis Park, is named in the girl&#x27;s honor.

Early industries such as wagon-making, as well as proximity to expansive forests and excellent transportation via two intersecting railroads, provided fertile ground for the emergence of the furniture industry. Likewise experience with textile manufacturing and easy access to power drove new industries in both fiber-optic cable and pressure-sensitive tape. Forty percent of the world&#x27;s fiber optic cable is made in the Hickory area.

Adhesive tape manufacturer Shurtape Technologies is based in Hickory and Fortune 500 network infrastructure provider CommScope, is based in nearby Claremont.

The furniture industry in Hickory is not as strong as in previous decades, but is still a primary component in the area economy.

<text>Rhodhiss is a town in Caldwell and Burke counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 1,070 at the 2010 census, up from 366 in 2000. It is part of the Hickory–Lenoir–Morganton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The name &quot;Rhodhiss&quot; comes from John M. Rhodes and George B. Hiss. They joined to build a cotton mill on the upper Catawba River in Caldwell County. With a $500,000 investment, they helped construct the village of Rhodhiss, which included a horseshoe-shaped dam, electric generator, mill, general store, and worker houses. Rhodhiss Manufacturing Company opened in 1902, with Rhodhiss incorporating as a town in 1903. Within the next decade, the Town of Rhodhiss would expand into Burke County, with a new steel bridge spanning the Catawba River to connect the town together.

The material of the U.S. flag that astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin erected on the first visit to the Moon in 1969, was woven at Burlington Mills Plant 2 in Rhodhiss. Glen Price, a lifelong Rhodhiss resident, was manager at the time.

==Geography==
Rhodhiss is located in eastern Burke County and southern Caldwell County. It is bordered to the north by the town of Granite Falls. The Catawba River runs through the center of the town, which is located just east (downstream) of Rhodhiss Dam. One bridge crosses the river in the town, leading north on Caldwell Street to Granite Falls, and leading south on Burke Street towards Icard and Connelly Springs. The small town has only one traffic light, a cautionary flashing yellow light, not a stop light. There is only one police officer, as the town has the lowest crime rate in Caldwell County. In the 1980s, there was a beach, that was located on Strawberry Hill (the first road on the right, just after crossing the bridge into Burke county). There was also a Boys Scout club house at the top of that same road; however, it closed in either the late 1970s or early 1980s.

<doc id="150822" wikidata="Q2023662" url="?curid=150822" title="Blowing Rock, North Carolina">
<text>Blowing Rock is a town in Watauga and Caldwell counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 1,376 at the 2020 census.

The Caldwell County portion of Blowing Rock is part of the Hickory–Lenoir–Morganton Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Watauga County portion is part of the Boone Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Before 1752, when Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg of the Moravian Church visited the Blowing Rock, the windy cliffs of the area were home to the Cherokee and the Catawba Native American tribes.

After the mid-18th century, when hardy Scots-Irish pioneers began to settle in the region, the mountain passes from southern Virginia into Kentucky attracted many colonists, farmers, hunters, and trappers who continued south to the mountains of North Carolina. The first family to settle in Blowing Rock were the Greenes, who were established by the mid-19th century on a site that would become the Green Park Hotel property.

Other early settlers in Blowing Rock included the Hayes, Coffey, Bolick, Estes and Storie families. During the American Civil War the mountains of North Carolina often witnessed fierce guerrilla warfare between groups of pro-Confederate and pro-Union fighters. To keep their families safe, men leaving for service in the Confederate Army often sent them to Blowing Rock, which became a local refuge from the fighting.

After the Civil War many of these veterans would join their families and remain in the Blowing Rock area. At the same time, summer residents began to come up from the nearby city of Lenoir to enjoy the cool fresh air and magnificent mountain views. Seeing the potential of their village to become a haven for well-to-do tourists, the residents of Blowing Rock had their village incorporated into a town on March 11, 1889. The town&#x27;s first mayor was &quot;Uncle&quot; Joe Clarke, and the town initially had a population of about 300.

As word traveled to other parts of the South about the merits of Blowing Rock, more visitors began to arrive, first camping out, and later taking rooms at boarding houses such as the Hayes and Martin houses on Main Street. Eventually there were more visitors than the existing boarding houses could handle, and so many homes were turned into hotels. The first hotel in Blowing Rock was the Watauga Hotel, built in 1884; the hotel added cottages in 1888. The Green Park Hotel opened in 1891, followed eight years later by the Blowing Rock Hotel. Walter Alexander, a prominent local resident, touted the clean air and healthy environment of Blowing Rock; in 1922 he opened his own hotel, called Mayview Manor.

As the tourist economy became Blowing Rock&#x27;s main industry in the late 19th century, the town was forced to adapt to meeting the needs of tourists. The need for cleaner and better streets (most streets then were simply dirt tracks) led to the paving of the town&#x27;s streets and highways. Another issue involved the need to build fences to keep farm animals from wandering into town and disturbing visitors - at the time most farms in the area were not fenced. In 1896 the town passed an ordinance which required local farmers to fence in their livestock.

The introduction of the automobile and improved roads early in the 20th century further eased the journey to Blowing Rock, and visitors began to arrive from as far away as Florida. Today Blowing Rock remains a tourist destination for visitors from all over the United States. Due to the town&#x27;s well-to-do, out-of-state summertime residents, Blowing Rock has restaurants, hotels, golf courses, and other attractions. A recent priority for Blowing Rock&#x27;s residents has been to preserve and protect the town&#x27;s historic structures and maintaining the small-town charm and scenery that has attracted so many people for the last 150 years.

In addition to the Green Park Inn, the Bollinger-Hartley House, East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad Locomotive No. 12, Gragg House, Green Park Historic District, Randall Memorial Building, Former, Vardell Family Cottages Historic District, Westglow, and Moses Cone&#x27;s Flat Top Manor are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Saint Elizabeth Catholic Church (Boone, NC), operates the Church of the Epiphany as a seasonal, mission church in Blowing Rock.

==Geography==
Blowing Rock is located in southern Watauga County in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The southernmost portion of the town, including the actual Blowing Rock cliff, is located in Caldwell County.

The town is located on the crest of the Blue Ridge. Most of the town lies just north of the crest, with waters draining north to the Middle Fork of the New River and thence to the Ohio River valley, while to the south of the ridgecrest, waters flow via the Johns River to the Catawba River valley and eventually to the Atlantic Ocean in South Carolina.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which of the area is land, and , or 1.49% of the total area, is water.

=== Climate ===
The climate in the area can be described as warm-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), or highland subtropical climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) depending on the isotherm used; Köppen Climate Classification. This results in an unusual climate compared to the rest of North Carolina; the town&#x27;s elevation of above sea level results in cooler summer temperatures than lowland areas to the east and south. Daytime temperatures in the summer infrequently rise above .

==Attractions==

The town of Blowing Rock takes its name from an unusual rock formation which juts over above the Johns River gorge. Due to the rock&#x27;s shape and size, wind currents from the gorge often blow vertically, causing light objects to float upwards into the sky.
Blowing Rock is the site of Glen Burney Falls and Glen Marie Falls.

The Blowing Rock area was once fought over by the Cherokee and Catawba Native American tribes. According to legend, two lovers - one from each tribe - were walking near the rocks when the man received a notice to report to his village and go into battle. When his lover urged him to stay with her, he became so distraught that he threw himself off the blowing rock into the gorge. The woman prayed to the Great Spirit to return her lover, and the Spirit complied by sending a gust of wind which blew the man back up the cliff and landed him safely on the blowing rock itself. This story of course is fictional but it was used as a draw for the attraction. In the 1980s, a billboard in Wilkesboro for Blowing Rock showed two Indians holding hands, one standing on the rock and one &quot;floating&quot;. Today &quot;The Blowing Rock&quot; is a tourist attraction and is known for its superb views of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains.

<text>Elizabeth City is a city in Pasquotank county, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 18,629. Elizabeth City is the county seat and most populous city of Pasquotank County. It is the cultural, economic and educational hub of the sixteen-county Historic Albemarle region of northeastern North Carolina.

Elizabeth City is the center of the Elizabeth City Micropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of 64,094 as of 2010. It is part of the larger Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC Combined Statistical Area. The city is the economic center of the region, as well as home to many historic sites and cultural traditions.

Marketed as the &quot;Harbor of Hospitality&quot;, Elizabeth City has had a long history of shipping due to its location at a narrowed bend of the Pasquotank River. Founded in 1794, Elizabeth City prospered early on from the Dismal Swamp Canal as a mercantile city. Later it developed industry and other commercial focus. While Elizabeth City still retains extensive waterfront property, it is linked to neighboring counties and cities by contemporary highways and bridges to support other transportation. It hosts one of the largest United States Coast Guard bases in the nation.

==History==
Located at the narrows of the Pasquotank River, colonists used the area that developed as Elizabeth City as a trading site. As early as the mid 18th century, they established inspection stations and ferries. With the addition of minor roads, a schoolhouse, and soon a church, a small community developed at these narrows.
In 1793, businessmen supported construction of the Dismal Swamp Canal; it was integral to the success of Elizabeth City&#x27;s commerce. The North Carolina Assembly incorporated the town as &quot;Redding&quot;, renaming it in 1794 as &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;. Due to resulting confusion with another town of the same name, in 1801, the city was renamed as &quot;Elizabeth City&quot;. The name &quot;Elizabeth&quot; has been attributed to Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Tooley, a local tavern proprietress who donated much of the land for the new town.

With improvements to the Dismal Swamp Canal, commerce flourished and Elizabeth City became a financial center of trade and commercially successful in the early 19th century. In 1826, the federal government purchased 600 stocks in the canal and, in 1829, additional funds for improvements were raised by the Norfolk lottery. With these funds, the Dismal Swamp Canal was widened and deepened, allowing for larger boats to ship their goods to and from the city.

Further bolstering Elizabeth City&#x27;s financial success, the US customs house was relocated in 1827 from Camden County to Elizabeth City. From 1829 to 1832, Elizabeth City&#x27;s tolls tripled for commercial shipping.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate States had a small fleet stationed at Elizabeth City. After the Battle of Roanoke Island, Union forces sent a fleet to take the city. A small skirmish resulted in a Union victory. Elizabeth City was under Union control for the remainder of the war, as was most of coastal North Carolina. Confederate irregulars engaged in guerrilla warfare with Union forces in the area for the remainder of the war.
Meanwhile, overland travel slowly improved, enabling greater trade between neighboring counties. The ferry continued to provide transport between Elizabeth City and Camden County. But the completion of competing canals and railroads around Elizabeth City meant that neighboring cities began to draw off some of the traffic. The Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad, completed in the 1830s, allowed for goods to be transported from the Roanoke River directly to Weldon. The Albemarle–Chesapeake Canal, completed in 1859, created a deeper channel for merchants shipping goods from the eastern Albemarle Sound to Norfolk.

Such new opportunities established Elizabeth City as a thriving deep-water port and powerful regional economic center. It was based on such industries as lumbering, shipbuilding, grain export, and fish and oyster processing; it rivaled other ports such as Norfolk, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland. But the establishment in 1881 of the Elizabeth City and Norfolk Railroad, later renamed the Norfolk Southern Railway, encouraged a shift of industries from waterfront in Elizabeth City to the growing cities of North Carolina&#x27;s Upper Coastal Plain and Piedmont.
The declaration of World War II reinvigorated Elizabeth City&#x27;s industries, particularly in shipbuilding, textiles, and aeronautics. Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City was established in 1940 and Navy Air Station Weeksville in 1941 to provide valuable surveillance by seaplane and dirigible of German U-boats that were targeting American merchant shipping in East Coast waters.

Additionally from 1942 to 1944, the Elizabeth City Shipyard supported the war effort with much of its production: thirty 111-foot SC-class submarine chasers, four YT-class yard tugboats, and six 104-foot QS-class quick supply boats. The Elizabeth City Shipyard built the most subchasers for the war effort (30 out of 438 total nationally), and set the record construction time for the SC-class, with SC-740 laid down in only thirty days. As of January 2020, the Elizabeth City Shipyard is no longer in operation.

For two years, 1950 and 1951, Elizabeth City was home to a professional minor league baseball team. The Elizabeth City Albemarles played in the Class D level Virginia League. Previously, the town had fielded a team for several seasons in the semipro Albemarle League.

The conclusion of the war led to a levelled economy. Industry restructuring here and in other areas changed the economy. Since the late 20th century, the service, government, and agriculture sectors have become dominant in the current economy. Starting in the late 1990s, revival efforts in tourism and civic revitalization centered on downtown and the city&#x27;s five historic districts have led to increasing economic stability.

The Elizabeth City Historic District, Elizabeth City State Teachers College Historic District, Elizabeth City Water Plant, Episcopal Cemetery, Norfolk Southern Passenger Station, Northside Historic District, Old Brick House, Riverside Historic District, and Shepard Street-South Road Street Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are protected to encourage heritage tourism that stresses the city&#x27;s unique qualities.

==Geography==

Elizabeth City is located alongside the Pasquotank River, which connects to Albemarle Sound. Directly across the river lies Camden County.

Located in the &quot;Inner Banks&quot; region of North Carolina, Elizabeth City is largely flat and marshy with an elevation of only above sea level. The city&#x27;s semi-coastal geography has played an important role in its history—Elizabeth City once hosted thriving oyster and timber industries.

===Climate===

==Government==

Elizabeth City serves as the county seat of Pasquotank County. The city has a council–manager style of government. The city council is composed of eight council members and the city manager, elected by the council members. The city manager serves a largely executive function, overseeing the city&#x27;s administrative departments, appointing department heads and city employees, and informing the rest of the council of relevant municipal conditions. As of January 2025, the city manager position is vacant, with the city actively seeking a new city manager. The eight council members, on the other hand, act in a legislative regard, adopting city policies, holding the city manager responsible, and choosing a mayor pro-tempore from its council members. This council is elected every two years by each of the four wards composing the city electing two members.

The mayor, elected by the whole voter body every two years, also serves an executive function, serving as the head of a council meeting and casting a tie-breaking vote for the council. As of February 2025, the mayor is Kirk Rivers. Previous mayors include Betty Parker, Joseph Peel, Charles L. Foster, who served from 2005 to 2007, and John Bell, who served from 1971 to 1981 and again from 2001 to 2005.

The council holds its meetings every second and fourth Monday of the month; the meetings are rebroadcast on a public service channel.

Elizabeth City has an office for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, headed by Terrence W. Boyle as the resident judge. This court presides over cases in the northern region of this district.

Elizabeth City also occupies North Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, served by U.S. Representative Greg Murphy.

==U.S. Coast Guard==

Established in 1940 and located southeast of Elizabeth City&#x27;s corporate limits, Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City is one of the largest United States Coast Guard Air Stations in the nation at over 800 acres, and is home to six commands - Air Station Elizabeth City, Aviation Logistics Center, Aviation Technical Training Center, Base Elizabeth City, C-27J Asset Project Office (APO), and Small Boat Station Elizabeth City - as well as the off-base National Strike Force Coordination Center located in northern Elizabeth City. As a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the base, along with a host of defense contractors anchored by DRS Technologies, provide a host of local jobs and maintains an influx of Coast Guard and industry employees from all around the country.

The USCG Air Station and the Aviation Technical Training Center (ATTC) in Elizabeth City were featured in numerous scenes of the 2006 Disney movie &quot;The Guardian&quot;, standing in for Kodiak, Alaska.

Elizabeth City is also home to one of the United States&#x27; few airship factories. Many of the nation&#x27;s commercial blimps are made and serviced here. The current airship facilities evolved from what had previously been Naval Air Station Weeksville, operational from 1941 to 1957. NAS Weeksville&#x27;s LTA craft played a vital role in German U-boat spotting during World War II, helping to minimize losses to East Coast shipping. NAS Weeksville was home to two hangars, one still existing as corrugated steel, and a slightly larger one constructed out of Southern Yellow Pine, to conserve metal for the WWII war effort. This latter hangar was the largest wooden structure in the world until its demise by fire in 1995.

A joint public-private airpark adjacent to the Coast Guard base is in the planning stages. Intended to make Elizabeth City a premier hub of the aviation industry, the airpark hopes to attract major tenants as well as the Aviation Science programs of Elizabeth City State University and related programs by the College of the Albemarle.

==Arts and culture==
Elizabeth City is home to the Museum of the Albemarle, the northeastern regional branch of the North Carolina Museum of History. The museum occupies a prominent location adjacent to the city&#x27;s waterfront and contains many permanent and revolving exhibits on the history and culture of the historic Albemarle region. The history of European colonization dates back to 1668, making the Albemarle the country&#x27;s oldest colonial inhabited area, second only to Jamestown and adjacent settlements in neighboring Virginia.

Downtown Elizabeth City is also home to Arts of the Albemarle, a regional arts council located in the Lowery-Chesson Building. Once home to the Chesson Department Store on the ground floor and a turn-of-the-century opera house on the second and third floors, the once-dilapidated building undertook a $3.4 million renovation, and &quot;The Center&quot; became AOA&#x27;s permanent home in 2005. The three-story building houses three art galleries, the state-of-the-art McGuire Theater for the performing arts, and multiple conference and meeting rooms. The Center has been an economic driver for downtown Elizabeth City since its opening. 
Among these are the most striking architectural feature of the greater Albemarle region, the Virginia Dare Hotel, and Arcade, which has dominated the skyline of Elizabeth City since its completion in 1927. Designed by William Lee Stoddart of New York City, one of the nation&#x27;s leading hotel architects, the nine-story building was billed as the Albemarle&#x27;s first “skyscraper” when it opened in 1927. It remains the tallest building in the region.

The hotel contained 100 rooms and a heated garage (now the rear parking lot) with an interior filling station and lubricating stand. It remained the premier hotel and center of Elizabeth City&#x27;s social activities for over 40 years. Architecturally, its restrained Colonial Revival finish follows the typical division of such tall buildings into the three parts of a classical pillar: a sturdy two-story base; a simply detailed six-story shaft; and a one-story capital, which displays an abundance of decoration. Today it serves as an elderly apartment complex.

Elizabeth City has been the birthplace of a few government officials in its history. Judge John Warren Davis, a justice of the Federal Court of Appeals, was born in Elizabeth City, as was John C. B. Ehringhaus, governor of North Carolina from 1933 to 1937 and for whom Ehringhaus Street, a major thoroughfare, is named.
During the same era, nine-ball legend Luther Lassiter was born in Elizabeth City, and developed much of his skill at pool in the City Billiards pool hall.

Elizabeth City was the 1929 birthplace of the American Moth Boat, a class of recreational sailboats invented by Dr. Joel Van Sant. The city hosts a Moth Boat Regatta annually in late February. The Moth Boat features prominently on the city&#x27;s seal.

===North Carolina Potato Festival===
Elizabeth City hosts the North Carolina Potato Festival, an annual celebration of the potato, one of the region&#x27;s most important crops. The festival has steadily become one of the most popular draws in northeastern North Carolina, and is usually held in mid-May in downtown Elizabeth City.

===Albemarle Craftsman&#x27;s Fair===
This annual Christmastime fair is sponsored by the Albemarle Craftsman&#x27;s Guild and features artisans, many of whom wear period costumes, selling and demonstrating traditional crafts. Crafts include quilting and fiber arts, pottery, jewelry and woodwork.

===Juneteenth Celebration===
This annual celebration is sponsored by River City Community Development Corporation and celebrates the freeing of African Slaves in America. It has evolved into a multi-racial, multi-cultural celebration of American Freedom. The festival features vendors and informational booths, speakers, entertainment, and good food.

==Media==
The &quot;Daily Advance&quot; has served as Elizabeth City&#x27;s sole daily newspaper since its founding by Herbert Peele in 1911. In mid-2009, the Daily Advance was bought by Cooke Communications.

The &quot;Independent&quot; was a weekly newspaper serving Elizabeth City and the surrounding Albemarle area from 1908 to 1939. The &quot;Independent&quot; was published by William Oscar &quot;W.O.&quot; Saunders (1884-1940).

Elizabeth City is part of the Hampton Roads television market. The majority of the stations received in the area come from southeastern Virginia, including WTKR (CBS), WAVY (NBC), WVEC (ABC), WVBT (FOX), and WHRO (PBS).

The only exceptions are WUND (PBS), a repeater transmitter of UNC-TV licensed to broadcast from Edenton, North Carolina, and WSKY (independent) transmitting from Camden. The only station based in Elizabeth City is W18BB-D, broadcasting from a tower on the Elizabeth City State University campus.

==Education==
All public education is overseen by the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County School Board of Education under the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank Public School system (ECPPS) which operates seven elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools, one Early College program, one alternative high school and one public charter STEM school

===Higher education===
Elizabeth City is home to one private and two public institutions of higher education.

Elizabeth City State University, the smallest constituent member of the 16-campus University of North Carolina System, is a historically African-American institution, enrolling 2,930 students as of fall 2011 on a compact campus along the city&#x27;s southern edge. Founded as a normal school in 1891, it now serves the higher educational needs of northeastern North Carolina&#x27;s sixteen counties, offering 28 undergraduate and four master&#x27;s degrees.

ECSU offers Aviation Science programs at their training facility at Elizabeth City Regional Airport, as well as once offering a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program in collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), flagship school of the UNC system. Declining enrollment at the Elizabeth City State University branch of UNC&#x27;s Eshelman School of Pharmacy forced UNC System President Thomas Ross to suspend the program in February 2013.

Also located here is the main campus of the College of the Albemarle (COA), positioned on the city&#x27;s northern edge adjacent to Albemarle Hospital. It is known as the first community college to be established under the (North Carolina) Community College Act of 1960. COA has satellite campuses in Barco, Edenton and Manteo.

Mid-Atlantic Christian University, a private Christian institution founded in 1948, is located along the Pasquotank River north of downtown Elizabeth City.

All three schools have agreements allowing students to dual-enroll in one of the other two institutions.

==Healthcare==
The primary healthcare provider in Elizabeth City is Sentara Albemarle Medical Center, a 182-bed regional medical center and part of the Sentara Healthcare system. Owned and formally operated by Pasquotank County, Albemarle Hospital has been in operation since 1914, relocating to its current location in 1960. In 2008, the Albemarle Health system came under the day-to-day management of Greenville-based Vidant Health, although ownership and most executive decisions remained with the county.

Starting in October 2012, the county began soliciting offers for affiliation with neighboring healthcare systems in order to cement Albemarle Hospital&#x27;s position as the region&#x27;s major medical facility. Limitations in some services and specialty providers had caused many prospective patients to seek services in the Hampton Roads or Greenville metro areas, leading to steady erosion of operating margins. Affiliation with a larger health organization would also provide increased buying power, improvements in equipment and facility investment as well as entice additional physicians to the area.

By January 2013 the board had received strong offers from then-current manager Vidant Health as well as Norfolk-based Sentara Healthcare and Brentwood, Tennessee-based Duke-LifePoint Health, itself a partnership between Durham-based Duke University Health System and Brentwood-based LifePoint Hospitals.

A 100-year management agreement for operation of the Albemarle Health system was reached with Sentara Healthcare, becoming effective on March 1, 2014, with Sentara committing to streamline patient care as well as make substantial investments in the physical building itself. Currently a brand new Sentara Albemarle Medical Center is being built on Halstead Boulevard Extended with an expected opening in the fall of 2025. Plans for the current hospital and surrounding property is unknown at this time.

==Services and utilities==
As part of its municipal mandate, Elizabeth City operates full-service police (ECPD), fire (ECFD) and public housing departments as well as water, sewer, sanitation and electric divisions which operate several deep wells, a water purification plant, three water towers, and a combined sewage/wastewater treatment plant. The city cooperates with Pasquotank County in joint operation of the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank Parks and Recreational Department (ECPPRD), Department of Social Services (ECPDSS), and the Witherspoon Memorial Library, the largest facility and head office of the four-county East Albemarle Regional Library System.

As with other Albemarle-area municipalities, Elizabeth City purchases wholesale electricity from Dominion North Carolina Power, operating 230kV transmission lines through the Albemarle area. Electricity is generated from natural gas-fired and nuclear power plants in nearby Chesapeake and Surry, Virginia, respectively.

Electricity is also locally generated for export by solar and wind facilities in Pasquotank County by Dominion Energy&#x27;s Morgan&#x27;s Corner 110 acre, 20MW solar farm, and Avangrid Renewables&#x27; Amazon Wind Farm East 22,000 acre (200 acre footprint), 208MW wind farm. Other renewable energy production facilities, chiefly solar, also exist in neighboring counties.

Local telephone service is currently provided by CenturyLink, operating out of the former headquarters and switchboard exchange building of early Elizabeth City-based provider Norfolk and Carolina Telephone and Telegraph. N&amp;CT&amp;T was later succeeded by Carolina Telephone &amp; Telegraph, United Telecom, Sprint and Embarq.

As of June 2016, cable television and Internet is provided by Spectrum (brand), a result of the merger of Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Networks. Previously, cable television and internet was provided by Time Warner, which was preceded by Adelphia Communications.

Pipeline natural gas is provided by Piedmont Natural Gas. Tank and bottled LP gas are also available through several local suppliers.

==Transportation==

===Highways===

Elizabeth City is linked to neighboring counties and cities through a network of highways.

Most unusual are the four branches of U.S. Route 17 that pass through the city - rarely are there more than two or three variants of the same route in any given community.

Mainline crosses the Little River, entering Pasquotank County from the southwest. Bypass US 17 immediately splits off to the northwest as mainline US 17 continues to the northeast toward Elizabeth City. Shortly after entering the city limits, US 17 Business splits off to the east towards the downtown waterfront. Mainline US 17 continues through Elizabeth City as Hughes Boulevard (the former US 17 Bypass from 1969 to 2002).

The route encounters major intersections with the commercial corridor of NC 344 (Halstead Boulevard), Church Street, Main Street and midway by Elizabeth Street, where it is joined by US 158 and Truck Business US 17. This tri-route combination continues northeastward to Business 17 and Truck Business 17&#x27;s northern termini at the intersection with North Road Street. From here, mainline US 17 and 158 make a curve to the northwest, departing Elizabeth City as a continuance of North Road Street.

Bypass US 17 rejoins the highway several miles outside of town, while US 158 splits off to the west at Morgan&#x27;s Corner just before crossing the Pasquotank River into Camden County. Running parallel to the Dismal Swamp Canal and the eastern boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp, US 17 continues to the Virginia border.

 (1969–present) branches off Hughes Boulevard and travels east as Ehringhaus Street, named for Governor John C. B. Ehringhaus (1933-1937), the only governor native to Elizabeth City. The route turns north through Downtown as North Road Street, ending with its intersection with US 17/Hughes Boulevard. Mainline US 17 continues north on North Road Street.

 is a double-designation almost unique among U.S. routes, traveling from the Camden Causeway west along Elizabeth Street and north along Hughes Boulevard to double-terminate with US 17 Business. The northern segment of US 17 Business from Elizabeth Street to its termination at Hughes Boulevard runs through a residential district and additionally has weight restrictions, thus requiring an alternate business routing.

 (2002–present) is a fully access-controlled and Interstate-grade freeway. Completed in 2002, US 17 Bypass stretches 9.3 miles to the immediate west of the city, eliminating one of the last remaining inner-city stretches of US 17 in North Carolina. In combination with other bypasses on U.S. 17 from the Virginia border to Williamston, the Elizabeth City bypass forms an integral component in the future I-87.

 enters Elizabeth City from points east, including the Outer Banks, as well as Dare, Currituck, and Camden counties. Traveling westward through town as Elizabeth Street, US 158 temporarily merges with mainline and Truck Business US 17 along the Hughes Boulevard and North Road Street corridors. It continues traveling northwestward leaving the city limits, turning left at Morgan&#x27;s Corner and continuing westward across the Great Dismal Swamp into Gates County.

 forms a minor connection southeastward from the US 17 Bypass to southern Pasquotank County. NC 344 serves as a major commercial and industrial corridor along Elizabeth City&#x27;s southern edge, providing access to Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, Elizabeth City State University, and the rural unincorporated community of Weeksville.

====Future====
 is planned to connect Elizabeth City to the Interstate Highway System; when completed, it will run from Raleigh to Norfolk, Virginia, utilizing existing segments of US 64, US 13 and US 17, upgrading them to fully controlled access Interstate highway standards.

===Air===
Elizabeth City has a joint civil-military airport, shared with U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, and located southeast of the city limits, named the Elizabeth City Regional Airport (IATA: ECG, ICAO: KECG, FAA LID: ECG).

Scheduled domestic and international passenger services are available at Norfolk International Airport (IATA: ORF, ICAO: KORF, FAA LID: ORF), located about an hour north in Norfolk, Virginia.

===Bus===
Local public bus transportation is provided by the Inter-County Public Transportation Authority, with service to Pasquotank, Perquimans, Camden, Chowan, and Currituck counties.

Elizabeth City has regularly scheduled inter-city bus service through Greyhound.

===Rail===
The Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad, a short line operated by the North Carolina and Virginia Railroad, extends between Edenton, North Carolina, and Chesapeake, Virginia. This line had first been established in 1881 as the Elizabeth City and Norfolk Railroad, later renamed the Norfolk Southern Railway. Once one of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s principal lines, the decline of the region&#x27;s industry and the demolition of tracks across the Albemarle Sound from Edenton to Mackey&#x27;s Ferry marginalized the route, forcing the line&#x27;s lease to the Chesapeake and Albemarle in 1990. The railroad still serves the region, primarily carrying grain, sand, gravel and other raw materials to and from the Norfolk Southern and CSX mainlines in Chesapeake.

Passenger service to Elizabeth City ended in 1947. Today, the closest passenger service is provided by Amtrak in Newport News, Virginia, approximately one hour to the north. Though an Amtrak station exists in Norfolk, Virginia, most outbound passengers from Norfolk are bussed via Amtrak Connect to Newport News instead.

Historians claim that the name &quot;Maiden&quot; stems from the native-grown &quot;Maidencane&quot; grass, which is found throughout the town to this day.

The town also calls itself &quot;The Biggest Little Football Town in the World&quot;, because of the strong community support for its local high school football team.

The David F. Propst House, Memorial Reformed Church, Miller–Cansler House, Franklin D. Reinhardt and Harren–Hood Farms, William Pinckney Reinhardt House, and Salem Union Church and Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Cary is a town in Wake, Chatham, and Durham counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina and is part of the Raleigh-Cary, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the 2020 census, its population was 174,721, making it the seventh-most populous municipality in North Carolina, and the 148th-most populous in the United States. In 2023, the town&#x27;s population had increased to 180,010.

Cary began as a railroad village and became known as an educational center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In April 1907, Cary High School became the first state-funded public high school in North Carolina. The creation of the nearby Research Triangle Park in 1959 resulted in Cary&#x27;s population doubling in a few years, tripling in the 1970s, and doubling in both the 1980s and 1990s. Cary is now the location of numerous technology companies, including SAS Institute, the world&#x27;s largest privately held software company.

In Cary, 68.4% of adults hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, which is higher than the state average. In 2021, it was identified as the safest mid-sized place to live in the United States, based on 2019 FBI data. It also has a median household income of $113,782, higher than the county average of $88,471 or the state average of $60,516.

==History==
 

Before the arrival of European settlers, the Tuscarora and Catawba people lived in what is now called Cary. However, their numbers were greatly reduced due to smallpox epidemics, resulting from contact with Europeans who carried the disease and having no prior immunity.

In the 1750s, John Bradford moved to the area and opened an ordinary or inn, giving Cary its first name—Bradford&#x27;s Ordinary. However, most of the land remained in the hands of two men, both named Nathaniel Jones. Arriving around 1775, Jones of White Plains plantation owned in eastern Cary, while Jones of Crabtree owned most of what is now western Cary. After the Revolutionary War, the community was on the road between the new capital in Raleigh and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. In the early 19th-century, Eli Yates added a gristmill and sawmill to the community, while Rufus Jones founded the first free school in the 1840s, along with Asbury Methodist Church, the community&#x27;s first church.

In 1854, Bradford&#x27;s Ordinary was linked to a major transportation route when the North Carolina Railroad came through the settlement, followed by the Chatham Railroad in 1868. The railroad tracks were laid mostly by enslaved people. Wake County farmer and lumberman Allison Francis Page also arrived in 1854 and is credited with founding the town. For $2,000, Page purchased surrounding the planned railroad junction and built his home called Pages, a sawmill, and a general store. Page also donated for a railroad depot.

The community was unofficially known as Page, Page&#x27;s Siding, Page&#x27;s Station, Page&#x27;s Tavern, and Page&#x27;s Turnout. In 1856, Page added a post office and became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. Page named the community Cary because of his admiration for Samuel Fenton Cary, head of the Sons of Temperance in North America, who had delivered an oration in Raleigh two months prior.

The American Civil War did not come to Cary until April 16, 1865—the same day Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered—when 5,000 Confederate troops under General Wade Hampton III encamped there. The next day, Raleigh surrendered to Union General William T. Sherman, and Major General Francis Preston Blair Jr. led the XVII Corps (Union Army) into Cary and established headquarters at the Nancy Jones House, the former home of Jones of Crabtree that had become a tavern and stagecoach stop on the road between Raleigh and Chapel Hill. With Blair&#x27;s arrival, Cary&#x27;s enslaved population was emancipated; some went to Raleigh and joined the 135th U.S. Colored Troops. Blair remained in Cary until the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston on April 27, 1865.

Cary&#x27;s population grew after the Civil War with the completion of the Chatham Railroad junction. Around 1868, the town&#x27;s first depot was built for the Chatham Railroad, and Page laid out residential lots and streets, including Academy and Chatham Streets. At the time, most of Cary&#x27;s men worked for the railroads, but other businesses included a furniture factory, two shingle factories, a tannery, a shoe factory, a brick factory, and a window sash and blind factory. Around 1868, Page also built a Second Empire style hotel for railroad passengers, known today as the Page-Walker Hotel.

Page, Adolphus Jones, and Rufus Jones established Cary Academy, a private boarding school later known as the Female Institute and Cary Female Academy. The two-story school was built in 1870 on Page&#x27;s land at the end of Academy Street with lumber milled on-site by Page. Other additions to the town included Page&#x27;s tobacco warehouse, First Methodist Church, First Baptist Church, and the Cary Colored Christian Church (the latter on land donated by Page), along with two free schools for whites and two free schools for blacks.

Cary was incorporated on April 3, 1871, with Page serving as the first mayor. Its boundaries were established as , with the center being the Chatham Railroad warehouse. Because Page supported temperance, Cary&#x27;s Act of Incorporation prohibited the sale of whiskey in the town&#x27;s boundary and its surrounding ; an 1889 addition the Act of Incorporation also banned &quot;any vinous, spirituous or malt liquors, cider or peach brandies&quot;. Page left Cary in 1880, following lumber opportunities in Moore County. However, Cary&#x27;s prohibition law was in place until 1964 when it was superseded by State and county laws.

The Raleigh and Augusta Air–Line Railroad arrived in Cary in 1879, creating Fetner Junction just north of downtown and spurring further growth. Sixteen Cary residents purchased Cary Academy in 1896 and converted it into the private boarding school, Cary High School, which had 248 students from across the state by 1900. When the North Carolina legislature passed a law establishing a system of public high schools in 1907, Cary High School was transferred to the State for $2,750, giving Cary its claim of having the first state-funded public high school in the state. Town bonds and the State funded a new brick school building in 1913; it was expanded in 1939 with WPA assistance. Today that structure survives as the Cary Arts Center.

In the 1920s, the paved Western Wake Highway (now Western Blvd.) connected Cary to Raleigh via automobile, followed by paved roads to Durham and Apex. This enabled Cary&#x27;s residents to commute for work, and the town&#x27;s population grew by 64% during the decade. Electricity came to Cary in 1921. For the first time, Cary had housing developments, along with a volunteer fire department and municipal water and sewage system. A Masonic Lodge was added to downtown in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, the Bank of Cary failed, and the town went bankrupt. Conditions were so challenging that Cary had four mayors in two years.

In the 1930s, a new North Carolina State University research farm supported Cary&#x27;s farmers. One Cary garden club began growing gourds and showed their products and related crafts at the North Carolina State Fair. After the club&#x27;s first annual Gourd Festival in 1944, they sent exhibits to the International Gourd Society Festival in Pasadena, California and took many prizes This earned Cary the nickname &quot;Gourd Capital of the World&quot;, a designation reflected by gourds circling the original version of the town seal. Now named North Carolina Gourd Festival, the annual event moved to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in 2000.

After World War II, Cary began to attract industry, including the Taylor Biscuit Company (later Austin Foods), which became the town&#x27;s largest employer with some 200 employees. Cary expanded its original single square mile boundary and created a Planning and Zoning Board in 1949. All the streets in Cary were paved by the early 1950s and residential suburbs began forming around the downtown area, including Veteran Hills, Russell Hills, and Montclair subdivisions. The town gained its first supermarket, Piggly Wiggly, in 1950, followed by the Cary Public Library in 1960, and a town-funded fire department in 1961.

The population and number of developments in Cary continued to increase in the 1960s and 1970s after the opening of the nearby Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959. This rapid growth was planned; the State built a four-lane road between Cary and the Research Triangle Park as part of the agreement to attract RTP to North Carolina. Historian Jordan R. Bauer says, &quot;The sleepy town of Cary...was the ideal place for an emerging class of scientific and technical workers&quot;. Initially, Cary adopted zoning and other ordinances on an ad hoc basis to control growth and give the town structure, including its first subdivision regulations in 1961 and a zoning and land-use plan in 1963. To deal with the problem of overcrowding in schools, several new schools were constructed in the 1960s. Cary High School was the first school in Wake County to integrate in 1963. Other ways Cary dealt with the rapid growth in the 1960s was adopting subdivision regulations in 1961, updating zoning ordinances and their land use plan in 1963, and connecting to Raleigh&#x27;s sewer and water systems in the early 1960s.

In 1971, the town created Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning, which lets a developer plan an entire community before beginning construction, allowing future residents to know where churches, schools, commercial, and industrial areas will be located in advance. Developed on the Pine State Dairy&#x27;s former Kildaire Farm, the Kildaire Farms development in Cary was North Carolina&#x27;s first PUD.

In 1960, Cary&#x27;s population was 3,356 but by 1970, it had grown to 7,686. To preserve its small-town feel, of Cary formed the Community Appearance Commission in 1972, which focused on regulating the look of downtown through sign ordinances. The Land Dedication Ordinance of 1974 required developers to set aside one acre of green space for every 35 housing units constructed. During the 1980s, Cary created Industrial Performance Districts, which increased the town&#x27;s tax base by encouraging businesses to build within the town&#x27;s limits. Cary had its own sewer system by the 1980s. The PUD model became so popular in Cary that 22 more were created between 1980 and 1992.

By 2000, Cary&#x27;s population had grown to 94,536. Concerned about forty years of steady growth, in 2008 the town council commissioned the &quot;Cary Historic Preservation Master Plan&quot; to establish a coordinated approach to historic preservation. Cary now has three districts recognized by the National Register of Historic Places: the Carpenter Historic District, the Green Level Historic District, and the Cary Historic District. In addition, the town has designed ten local landmarks which receive a property tax break in exchange for oversight of exterior changes to the structures by the town&#x27;s Historic Preservation Commission.

==Geography==

Located in the piedmont region of North Carolina, most of Cary is in western Wake County, with neighborhood-sized sections in the northeast corner of Chatham County and small portions of southwest Durham County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.82%) is water. Cary is bordered on the north and east by Raleigh, generally toward the north by Research Triangle Park and Morrisville, on the south by Apex and Holly Springs, and on the west by the Jordan Lake area.

Cary is seated on the boundary between the Durham Basin with its softer sedimentary rocks and the piedmont with its harder metamorphic rocks; both geologic provinces have igneous rock intrusions. The landscape is typically gentle to moderate sloping hills separated by narrow V-shaped valleys, but there are areas with steeper slopes and broader, U-shaped valleys in western Cary, roughly along NC 55 near the Research Triangle Park and north of Green Hope School Road. Cary&#x27;s average elevation is .

The Cary drainage basin includes three main creeks—the Crabtree, the Swift, and the Walnut—which are all tributaries of the Neuse River.

Suburbanization is the typical land use in Cary. However, some areas are still undeveloped forests or agricultural, such as the agricultural areas west of NC 55 in Green Level, Upper Middle Creek and the Carpenter community. There is a mixture of mature conifers and broadleaf trees in Cary&#x27;s parks, nature preserves, and older subdivisions such as Farmington Woods, Greenwood Forest, and Kildaire Farms because tree preservation was a key design element. According to the &quot;Town of Cary Land Use Plan&quot;, newer construction in Cary, both residential and commercial, shows &quot;less regard for tree preservation and replanting.&quot;

The Cary Historic District is located two blocks south of downtown and includes a variety of 19th and 20th-century structures of note. Architectural styles that were popular in the 19th century are represented by the Gothic revival Ivey–Ellington House built , the simple Victorian style of the Marcus Baxter Dry House built , and the Queen Anne style of the Sam–Jones cottage built and the Captain Harrison P. Guess House (aka the Guess–White–Ogle House) built in 1830 and 1900.

House, and the brick bungalow style Dr. John Pullen Hunter House. The district also includes the former Cary High School which is a substantial Neo Classical structure that was designed and built in 1939 by the Works Progress Administration, and the related Pasmore House, dating from , which was a boarding house for the former high school.

The primary structure in the district is the brick Carpenter Farm Supply Company which has been described as &quot;the most substantial early twentieth-century store building in rural Wake County&quot;. Other contributing buildings to the historic district include houses, an assemblage of farming structures, and other commercial structures. The most prominent house is the William Henry Carpenter Boarding House which features a simple Victorian porch and gable ornamentation and was used as a residence for railroad workers.

Its includes a late 19th to early 20th-century crossroads centered around the intersection of Green Level Church Road and Green Level West Road and a railroad spur. Most historic structures in the district are along Green Level Church Road, including community buildings, farms, houses, and stores. The 1907 Green Level Baptist Church is one of the best examples of rural church architecture in Wake County. This Gothic Revival church was the &quot;visual and social focal point of the community&quot;. The A.M. and Vallaria Council Farm is a good example of a late 19th-century tobacco farm, with its related tobacco barns and other secondary buildings dating to the 1900s through the 1930s. The Alious H. and Daisey Mills farmhouse is the largest building in the historic district and features a hip roof and slender Doric columns on its porch. It is located across the road and east of the church, on property that includes other historic houses, including a store and farm buildings ranging from a potato shed to a well-house. The two-story Alious Mills Store was built around 1916 and expanded in the 1930s. The one-story Vick and Mattie Council House was built in the 19th century and featured Victorian detailing, such as patterned shingles and decorative vents. The one-story Kenneth and Reba Mills House is an example of a 1930s Tudor Revival.

SAS&#x27;s Building A is ten-stories tall with 990 offices and several two-story atriums. One writer notes, &quot;The design of its headquarters reflects both its status as a tech giant and its original academic routes.&quot; For example, eight solar installations power part of the SAS campus. Building Q is a six-story LEED Gold certified office building that is not only sustainable with features such as a green roof, but is also &quot;light-filled, comfortable, and functional&quot; according to LS3P architects. Building Q also has artwork on every floor; the SAS art collection includes some 4,600 works.

Despite its sizable population, Cary is classified as a &quot;town&quot; because that is how it was incorporated with the State; North Carolina has no legal distinction between a city and a town for size. Cary has a council-manager government; the mayor and council members serve a four-year term, with half of the council seats being up for election each odd-numbered year. Four of the six council seats are elected by single-member districts; the remaining two seats are elected as at-large representatives, meaning they must attract a majority of votes across the whole town. Notable mayors include Fred Bond Jr. (1971–1983), Glen Lang (1999–2003), and Harold Weinbrecht (2007–present).

As of August 2024, the town council consists of mayor Harold Weinbrecht and representatives Jennifer Robinson (District A, Mayor Pro Tem), Michelle Craig (District B), Jack W. Smith (District C), Sarika Bansal (District D), Lori Bush (at-large), and Carissa Kohn-Johnson (at-large). On October 9, 2007, Weinbrecht defeated incumbent mayor Ernie McAlister in the 2007 mayoral election. Citizen concerns that rapid growth was adversely affecting infrastructure and environment over the effect rapid growth was having on the town, especially on roads, schools, and the environment, led to McAlister&#x27;s ouster and Weinbrecht&#x27;s reelection in 2011, 2015, and 2019, and 2023.

On December 26, 2009, &quot;The Nation&quot; reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had secret prisons in the United States, where it held suspected illegal immigrants indefinitely before deportation.

===Smart city technology===
In 2016, Cary created its Simulated Smart City Program, which allows the town to test and evaluate Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city technologies in its town hall campus. Technologies already tested and expanded into the community include sensors for public parking that reveal available spots, smart street lights that dim when not needed, smart trash and recycling containers that message when they are full, and free outdoor Wi-Fi via beacons. The first town-wide IoT project was a smart water monitoring system with analytics from the SAS Institute, which can detect leaks. The National Recreation and Park Association noted, &quot;These technologies offer more than just cost savings for the city of Cary. They also provide convenient quality-of-life improvements for citizens, and in many cases help lower environmental waste.&quot; Cary and SAS also collaborated on an IoT stormwater flood alert system, winning the 2020 IDC Smart Cities North American Awards (Smart Water Category) and the 2020 Government Innovation Award (Leveraging IoT for Increased Flood Protection).

In 2021, Cary installed IoT and smart city technologies that give emergency vehicles faster access through pedestrian crossings, railroad crossings, school zones, and traffic lights. This is the first citywide system like this in North Carolina. Paid for by the town with a matching grant from the U.S Department of Transportation, this project involved fifteen pedestrian crossings, 100 school safety beacons, 205 traffic signals, and railroad crossings.

In late 2021, Cary announced a new tech-focused Center of Excellence that brings together the town, SAS, and Semtech Corporation, to create new community services and expand the digital infrastructure. &quot;Connected World&quot; says, &quot;In the quest for developing smarter cities across the country, ...the town of Cary, N.C., is one of the smartest towns in the United States&quot;.

The Battle of Kings Mountain was proclaimed as &quot;the turning point of the American Revolution&quot; by Thomas Jefferson. Liberty Mountain, a play performed at the local theater, recounts the events of the battle. The downtown area is home to the museum, police station, and the Mauney Memorial Library.

<text>High Point is a city in the Piedmont Triad region of the U.S. state of North Carolina. Most of the city is in Guilford County, with parts extending into Randolph, Davidson, and Forsyth counties. High Point is North Carolina&#x27;s only city that extends into four counties. As of the 2020 census the city had a total population of 114,059. High Point is the ninth-most populous in North Carolina, the third-largest municipality in the Piedmont Triad, and the 259th-most populous city in the U.S.

Major industries in High Point include furniture, textiles, and bus manufacturing. The city&#x27;s official slogan is &quot;North Carolina&#x27;s International City&quot; due to the semi-annual High Point Furniture Market that attracts 100,000 exhibitors and buyers from around the world. It is home to High Point University, a private Methodist-affiliated institution founded in 1924.

The current mayor of High Point is Cyril Jefferson.

==History==
High Point was at the highest point of the 1856 North Carolina Railroad between Charlotte and Goldsboro, where it intersected the 1852 Great Western Plank Road. Its central location and transportation allowed for the delivery of raw materials like cotton and lumber as well as import and export of processed goods, contributing to its early growth. High Point was settled by Europeans, including English Quakers and German immigrants, before 1750, but was not incorporated until 1859. Before it became a major manufacturing center, the most important industries were tobacco, woodworking and textiles. The High Point furniture factory opened in 1889. High Point College was founded in 1924 as a private Methodist-affiliated institution. The college later became a liberal arts university, now with approximately 4,400 undergraduate and graduate students from 51 countries and 46 states.

==Geography==

High Point is the only city in North Carolina that exists within four counties: Davidson, Forsyth, Guilford and Randolph. It also stands within two major watersheds: the Yadkin–Pee Dee to the west and the Cape Fear to the east. Parts of the city rise above , making it among the highest cities in North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont.

High Point is bordered by Greensboro to the north, Jamestown to the northeast, and Archdale to the southeast. The city limits of Trinity and Thomasville come within half a mile of High Point&#x27;s city limits to the south and southwest, respectively.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.60%) is water.

===Climate===
High Point experiences a humid subtropical climate. Summers are hot and humid, and the dew points will often climb to near or even above by late June through much of August. Nights usually remain warm above 70 degrees. Most summers the hottest day will record a maximum between . About once every 5 to 10 years the city will climb to or above . Winters are cool to cold. Nights average near , with the coldest averages in the upper 20s from late December through early February. Most winters the coldest temperature will dip to between . About once every 10 years the minimum will dip below and to near or below approximately once every 20 years. Daytime highs average near in the winter, with the coldest stretch between late December through early February with highs averaging in the upper 40s. Most winters there will be 2 to 4 days that remain below freezing. The hottest temperature on record for the area was on August 18, 1988 (in nearby Greensboro the high reached in 1914), and the coldest was on January 21, 1985.

Rainfall patterns are generally spread evenly throughout the year, with between seven and eleven wet days per month. The city averages around of rain per year. Snowfall varies from year to year, with most years totaling less than . However, there are some years that exceed , and this brings the overall average to more than per year. In the winter of 1959/60 the city had just over of snowfall, which stands as the most dating back to the start of snowfall record-keeping in 1928. In addition to snowfall, some years the city can be impacted by significant ice storms. Cold air wedging up on the east side of the mountains can lock this part of the state into cold air while warmer moist air moves in aloft. This proximity to the mountains creates what is known as the Appalachian Wedge and can produce crippling ice storms.

High Point was one of several communities affected by a 2010 tornado outbreak. The twister reached its most powerful EF3 classification as it crossed the northern suburbs of the city.

In 1989, High Point sustained minor wind damage from Hurricane Hugo as it raced through the western Piedmont region of North Carolina after making landfall 5 hours away in Charleston, South Carolina.

==Economy==
===Diversification===
Though historically focused on production of furniture, hosiery, and Hatteras Yachts, High Point diversified its economy by becoming a center for distribution and logistics, customer service, banking, manufacturing, photography and pharmaceuticals. The High Point Market remains important to High Point&#x27;s economy and the city&#x27;s furniture industry. Its bi-annual trade show is the largest furniture and furnishings industry event in the world. It is held in April and October of each year. Approximately of showroom space is used by 2,300 exhibitors, in 188 separate buildings. Over 100 countries are represented through both vendors and visitors.

===Evolution of furniture industry===
High Point was an early center for the development of the furniture industry in the South. Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina. As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the Civil War and slavery, cheap labor became available during the Reconstruction Era. The North Carolina furniture industry gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and cheap labor. The city was in the center of the Piedmont region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state. High Point, at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, provided a centralized shipping point for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers to developing towns like High Point looking for industrial jobs.

Factories were needed to produce affordable wooden household furniture for the southern market. The first furniture company, the High Point Furniture Manufacturing Company, was formed in 1889. Subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, 38 new furniture factories opened in the state, with 13 of those in High Point. The Southern Railway line was formed in 1894, and High Point was shipping eight fully loaded freight cars of furniture each day by 1898. By the turn of the century, High Point had become the leading furniture center in the South, with over 40 furniture companies in the city and the surrounding area. Meanwhile, other manufacturers set up local factories to provide related products like veneers, plate glass, mirrors, paint, and locks to furniture companies.

Profits in the North Carolina furniture industry declined with the increasing number of factories. In addition to the increased competition for market shares, by 1910 the salary for competent experienced workers and rising shipping costs had cut further into the profit. Bankruptcies resulted from inexperienced managers who tried to sell products below the cost of production and companies that tried to expand too quickly. An innovative High Point company, Tomlinson Chair Co., devised incentives to give its workforce an opportunity to receive part of the profits. The company was one of the first to manufacture period reproduction dining and living room furniture on a large scale. Employees who exceeded monthly quotas received a percentage bonus. All workers received a life insurance policy as well.

Marketing became important to growth of the furniture industry in North Carolina in the twentieth century. Store owners had to visit the factory to select their orders due to the large size and weight of the furniture. This situation improved at the turn of the century with the mass marketing and sales of North Carolina furniture from the catalogues of Sears Roebuck and Co. At the same time, competitors in large cities like New York and Chicago held a national exposition twice a year to display the manufacturers&#x27; products and to take orders from furniture dealers and buyers. Recognizing the need for a more convenient southern location, High Point furniture manufacturers began planning for an exposition to display and sell their product to the public. The first North Carolina furniture exposition was held in High Point in 1905. In 1921, a brand new Southern Furniture Exhibition Building was built with ten stories and at a cost of $2 million. The event that became known as the High Point Furniture Market was attended by 700 buyers and generated $2.25 million in sales. High Point overtook Chicago as the site of the nation&#x27;s most important semi-annual furniture show. Gradually the High Point Furniture Market, held in April and October, grew into an internationally renowned furniture trade fair for home furnishings. High Point continues to be the prime U.S. location to purchase brand-name furniture at a substantial discount.

The furniture industry and developing textile manufacturing set the pace for two 20th century growth booms in High Point. Over the decade of the 1920s, the population grew from 14,302 to 36,745 as $20 million of building permits were issued and $26 million was spent on city improvements. The Great Depression did not seem to affect the southern furniture market, which focused on trendy and affordable furniture, while those in the North focused on traditional, luxurious products. By 1935, North Carolina was second only to New York in US furniture production. Meanwhile, the High Point Market continued to set furniture trends and to be a national economic indicator; the $5 billion in sales in 1947 after World War II forecast a postwar boom. The 1950s&#x27; growth of the furniture market mirrored that of High Point&#x27;s second population boom from 39,973 in 1950 to 62,063 in 1960. By 1959, North Carolina had surpassed New York to become the state employing the most people in the furniture industry. In 1961, &quot;The State&quot; magazine declared, &quot;High Point, in Guilford County, is the world&#x27;s leading manufacturing center of wood furniture. It is also the location of one of the nation&#x27;s principal furniture markets.&quot; Four international furniture shows were being hosted by High Point at that time, including the High Point Market (still known then as the Southern Furniture Exposition), which &quot;The State&quot; reported was drawing crowds of five to six thousand buyers. Throughout the end of the 20th century, North Carolina continued to lead the nation in the production of both upholstered and wooden household furniture. The furniture was slightly styled and inexpensive, but lost its regional characteristics. Some local artisans still maintained a unique and high quality wooden product. High Point became known as the &quot;Furniture Capital of the World&quot; in the 1980s during the golden era of North Carolina furniture manufacturing.

The globalization of the 1990s opened free trade and competition from foreign furniture manufacturers. US companies, unable to compete, began outsourcing to Latin America and Asia. China became the leading manufacturer by producing furniture of equal quality at a lower price. The majority of furniture companies in North Carolina have continued to close since the 1990s. The furniture makers who have maintained a high quality product made from solid wood continue to maintain a unique niche and are sold in both the United States and Asia.

The High Point Museum showcases an exhibit, &quot;High Point&#x27;s Furniture Heritage&quot;, which examines the historical relationship between the furniture industry and the people of High Point. The Bienenstock Furniture Library located in downtown High Point is the largest furniture specialty library in the world and contains over 4,000 furniture and design-specific volumes.

Owing to so much of its dedication to usage as showroom space by the High Point Market, much of downtown High Point lacks the traditional retail and restaurant businesses which characterize other large North Carolina cities, though that sector grew in the city in the 2010s and 2020s, in part due to a customer base present with people involved with High Point University.

===The High Point Market===
The High Point Market is the largest home furnishings industry trade show in the world, with over 11 million square feet (1 km2) and about 2,000 exhibitors throughout about 180 buildings. The market holds two major shows each year, and attracts between 70,000 and 80,000 attendees. A 2018 Duke University study showed that the market contributed $6.7 billion to the area&#x27;s economy. In May 2011, the High Point Market and the Las Vegas World Market Center were combined into the new firm International Market Centers (IMC). In September 2017, Blackstone Inc. and Fireside Investments purchased IMC, which at the time owned 14 buildings totaling 6.7 million square feet, over 50% of the downtown.

===Top employers===
According to High Point&#x27;s 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Transportation==
Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;Carolinian&quot; and &quot;Piedmont&quot; trains connect High Point with the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans. The recently refurbished historic High Point Amtrak station is at 100 West High Street.

Interstate 85 runs through southern High Point, southeast of the original interstate roadway, which is now designated Business 85. The new Interstate 74 runs north and east of the city. This section is referred locally as the &quot;East Belt&quot; freeway project, and was completed southeast to I-73/US 220 near Randleman in 2013. To the northwest, it extends to Interstate 40 in Winston-Salem.

The Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation (PART) operates in High Point. It is a service that shuttles people among most of the cities in the northwestern Piedmont region of North Carolina. The main service for public transportation in High Point is Hi tran, the local bus service.

==Education==

Private schools for children were established in and around High Point as early as the early nineteenth century by Quakers. The New York Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, a network of Quakers from that state, started a school in Asheboro in the 1880s for African American students. The school relocated to High Point in 1891 on land east of town on Washington Street. The institution was named the High Point Normal and Industrial School (later William Penn High School), and was administered by the Quakers until 1897. In that year, black educator Alfred J. Griffin accepted the position of principal and led the establishment into a long period of growth. The school closed in 1968, but was renovated and reopened in 2003 as Penn-Griffin School for the Arts, a public arts magnet high school. It is one of three public high schools in the city.

The High Point public school system was founded in 1897 with the approval of a $10,000 bond, in part to finance the purchase of J. Elwood Cox&#x27;s family home on South Main Street for use as the first school building. Twelve school commissioners were appointed to administer the 350-student system of five grades. Growth of the city&#x27;s institutions reflected improved primary educational facilities. A school building campaign coupled with additional grades and improved classes resulted in four additional schools for white students: Elm Street School (1905), Park Street School (1910), Fairview School (1910), and Grimes Street School (1911). Many other schools were born in the 1920s during a period of rapid growth.

This building spree culminated in 1927 with the opening of High Point High School. Among the many high styled school complexes in the state, few surpass High Point&#x27;s grand 1927 high school. The campus joined the talents of two designers, Greensboro architect Harry Barton and Charlotte landscape architect Earl S. Draper. The building was matched in 1931 with the addition of Ferndale Middle School just to the east, designed to incorporate details from the high school so that it maintained a campus theme. Both shared athletic facilities on a large tract of land between downtown and Emerywood. In 1962, High Point High School&#x27;s name was modified to High Point Central High School when an additional high school, T. Wingate Andrews High School, was established in the 1960s.

Several private and independent schools are found in High Point, including High Point Christian Academy (Baptist), High Point Friends School (Quaker), Immaculate Heart of Mary (Catholic), Wesleyan Christian Academy (Wesleyan), and Westchester Country Day School (nonsectarian), and Phoenix Academy, a charter school.

In 1921, the Chamber of Commerce made the establishment of a college in High Point a high priority and initiated a High Point College campaign. The campaign solicited funds in order to attract the attention of the North Carolina Methodist Protestants, who had desired for decades to found a college.

High Point succeeded in attracting the college over rivals Greensboro and Burlington with a gift of and $100,000 in pledges from leading citizens. High Point College opened in 1924 (changed to High Point University in 1991) with three buildings at various stages of development. Many of the numerous civic organizations founded in the 1920s pledged funds, including the Rotary, Kiwanis, Civitan, and the American Business Club. The architectural design of the High Point College campus was in keeping with traditional and historical architectural initiatives found at many private colleges and universities across the state in the 1920s. The administration building (Roberts Hall), male and female dormitories (McCulloch Hall and Women&#x27;s Hall, respectively), and a central heating plant were all erected between 1922 and 1924 according to designs by Washington, D.C. architect R.

<text>Thomasville is a city in Davidson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 27,183 at the 2020 census. The city was once notable for its furniture industry, as were its neighbors High Point and Lexington. This Piedmont Triad community was established in 1852 and hosts the state&#x27;s oldest festival, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Day&quot;.

==History==
John Warwick Thomas was born June 27, 1800, and by age 22 owned in the Cedar Lodge area after marrying Mary Lambeth, daughter of Moses Lambeth. By age 30 he was a state representative. In 1848 he became a state senator. He pushed to get a railroad built through Davidson County and even invested money. Knowing the railroad was coming, Thomas built the community&#x27;s first store in 1852 at present-day West Main and Salem streets, and the community was named &quot;Thomasville&quot; for its founder. In 1855 the North Carolina Railroad was built through Davidson County, reaching Thomasville November 9. On January 8, 1857, Thomasville was incorporated and occupied one square mile, with the railroad dividing the town into north and south sections.

In 1860 Thomasville had 308 people. After the Civil War the town had only 217 residents, but by 1880 the population was 450, reaching 751 by 1890.

Long Bill Whiteheart may have been the first to make furniture; he made split-bottom chairs at home. D.S. Westmoreland also made chairs at home starting in 1866, and his factory on what became Randolph Street went up in 1879 but burned in 1897 and was not rebuilt. The oldest plant still standing as of 1990 was that of Standard Chair, built in 1898. Other furniture companies were Lambeth Furniture, Thompson Chair, and Queen Chair Company.

Cramer Furniture was said to be the South&#x27;s second largest furniture company in 1901. Thomasville Chair, started in 1904, soon became the town&#x27;s leading furniture manufacturer. By 1916, 2,000 chairs a day were being made citywide.

By 1909 Jewel Cotton Mills and Amazon Cotton Mills gave Thomasville another industry, textiles. Sellers Hosiery Mills of Burlington opened in 1913, and Thomasville Hosiery in 1916.

The Abbott&#x27;s Creek Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery, Brummell&#x27;s Inn, Church Street School, Emanuel United Church of Christ Cemetery, Shadrach Lambeth House, Mitchell House, Randolph Street Historic District, Salem Street Historic District, Smith Clinic, Thomasville Downtown Historic District, and Thomasville Railroad Passenger Depot are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Big Chair==

Thomasville is commonly referred to as the &quot;Chair Town&quot; or &quot;Chair City&quot;, in reference to a landmark replica of a Duncan Phyfe armchair that rests in the middle of the city. The original &quot;Big Chair&quot; was constructed in 1922 by the now-defunct Thomasville Furniture Industries (formerly the Thomasville Chair Company) out of lumber and Swiss steer hide to reflect the city&#x27;s prominent furniture industry. However, this chair was scrapped in 1936 after 15 years of exposure to the weather. In 1951, a larger concrete version of the chair was erected with the collaboration of local businesses and civic organizations and still remains today. The Big Chair gained national attention in 1960 when then presidential candidate Lyndon B. Johnson greeted supporters on the monument during a campaign whistle stop. Although larger ones have been built, many Thomasville residents still boast that the Big Chair between the two Main Streets is the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Chair&quot;.

==Geography==
Thomasville is located in northeastern Davidson County and is bordered to the east by the city of Trinity in Randolph County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Thomasville has a total area of , of which , or 0.07%, is water.

<text>Durham ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina and the county seat of Durham County. Small portions of the city limits extend into Orange County and Wake County. With a population of 283,506 in the 2020 census, Durham is the fourth-most populous city in North Carolina and the 70th-most populous city in the United States. The city is located in the east-central part of the Piedmont region along the Eno River. Durham is the core of the four-county Durham–Chapel Hill metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 608,879 in 2023. The Office of Management and Budget also includes Durham as a part of the Raleigh–Durham–Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the Research Triangle, which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023.

A railway depot was established in 1849 on land donated by Bartlett S. Durham, the namesake of the city. Following the American Civil War, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the tobacco industry. The town was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, in April 1869. The establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Textile and electric power industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth to become an educational, medical, and research center.

Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the Duke University Hospital and many private companies. Duke and its Duke University Health System are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a historically black university that is part of the University of North Carolina System. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the Research Triangle area; central to this is the Research Triangle Park south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.

On the Duke University campus are the neo-Gothic Duke Chapel and the Nasher Museum of Art. Other notable sites in the city include the Museum of Life and Science, Durham Performing Arts Center, Carolina Theatre, and Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory. Bennett Place commemorates the location where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with Raleigh, by Raleigh–Durham International Airport.

==History==
===Pre-establishment===
The Eno and the Occoneechi, related to the Sioux and the Shakori, lived in the area and may have established a village named Adshusheer (or Ajusher) in the area which became Durham. The Occaneechi Path, a corridor of trading roads and trails, went through the area. Native Americans expanded the region by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.

In 1701, English explorer John Lawson, documented the area and would later call it &quot;the flower of the Carolinas&quot;. Lawson claimed that Ajusher was situated from Occaneechi Town. In the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by King Charles I, a grant that had by then been inherited by his great-grandson John. Early settlers built settlements as well as farms and mills, like West Point Mill.

Frontiersmen in the area, prior to the American Revolutionary War, participated in the Regulator Movement. Loyalist militia used Cornwallis Road to cut through the area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. William Johnston, a local a farmer and shopkeeper, made munitions for the Continental Army, served in the Provincial Congress in 1775, and financially supported Daniel Boone on his westward explorations.

===Antebellum and Civil War===
Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east–west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.

Large plantations, Hardscrabble, Fairntosh, Lipscomb, Walnut Hall, Patterson, and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free African-Americans in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.

Durham&#x27;s location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new North Carolina Railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than &quot;a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad&quot; and refused to sell or lease land for a depot. In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by Dr. Bartlett S. Durham; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift. A U.S. post office was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city&#x27;s official birthday.

Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, was headquartered in Greensboro to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at Bennett Place, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army&#x27;s lines about west of Durham Station.

As both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area&#x27;s Brightleaf tobacco, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.

===Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco===

The community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green&#x27;s tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the &quot;Bull Durham Tobacco Factory&quot;. The name &quot;Bull Durham&quot; is said to have been taken from the bull on the British Colman&#x27;s Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in Durham, England. Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in Durham, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of Colman&#x27;s of Norwich, England.
===Incorporation===
As Durham Station&#x27;s population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of Durham County was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of Wake County. In 1911, parts of Cedar Fork Township of Wake County was transferred to Durham County and became Carr Township.

===Early growth (1900–1970)===

The rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and Washington Duke&#x27;s W. Duke &amp; Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Throughout the Gilded Age and into the early twentieth century, Durham industrialists, including George Washington Watts, John Sprunt Hill, and Julian S. Carr, built large mansions such as Somerset Villa, Harwood Hall, the John Sprunt Hill House, and Greystone Manor. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke&#x27;s business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as American Tobacco, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco&#x27;s ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation&#x27;s image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.
Prevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. Duke Power (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910–1920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local &quot;powerhouses&quot;. These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco. Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham&#x27;s public bus system (now GoDurham) until 1991.

The success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single-family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.

Much of the early city architecture, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890–1930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department&#x27;s water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.

Durham quickly developed a black community, the center of which was an area known as &quot;Hayti&quot;, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses — the best known of which are North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics &amp; Farmers Bank — were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;. In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation&#x27;s first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.

In 1924, James Buchanan Duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father Washington Duke to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to Duke University and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the Duke East Campus).

Durham&#x27;s manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. Textile mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham&#x27;s tobacco industry.

In a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation&#x27;s first &quot;science park&quot; for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the Research Triangle Park an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham&#x27;s tobacco and textile industries.

===Civil rights movement===
As a result of its substantial African-American community, including many activists, a prominent civil rights movement developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and Martin Luther King Jr., visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, Douglas E. Moore, minister of Durham&#x27;s Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.

Widely credited as the first sit-in of the civil rights movement in North Carolina, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the Greensboro Four, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.

The six-month-long sit-in at a Woolworth&#x27;s counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, captured the nation&#x27;s attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry &quot;Fill up the jails,&quot; during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, &quot;Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South.&quot;

This community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s. The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hill, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.

===1970s–present===

In 1970, the Census Bureau reported city&#x27;s population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white. Durham&#x27;s growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest Research Triangle Park, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph&#x27;s Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to &quot;preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans&#x27; contributions to world culture.&quot;

In 1987, the American Tobacco Factory in Durham closed, leading to an economic downturn and a decline in the city&#x27;s reputation. A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the Durham Bulls in 1994. The Durham Performing Arts Center now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including B.B. King and Willie Nelson. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown. While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham&#x27;s residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.

Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (NC 147).

===Downtown revitalization===


In recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the Durham Performing Arts Center and new Durham Bulls Athletic Park. The American Tobacco Historic District, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups. Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as Measurement Incorporated and Capitol Broadcasting Company.
The American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including Red Hat, was selected by Google to host its launch of the Google Glass Road show in October 2013. The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space The Durham County Justice Center, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.

Many of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios, and co-working spaces, in addition to shopping and dining in nearby Brightleaf Square, another former tobacco warehouse in the Bright Leaf Historic District. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the American Tobacco Trail, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.

In 2013, 21c Museum Hotels announced plans to fully renovate the Hill Building. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. Skanska is responsible for managing this project.

In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named &quot;City Center Tower,&quot; but now called &quot;One City Center&quot;. Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018. Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham&#x27;s current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018. This is an ambitious, $80 million project.

In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.

On April 10, 2019, a gas explosion rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in Bright Leaf Historic District. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.

==Geography==
Durham is located in the east–central part of the Piedmont region at (35.99, -78.9). Like much of the region, its topography is generally flat with some rolling hills.

As of 2022, the city had a total area of , of which was land and (0.71%) was water.

The soil is predominantly clay, making it poor for agriculture. The Eno River, a tributary of the Neuse River, passes through the northern part of Durham, along with several other small creeks. The center of Durham is on a ridge that forms the divide between the Neuse River watershed, flowing east to Pamlico Sound, and the Cape Fear River watershed, flowing south to the Atlantic near Wilmington. A small portion of the city is in Wake County.

Durham is located 10 miles northeast of Chapel Hill, 21 miles northwest of Raleigh, 50 miles east of Greensboro, 121 miles northeast of Charlotte and 134 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia.

The region sees an average of of snow per year, with any snowfall usually melting within a few days.

The Durham area consistently ranks in the top 10 most challenging places to live with seasonal allergies.

Climate change is expected to increase the number of days of extreme precipitation in Durham as well as moderately increase temperature within the region. The number of days of inland flooding within the Piedmont is also expected to increase, which puts Durham at higher risk of future flooding. High-intensity short-duration storms are predicted to grow in frequency to upwards of 9 days a year by 2100. Inland flooding is anticipated to have a greater impact on the elderly and other at-risk groups.

Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women&#x27;s fast pitch softball team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998 to 2000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.

==Government and politics==
===Government===

Durham operates under a council–manager form of government. The city is led by a city council and a mayor. Council members are chosen in staggered elections to serve four year terms, while mayoral elections are held every two years. The mayor presides over meetings of the city council and makes some committee appointments, while much of the regular management of the city&#x27;s administration falls to the city manager. In November 2021, Elaine O&#x27;Neal was elected mayor of Durham, becoming the first black female mayor in the city. The current mayor is Leonardo Williams, who was elected in November 2023.

Federally, Durham is in North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which is represented by Democrat Valerie Foushee.

The new Durham County Justice Center was completed in early 2013.

===Politics===
The area is predominantly Democratic, and has voted for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential candidate in every election since the city&#x27;s founding in 1869. Durham County is the most liberal-leaning county in North Carolina, with over 80% of the county voting for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. The city&#x27;s politics have long been dominated by the activities of two local political action committees, the People&#x27;s Alliance (PA) and the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People (DCABP). PA is a mostly-white progressive organization, while the DCABP is a black moderate group.

Key political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, and growth and development. A merger of Durham City Schools (several inner city neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s ignited controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council&#x27;s 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latino council member Javiera Caballero. In 2023, Durham elected Nate Baker to the city council, its first candidate endorsed by the Triangle chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
Public schools in Durham are run by the Durham Public Schools, the eighth-largest school district in North Carolina. The district runs 46 public schools, consisting of 30 elementary, 10 middle, 2 secondary, and 12 high schools. Several magnet high schools focus on distinct subject areas, such as the Durham School of the Arts and the City of Medicine Academy. Public schools in Durham were partially segregated until 1970.

The North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics is a boarding high school operated by the University of North Carolina System in central Durham. The residential school accepts rising juniors living in North Carolina, with a focus on science, mathematics, and technology.

There are several charter school options as well, including Research Triangle High School (a STEM school in Research Triangle Park), Voyager Academy (K–12), Kestrel Heights School (K–12), Maureen Joy Charter School (K–8), and most recently Excelsior Classical Academy (K–12).

Several private schools operate in Durham, such as Durham Academy, Triangle Day School, and The Duke School. There are also religious schools, including Carolina Friends School, Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill, Cristo Rey Research Triangle High School, Immaculata Catholic School, and Durham Nativity School.

===Colleges and universities===
Duke University has approximately 14,000 students, split evenly between graduates and undergraduates. Duke&#x27;s 8600-acre campus and Medical Center are located in western Durham, about from downtown. Duke forms one of the three vertices of the Research Triangle, along with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University.

North Carolina Central University is a public historically black university located in southeastern Durham. The university was founded by James E. Shepard in 1910 as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua to address the needs of the region&#x27;s black population, and now grants baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, professional and doctoral degrees. NCCU became a university in 1969 and joined the University of North Carolina System in 1972.

Durham Technical Community College is a two-year public institution that grants associate degrees.

==Media==

The major daily newspaper in Durham is &quot;The Herald-Sun&quot;, which began publication in 1893. The Durham-based &quot;Independent Weekly&quot;, noted for its progressive/liberal perspective, provides political and entertainment news for the greater Research Triangle; it began publication in 1983. Duke&#x27;s independent student newspaper, &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, also provides local coverage.

Durham is part of the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville designated market area, the 24th-largest broadcast television market in the United States. ABC-owned and -operated WTVD is licensed to and based in Durham, while the studios for statewide public television service UNC-TV are based in Research Triangle Park. All major U.S. television networks have affiliates serving the region.

The city is part of the Raleigh–Durham Arbitron radio market, ranked No. 37 nationally. National Public Radio affiliate WUNC, based in Chapel Hill, has significant operations in Durham.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Most travel in Durham is by private motor vehicle on its network of public streets and highways. Important arteries for traffic include NC 147, which connects Duke University, downtown, and Research Triangle Park, U.S. 15-501 between Durham and Chapel Hill, I-85, connecting Durham to Virginia and western North Carolina cities, and I-40 running across southern Durham County between the Research Triangle Park and Chapel Hill. The I-40 corridor has been the main site of commercial and residential development in Durham since its opening in the early 1990s. Over 95% of commuters use a car to get to work, with 14% of those people in carpools.

Durham maintains an extensive network of bicycle routes and trails and has been recognized with a Bicycle Friendly Community Award. The American Tobacco Trail begins in downtown and continues south through Research Triangle Park and ends in Wake County. The city is also considering furthering the progress on the Triangle Greenway System.

Air travel is provided by Raleigh–Durham International Airport, 12 miles southeast of Durham, which enplanes about 4.5 million passengers per year. Frequent service (five flights a day or more) is available to Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia, New York LaGuardia, New York Kennedy, Newark, Washington Reagan, Washington Dulles, Chicago O&#x27;Hare, Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta, GA. Non-stop daily service is provided to approximately 30 destinations in the United States and daily international service is also available to London Heathrow, Toronto-Pearson and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

Amtrak operates the daily &quot;Carolinian&quot; train between Charlotte and New York City, which stops in downtown Durham. The State of North Carolina, in cooperation with Amtrak, operates four additional daily &quot;Piedmont&quot; trains between Raleigh and Charlotte which also stop in Durham. A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown railroad underpass has attracted national media coverage because it provided only 11 feet 8 inches of clearance, damaging the roofs of many trucks. On October 26, 2019, the underpass was temporarily closed to both automotive and train traffic so that the track could be raised to improve the railway grade in that location and increase the clearance underneath to 12 feet 4 inches. Nonetheless, a few accidents still occur.

National bus service is provided by Greyhound and Megabus at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. GoDurham provides municipal bus service.

GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region&#x27;s other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh–Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region&#x27;s larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region&#x27;s larger employers and commute destinations.

From 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle&#x27;s long-term plan was a rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh–Durham metropolitan area have struggled to determine the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region. The project was cancelled 2019 with costs more than $157 million.

The region&#x27;s two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit&#x27;s problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit&#x27;s original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.

Duke University also maintains its own transit system. Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses, with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.

To help create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham&#x27;s Pace Car Program, agreeing to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.

<text>Morrisville is a town located primarily in Wake County, North Carolina, United States (a small portion extends into neighboring Durham County). According to the 2020 census, the population was 29,630. Morrisville is part of the Research Triangle metropolitan region, located midway between the cities of Raleigh and Durham. The Research Triangle region encompasses the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area. The operational headquarters of Lenovo is located in the municipal limits.

==History==
The area was originally named in 1852 after Jeremiah Morris. Morris donated land to the North Carolina Railroad for a depot, water tower, and other buildings. The town continued to grow as a result of the rail line and its location at the intersection of roads leading to Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Hillsborough.

On April 13, 1865, in the Battle of Morrisville, United States cavalry under the command of Gen. Judson Kilpatrick skirmished with the retreating Confederate armies at Morrisville Station. The Confederate troops were successful in evacuating their remaining supplies and wounded to the west toward Greensboro, but Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s cavalry forced the Confederates to leave the train behind and retreat toward Durham and the eventual surrender of the largest Confederate force of the war at Bennett Place.

The town was officially chartered in 1875 but was disincorporated in 1933. Eventually the town charter was restored in 1947.

Morrisville History (as listed on historical marker):

Morrisville Station: &quot;On April 16, 1865, Union cavalry under the command of General William T. Sherman, captured Raleigh and pursued the retreating Confederate cavalry west along the railroad. Rearguard skirmishes erupted at points along the Hillsborough Road until the combatants reached Morrisville. Using cavalry and artillery, Union forces attacked a Confederate train loaded with supplies and wounded. Before withdrawing, the Confederate cavalry repelled the attack long enough to allow the railcars of wounded to escape while abandoning the supplies. This was the last major cavalry engagement in Sherman&#x27;s campaign. The next night, a courier from the Confederate commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, rode into the Union camp at Morrisville with a truce proposal. Subsequent negotiations between Johnston and Sherman led to the largest Confederate surrender of the Civil War at the Bennett Farm in Durham on April 26.&quot;

The history marker notes it was given in memory of Commissioner C.T. Moore.

On December 13, 1994, Flagship Airlines Flight 3379 crashed in Morrisville, killing 15 of the 20 people on board.

==Geography==

Morrisville is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the North American Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the &quot;Fall Line&quot; because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Morrisville features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state&#x27;s flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates the county approximately three hours west of Atlantic Beach by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains.

<doc id="150837" wikidata="Q26245" url="?curid=150837" title="Rusyn language">
<text>Rusyn ( ; ; ) is an East Slavic language spoken by Rusyns in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, and written in the Cyrillic script. The majority of speakers live in an area known as Carpathian Ruthenia that spans from Transcarpathia, westward into eastern Slovakia and south-east Poland. There is also a sizeable Pannonian Rusyn linguistic island in Vojvodina, Serbia, as well as a Rusyn diaspora throughout the world. Per the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Rusyn is officially recognized as a protected minority language by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Poland (as Lemko), Serbia, and Slovakia.

The categorization of Rusyn as a language or dialect is a source of controversy. Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian, as well as American and some Polish and Serbian linguists treat it as a distinct language (with its own ISO 639-3 code), whereas other scholars (in Ukraine, Poland, Serbia, and Romania) treat it as a dialect of Ukrainian.
== Name ==
In the English language, the term &quot;Rusyn&quot; is recognized officially by the ISO. Other names are sometimes also used to refer to the language, mainly deriving from exonyms such as &quot;Ruthenian&quot; or &quot;Ruthene&quot; ( , ), that have more general meanings, and thus (by adding regional adjectives) some specific designations are formed, such as: Carpathian Ruthenian/Ruthene or Carpatho-Ruthenian/Ruthene.

Within the Rusyn community, the language is also referred to as , or simply referred to as speaking &quot;our way&quot; ().

== Classification ==
The classification of the Rusyn language has historically been both linguistically and politically controversial. During the 19th century, several questions were raised among linguists, regarding the classification of East Slavic dialects that were spoken in the northeastern (Carpathian) regions of the Kingdom of Hungary, and also in neighbouring regions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. From those questions, three main theories emerged:

* Some linguists claimed that East Slavic dialects of the Carpathian region should be classified as specific varieties of the Russian language. 
* Other linguists argued that those dialects should be classified as western varieties of a distinctive Ukrainian language. 
* A third group claimed that those dialects are specific enough to be recognized as a distinctive East Slavic language.

In spite of these linguistic disputes, official terminology used by the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy that ruled the Carpathian region remained unchanged. For Austro-Hungarian state authorities, the entire East Slavic linguistic body within the borders of the Monarchy was classified as &quot;Ruthenian&quot; language (, ), an archaic and exonymic term that remained in use until 1918.

== Geographic distribution ==
In terms of geographic distribution, Rusyn language is represented by two specific clusters: the first is encompassing Carpathian Rusyn or Carpatho-Rusyn varieties, and the second is represented by Pannonian Rusyn.

Carpathian Rusyn is spoken in:
* the Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine.
* northeastern regions of Slovakia.
* southeastern regions of Poland. The variety of Rusyn spoken in Poland is generally known as &quot;Lemko&quot; language ( ).
* northeastern regions of Hungary.
* northern regions of Romania (in Maramureș).

Pannonian Rusyn is spoken by the Pannonian Rusyns in the region of Vojvodina (in Serbia), and in a nearby region of Slavonia (in Croatia).
== Varieties ==

=== Carpathian Rusyn varieties ===
The main continuum of Rusyn varieties stretches from Transcarpathia and follows the Carpathian Mountains westward into South-Eastern Poland and Eastern Slovakia, forming an area referred to as Carpathian Ruthenia. As with any language, all three major varieties of Rusyn vary with respect to phonology, morphology, and syntax, and have various features unique to themselves, while of course also containing their own, more local sub-varieties. The continuum of Rusyn is agreed to include the varieties known historically as Lemko and Bojko, and is also generally accepted to end at or with the Hucul variety, which is &quot;not included in the Rusyn continuum per se, but represent[s] a linguistic variant .. better seen as a dialect of Ukrainian&quot;. As the westernmost member of the family of East Slavic languages, it has also acquired a number of West Slavic features—unique to East Slavic languages—due to prolonged contact with the coterritorial languages of Polish and Slovak.

==== Literary languages ====
Today, there are three formally codified Rusyn literary varieties and one de facto (Subcarpathian Rusyn). These varieties reflect the culmination of nearly two centuries of activist and academic labor, during which a literary Rusyn language was desired, discussed, and addressed (time and again) by a dedicated intelligentsia. Linguist Stefan M. Pugh notes, &quot;...at every stage someone was thinking of writing in Rusyn; approximately every generation a grammar of some sort would be written but not find wide acceptance, primarily for reasons of a political nature (and of course logistical practicalities).&quot;

Some of these earlier grammars include those by Dmytrij Vyslockij (&quot;Karpatorusskij bukvar&quot;&quot;&#x27;), Vanja Hunjanky&quot; (1931), Metodyj Trochanovskij &quot;(Bukvar: Perša knyžečka dlja narodnıx škol&quot;; 1935), and Ivan Harajda (1941). Harajda&#x27;s grammar is particularly notable for having arrived in the midst of a five-year linguistic fervor for Carpatho-Rusyn. From 1939 through 1944 an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 Rusyn-language publications (mostly centered around Uzhhorod, Ukraine) entered print and from 1941 onward, Harajda&#x27;s grammar was the accepted standard.

==== Prešov Rusyn ====
In Slovakia, the Prešov literary variety has been under continuous codification since 1995 when first published by Vasyl Jabur, Anna Plíšková and Kvetoslava Koporová. Its namesakes are both the city and region of Prešov, Slovakia—historically, each have been respective centers for Rusyn academia and the Rusyn population of Slovakia.

Prešov Rusyn was based on varieties of Rusyn found in a relatively compact area within the Prešov Region. Specifically, the variety is based on the language spoken in the area between the West Zemplin and East Zemplin Rusyn dialects (even more specifically: a line along the towns and villages of Osadne, Hostovice, Parihuzovce, Čukalovce, Pcoline, Pichne, Nechvalova Polianka, Zubne, Nizna Jablonka, Vysna Jablonka, Svetlice, and Zbojne). And though the many Rusyn dialects of Slovakia entirely surpass the limited set of features prescribed in the standard, this comparatively small sample size was consciously chosen by codifiers in order to provide a structured ecosystem within which a variety of written and spoken language would inevitably (and already did) thrive.

Its orthography is largely based on Zhelekhivka, a late 19th century variety of the Ukrainian alphabet.

==== Lemko-Rusyn ====

In Poland, a standard Lemko-Rusyn grammar and dictionary, (), was published in 2000 by Mirosława Chomiak and , with a second edition issued in 2004.

==== Subcarpathian Rusyn ====
In Transcarpathia, Ukraine, M. Almašij&#x27;s and Igor Kerča&#x27;s , serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; literary standard for Subcarpathian, though &quot;unofficial&quot;. Published in 1999, with a second edition in 2004, and a 58,000 word Rusyn-Russian dictionary in 2007, Kerča&#x27;s work has been used by prominent Rusyn publishers in Uzhhorod—albeit with variations between published works that are typical of the spoken language.

===== Common usage =====
Despite the above codified varieties, many Carpatho-Rusyn publications will use a combination of the three Carpathian standards (most notably in Hungary and in Transcarpathia). There have even attempts to revitalize the pre-war etymological orthography with archaic Cyrillic orthography (i.e. usage of the letter ѣ, or &quot;yat&quot;&#x27;); the latter can be observed throughout Rusyn Wikipedia, where even a single article may be written in several different codified varieties. And while somewhat archaic, used of Harajda&#x27;s grammar is even promoted by some in Rusyn Wikipedia (although parts of the articles are written using other standards).

=== Pannonian Rusyn ===
Pannonian Rusyn, has variously been referred to as an incredibly distinct dialect of Carpathian Rusyn or a separate language altogether. In the ISO 639-9 identifier application for Pannonian Rusyn (or &quot;Ruthenian&quot; as it is referred to in that document), the authors note that &quot;Ruthenian is closest to [a] linguistic entity sometimes called [ , ], ... (the speeches of Trebišov and Prešov [districts]).&quot;

==== Literary language ====
The literary variety of Serbian and Croatian Rusyns is, again, significantly different from the above three Carpathian varieties in both vocabulary and grammar. It was first standardized in 1923 by G. Kostelnik. The modern standard has been continuously developed since the 1980s by Julian Ramač, Helena Međeši and Mihajlo Fejsa of Serbia, and Mihály Káprály of Hungary.
== History ==

The Niagovo Postilla (Njagovskie poučenija), dated to 1758, is one of the earliest texts possessing significant phonetic and morphological characteristics of modern Rusyn (specifically the Subcarpathian variant) and is potentially &quot;linguistically traceable&quot; to the 16th century.

By the 18th century, the Rusyn language was &quot;clearly in evidence&quot; and &quot;quite recognizable in a more systematic fashion&quot;.

The first books produced exclusively for Rusyn readership were printed under the direction of bishop of Mukachevo, Joseph Decamillis (r. 1690 – 1706). Under his direction, the printshop at the University of Trnava published a catechism (Katekhisis dlia naouki Ouhorouskim liudem, 1698) and an elementary language primer (Boukvar’ iazyka slaven’ska, 1699). For decades, these would be the only textbooks available to Rusyn students.

Later, in 1767 Maria Theresa&#x27;s Urbarium was published throughout the Habsburg Empire in a variety of languages, including Rusyn.

Finally, under Bishop Andriy Bachynskyi&#x27;s tenure (r. 1773 – 1809) in the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo, new texts for Rusyn student readership were published. These several editions of Ioann Kutka&#x27;s primer and catechism were published in Rusyn vernacular, though with heavy influence from Church Slavonic. 

=== 19th century ===

By the 19th century, &quot;attempts to write in a form of Russo-Church Slavonic with a Rusyn flavor, or a type of &#x27;Subcarpathian Russian&#x27; with Rusyn phonetic features,&quot; began to be made. Notably, Myxajlo Lučkaj&#x27;s grammar of the Subcarpathian variety of Church Slavonic, &quot;Grammatica Slavo-Ruthena&quot;, of 1830 had a &quot;distinctly Rusyn flavor&quot;. And while Lučkaj did not support use of vernacular as a literary language (commenting on the proper usage of either in his &quot;Praefatio&quot;), he &quot;did&quot; include examples of &quot;Rusyn paradigms&quot; in his work to attempt demonstrate its similarity to Church Slavonic. Lučkaj in effect sought to prove the two languages were close sisters of a common ancestor. 

In 1847, Greek Catholic priest Alexander Dukhnovych published the first textbook written almost fully in common Rusyn vernacular, &quot;Knyzhytsia chytalnaia dlia nachynaiushchykh&quot; (A Reader for Beginners). Further editions of the primer followed in 1850 and 1852, as well as the establishment of &quot;the first Carpatho-Rusyn cultural organization&quot;, the Prešov Literary Society, in 1850. Over the next four years of its existence, the Society would go on to publish a further 12 works, including Dukhnovych&#x27;s &quot;Virtue is More Important than Riches&quot; (the very first play written in Carpatho-Rusyn), as well Carpatho-Rusyn&#x27;s first literary anthologies in 1850, 1851, and 1852, titled &quot;Greetings to the Rusyns&quot;.

=== 20th century ===

After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary (1918), the newly proclaimed Hungarian Republic recognized Rusyn regional autonomy in Subcarpathian regions and created, at the beginning of 1919, a department for Rusyn language and literature at the Budapest University.

By the end of 1919, the region of Subcarpathian Ruthenia was appended to the newly formed Czechoslovak state, as its easternmost province. During the next twenty years, linguistic debates were continued between the same three options (pro-Russian, pro-Ukrainian, and local Rusyn), with Czechoslovak state authorities occasionally acting as arbiters.

In March 1939, the region proclaimed independence under the name Carpatho-Ukraine, but it was immediately occupied and annexed by Hungary. The region was later occupied (1944) and annexed (1945) by the Soviet Union, and incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, which proceeded with implementation of Ukrainian linguistic standards. In Soviet Ukraine, Rusyns were not recognized as a distinctive ethnicity, and their language was considered a dialect of Ukrainian language. Poland employed similar policies, using internal deportations to move many Eastern Slavs from southeastern to newly acquired western regions (Operation Vistula), and switch their language to Polish, and Ukrainian at school.

During that period, the only country that was officially recognizing the Rusyn minority and its language was Yugoslavia.

==== Post-Soviet developments ====
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, modern standards of minority rights were gradually applied throughout Eastern Europe, thus affecting the attitude of several states towards the Rusyn language. As successors of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Croatia continued to recognize the Rusyn language as an official minority language.

Scholars with the former Institute of Slavic and Balkan Studies in Moscow (now the Institute of Slavonic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences) formally acknowledged Rusyn as a separate language in 1992, and trained specialists to study the language. These studies were financially supported by the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Since 1995, Rusyn has been recognized as a minority language in Slovakia, enjoying the status of an official language in municipalities where more than 20 percent of the inhabitants speak Rusyn.

=== Contemporary status ===

Ukrainian state authorities do not recognize Rusyns as a separate ethnicity, regardless of Rusyn self-identification. Ukraine officially considered Rusyn a dialect of Ukrainian. In 2012, Ukraine adopted a new law, recognizing Rusyn as one of several minority and regional languages, but that law was revoked in 2014.

Rusyn is recognized as an officially protected, minority language by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2011), Croatia (1997), Hungary (1998), Romania (2008), Poland (as Lemko, 2009), Serbia (2006), and Slovakia (2002).

It is not possible to estimate accurately the number of fluent speakers of Rusyn; however, their number is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

==== ISO 639-9 Identifiers ====

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has assigned the ISO 639-3 code &#x27;rue&#x27; for Carpathian Rusyn.
== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===

A soft consonant combination sound [] exists more among the northern and western dialects. In the eastern dialects the sound is recognized as [], including the area on which the standard dialect is based. It is noted that a combination sound like this one, could have evolved into a soft fricative sound [].

=== Vowels ===
* // and // tend to be more towards centralized as [], [].

== Grammar ==

=== Noun declension ===

Declension in Rusyn is based on grammatical number, gender, and case. Like English, only two types of grammatical number are expressed: singular and plural. And like other Slavic languages, Rusyn has three grammatical genders: feminine, masculine, and neuter. Furthermore, like those languages, Rusyn uses a seven-case system of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental, and vocative cases.

One final point of note is that the masculine gender (and only the masculine gender) is further subdivided into animate and inanimate types. While there are no suffixes &quot;specific&quot; to animacy, declension between the two differs in that for &quot;animates&quot;, the form of the accusative case copies that of the genitive case.

==== Grammatical cases ====

As mentioned in the preceding section, Rusyn cases are similar to those of other Slavic languages. A &quot;very general&quot; summary of usage is given in the table below, though proper usage depends on a particular situation, prepositions, and verbs used, as well as other extenuating circumstances.

Nouns will generally decline differently to indicate each case (e.g. English &quot;they/them/their/theirs&quot;). Based on &quot;how&quot; they decline, nouns can be grouped into one of four &quot;types&quot;.
* Type I: feminine nouns ending in -а/-я in the nominative singular
* Type II:
** masculine nouns ending in a consonant in the nominative singular
** neuter and masculine nouns ending in a consonant or -o in the nominative singular
** neuters ending in -e or -а/-я in the nominative singular
* Type III:
** feminine nouns ending in a &quot;paired consonant&quot; (-cons.+ь), an &quot;unpaired palato-alveolar consonant&quot; (-ш, -ч, щ, -ж, or -дж), or -ов in the nominative singular
** the feminine noun 
* Type IV: neuter nouns ending in -а/-я in the nominative singular

==== Declension type I: feminines ending in -а/-я ====
This type consists of grammatically feminine nouns ending in -а (hard) or -я (soft) in the nominative case. The table below includes four examples of such nouns. The first two represent the &quot;archetypal&quot; feminine paradigm, while the second two represent a &quot;common&quot; or &quot;two-fold gender&quot; paradigm.

It is important to note that this second paradigm has atypical dative, locative, and instrumental singular suffixes which are actually representative of the male/neuter declension paradigm (visible later in this article). According to Pugh, this peculiarity developed as a result of the societal roles of &quot;judge&quot; and &quot;elder&quot; being traditionally patriarchal. This phenomenon is in contrast to grammatically feminine nouns of ambiguous gender where a particular role was not historically male-oriented, such as . In these cases, the typical feminine paradigm is &quot;maintained&quot;.


==== Declension type II: masculines and neuters ====
This declension type encompasses a very large set of vocabulary as it contains nouns of both masculine and neuter genders, hard and soft stems, as well as animate and inanimate beings (for the masculine gender).

===== Masculines ending in consonants =====
This declension contains a large amount of identical forms (syncretism) between cases. Depending on the noun, the number of distinct forms may number from as few as 3 to as many as 6. For singular animate nouns, there is a single form for the accusative and genitive cases, as well as a single form for the dative and locative cases. Similarly, singular inanimate nouns share a form for nominative and locative cases.


===== Neuters or masculines ending in -o, neuters ending in -e or -а/-я =====
The following table demonstrates the declension paradigm for nouns with hard stems which end in -o in the nominative case. Though there are some masculine nouns in this category, these nouns are predominantly neuter.


==== Declension type III: other feminines ====
All nouns in this type are feminine. The paradigm can be identified by the following suffixes in the nominative singular case: a &quot;paired consonant&quot; (-cons.+ь), an &quot;unpaired palato-alveolar consonant&quot; (-ш, -ч, щ, -ж, or -дж), or the suffix -ов. Additionally, the noun is also part of this type.

==== Declension type IV: neuters ending in -а/-я ====
This declension paradigm is used very rarely. It entirely consists of grammatically neuter nouns. This paradigm can be identified by the -a suffix in the nominative and accusative cases, as well as the appearance of the affix -t- between the stem and suffix in other cases. There is &quot;no variation&quot; in this paradigm: all nouns decline in an identical manner.

Type IV is predominantly made up of words referring to the young of animals and humans. However, this should not be taken as a hard rule as some nouns which &quot;historically&quot; declined differently (e.g. and ), now decline according to this paradigm instead.


=== Verbal conjugation ===

Verbs may be divided into two major conjugation types, which may be identified based on the &quot;stem-marker&quot; that appears during conjugation. The infinitive verb forms are often ambiguous and as such, there is no &quot;general&quot; system that allows an infinitive to be identified as either Type I or Type II. Some infinitive suffixes, however, are unique to at least Type I, i.e. -ути, -овати, -нути, etc. In the following sections, the stem-markers are given in Latin as Cyrillic often obscures the markers in the conjugated forms.

==== Conjugation type I ====
Type I may be divided into several sub-types, the most notable of which are the &quot;vowel+j&quot; stem-markers: -uj-, -ij-, -yj-, etc. It is important to remember that in the infinitive and some conjugations that the consonant, -j-, is truncated when followed by another consonant, e.g. &quot;бісїдув-aj-ty → бісїдув-a-ty&quot;.

===== UJ stem markers =====
The -uj- set of verbs can be divided into two groups based the presence of the suffixal markers -ova- or -uj- in the infinitive. The former group representing the overwhelming majority of verbs in this type.
===== IJ stem markers =====

Verbs with stem formant -IJ- are typically derived from adjectives and thus indicate the acquisition of a given property i.e. → . In the infinitive, these verbs are &quot;identical&quot; to those of Conjugation II, Type I. However, these two types of verbs are conjugated differently.

===== YJ stem markers =====

There are very few verbs in this category, but the members that do belong to it, tend to be commonly used.


===== ЫJ stem markers =====

This conjugation scheme works similarly to the previous one.

===== AJ stem markers =====
The -AJ- stem type has variations within different Rusyn dialects and regions. In the Prešov Rusyn community, the -A(J)- type described below is the predominant conjugational pattern. However, in regions further east within Slovakia and in other Rusyn communities, a full-fledged &quot;AJ&quot; type conjugation exists, resembling the patterns found in the rest of East Slavic.

In the Prešov Rusyn community, the -A(J)- conjugation is recommended for the written system, while the -AJ- type is limited and occurs primarily with specific verb stems like &quot;maj-&quot;, &quot;znaj-&quot;, and &quot;staj-&quot;. Both forms may coexist in speech and writing, but the &quot;A(J)&quot; type is more prevalent in the Prešov dialect.

In Lemko Rusyn, the conjugation system generally agrees with that of Prešov Rusyn; a fully-fledged -AJ- conjugation is limited to the third person singular of only three verb stems: &quot;мати&quot;, &quot;знати&quot;, and &quot;познати&quot;. In Subcarpathian Rusyn, however, the -AJ- type is predominant, and the element &quot;aj&quot; can appear in all persons in the non-past paradigm.

====== A(J) stem markers ======

While this stem type follows a conjugation structure similar to other East Slavic languages, it is completely unique in that -j- (normally in the form of suffixes -ю, -єш, -є, -єме, -єте, -ют) is truncated—except for in the 3rd person plural. The absence of the connector vowel -e- in this conjugation type is a distinctive feature, likely influenced by West Slavic languages. The conjugational pattern is similar to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak.

This stem type also includes verbs with the suffix -ывати, a suffix which is often found in imperfective verbs.

===== AVA stem markers =====

This conjugation type is marked by the presence of -AVA- in the infinitive. The conjugation scheme for these verbs vacillates depending on local dialect: sometimes being conjugated as if they were of the previously-discussed -AJ- stem type. A comparison between the two different conjugation schemes is given in the table below. The -AJ- conjugation scheme is preferred by the Prešov standard.

===== A stem markers =====
===== NU stem markers =====
===== Non-syllabic stem markers =====
===== Consonant stems =====
==== Conjugation type II ====

===== Y-type I =====
===== Y-type II =====
===== I-type =====
===== Palato-Alveolar Stems =====
==== Irregular Verbs ====
== Orthography ==

Each of the Rusyn standard varieties has its own Cyrillic alphabet. The table below shows the Rusyn alphabet of the Prešov Standard, with notes on other varieties. The alphabets of the other Carpathian Rusyn varieties, Lemko Rusyn and Subcarpathian Rusyn, differ from the Prešov Standard in lacking ё and ї. For the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet, see .

Romanization (transliteration) is given according to ALA-LC, BGN/PCGN, generic European, ISO/R9 1968 (IDS), and ISO 9.

=== Usage notes ===

=== Number of letters and relationship to the Ukrainian alphabet ===

The Prešov Rusyn alphabet of Slovakia has 36 letters. It includes all the letters of the Ukrainian alphabet plus ё, ы, and ъ.

The Lemko Rusyn alphabet of Poland has 34 letters. It includes all the Ukrainian letters with the exception of ї, plus ы and ъ.

The Pannonian Rusyn alphabet has 32 letters, namely all the Ukrainian letters except і.

=== Alphabetical order ===

The Rusyn alphabets all place ь after я, as the Ukrainian alphabet did until 1990. The vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place ь before э (if present), ю, and я.

The Lemko and Prešov Rusyn alphabets place ъ at the very end, while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after щ. They also place ы before й, while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after ш, щ (if present), and ъ (if present).

In the Prešov Rusyn alphabet, і and ї come before и, and likewise, і comes before и in the Lemko Rusyn alphabet (which does not have ї). In the Ukrainian alphabet, however, и precedes і and ї, and the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet (which does not have і) follows this precedent by placing и before ї.

<text>Kernersville is a town in Forsyth County, North Carolina, and the largest suburb of Winston-Salem. A small portion of the town is also in Guilford County. The population was 26,481 at the 2020 census, up from 23,123 in 2010. Kernersville is located at the center of the Piedmont Triad metropolitan area, between Greensboro to the east, High Point to the south, and Winston-Salem to the west. Some of the farmland surrounding the town has been sold and turned into large middle-to-upper-class housing developments.

==History==
The site was first settled by an Irishman named Caleb Story in 1756. &quot;Circa&quot; 1770, the site was purchased by William Dobson and was called &quot;Dobson&#x27;s Crossroads&quot;. George Washington was served breakfast at Dobson&#x27;s tavern on June 2, 1791. Joseph Kerner bought the property in 1817, continuing to operate the inn; the town became known as &quot;Kerners Crossroads&quot;. Kerner left his property to two sons and a daughter. Not long after the arrival of the railroad, the town was incorporated as &quot;Kernersville&quot; in 1873.

First Baptist Church, Kernersville Depot, Korner&#x27;s Folly, Isaac Harrison McKaughan House, North Cherry Street Historic District, Roberts-Justice House, South Main Street Historic District, and Stuart Motor Company are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

There was brief flirtation with relocating the Minnesota Twins to Kernersville in 1998.

In late 2005, President George W. Bush visited Kernersville&#x27;s Deere-Hitachi plant to give a speech about the American economy. In the summer of 2008, former president Bill Clinton spoke at R. B. Glenn High school. He was campaigning for his wife, Hillary Clinton, in the Democratic primary. Donald Trump Jr. hosted a campaign rally for his father and then-president, Donald Trump, at Salem One Inc. on October 19, 2020.

===Improvements===

Starting in mid 2006, Century Park went under construction to rebuild the lake that had been drained years before due to a structural issue with its dam. The lake was restocked with fish and renovated, and the park is now accessible from Century Blvd with bathrooms and picnic areas. The project was finished in Spring 2008. Beginning in May 2009 the public is allowed to fish from the lake.

Starting in July 2008, North Main Street was closed through downtown Kernersville. Improvements included widening the road and adding parking along the street. North Main Street was reopened on October 2, 2008. Also, Century Blvd went under construction in the winter of 2008. The construction extended Century Place Blvd which allowed traffic from South Main St to Century Blvd. The construction was finished in January 2009.

The residences in the historical district on Salisbury Street were given an ordinance to renovate their homes to match the current renovations done to the roads leading into downtown along with the new bank and park added further downtown. The historical district includes the famous Körner&#x27;s Folly built 1878–1880, and the Harmon House.

In 2012, complete reconstruction of the Salisbury Street overpass bridge over I-40 Business was completed. The new bridge includes stone side walls, sidewalks, and light posts. That same year, new landscaping was put into place around the Main Street exit and entrance ramps from I-40 Business. Also beginning in 2012, construction began to replace the Hastings Hill Road overpass bridge to I-40 Business. The project is focused around replacing the outdated bridge as well as making the northern part of the road leading to the bridge a straight shot over I-40 Business instead of the winding road it currently is. The project may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to I-40 Business. Such access would eliminate the large distance between the closest exits (Winston-Salem Northern Beltway/Exit 227 and Linville Rd/Exit 230) and provide easier access for motorists to surrounding areas of the overpass.

Beginning in Fall 2013, road construction began to incorporate a traffic circle to the intersection of W. Bodenhamer St. and Dobson St. The project is focused around decreasing the traffic congestion of the intersection around heavy traffic times. The project was estimated to complete in mid-2014.

The intersection of Wallburg Road and Union Cross Road near Union Cross Park had been constructed to where motorists can simply head onto eastbound Union Cross Road and Wallburg Road which also featured installment of traffic lights.

<text>King is a city in Stokes and Forsyth counties, North Carolina, United States. The population was 7,096 at the 2020 census. King is part of the Piedmont Triad metropolitan area, located northwest of Winston-Salem.

==History==
The town was originally called &quot;King&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Charles and Francis King lived in a cabin owned by Francis&#x27;s father for a short time in the 1830s. Being Quakers and against slavery, the King family moved to the free North. According to television journalist and historian Chad Tucker&#x27;s book &quot;Images of America, King&quot; (2006), after the King family left their home it was used by locals as a landmark or reference point in giving directions. Several decades later when a post office was established in 1888 it was named for that reference point, King&#x27;s Cabin. The railroad laid tracks a few years later and shortened the name to &quot;King&quot; in its business transactions, and to eliminate confusion the post office followed on September 26, 1894. Charles and Francis King never returned to Stokes County and never knew their former home became the namesake of a town.

According to Tucker, the community grew into an unincorporated town of schools and businesses. With the first automobile arriving by train in October 1911, new highways followed. With new roads, the town&#x27;s proximity to Winston-Salem, and a new four-lane Highway 52 built in the 1960s, King opened its doors to growth, turning farmland into subdivisions. Community groups acted as an unofficial town council, providing services such as a fire department, water and sewer. On September 13, 1983, King became an incorporated city, 95 years after the King&#x27;s Cabin post office opened.

The King Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
King is located in southern Stokes County, with parts of the city limits extending south into Forsyth County.

Pilot Mountain State Park is to the northwest and Hanging Rock State Park is to the north. It&#x27;s a 40-minute drive to the Blue Ridge Mountains via the Blue Ridge Parkway.

<doc id="150844" wikidata="Q2024972" url="?curid=150844" title="Saluda, North Carolina">
<text>Saluda is a city in Polk and Henderson counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 713 at the 2010 census. Saluda is famous for sitting at the top of the Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Saluda Grade, which was the steepest main line standard-gauge railway line in the United States until Norfolk Southern ceased operations on the line in 2001. Saluda is close to the South Carolina state line, between Asheville, North Carolina, and Spartanburg, South Carolina.

==History==
Saluda&#x27;s name came from the Cherokee word &quot;Tsaludiyi&quot;, meaning &quot;green corn place&quot;. The first name of the area by European settlers was &quot;Pace&#x27;s Ridge&quot;, from the Pace family who inhabited the area. Many of the original families were Scots-Irish who left Pennsylvania around the time of the Whiskey Rebellion in the early 1790s.

Count Joseph Marie Gabriel St. Xavier de Choiseul, French consul to Charleston, South Carolina, and cousin to Louis Philippe I of France, bought land in 1831 from the Barings of nearby Flat Rock and built his home, Saluda Cottages.

In 1878, there were only two houses in the limits of present-day Saluda. The completion of the Southern Railroad that same year brought about a large change in Saluda. The Saluda railroad grade is unmatched by any main line east of the Rocky Mountains with a grade that drops to the mile. This included 50 curves, some horseshoe, and saved money by going over rather than through the mountains. This section of railroad was originally built as the Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad. The railroad was built with convict labor, which marked the first such use on a large scale, and was supervised by Colonel Andrew Tanner, who operated the first hotel in Saluda and was elected the first mayor of Saluda in 1881. In 1887, eight passenger trains passed through Saluda daily, with about 3,000 visitors a year. The Saluda Grade was infamous for runaway train accidents. In 1880 alone, fourteen men were killed on the stretch of track. Freight service along the line ended in December 2001 when Norfolk Southern suspended operations along the line between East Flat Rock, North Carolina and Landrum, South Carolina before severing this segment from the rest of its system in April 2003. Talks to convert this segment to passenger train excursion and a Rails-to-trails conversion made no headway in the 2000s and 2010s. In February 2023, Norfolk Southern agreed to sell 31 miles of the Saluda Grade to the Saluda Grade Trail Conservancy, which plans to convert the segment to a rail trail.

==Geography==

Saluda is located in southwestern Polk County. Two small parts of the city extend west and north into Henderson County. The elevation on Main Street is above sea level, while the elevation at the bottom end of the Saluda Grade, in Tryon, is .

U.S. Route 176 is Saluda&#x27;s Main Street; the highway leads east down the mountain to Tryon and northwest to Hendersonville. Interstate 26 passes just north of Saluda, with access from Exit 59. I-26 leads north to Asheville and southeast to Spartanburg, South Carolina.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Saluda has a total area of , all land.

<text>Red Springs is a town in Robeson County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 3,087 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Red Springs is located in northern Robeson County. North Carolina Highways 211 and 71 are the main roads through the town, joining to form North Main Street. NC-211 leads north to Raeford and southeast to Lumberton, while NC-71 leads northeast to Lumber Bridge and southwest to Maxton. North Carolina Highway 72 leaves Red Springs on South Main Street, leading south via Philadelphus to Lumberton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Red Springs has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.61%, are water bodies.

==History==
One of the first settlers in this community was &quot;Sailor Hector&quot; McNeill. It is not known exactly how he got his nickname, but he is found using it in the Bladen County tax lists of 1771. (Red Springs is in Robeson County which was formed from Bladen County in 1787.) &quot;Sailor Hector&quot; McNeill&#x27;s home was at the top of the hill on the edge of the McNeill cemetery in town, and he and his wife Mary are buried there in unmarked graves. In 1775, McNeill secured a royal land grant from King George III for the area encompassing the eventual town. The 1795 Mill Prong house was built nearby in Hoke County and uses a Red Springs address.

In the mid-1800s the community served as a summer resort, with visitors attracted to its mineral springs. By around 1852, Malcolm McNiell, Hector&#x27;s grandson, had established a hotel to serve vacationers. It remained in operation until another hotel was built by S. R. Townsend in 1891. A line of the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railway was laid through the community in June 1884, and at about that time a post office was opened under the name Dora. The following year the name of the post office was changed to Red Springs in homage to the rusty color of the spring water. In 1887 the community was incorporated at the impetus of legislator Hamilton McMillan, a resident of the town. The following year the &quot;Scottish Chief&quot; newspaper was founded. It published there for several years before being moved to Maxton. On February 17, 1906, a large section of the downtown was destroyed by fire.

Between 1896 and 1915, Red Springs had a military school for boys as well as the Southern Conservatory of Music for girls from all over the country. The military school is long gone, but in time the conservatory became Flora McDonald College, known today as Flora McDonald Academy, a private day school. In the 1840s, Floral College for young women was established a few miles south of town by a local lawyer, John Gilchrist Jr. of Mill Prong House. The school operated until the Civil War, reopened afterward, but closed its doors around 1870.

From 1947 to 1950, Red Springs fielded a professional minor league baseball team, the Red Springs Red Robins, that was a farm team of the Philadelphia Athletics. The team won the Tobacco State League championship in 1948. In 1949, led by pitcher Bill Harrington, who would go on to pitch for the big league parent club, the Red Robins won a second title. The 1950 team was led by player/manager Ducky Detweiler, who had played for the Boston Braves.

Professional baseball returned to Red Springs in 1969 when Red Springs Twins played, as the Minnesota Twins organization moved its Class A franchise from Wilson, N.C. During the year the club drew more than 40,000 fans and were managed by Tom Umphlett, a former major leaguer and North Carolina native. Six future major Leaguers were on the Red Springs roster. The team lasted only one season and were featured in Sports Illustrated magazine.

<doc id="150846" wikidata="Q154460" url="?curid=150846" title="Christian II of Denmark">
<text>Christian II (1 July 1481 – 25 January 1559), a monarch under the Kalmar Union, reigned as King of Denmark and Norway from 1513 until 1523. He was briefly King of Sweden from 1520 until 1521. As king of Denmark and Norway, he was concurrently Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in joint rule with his uncle Frederick.

As king, Christian tried to maintain the Kalmar Union between the Scandinavian countries which brought him to war with Sweden, lasting between 1518 and 1523. Though he captured the country in 1520, the subsequent slaughter of leading Swedish nobility, churchmen, and others, known as the Stockholm Bloodbath, caused the Swedes to rise against his rule. He was deposed in a rebellion led by the nobleman and later king of Sweden Gustav Vasa. He attempted to bring in a radical reform of the Danish state in 1521–22, which would have strengthened the rights of commoners at the expense of the nobles and clergy. The nobility rose against him in 1523, and he was exiled to the Netherlands, ceding the Danish throne to his uncle Frederick. After attempting to reclaim the thrones in 1531, he was arrested and held in captivity for the rest of his life, first in Sønderborg Castle and later at Kalundborg Castle. Supporters tried to restore him to power both during his exile and his imprisonment but they were defeated decisively during the Count&#x27;s Feud in 1536. Christian died at Kalundborg in 1559.

In 1515, Christian married Isabella of Austria, granddaughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Isabella died in 1526, after which her family took Christian&#x27;s three children from him. His relationship with his mistress, Dyveke Sigbritsdatter, pre-dated his marriage and continued until her death in 1517. Christian&#x27;s persecution of her supposed murderer contributed to his political isolation and downfall. Dyveke&#x27;s mother, Sigbrit Willoms, became an influential councillor and followed Christian into exile.

==Early life==
Christian was born at Nyborg Castle in 1481 as the son of John, King of Denmark and his wife, Christina of Saxony. Christian descended, through Valdemar I of Sweden, from the House of Eric, and from Catherine, daughter of Inge I of Sweden, as well as from Ingrid Ylva, granddaughter of Sverker I of Sweden. His rival Gustav I of Sweden descended only from Sverker II of Sweden and the House of Sverker.

Christian took part in his father&#x27;s conquest of Sweden in 1497 and in the Dano-Swedish War (1501–1512). He was appointed viceroy of Norway in 1506, and succeeded in maintaining control of the country. During his administration in Norway, he attempted to deprive the Norwegian nobility of its traditional influence exercised through the &quot;Rigsraadet&quot; privy council, leading to controversy with the latter.

In 1513, he succeeded his father as king of Denmark and Norway. Christian&#x27;s succession to the thrones of Norway and Denmark was confirmed at the &quot;Herredag&quot; assembly of notables from the three northern kingdoms, which met at Copenhagen in 1513. The Swedish delegates said, &quot;We have the choice between peace at home and strife here, or peace here and civil war at home, and we prefer the former.&quot; A decision as to the Swedish succession was therefore postponed. Christian&#x27;s coronations as king of Denmark in Copenhagen and of Norway in Oslo took place in the summer of 1514.

==Personal life==

Whilst visiting Bergen in 1507 or 1509, Christian fell in love with a Norwegian girl of Dutch heritage, named Dyveke Sigbritsdatter. She became his mistress and remained with him until Dyveke&#x27;s death. Their relationship was not interrupted by Christian&#x27;s marriage to Isabella of Austria, the granddaughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. They married by proxy on 11 June 1514 in Brussels. Isabella was brought to Copenhagen a year later, and the marriage was ratified on 12 August 1515 at Copenhagen Castle, in a ceremony conducted by Birger Gunnersen, Archbishop of Lund.

Dyveke died in 1517, and Christian was led to believe that the magnate Torben Oxe had poisoned her. Oxe&#x27;s status meant that he should have been tried by the Council of State, but instead he was brought to trial by a common jury at Solbjerg outside Copenhagen. He was found guilty and executed in November 1517. This act precipitated the division between the king and aristocracy that ultimately led to Christian&#x27;s deposition.

Christian&#x27;s chief counsellor was Dyveke&#x27;s mother, Sigbrit Willoms. Christian appointed her controller of the Sound Dues of Øresund, and took her advice on all financial matters. A bourgeoise herself, she acted to extend the influence of the middle classes, and formed an inner council, which competed with the &quot;Rigsraadet&quot; for power. Her influence was resented by the aristocracy, who blamed her for the king&#x27;s favouring the working classes.

==Reconquest of Sweden==
Christian was meanwhile preparing for the inevitable war with Sweden. The anti-Danish faction, headed by the regent Sten Sture the Younger, was opposed by the pro-Danish party led by Archbishop Gustav Trolle. In 1517 Christian dispatched ships and soldiers to the relief of the archbishop&#x27;s fortress of Stäket, but was defeated by Sture and his peasant levies at Vedila. A second attempt the following year was also frustrated by Sture&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Brännkyrka.

A third attempt made in 1520 with a large army of French, German and Scottish mercenaries proved successful. Sture was mortally wounded at the Battle of Bogesund on 19 January, and the remaining rebel forces were suppressed in April at the bloody Battle of Uppsala. Christian’s army and navy then moved to Stockholm and besiege the city. Sweden was now under the leadership of Sture&#x27;s widow Christina Gyllenstierna. Stockholm held out until September 1520, when Christina surrendered. Christian was crowned king of Sweden by Trolle in November, with the agreement of the Swedish Privy Council (&quot;Riksråd&quot;), who had, however, extracted an indemnity for the past and guarantee that Sweden should be ruled according to Swedish laws and custom.

=== Stockholm Bloodbath===
Three days after the coronation, Archbishop Trolle accused the followers of Sture of heresy for their part in the rising against him. Gyllenstierna used the fact that the Swedish Diet had made a &#x27;swearing in common&#x27; &quot;(sammansvärjning)&quot; in 1517, which had bound the nobles to Sture&#x27;s cause, in defence of her husband&#x27;s followers. However, Christian seized on this as an opportunity to cement his control over Sweden by removing his opponents. He convened an ecclesiastical court which condemned all parties to the swearing in common. On 8 and 9 November eighty-two Swedish noblemen were executed at Stockholm castle, including the bishops of Skara and Strängnäs. As well as Sture&#x27;s supporters, who had formed Trolle&#x27;s original list, Christian&#x27;s suspicious nature led him to even execute supporters of the Kalmar Union. The bodies of Sten Sture and his child were dug up and burnt. Gyllenstierna and other noble Swedish ladies were sent as prisoners to Denmark.

The bloodbath, rather than cementing Christian&#x27;s control of the Swedish throne, led in short order to Sweden&#x27;s secession from the Kalmar Union. Didrik Slagheck, whom Christian appointed to the bishopric of Skara and as one of the three regents of Sweden, proved brutal and inept. The remaining Swedish nobility, appalled by the bloodbath, rose against Christian and the Swedish Diet elected Gustav Vasa regent and subsequently King of Sweden. On account of the massacre Christian is remembered in Sweden as &quot;Christian the Tyrant&quot; (&quot;Kristian Tyrann&quot;).

==Legal reforms and downfall==
In June 1521, the Danish king paid a visit to Charles V in the Netherlands, where he remained for some months. He visited most of the large cities, made the personal acquaintance of Quentin Matsys and Albrecht Dürer, and met Erasmus, with whom he discussed the Protestant Reformation. Directly upon his return to Denmark in September 1521 Christian issued two bodies of laws – the Town Law and the Land Law – which governed respectively trade and the behaviour of the clergy. The Town Law strengthened the rights of tradesmen and peasants at the expense of the nobility. Trade was reorganised and was to be conducted solely through market towns, which were to be governed by officials appointed by the king. Trading in peasants was forbidden, and peasants were given the right to negotiate the terms of their tenure with the nobility. The Land Law permitted clergy to marry, and gave some control of the church over to the state. The new laws were radical, progressive, and perceived by the nobility and bishops as an existential threat.

By 1522, Christian was running out of allies. In an attempt to set up a Danish-centered trading company in direct competition with the Hanseatic League, Christian had raised the sound tolls, which affected trade between Sweden and the Hanseatic towns. As a consequence, Lübeck and Danzig joined the newly independent Sweden in war against Denmark. Domestic rebellion against Christian started in Jutland. On 20 January 1523, the &quot;herredag&quot; at Viborg offered the Danish crown to Christian&#x27;s uncle, Duke Frederick of Holstein. Frederick&#x27;s army gained control over most of Denmark during the spring, and in April 1523 Christian left Denmark to seek help abroad. On 1 May, he landed at Veere in Zeeland.

==Exile and imprisonment==

In exile Christian led a humble life in the city of Lier in the Netherlands (now in Belgium), waiting for military help from his brother-in-law Charles V. Christian corresponded with Martin Luther and he became a Lutheran for some time; he even commissioned a translation of the New Testament into Danish. Isabella died in January 1526, and Christian&#x27;s children were taken by her family so as not to be raised as heretics. Popular agitation against Fredrick I in Denmark centered on Søren Norby, who gathered an army of peasants in Scania, but was defeated in 1525.

By 1531, Christian had reverted to Catholicism and reconciled with the Emperor. He took a fleet to Norway, and landed in Oslo to popular acclaim in November 1531. Christian failed to subdue Akershus Castle, and accepted a promise of safe conduct from Fredrick I, in 1532.

Frederick did not keep his promise, and Christian was kept prisoner for the next 27 years, first in Sønderborg Castle until 1549, and afterwards at the castle of Kalundborg. Stories of solitary confinement in small dark chambers are inaccurate; King Christian was treated like a nobleman, particularly in his old age, and he was allowed to host parties, go hunting, and wander freely as long as he did not go beyond the Kalundborg town boundaries.

Fredrick I died in April 1533, and the Danish Council of State was at first unable to choose a successor. The mayor of Lübeck, Jürgen Wullenwever, took advantage of the resulting interregnum to conspire for the restoration of Christian II to the throne of Denmark. He formed an alliance with two prominent nobles, Ambrosius Bogbinder and Jørgen Kock, mayor of Malmö. With Christopher, Count of Oldenburg as his military commander he succeeded in seizing Scania and Zeeland in the name of Christian II in a conflict known as the Count&#x27;s Feud. However, Fredrick&#x27;s eldest son, also named Christian, raised an army in Holstein which, led by Johann Rantzau, took in turn Holstein, Jutland and Zeeland in a series of brilliant military manoeuvers. He formed an alliance with Gustav Vasa, who subdued Scania, and took the throne as Christian III of Denmark. Christian II remained in prison in Kalundborg.
Christian II died in January 1559, a few days after Christian III. The new king, Frederick II, ordered that a royal funeral be held in his memory. He is buried in Odense next to his wife, parents, and son John, who died in the summer of 1532.

==Legacy==
Christian II is one of the most discussed of all Danish kings. He has been regarded as both a hypocritical tyrant and a progressive despot, who wanted to create an absolute monarchy based upon &quot;free citizens&quot;. His psychological weaknesses have caught the interest of historians, especially his frequently mentioned irresolution, which as years passed seemed to dominate his acts. Christian clearly made too many enemies. Furthermore, the Danish middle class was still not strong enough to support royal power. However some of his ambitions were fulfilled by the victory of absolutism in 1660.

==In popular culture==
Christian den Anden (Christian II) is a 1889 play by Jenny Blicher-Clausen which was performed at Copenhagen&#x27;s Dagmar Theatre.

Jean Sibelius composed in 1898 incidental music &quot;King Christian II&quot; to a play about the king, and derived from it a suite.

&quot;The Fall of the King&quot; (), a novel by the Danish author and Nobel Prize Laureate Johannes V. Jensen, published in three parts from 1900 to 1901, is considered a major work of modern Danish literature. It relates the tangled history of Christian II reign and downfall as seen by the (fictional) Mikkel Thøgersen, a loyal follower of king.

&quot;The Corridors of Time&quot; by Danish-American science fiction writer Poul Anderson includes a section where a modern American travels in time to 16th Century Denmark, arriving there shortly after Christian II&#x27;s downfall – where he meets and befriends a diehard follower of the deposed King, and the two of them share various adventures.

==Issue==
Christian II had six children by his wife, Isabella of Austria (1501–1526), only three of whom survived infancy and two reached adulthood. They were:

<doc id="150847" wikidata="Q2026925" url="?curid=150847" title="Davidson, North Carolina">
<text>Davidson is a suburban town located in Iredell and Mecklenburg counties, North Carolina, United States, on the banks of Lake Norman. It is a suburb in the Charlotte metropolitan area. The population was 10,944 at the 2010 census, and in 2019 the estimated population was 13,054. The town was founded in 1837 with the establishment of the Presbyterian Davidson College, named for Brigadier General William Lee Davidson, a local Revolutionary War hero. The land for Davidson College came from Davidson&#x27;s estate, a large portion of which was donated by his son.

==History==
John Davidson, described as &quot;a prosperous Ulster merchant&quot;, was a member of the Davidson family who migrated south from Pennsylvania. Davidson&#x27;s Creek was the westernmost settlement in North Carolina at the time, and according to Robert Ramsey&#x27;s &quot;Carolina Cradle&quot;, it &quot;became the nucleus of the Centre Presbyterian Congregation.&quot; John Davidson&#x27;s son William went on to serve in the American Revolution, eventually becoming a major. Maj. William Davidson was a cousin of Col. William Davidson, the first state senator from Buncombe County, North Carolina, who in turn was a cousin of Gen. William Lee Davidson, for whom Davidson College was named. Gen. Davidson&#x27;s son William Lee Davidson II sold 469 acres (1.90 km2) to the Concord Presbytery to start Davidson College.

The history of the town of Davidson is inextricably linked to Davidson College, which predated the surrounding community and influenced its development. Although Davidson&#x27;s growth in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries typified small railroad towns throughout the Piedmont, the presence of the college created a unique village. The tree-shaded campus filled with classically inspired architecture distinguished Davidson from other communities. The sway of the school also extended beyond the campus to the entire town, influencing commerce, culture, and the character of its architecture. The 1869 Branson&#x27;s business directory recorded four dry goods merchants in the town as well as a cabinetmaker, a miller, and three physicians.

Soon after the arrival of the railroad, Davidson became a shipping point for cash crops, especially cotton, and a service center for farmers. In common with other railroad towns in the region, textile investors constructed cotton mills and mill villages along the rail corridor. The Linden Cotton Factory, erected in 1890 on Depot Street, was the first textile plant in Davidson, and in 1908, the Delburg Cotton Mills was constructed nearby. Two thousand bales of cotton were sold at Davidson annually in the early 1900s.

In 1891, the name of the town was changed from &quot;Davidson College&quot; to &quot;Davidson&quot;, emblematic of the community&#x27;s expanding roles for town and gown alike. Davidson&#x27;s cotton mills spurred the growth of the town, and by 1910 the population of Davidson had reached 500 residents, climbing to 1,500 by the 1920s. Between 1900 and the Great Depression, the business district evolved from a commingling of stores and residences into contiguous rows of one- and two-story, brick commercial buildings. The heart of downtown – opposite the college – contained a full complement of small-town stores and services, including four general merchandise stores, a drug store, a laundry, tailor shop, two barber shops, a hardware store, a post office, a bank, and several restaurants. Physicians, building contractors, and milliners also had Main Street addresses. Behind Main Street along the railroad tracks stood the small 1897 Southern Railway Depot, a livery, flour mill, sawmill, cotton gins, a cottonseed oil company, a blacksmith shop, and a buggy manufacturer. 
The demise of cotton farming and decline of other agricultural pursuits in the region effectively ended the town&#x27;s role as a farming service center. Meanwhile, improved highways and the advent of I-77 encouraged residents to frequent larger department stores in the cities, especially Charlotte, to the south. In more recent years, the emergence of suburban shopping centers around Davidson accelerated the town&#x27;s status to an all-purpose retail market.

Today, the tremendous development around Charlotte has stimulated Davidson&#x27;s growth to its current population of more than 10,000 people. Local downtown businesses, now characterized by restaurants and specialty shops, cater to this new market. Prestigious, nationally known Davidson College has made the town an intellectual and cultural center, drawing into its orbit a sizable professional class.

Beginning with the General Plan in 1993, continuing through the Land Plan of 1995 and the Planning Ordinance of 2001, the town has advocated for and implemented smart growth principles, including pedestrian orientation (resulting in a ban on drive-thru&#x27;s), mixed-use development, affordable housing, open space preservation, and connectivity. An emphasis on design has been a consistent theme in each resulting regulatory document. Additionally, the town of Davidson received National Register Historic District status in 2009 for the historic core of the town, which includes downtown.

==Geography==

<doc id="150848" wikidata="Q2025093" url="?curid=150848" title="Highlands, North Carolina">
<text>Highlands is an incorporated town in Macon County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Located on a plateau in the southern Appalachian Mountains, within the Nantahala National Forest, it lies mostly in southeastern Macon County and slightly in southwestern Jackson County, in the Highlands and Cashiers Townships, respectively. The permanent population was 1,014 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Highlands was founded in 1875 after its two founders, Samuel Truman Kelsey and Clinton Carter Hutchinson, drew lines from Chicago to Savannah and from New Orleans to New York City. They felt that the place where these lines met would eventually become a great trading center and commercial crossroads. Highlands was named for its lofty elevation.

In the 1930s the town became a golfing mecca when Bobby Jones of Atlanta and some of his well-heeled golfing buddies founded the Highlands Country Club. 
Today that club is one of seven successful residential country club communities in the area. The Highlands Country Club is south of Highlands on Dillard Road (North Carolina Highway 106).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.94%, is water.

The official average elevation within town limits is , making it one of the highest incorporated municipalities east of the Mississippi River, and the highest not developed as a resort community - the only other communities laying higher, Sugar Mountain, NC, Wolf Laurel, NC, Snowshoe, WV, and Beech Mountain, NC were all created as resorts. The annual rainfall approaches due to the orographic lifting effect of storms coming from the lower elevations. This rainfall, coupled with abundant sunshine, creates a lush and verdant microclimate that appeals to botanists.

==Climate==
Highlands has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), with cool winters and warm summers. Highlands experiences notably cooler weather than the rest of the American South; this cooling is caused by its altitude. Astride the Eastern Continental Divide, at just over , the town&#x27;s elevation contributes to its relatively cool summers and abundant rainfall, averaging per year. Average snowfall is , largely due to the fact that Highlands is further south and east in the Appalachian Mountains. In 2013 Highlands received 106 inches of rainfall. Areas of similar elevation on the northwest side of the Appalachian region, such as Banner Elk, are not as protected from periodic blasts of Arctic air and receive more substantial snowfall. Highlands is one of the very rare locations at this latitude that has an average high of 78 °F or 26 °C in July, far lower than the rest of the American South.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
Highlands is increasingly becoming a two-season community; a summer-season community and an ever-growing winter-season community. The summer season (generally March through November) draws large numbers of Southerners from the summertime heat and humidity found throughout much of the region to enjoy the cooler mountains and hometown &quot;Main Street experience&quot;.

The town is dotted with antique dealers, restaurants (six of which have received awards from &quot;Wine Spectator&quot;), shops, and inns, as well as several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. For the performing arts there are four theaters: The Highlands Playhouse (founded in 1938), the Instant Theatre Company (founded in 1981), the Highlands Community Players (founded in 1995), and the Martin-Lipscomb Performing Arts Center, which hosts touring groups. For the visual arts there is The Bascom - A Center for the Visual Arts, a new facility named for the artist and playwright, Louise Rand Bascom Barratt.

The historic (NRHP-listed) Lee&#x27;s Inn, with an enormous tree growing through the middle of its dining room, was lost to an electrical fire in the 1980s and was not rebuilt. The historic Old Edwards Inn (also NRHP-listed) continues to operate as an inn and spa catering to affluent demographics.

=== Martin-Lipscomb Performing Arts Center ===
The Martin-Lipscomb Performing Arts Center is a prominent venue in Highlands, featuring independent theater and local musical acts. When the building, which was formerly the Community Bible Church, went up for sale in 1999, the founding director of the Highlands-Cashiers Chamber Music Festival started a fundraising campaign to buy the property so that the festival could have a permanent home. Since then, the Performing Arts Center has brought over 255 performances to the southeastern Macon County area.

===Public utilities and services===
There is one public school in the town, Highlands School, as well as a public library, known as the Hudson Library. The Hudson Library is part of the Fontana Regional Library, which serves Swain, Jackson, and Macon counties.

It is within area code 828, and all telephone numbers served by the town&#x27;s exchange begin with 526 or 482, with seven-digit dialing allowed.

====Television and Internet====
Cable television and Internet services for the town of Highlands are contracted to Northland Communications Corporation and Highlands Cable Group. Both systems carry local TV stations from the Asheville/Hendersonville Greenville/Spartanburg Designated Market Area. Additionally, because there are many visitors and residents from metro Atlanta, Northland carries two major-TV network stations from Atlanta: WSB-TV 2 (ABC), WAGA TV 5 (Fox). Highlands Cable Group now carries all the local networks and the 3 &quot;PBS&quot; networks as well as &quot;Peachtree TV&quot; and &quot;Fox Networks&quot;.

Highlands is the city of license for two radio stations. WHLC FM 104.5 broadcasts from a house just north of the town and is one of very few stations to still have an easy listening format. Its omnidirectional broadcast range extends into all three surrounding states, going furthest into upstate South Carolina. W277CU on 103.3 relays Western North Carolina Public Radio from Asheville. UNCTV is relayed digitally on W35CK-D, replacing analog W27BD.

===Transportation===
There are four major roads in and out of town. Franklin Road and most of Main Street carry U.S. 64 west and N.C. 28 north, going briefly west and then northwest to Franklin, along the Mountain Waters Scenic Byway alongside the Cullasaja River. Cashiers Road and north Fourth Street carry U.S. 64 east, going north and then northeast toward Cashiers, with views of Whiteside Mountain. Walhalla Road and south Fourth Street carry N.C. 28 briefly south, west around the south side of downtown, and then south again toward Pine Mountain, Georgia, and Walhalla, South Carolina, keeping the number 28 in all three states. Dillard Road carries N.C. 106 southwest, crossing the state line five times, and soon ending at U.S. 441 in Dillard. There are also other state secondary roads maintained by NCDOT, with Buck Creek Road (N.C. 1535/1538) acting as a very curvy bypass route around the town.

There is no public transportation within or through the town. The nearest municipal airport is Macon County Airport, between Franklin and Iotla. While it is also the nearest automated airport weather station, conditions there do not accurately reflect Highlands, as there is a major difference in elevation, and therefore temperature and precipitation. A USFS RAWS automated weather station (HGLN7) operates from north-northwest of Highlands, along Flat Mountain Road (N.C. 1544).

==Waterfalls==

===Bridal Veil Falls===
Bridal Veil Falls is a waterfall located in the Nantahala National Forest, northwest of Highlands. With a short curve of roadway located behind the falls, it has the distinction of being the only waterfall in the state that one can drive a vehicle behind. Bridal Veil Falls flows on a tributary of the Cullasaja River through the Nantahala National Forest. The falls flows over an overhanging bluff that allows visitors to walk behind the falls and remain dry when the waterflow is low. During periods of drought, the stream may nearly dry up, though visitors will get wet if the waterflow is moderate or high. Bridal Veil Falls is located on the side of U.S. Highway 64 northwest of town. Highway 64 originally used the curve of roadway behind the falls exclusively so that all traffic went behind them; however, this caused problems with icing of the roadway during freezing weather, and it was re-routed around the front of the falls since. There is a parking area on the side of the road, where visitors can park and view the falls as well. In 2003, a massive boulder slid off the left side of the falls, blocking that side of the drive-under completely. However, in July 2007, that boulder was removed by a local developer.

===Cullasaja Falls===
Cullasaja Falls is located on the Cullasaja River in the Nantahala National Forest and is part of the Mountain Waters Scenic Byway. &quot;Cullasaja&quot; comes from a Cherokee word meaning &quot;honey locust place&quot;. The falls is the last major waterfall on the Cullasaja River. The falls is a long cascade over the course of . The height of the falls is given as in Kevin Adams&#x27; book, &quot;North Carolina Waterfalls&quot; and by NCWaterfalls.com. However, Google Earth gives a height (based on the elevation of the water at the top of the falls and the elevation of the plunge pool at the bottom of the falls) of . The falls are located beside a series of blind curves on Highway 64 with sheer rock cliffs above and below the road. There is only one small pull-off near the falls, but walking on the road puts visitors in danger of being hit by a passing vehicle.

===Dry Falls===
Dry Falls, also known as Upper Cullasaja Falls, is a waterfall in the Nantahala National Forest, northwest of Highlands on the Cullasaja River. It is part of a series of waterfalls on an stretch of the river that eventually ends with Cullasaja Falls. Dry Falls flows over an overhanging bluff that allows visitors to walk up under the falls and remain relatively dry when the water flow is low, hence its name. The waterfall has also gone by other names, including High Falls, Pitcher Falls, and Cullasaja Falls. Dry Falls is located on the side of U.S. Highway 64, north of Highlands. There is a parking area on the side of the road, where visitors can park before walking the short path with stairs to the falls. During 2008-2009 the Forest Service made improvements to the parking area, which included renovation and expansion and the addition of bathroom facilities. A new walkway and overlook were also constructed adjacent to the parking area.

===Quarry Falls===
Quarry Falls (aka Bust Your Butt Falls) is a small waterfall located beside US Highway 64 west of Highlands. It is best known for the large, deep pool at the bottom and is a popular place for swimming during warm weather. Also located here is a rock to climb and jump from into the deep pool. The waterfall is located about 10 miles from Franklin and 6.5 miles from Highlands.

In May 2022, Zebulon was ranked North Carolina&#x27;s second fastest growing town, only behind neighboring Wendell.

==History==

In 1906, the Raleigh and Pamlico Sound Railroad Company decided to bring the railroad through the Whitley and Horton family farms in eastern Wake County. Edgar B. Barbee and Falconer B. Arendell organized the Zebulon Company for development that same year. The company received its charter on February 15, 1906. Shortly thereafter, they began to divide up their into lots, blocks, streets and avenues. On February 16, 1907, the town was officially recognized as Zebulon, North Carolina. The town was named after Zebulon Baird Vance, the Governor of North Carolina during the American Civil War. The first election was held in May 1907, and the first elected mayor was Thomas J. Horton.

In 1997 Zebulon annexed the neighboring community of Wakefield, increasing the total area inside the corporate limits to and the population to 3,908. The population had grown to 6,903 by 2020.

There are three properties in Zebulon listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Wakelon School, Bennett Bunn Plantation, and the George and Neva Barbee House.

==Law and government==
Zebulon follows the council-manager government form of government, in which the elected governing body is responsible for legislative functions such as establishing policy, passing local ordinances, adopting annual budget, and developing an overall town vision. The council then appoints a professional town manager who is responsible for overseeing administrative operations, implementing policies, and advising the council.

Zebulon is governed by a five-member Board of Commissioners and a mayor. Three members are elected in one year and the two remaining members and the mayor are elected two years later. The mayor, as the principal elected official of the town, provides leadership to the governing body and the community and presides over Board meetings.

As the legislative body of Zebulon, the Board&#x27;s primary responsibilities include establishing town policies and adopting an annual budget. Local municipality budgets for each fiscal year must be adopted by June 30. The budget for the fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

<text>Grifton is a town in Lenoir and Pitt counties, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,448 at the 2020 census. The Pitt County portion of the town is a part of the Greenville Metropolitan Statistical Area located in North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region. 

==History==
Settlement in the area dates back to 1756, when the locale was known as Peter&#x27;s Ferry. By 1764, it was known as Blount&#x27;s Ford. In the 1800s according to local knowledge, the Contentnea Creek bridge was set ablaze during the Civil War, prompting Mr. Coward to construct a replacement bridge in 1867. However, this bridge had a short lifespan, leading Franklin Bell, a nearby blacksmith and chair-maker, to operate a ferry across the creek. As a result, the location earned the name Bell&#x27;s Ferry, which persisted even after the county erected a fresh bridge over the creek in 1869. It was incorporated under that name in 1883. The name was formally changed to Grifton six years later to honor local merchant C. M. A. Griffin. Soon thereafter, it became styled as Grifton.

==Geography==
Grifton is located on the southern edge of Pitt County mostly on the northeastern side of Contentnea Creek, which forms the county line. A small portion of the town is on the southwestern side of the creek in Lenoir County. North Carolina Highway 11 passes just west of the town, leading north to Greenville, the Pitt county seat, and southwest to Kinston, the Lenoir county seat.

<doc id="150853" wikidata="Q4764075" url="?curid=150853" title="Angus Calder">
<text>Angus Lindsay Ritchie Calder (5 February 1942 – 5 June 2008) was a Scottish writer, historian, and poet. Initially studying English literature, he became interested in political history and wrote a landmark study on Britain during the Second World War in 1969 entitled &quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot;. He subsequently wrote several other historical works but turned to literature and poetry and worked primarily as a writer, though often holding a number of university teaching positions. A socialist, he was a prominent Scottish public intellectual during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==
Angus Calder was born in London on 5 February 1942 into a prominent left-wing family from Scotland. His father was Ritchie Calder (1906–1982), a noted socialist and pacifist who became famous for his work as a journalist and science writer. His siblings are Nigel Calder, mathematician Allan Calder, educationist Isla Calder (1946–2000) and teacher Fiona Rudd (née Calder). His nephew is travel writer and journalist Simon Calder.

Angus Calder read English literature at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He gained a doctorate from the University of Sussex in 1968 on politics in the United Kingdom during World War II, entitled &quot;The Common Wealth Party, 1942–45&quot; which studied the political party of the same name. At the time, academic research into the conflict was rare as government papers were not available under the fifty-year rule. As a result, Calder worked closely with Paul Addison, another historian with similar research interests. Together Addison and Calder made extensive use of the newly discovered archives of Mass-Observation to examine British public opinion. Calder was instrumental in creating the Mass-Observation Archive at Sussex in 1970, in collaboration with Asa Briggs.

==&quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot;==
Calder had been commissioned to write a general history of the British Home Front by the publisher Jonathan Cape while still working on his PhD thesis. This led to &quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot;, first published in 1969. The work was academic in tone and ranged widely across the political and social history of the period. It was critical of enduring propaganda myths without being polemic, and was extremely successful. It has subsequently been described as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;. As Addison summarised:

&quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot; was well received and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, a literary award. Though its thesis was not widely adopted in academia, it proved extremely influential as popular history. Richard Eyre said that he &quot;could name about twenty works, films, television and theatre which have emerged essentially from Angus Calder&#x27;s book&quot;. Among those who were said to have been influenced by the work were the playwright David Hare and future prime minister Gordon Brown. It remains in print.

Calder increasingly began to doubt his own thesis over the following decades. Many of his original conclusions were revised in his &quot;The Myth of the Blitz&quot; (1991). According to Addison, this reassessment was encouraged by Calder&#x27;s revulsion with the jingoistic nationalism which accompanied the Falklands War of 1982 and Thatcherism. Both were partly inspired by the collective memory of the &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot; which Calder had himself popularised.

==Literature and poetry==
Following his success with &quot;The People&#x27;s War&quot;, Calder increasingly returned to his interests in literature and poetry. In 1971, he moved to Edinburgh where he published &quot;Russia Discovered&quot;, a survey of 19th-century Russian fiction in 1976, and, three years later, became staff tutor in arts with the Open University. He subsequently taught all over the world, lecturing in literature at several African universities and serving from 1981 to 1987 as co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Commonwealth Literature&quot;.

Calder became a ubiquitous figure on the Scottish literary scene writing essays and articles, books on Byron and T. S. Eliot, and working as editor of collections of poetry and prose. He also wrote introductions to new publications of such diverse works as &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy and James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;.
In 1981 he published &quot;Revolutionary Empire&quot; (1981), a study of three centuries of imperial development by English speakers to the end of the 18th century. &quot;Revolving Culture: Notes from the Scottish Republic&quot; is a collection of essays on Scottish topics which expressed itself through the writings of such figures as Robert Burns and Scott and in gestures of &quot;realpolitik&quot; such as the repression of &quot;Jacobins&quot; during the French Revolution. In 1984 Calder helped to set up the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh and served as its first convener. He also worked as an editor of Hugh MacDiarmid&#x27;s prose. Calder won the Eric Gregory Award for his poetry.

==Politics==
A nationalist and socialist, he moved from the Scottish National Party (SNP) to the Scottish Socialist Party, and though he cherished the Scottish republican spirit, he sought to challenge some of the popular myths surrounding the country&#x27;s sense of national identity. In &quot;Revolving Culture: Notes from a Scottish republic&quot; (1992) he described the development, during the early stages of the Union with England, of an &quot;intellectual republic&quot; forged by a combination of insularity and lack of English interest in Scottish affairs. In 1997 he edited &quot;Time to Kill — the Soldier&#x27;s Experience of War in the West 1939–1945&quot; with Paul Addison; &quot;Scotlands of the Mind&quot; (2002); &quot;Disasters and Heroes: On War, Memory and Representation&quot; (2004); and &quot;Gods, Mongrels and Demons: 101 Brief but Essential Lives&quot; (2004), a collection of potted biographies of &quot;creatures who have extended my sense of the potentialities, both comic and tragic, of human nature&quot;. He had always published verse and won a Gregory Award for his poetry in 1967. Questions of Scottish national identity assumed growing importance in the 1980s, and Calder became active in the debate. A distinctive &quot;Scottish social ethos&quot; informed the activities of prominent Scots in the years of Empire, when they had invested heavily in the concept of Britishness, although he reportedly felt that the Scots had meddled much more overweeningly with the English sense of identity than the English ever did with the Scots. He was delighted to discover that the game of cricket had been introduced to Sri Lanka by a Scot.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Jennifer Daiches, daughter of Scottish literary critic David Daiches, with whom Calder collaborated on a book about Sir Walter Scott in 1969. The Calders had two daughters, Rachel and Gowan, and a son, Gideon. His first marriage ended in 1982; he married Kate Kyle in 1986, with whom he had a son, Douglas, born in 1989. He took early retirement from the Open University in 1995.

==Death==
Calder died from lung cancer on 5 June 2008, aged 66. In the closing weeks of his life, the poet Richard Berengarten, together with his son Gideon Calder edited a collection of writing and sketches for and about him, which appeared just after his death.

==Bridges==

Until late 2018, road access to Surf City was mainly via the Topsail Island Swing Bridge, a failing steel truss swing-span bridge, built in 1954, which crossed the Intracoastal Waterway. Planning for a replacement bridge began in 2010, with construction beginning in September 2016. It opened in December 2018, a year ahead of schedule. Costing US$54 million, the fixed-span high rise bridge, with a vertical clearance of , allows the passage of vessels at any time and eases traffic flow to and from the community. The wide bridge provides two lanes for traffic, shoulder bicycle lanes, and a multi-use path. The unusually wide design is intended to permit three lanes for hurricane evacuations. The contractor was scheduled to remove the old bridge by March 31, 2019. In a letter to residents in January, the Town&#x27;s mayor, Doug Medlin said, &quot;NCDOT and Balfour Beatty understood the sentimental relationship that the Town of Surf City had for our Swing Bridge. We were given the turn bridge control panel and key as well as the cornerstone from when the bridge was first constructed. These items will be displayed in the new Surf City Town Hall as a historical memorial.&quot;

<text>Maxton is a town in Robeson and Scotland counties, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,110 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Maxton area was first settled in the 18th century. The community was incorporated in 1874 under the name of Shoe Heel. The name changed to Tilden, in honor of 1876 U.S. President candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The name reverted to Shoe Heel in 1881 before finally settling on Maxton in 1887.

As agriculture in the industry consolidated into larger corporate ventures in the 1960s, Maxton&#x27;s status as a local market town declined. Far away from major transportation links such as Interstate 95, its economy continued to wane in following decades without the arrival of new industry. White people began leaving in search of better prospects, leading Maxton to become a majority-black town by 2000. With a newly elected government comprising many black officials, the town began expanding its incorporated limits to include many old black neighborhoods. In 2004 a highway bypass around the town was completed, depriving local businesses of the spending of travelers they had hitherto enjoyed.

The Maxton Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

=== Educational institutions ===
Maxton is the location of several former, but historically important schools.

Charles N. Hunter a famous African-American educator who would go on to found the North Carolina Industrial Association opened his first school in Maxton.

Carolina College was a Methodist college for women which operated in Maxton, North Carolina, from 1912 to 1926.

Carolina Military Academy was a military school for boys (7th - 12th grade + post graduate) which operated in Maxton, North Carolina, from 1963 to 1972. The school opened it doors to female day students during the 1970 - 1971 school year.

===Confrontation between the Lumbee and the Ku Klux Klan===

In January 1958, the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses on the lawns of two Lumbee families. A few nights later, on January 18, 1958, the Lumbee surrounded and disrupted a public Klan rally near Maxton, dispersing the Klansmen, some of whom left under police protection while others escaped into the woods. The confrontation made national headlines, and the Klan never again held a public rally in Robeson County, even as they gained influence over the next decade in North Carolina. The Lumbee refer to the event as the Battle of Hayes Pond, and celebrate it as a holiday.

<text>The New Bedford River, also known as the Hundred Foot Drain because of the distance between the tops of the two embankments on either side of the river, is a navigable man-made cut-off or by-pass channel of the River Great Ouse in the Fens of Cambridgeshire, England. It provides an almost straight channel between Earith and Denver Sluices. The river is tidal, with reverse tidal flow being clearly visible at Welney, some from the sea.

==History==
In the 1620s, there was discontent in the region through which the New Bedford River now flows, as the land was regularly inundated by flood water. Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, who owned large tracts of land in the vicinity, agreed to carry out drainage works in 1630, in return for of the land which would be reclaimed. He was joined in the project by thirteen other adventurers, who formed a corporation and obtained a charter to carry out the work in 1634. The Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was engaged to oversee the work, which included nine major drainage channels, including the Bedford River, which ran from Earith to Salter&#x27;s Lode. The tract of land through which it ran became known as the Bedford Level, and the scheme was declared to be complete in 1637. However, in 1638, that decision was reversed, and King Charles I became the undertaker to ensure the work was completed. The adventurers were given for the work that had already been carried out, and further work was again to be overseen by Vermuyden, but little work was done, as the English Civil War intervened. The existing works were neglected, and some were deliberately damaged during the hostilities.

In 1649, interest in the drainage of the Bedford Level resumed, and a second Drainage Act was obtained. It became known as the &#x27;Pretended Act&#x27;, and authorised William Russell, the 5th Earl of Bedford, to carry out further work, the chief of which was a second channel parallel to the Bedford River. Vermuyden was again the engineer, and the new channel was completed in 1652. The Bedford River became known as the Old Bedford River, and the new channel became the New Bedford River. Sluices were built at Earith and Denver, and the river carried most of the flow of the River Great Ouse, resulting in its old course via Ely becoming just a drainage channel. The Corporation of the Bedford Level was set up, and took control of the river and the drainage channels, under the terms of the General Drainage Act, passed in 1663. This move was not popular with those engaged in navigation on the Great Ouse, as the sluices were operated for the benefit of the drainage scheme, and boats often had to wait for days or weeks while the sluices remained closed. The destruction of the Denver Sluice in 1713, caused by exceptional flood levels, was celebrated by the boatmen, but the resultant flooding led to the Corporation building a new sluice between 1748 and 1750. The concerns of the boatmen were placated by the provision of a navigation lock in the structure.

Some of the workers who built the New Bedford River may have been Scottish prisoners-of-war captured at the Battle of Dunbar, since a number of such prisoners were used on drainage schemes in the Fens, because labourers were scarce. After 1652, they were supplemented by Dutch prisoners, as a result of sea battles between Admiral Blake and Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp during the First Anglo-Dutch War, and probably by a colony of French workers stationed near Thorney Abbey.

Towards the northern end of the washes, the New Bedford River is joined by the River Delph at Welmore Lake Sluice. The origins of this channel, which is sometimes called the thirty-foot drain, are obscure, although it was built to assist the removal of water from the washlands, according to C. N. Cole writing in 1784. Prior to 1825, there was a dam where the sluice is located, and water was let out of the washland by cutting a slot in it, which the flood water enlarged as it passed through. The cost of rebuilding the dam at the end of the process was considerable, and this unsatisfactory arrangement was replaced by a sluice. At the same time, the New Bedford River was made wider and deeper, while some of the flood banks were also raised. At its southern end, the River Delph is connected to the Old Bedford River at a double bend near Welches Dam. The northern half of the Old Bedford River is no longer connected to its southern half. It is not known exactly when this configuration was built, although it may have been between 1789 and 1821, since Cole&#x27;s map of 1789 shows the Old Bedford River proceeding in a straight line, and Baker&#x27;s map of 1821 shows two rivers, each with a double bend. Blair argues for a date soon after the New Bedford River was built, however, since Welches Dam is named after Edmund Welche, who worked with Vermuyden, and the dam in question was originally built across the Old Bedford River.
==Course==
The New Bedford River follows a fairly straight course, heading approximately north-east for from Earith to Denver Sluice. While there are no real restrictions on the length or width of boats, draught is limited to and headroom to , although the river is tidal, and so these values can fluctuate depending on the state of the tide. The Environment Agency advise that navigating up the river is best attempted when there is a tide of at least at King&#x27;s Lynn, and boats should enter the river at Denver soon after the tide turns. Water levels tend to rise steeply for about two hours after the tide turns, and then drop gradually over the next ten hours. Care is needed to ensure that boats remain in the centre of the channel, particularly during the winter months when the river may be overflowing into the Ouse Washes. Despite being some from the sea, water levels at Earith still rise and fall by about on a spring tide, and by a few inches for a neap tide.
The area between the two Bedford Rivers, long and wide at their greatest separation near Welney, is below the rivers and below sea level, and is frequently flooded during winter. There is a sluice at Earith which is used to control the waters of the River Great Ouse. It was built with nine openings in 1637, but was subsequently rebuilt with seven openings in 1824, and again with three openings in 1954. When flows in the upper river are normal, the sluice gates are closed, and most of the flow is routed along the tidal New Bedford River. As flows increase, the sluices are opened, and water flows along the Old Bedford River, which progressively floods the of washlands which comprise the Ouse Washes. At Welney, these washes provide an ideal habitat for wildfowl and other birds, and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust has established a nature reserve here, the WWT Welney. The reserve occupies , and is accessible from the A1101 bridge by following a minor road to the carpark, and then crossing the New Bedford River by a footbridge. It is important for its wild flowers, dragonflies and butterflies, as well as the birds, which are most numerous when the washland is flooded.

There are public footpaths on both sides of the river for most of its length, the only exception being a short section of the western bank near Earith. A long-distance footpath called the Hereward Way crosses the river by the A1101 bridge at Welney, and then follows the eastern bank southwards almost to the March to Ely railway line. It turns to the east a little before the bridge, following the north bank of the Engine Basin, a drainage channel which is pumped into the river by the Hundred Foot Pumping Station.
==Land drainage==
The area between the New Bedford River and the Great Ouse now lies at an average of below mean sea level, and three times that distance below the highest levels that tides normally reach. The low lying land is managed by the Littleport and Downham Internal Drainage Board, the successors to the Littleport and Downham Drainage Commissioners which were established by Act of Parliament in 1756. This act enabled the land to be enclosed, and the district has relied on pumped drainage ever since. The board are now responsible for of fen land. Water from the district is pumped into the New Bedford River by the Hundred Foot and Oxlode pumping stations, and into the Great Ouse by the Ten Mile, Moors, and Wood Fen pumping stations.

The 1756 act was consolidated by further Acts of Parliament obtained in 1800 and 1810. By the early 1800s, drainage was achieved by 80 wind pumps, but in 1818, the first steam-powered pumping station was built at Ten Mile Bank, by the Great Ouse. This was followed in 1830 by the Hundred Foot pumping station on the banks of the New Bedford River. It replaced Westmoor Mills, where two wind pumps raised the water in two stages. The new plant consisted of a beam engine manufactured by the Butterley Company and rated at . Steam was produced by two boilers, with a third added in November 1843. Butterley replaced the first two boilers in 1869, and James Watt replaced the third in 1875. They were all replaced by high pressure Lancashire boilers in 1911. Originally, the engine drove a scoop wheel which was in diameter, but in 1881 this was replaced by the largest scoop wheel used in the Fens, which was in diameter. There were continual problems with the land levels dropping due to shrinkage of the peat, resulting in the intake needing to be lowered. The beam engine was replaced by a vertical steam engine manufactured by Gwynnes in 1914, linked to a Gwynnes pump. In 1926, a Mirlees diesel engine was installed to supplement the steam engine, until that was replaced by a Ruston and Hornsby diesel engine in 1951. In 1965, the Mirlees engine was sold, and a new electric station was built in 1985, although the Ruston engine and the 1911 boilers were retained.

The electric station contains three submersible pumps, one of which failed in December 2012, after a period of heavy rain. With water levels in Pymoor Drain rising to record levels, the Ruston diesel engine was mended and pressed into service on 24 December. At the same time, the Oxlode pumping station suffered from the failure of a gate valve in a separate incident, resulting in one of the two pumps not being available for use. Plans for a pumping station at Oxlode were originally announced in 1940, but it is unclear when it was opened, as a new pumping station was commissioned in July 1944, but newspapers did not print its name, due to wartime censorship. A second pumping station with two electric pumps was opened in May 1962, at a cost of £65,000. Each pump could discharge 270 tons of water per minute into the New Bedford River, but the existing two diesel pumps were retained. Prior to the opening ceremony, the Drainage Commissioners held a celebration lunch at the Club Hotel, Ely, where their predecessors had met for the first time in 1756.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the New Bedford River and the lower Great Ouse was as follows in 2019.

The water quality is less than good mainly due to physical modification of the channel for flood protection. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

The Allen County portion of Bluffton is part of the Lima Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Hancock County portion is part of the Findlay Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The village was founded in 1831 by Swiss Mennonites, German Reformists and Irish Catholics. It was originally named &#x27;Crogan&#x27;s Corners&#x27; after the postmaster. When the citizens chose to incorporate as a village, the Irish suggested the name &#x27;Shannon&#x27; because of the green fields around the area. As there was already a village named Shannon in the state, the town was renamed Bluffton for the hilly terrain of the town site.

Bank robber John Dillinger robbed the Bluffton Bank (now known as Citizens National Bank of Bluffton) of $6,000 on August 14, 1933.

In 2011, Bluffton celebrated its 150th birthday with a series of town-wide events.

<text>Delphos is a city in Allen and Van Wert counties in the U.S. state of Ohio approximately 14 mi (23 km) northwest of Lima and 13 mi (21 km) east of Van Wert. The population was 7,117 at the 2020 census.

The Allen County portion of Delphos is part of the Lima Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Van Wert County portion is part of the Van Wert Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Delphos had its start in the early 1850s with the merger of neighboring rival towns. These were the towns of Howard (in the northwest), Section 10 (in the east), Bredeick Street (south of Howard) and East Bredeick (named after Father John Otto Bredeick, a Bavarian priest, who had purchased the tract of land in 1840). In 1851, the four towns agreed to form a single town called Delphos. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the Greek god Delphus.

The Miami and Erie Canal, a 274 mile (441 km) canal connecting Cincinnati to Toledo, ran through Delphos. The first settlers to Delphos were mainly construction workers attracted by the work being done on the Canal. After 20 years of construction, the Canal was completed—an inaugural canal boat carrying the governor of Ohio passed through Delphos on July 4, 1845.

The Canal was crucial to the economic development of the city in the 19th century, since it positioned Delphos as a center of regional trade. Indeed, Delphos became one of the major ports along the Canal, with transshipment facilities linking the Canal to the growing rail network in the region. Industrialists were also attracted by the Canal. By 1879, more than 100 factories located in Delphos produced goods for national and international trade. However, rail transport eventually came to dominate long-haul commercial transport and Delphos&#x27; importance as a hub of commerce waned.

Three Delphos buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Marks-Family House and St. John&#x27;s Catholic Church on the Allen County side of the city, and the Bredeick-Lang House on the Van Wert County side (see Gallery below).

<doc id="150867" wikidata="Q925581" url="?curid=150867" title="Loudonville, Ohio">
<text>Loudonville is a village in Ashland and Holmes counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 2,786 at the 2020 census. Loudonville is nicknamed the &quot;Canoe Capital of Ohio&quot; for the many canoe liveries along the Mohican River. It is also home to Mohican State Park and Mohican-Memorial State Forest.

==History==

Loudonville was first inhabited by Delaware Nation peoples. The first white settlement was in 1810 when Stephen Butler built a single log cabin on the Black Fork of the Mohican River. In 1814, Thomas Jelloway and James Loudon Priest (the town&#x27;s namesake) laid out the village of Loudonville, starting with twelve plots. A post office called Loudonville has been in operation since 1820.

From 1913 to 1996, Loudonville was home to The Flxible Company, a manufacturer of motorcycle sidecars, commercial cars (hearses, ambulances, and flower cars), intercity coaches, and city-transit coaches. During World War II, Flxible interrupted its normal production and instead built a variety of war goods. There was a devastating fire at the plant on January 2, 1947. The nearly all-glass 1927 expansion to Plant 1 made for frigid working conditions in the winter and required paint to be heated before it could be applied. An unknown employee accidentally knocked over a can of paint thinner, which spilled onto one of the heat plates for warming the paint. The fire was so massive that nearby houses were damaged. A part of the former Flxible plant was in use as a parts depot and service point for Motor Coach Industries until December 5, 2014, when all production was shut down.

The town of Loudonville includes three sites on the National Register of Historic Places. One is the Ohio Theatre, which was erected in 1909 under the name of &quot;City Hall and Opera House.&quot; The theatre had a troubled history and was almost closed in the 1990s, but three freshmen from Loudonville High School raised $4,000 in a local talent show to keep it afloat. In 1914, the theater showed its first movie, the silent film Neptune&#x27;s Daughter. The home of Phillip J. Black located at 303 N. Water Street is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1856, it is now home to the Blackfork Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast. The third, TJ and Sarah Bull House, is a Greek revival home built in 1852.

In July 1982, Krista Lea Harrison was found dead on Township Road 464 just outside of the town, just 6 days after she had been abducted from Marshallville, a town 35 miles away. Robert Anthony Buell was convicted of the crime and executed in 2002.

In December 2015, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay visited Landoll&#x27;s Mohican Castle just outside of town to film an episode of &quot;Hotel Hell.&quot; The episode aired on July 26, 2016, and was the last episode of the series. The show &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; filmed an episode at the castle in the summer of 2019, airing on September 11, 2019.

== Local culture ==
Since 1876, the town has held the Loudonville Free Street Fair. Early fairs were held on the land went of North Mt. Vernon Avenue, in an open privately-owned field near the high school building and athletic field. It was there held each year until 1888, when the town&#x27;s streets and Central Park became the &quot;fairground&quot; after field&#x27;s private owner, a farmer, unexpectedly planted and forced the Association to find another location.

Since 2000, the town has held a car show every July. This event features over 500 cars on display and has been rated among the top downtown events in the region. The show includes music, food, raffles, and downtown shopping, making it a family-friendly occasion.

Since 2009, the Mohican 5K run has occurred annually, benefiting the Loudonville-Mohican bike path with proceeds helping to complete and maintain the area’s bike path.

==Geography==
Loudonville is located along the Black Fork of the Mohican River, near Mohican State Park. The river system is navigable by canoe. There are a variety of camping, canoeing, fishing, hiking and picnicking activities available along the Mohican River. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Education==

Loudonville&#x27;s three schools comprise the Loudonville-Perrysville Exempted Village School District. First through third graders attend the R.F. McMullen School. Fourth through sixth graders attend the nearby C.E. Budd School, a building that once served as the village&#x27;s high school. Students then transition to the Loudonville High School campus, which includes seventh through tenth grades. The high school colors are red and gray and the athletic teams are known as the &quot;Redbirds&quot;.

In November 1925, builders completed construction on the new Loudonville High School on east Main Street with a final cost of $170,000. The building was located immediately north of the Union School (built in 1885) which faced west on Wood Street and had until then housed all grades. This later became the middle school when the campus-style high school was constructed in 1964.

In 1953 a new elementary school was constructed on east Bustle Street at a cost of $613,274, with the Union School being razed. The elementary school was built on the site of the athletic fields, so new athletic fields were constructed on north Mount Vernon Avenue at an initial cost of $82,303. In 1959 the elementary school was named R.F. McMullen after the former Superintendent.

Following consolidation of Loudonville and Perrysville school districts in 1961, a new high school was built adjacent to the athletic complex on Mount Vernon Avenue. The new building cost $1,455,00 and was completed in 1964. The old high school was renamed in honor of C.E. Budd, who had served as Superintendent during its construction, and was converted to a middle school.

<text>Christian III (12 August 1503 – 1 January 1559) reigned as King of Denmark from 1534 and King of Norway from 1537 until his death in 1559. During his reign, Christian formed close ties between the church and the crown. He established Lutheranism as the state religion within his realms as part of the Protestant Reformation, and was the first King of Denmark-Norway.

== Childhood ==

Christian was the eldest son of the future king, Frederick I of Denmark, and Anna of Brandenburg. He was born at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig which Frederick I had made as a primary residence. In 1514, when he was just ten years old, Christian&#x27;s mother died. Four years later, his father remarried to Sophie of Pomerania (1498–1568). In 1523, Frederick I was elected King of Denmark in the place of his nephew, Christian II. The young Prince Christian&#x27;s first public service after his father became king was gaining the submission of Copenhagen, which stood firm for the fugitive, Christian II. As stadtholder of the Duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in 1526, and as viceroy of Norway in 1529, Christian III displayed considerable administrative ability.

== Religious views ==
Christian&#x27;s earliest teacher, Wolfgang von Utenhof (ca. 1495–1542) and his Lutheran tutor, the military general Johann Rantzau (1492–1565), were both zealous reformers who had an influence on the young Prince. At their urging, while traveling in Germany in 1521, he made himself present at the Diet of Worms to hear Martin Luther speak. Luther&#x27;s arguments intrigued him. The Prince made no secret of his Lutheran views. His outspokenness brought him into conflict, not only with the Roman Catholic dominated State Council (&quot;Rigsraad&quot;), but also with his cautious and temporizing father. At his own court at Schleswig, he did his best to introduce the Protestant Reformation, despite the opposition of the bishops. He made the Lutheran Church the State Church of Schleswig-Holstein, with the Church Ordinance of 1528.

==Reign as king==
=== Early reign as King of Denmark ===
After his father&#x27;s death, in 1533, Christian was proclaimed king of Denmark at an assembly in Rye, a town in eastern Jutland, in 1534. The Rigsraad, dominated by Roman Catholic bishops and nobles, refused to accept Duke Christian as king and turned to Count Christopher of Oldenburg in order to restore Christian II to the Danish throne. Christian II had supported both the Roman Catholics and Protestant Reformers at various times. In opposition to Christian III, Count Christopher was proclaimed regent at the Ringsted Assembly (&quot;landsting&quot;), and at the Scania Assembly (&quot;landsting&quot;) on St Liber&#x27;s Hill (&quot;Sankt Libers hög&quot;) near Lund Cathedral. This resulted in a two-year civil war, known as the Count&#x27;s Feud (&quot;Grevens Fejde&quot;) from 1534 to 1536, between Protestant and Catholic forces.

===Civil War (Count&#x27;s Feud) ===

Count Christopher had the support of most of Zealand, Scania, the Hanseatic League, and the small farmers of northern Jutland and Funen. Christian III found his support among the nobles of Jutland. In 1534, peasants under Skipper Clement (c. 1484–1536) began an uprising in northern Jutland, pillaging the holdings of Lutheran nobles. An army of nobles and their vassals assembled at Svendstrup and suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of the peasants. Realizing his hold on the throne was in imminent danger, Christian III negotiated a deal with the Hansa States which allowed him to send his trusted advisor Johan Rantzau north with an army of Protestant German mercenaries. Clement and his army fled north, taking refuge inside the walls of Aalborg. In December, Rantzau&#x27;s forces breached the walls and stormed the city. Clement managed to escape, but was apprehended a few days later. He was tried and beheaded in 1535.

With Jutland more or less secure, Christian next focused on gaining control of Scania. He appealed to the Protestant Swedish king Gustav Vasa for help in subduing the rebels. Gustav immediately obliged by sending two armies to ravage central Scania and Halland. The peasants suffered a bloody defeat at Loshult in Scania. The Swedes moved against Helsingborg Castle, which surrendered in January 1535 and was burned to the ground.

Rantzau moved his army to Funen and defeated Count Christopher&#x27;s army at Øksnebjerg on Funen in June 1535. Count Christopher&#x27;s forces held out in Malmø and Copenhagen until July 1536 when they surrendered after several months of siege by Christian III&#x27;s forces. With their capitulation, Christian III was firmly placed upon Denmark&#x27;s throne, and the Roman Catholic forces in Denmark were subdued.

=== After the war and coup d&#x27;état in Norway ===
A mutual confidence between a king who had conquered his kingdom and a people who had stood in arms against him was not attainable immediately. The circumstances under which Christian III ascended the throne exposed Denmark to the danger of foreign domination. It was with the help of the gentry of the Germanic duchies that Christian had captured Denmark. Holstein and German noblemen had led his armies and directed his diplomacy. The first six years of Christian III&#x27;s reign were marked by a contest between the Danish &quot;Rigsraadet&quot; and the German counsellors, both of whom sought to rule through the king. Though the Danish party won a victory at the outset, by obtaining the insertion in the charter of provisions stipulating that only native-born Danes should fill the highest dignities of the state, the king&#x27;s German counsellors continued paramount during his early reign.

The triumph of Christian III would eventually bring about an end to Catholic Christianity in Denmark, but Catholics still controlled the Council of State. Christian III ordered the arrest of three of the bishops on the State Council by his German mercenaries (12 August 1536). Some Catholic bishops were later executed on his orders.

Christian&#x27;s debt for the Count&#x27;s Feud was enormous and confiscating the Church lands (farmed by peasants who had been free from vassalage duties to the nobles) enabled him to pay down the debt to his creditors.

Christian&#x27;s Protestant policies led Denmark toward the establishment of Lutheranism as the Danish National Church (&quot;Folkekirke&quot;). This occurred officially on 30 October 1536 when the reconstituted State Council adopted the Lutheran Ordinances designed by German theologian Johannes Bugenhagen (1485–1558), which outlined church organization, liturgy, and accepted religious practice. Monasteries, nunneries, and priories, were closed and the property taken by the crown (see Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Grayfriars). Vast tracts of land were handed out to the king&#x27;s supporters, the royal land was rapidly expanded from one-sixth of the national land before the religious reform to 60% after the religious reform.

In 1537, Christian&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in Norway made it a hereditary kingdom in a real union with Denmark that would last until 1814. He also made Lutheranism the state religion in Norway, and on 2 September 1537 he appointed Gjeble Pederssøn as its first Lutheran bishop.

=== Later reign ===
The dangers threatening Christian III from Emperor Charles V and other kinsmen of the imprisoned Christian II convinced him of the necessity to lessen the discontent in the land by relying on Danish magnates and nobles. At the High Court (&quot;Herredag&quot;) of Copenhagen in 1542, the nobility of Denmark voted Christian a twentieth part of all their property to pay off his heavy debt to German mercenaries. The pivot of the foreign policy of Christian III was his alliance with the German Protestant princes and France. This provided a counterpoise to the persistent hostility of Charles V, who was determined to support the hereditary claims of his nieces, the daughters of Christian II, to the Scandinavian kingdoms. War was declared against Charles V in 1542, and, though the German Protestant princes proved faithless allies, the closing of the Sound against Dutch shipping proved such an effective weapon in Christian&#x27;s hand that the Netherlands compelled Charles V to make peace with Denmark-Norway at the diet of Speyer, on 23 May 1544.

=== Partition of Holstein and Schleswig ===
Until this peace, Christian III also ruled the entire Duchies of Holstein and of Schleswig in the name of his then still minor half-brothers John &quot;the Elder&quot; (&quot;Hans den Ældre&quot;) and Adolf. They determined their youngest brother Frederick for a career as Diocesan administrator of an ecclesiastical state within the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1544 the elder three brothers partitioned Holstein (a fief of the Holy Roman Empire) and Schleswig (a Danish fief). Following negotiations between the brothers and the Estates of the Realm of the duchies, the revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to each of the three brothers, while other general revenues, such as taxes from towns and customs dues, were levied together but then shared among the brothers. The estates, whose revenues were assigned to the parties, made Holstein and Schleswig look like patchworks, technically inhibiting the emergence of separate new duchies.

=== Final years ===
The foreign policy of Christian&#x27;s later days aimed at preserving the peace established by the Treaty of Speyer (1544). He refused to participate in the Schmalkaldic War of 1546, and mediated between the Emperor and Saxony after the fall of Maurice of Saxony at the Battle of Sievershausen in 1553. In 1549, he began the building of Landskrona Citadel. He also rebuilt Sønderborg Castle, converting it from a fortress into a four-winged castle in the new Renaissance syle, between 1549 and 1557. In February 1555, he interceded successfully on the behalf of the English Bible translator and Bishop of Exeter, Miles Coverdale (1488–1569), who had been imprisoned for two and a half years by the Catholic Mary I. Coverdale was then released and allowed to leave England.

Christian III died on New Year&#x27;s Day 1559 at Koldinghus, and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral in a funerary monument designed by Flemish sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt (1514–1575).

== Memorials ==
In 1579, Frederick II commissioned Dutch artists to erect a memorial to Christian III at Roskilde Cathedral.

Christian III received an honorary stone at the Walk of Fame at Landskrona which Sweden&#x27;s Carl XVI Gustaf inaugurated in 2013.

== Children ==
Christian married Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg on 29 October 1525 at Lauenburg Castle. She was daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.
Christian and Dorothea were the parents of five children:
*Anna of Denmark (1532–1585), married to Augustus, Elector of Saxony.
*Frederick II of Denmark (1534–1588), succeeded as King of Denmark and Norway.
*Magnus of Denmark (1540–1583), became Duke of Holstein, and later titular King of Livonia.
*Hans of Denmark (John &quot;the Younger&quot;; 1545–1622), Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg as &#x27;John II&#x27;.
*Dorothea of Denmark (1546–1617), married to William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and mother of George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

<text>Middletown is a city in Butler and Warren counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 50,987 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area in southwest Ohio, northeast of Cincinnati and southwest of Dayton.

Incorporated in 1833 and designated a city in 1886, Middletown was formed from parts of Lemon, Turtlecreek, and Franklin townships. It was home to AK Steel Holding Corporation, formerly known as Armco and founded in 1900, whose steel factory in Middletown still operates as part of Cleveland-Cliffs. The city also features Hook Field Municipal Airport, now serving only general aviation, and a regional campus of Miami University. In 1957, Middletown was named an All-America City.

==History==
Middletown is mostly part of the 1788 Symmes Purchase of purchased by Judge John Cleves Symmes of New Jersey in 1788 from the Continental Congress as part of the Land Ordinance of 1785.

Stephen Vail Jr. purchased land on the eastern bank of the Great Miami River from Symmes and platted 52 lots for the village in 1802. The purchase was complicated when it was discovered that Symmes did not own all the land thought to have been sold to Vail, and eventually, after Vail&#x27;s death, the Ohio Supreme Court permitted the transactions to go through.

In 1825, construction of the Miami and Erie Canal occurred, linking Middletown to Toledo, Ohio on Lake Erie and Cincinnati, Ohio on the Ohio River. A branch called the Warren County Canal operated to Lebanon, Ohio from 1830 to 1852 when flooding on Shaker Run destroyed the branch. The Great Flood of 1913 destroyed most of the Miami and Erie in the area. The canal was paved over and became the Verity Parkway In 1982, Middletown opened the Canal Museum to commemorate the events.

Middletown was served by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, Erie Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad.

Middletown was principally known for its agriculture and paper mills but became most famous as a steel town when George Verity, founder of American Rolling Mill Company (ARMCO) opened a sheet steel rolling process plant in 1900.

===Etymology===
The city&#x27;s name is believed to have been given by its founder, Stephen Vail, but questions remain unanswered as to why. One local historian stated that the city received its name because Vail had come from Middletown, New Jersey. Another writer believed that the city was named Middletown because it was the midway point of navigation on the Great Miami River, which was then considered a navigable stream. Another theory is credited to the city being roughly halfway between Dayton and Cincinnati. Vail centered the city in Fractional Section 28 of Town 2, Range 4 North. One of the first settlers in Middletown was Daniel Doty, who migrated there from New Jersey in the late 18th century.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Middletown adjoins the Great Miami River. Middletown also borders the cities of Franklin, Monroe, Trenton, and Liberty and Madison Townships.
