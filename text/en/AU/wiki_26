<text>Csound is a domain-specific computer programming language for audio programming. It is called Csound because it is written in C, as opposed to some of its predecessors. It is free software, available under the LGPL-2.1-or-later.

==History==
Csound was originally developed by Barry Vercoe at the MIT Media Lab in 1985, based on his earlier system called Music 11, which in its turn followed the MUSIC-N model initiated by Max Mathews at Bell Labs. Csound development continued throughout the 1990s and 2000s, led by John Fitch at the University of Bath.
Many developers have contributed to Csound, most notably Istvan Varga, Gabriel Maldonado, Robin Whittle, Richard Karpen, Iain McCurdy, Michael Gogins, Matt Ingalls, Steven Yi, Richard Boulanger, Victor Lazzarini and Joachim Heintz. Developed over many years, it currently has nearly 1700 unit generators. One of its greatest strengths is that it is completely modular and extensible by the user.

Csound is closely related to the underlying language for the Structured Audio extensions to MPEG-4, SAOL.

== Csound code ==
Csound takes two specially formatted text files as input. The &quot;orchestra&quot; describes the nature of the instruments and the &quot;score&quot; describes notes and other parameters along a timeline. Csound processes the instructions in these files and renders an audio file or real-time audio stream as output.

The &quot;orchestra&quot; and &quot;score&quot; files may be unified into a single structured file using markup language tags (a CSD file with filename extension .csd). Here is a very simple example of a unified Csound data file which produces a wave file containing a one-second sine wave tone of 1 kHz at a sample rate of 96 kHz:
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
 &lt;CsOptions&gt;
 csound -W -d -o tone.wav
 &lt;/CsOptions&gt;
 &lt;CsInstruments&gt;
 sr = 96000 ; Sample rate.
 kr = 9600 ; Control signal rate.
 ksmps = 10 ; Samples per control signal.
 nchnls = 1 ; Number of output channels.

 instr 1
 a1 oscil p4, p5, 1 ; Oscillator: p4 and p5 are the arguments from the score, 1 is the table number.
 out a1 ; Output.
 endin
 &lt;/CsInstruments&gt;

 &lt;CsScore&gt;
 f1 0 8192 10 1 ; Table containing a sine wave. Built-in generator 10 produces a sum of sinusoids, here only one.
 i1 0 1 20000 1000 ; Play one second of one kHz at amplitude 20000.
 e
 &lt;/CsScore&gt;

&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;

As with many other programming languages, writing long programs in Csound can be eased by using an integrated environment for editing, previewing, testing, and debugging. The one now officially supported is CsoundQt, and it has many features, such as automatic code insertion, integrated documentation browser, integrated widgets for graphically controlling parameters in realtime, plus a button for playing the code.

== Csound 5 ==
Version 5.01 was released on March 18, 2006 – 20 years after Csound&#x27;s first release. Csound 5 is available in binary and source code for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X from the SourceForge Csound project. It is much improved and expanded compared to the original software, effectively made into a software library with an API. A variety of front ends have been developed for it. In addition to the basic C API, there are also Python, Java, Lisp, Tcl and C++ among other bindings, like one from Haskell which allows control of Csound from a purely functional environment.

The use of plug-ins allows additional capabilities without modifications to the Csound code, as there is the possibility to write user-defined opcodes as extensions to the original language. LADSPA and DSSI are supported, but VST support has been removed.

Real-time performance through MIDI was added in the 1990s. Another addition was the support of FLTK widgets (graphical interface components with sliders, knobs, etc.) for controlling real-time audio, and integration of custom graphical interfaces written in Python.

== Csound 6 ==
The development of Csound 6 was led by John Fitch, Steven Yi and Victor Lazzarini. After its features were hashed out at the Csound Conference held in 2011 in Hanover, Csound 6 was released in July 2013 and made available on GitHub. Csound 6 is also available for Android. The major new features of Csound 6 include:

* A bison/flex based parser for the Csound language is now standard. It generates an abstract syntax tree that is accessible via the Csound API. The tree can then be compiled to a Csound performance runtime using the API. Therefore, after the tree has been compiled, it can be manipulated by user code before compiling it to a Csound performance runtime. Alternatively, the user could create the entire abstract syntax tree from another language, then compile the tree to a Csound performance runtime.
* There is a new built-in multi-dimensional array type. Arrays can be passed to instruments and opcodes. Arithmetic may be performed directly on arrays.
* There is a new type system that enables user-defined types to be used in the Csound language.
* The orchestra can be re-compiled at any time, or individual instruments can be compiled at any time, during a running performance. This enables true &quot;live coding&quot; in Csound performances.
* The Csound API has been rationalized and simplified.
* Csound can take advantage of any number of CPUs for concurrent processing during performance. This occurs without any changes to Csound code. This produces substantial speedups of most Csound processing. For example, a piece that renders in 100 seconds with 1 core should render in about 50 seconds with 4 cores.
* Csound can compile orchestras and scores directly from strings of text, enabling the use of Csound in environments where writing to the file system is not permitted.
* Score events such as notes can be scheduled to sample accurate times, even if synthesis is processed in blocks of samples.
* All opcodes that return a single value may be used as functions in the orchestra language.
* Audio analysis file formats can be byte-order independent.
* A single score statement can contain multiple string parameters.
* Most oscillator opcodes will use an internal sine function table if the table number is omitted.
* Command-line options can be set programmatically using the Csound API.
* Numerous duplicate areas of code within Csound have been rationalized.
* An Android app was built which provides user-defined graphical user interfaces and JavaScript-based algorithmic composition using HTML5.
== Csound for live performance==
Currently only Csound score or note events can be generated in real time (as opposed to instruments, which are only definable at compile time, when csound first starts; in Csound 6 this limitation is removed). The set of sound processors is defined and compiled at load time, but the individual processing objects can be spawned or destroyed in real time, input audio processed in real time, and output generated also in real time. Note events can be triggered based on OSC communications within an instrument instance, spawned by MIDI, or entered to stdin (by typing into a terminal or sending textual statements from another program). The use of Csound 5 as a live performance tool can be augmented with a variety of third-party software. Live Event Sheet within CsoundQt can be used to modify the score in real-time. In addition, interfaces to other programming languages can be used to script Csound. A paper detailing the use of Csound with Qt or Pure Data in real-time musical synthesis was presented at the 2012 Linux Audio Conference The Ounk project attempts to integrate Python with Csound while CsoundAC provides a way to do algorithmic composition from Python using Csound as backend. Audivation&#x27;s Csound for Live packages various opcodes into Max/MSP wrappers suitable for use in Ableton Live.
Csound is also available for mobile systems (iOS, Android).

== One Laptop per Child (OLPC) ==
Csound5 was chosen to be the audio/music development system for the OLPC project on the XO-1 Laptop platform.

<text>Red House Museum was a historic house museum, built in 1660 and renovated in the Georgian era. It closed to the public at the end of 2016 but remains as a Grade II* listed building in Gomersal, Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England.

==History==
Red House was built by William Taylor whose descendants owned it until 1920. The Taylor family had lived in Gomersal for more than a century when in 1660, William Taylor built a brick house next to their old one. The family were farmers and clothiers who developed their business into cloth finishing and became merchants.

The old house was standing in 1713 and surrounding workshops contained items for cloth manufacture. The old house was probably demolished when the barn to the west of the house and coach house were built in the mid-18th century. The house is constructed of red brick, unusual in a village built of local sandstone, and consequently was named the Red House. The exterior and interior were remodelled during the 18th century, and in 1920 the parlour and dining room windows were enlarged.

The house was Grade II* listed in January 1967 for its historic, industrial and literary interest and because it &quot;contains some good survivals of the Georgian period, including a staircase, fireplaces and windows, embedded in a late C17 core.&quot; Also of interest are the barn and coach house. Spenborough Council bought the house in 1969 and it opened as a museum five years later.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===

The two-storey house is built of red brick with stone quoins and has a stone slate roof that is hipped at the front and four gables to the rear. The doorway is off-centre and has a sash window and a canted bay window to either side. The upper storey has three double and two single sash windows. The rear wall with four gables was rebuilt between 1995 and 1997.

===Interior===

The house is decorated and furnished to suggest its appearance during the 1830s when Joshua Taylor, a woollen cloth manufacturer who owned a mill at Hunsworth near Cleckheaton, and his wife Anne and their six children were living there.

The entrance hall contains an 18th-century staircase with slender wooden balusters leading to a galleried landing of the same period. The hall has grained woodwork in the Georgian style, and is hung with portraits of the Taylor family from between 1737 and 1817. They are of Joshua Taylor&#x27;s sister Deborah (1771–1810), his parents, John (1737–1805) and Anne (1739–1817) and his father-in-law Captain Tickell.

Displays in the parlour, dining room, study, governess&#x27; room, scullery, kitchen and bedchambers are recreations of the 1830s era, utilising 19th-century furniture. The dining room contains stained glass windows with portraits of William Shakespeare and John Milton and a painting of the 1794 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which are described in the novel &quot;Shirley&quot;. Several rooms contain 18th-century hob grates or iron fire grates with integral ledges for heating food in pots or pans.

===Garden and outbuildings===

The garden has been designed with lawns, scented old climbing roses, an arbour and borders containing old-fashioned flowers to reflect 19th-century taste. It contains a display of old gateposts on the lawn.

A two-storey stone barn with a stone slate roof and cart entrance is situated to the west of the house. The stone coach house has four open-fronted arches. Its interior has been restored.

==Notable visitors and staff==
John and Charles Wesley, the Methodist preachers who were friends of John Taylor, the great-grandson of William Taylor, visited the house. Charlotte Brontë, who had been a pupil at Roe Head with Mary Taylor, the daughter of Joshua Taylor, a banker and wool merchant was also a visitor. She immortalised the family as the Yorkes and the house as &quot;Briarmains&quot; in her novel &quot;Shirley&quot;. Reverend Lauten of Gomersal Moravian Church, a visitor in the 1840s, may have been the inspiration for the Moravian minister in &quot;Shirley&quot;.

Mabel Ferrett (1917–2011), poet, publisher, literary editor and local historian, worked at the museum and wrote &quot;The Taylors of the Red House&quot; (1987).

==Closure==
As a result of government funding cuts, Kirklees Council considered that it could only afford to operate two museums, one in the north of the borough and one in Huddersfield. Red House, the Tolson and Dewsbury Museums were consequently threatened with closure. The Council for British Archaeology Yorkshire, said the authority wanted to save £531,000 by 2017–18.&quot; Friends of the museum and literary groups concerned with the loss of a Bronte connection were dismayed at the prospect of the museum closing and campaigned to keep it open. Kirklees Council closed Red House on 21 December 2016. Its contents will be stored or dispersed and the building is to be sold.

As of June 2018 the building was still unsold and almost £30,000 had been spent on its upkeep. It sold at auction in December 2024 for £650,000.

<doc id="150009" wikidata="Q209811" url="?curid=150009" title="Twin-lens reflex camera">
<text>A twin-lens reflex camera (TLR) is a type of camera with two objective lenses of the same focal length. One of the lenses is the photographic objective or &quot;taking lens&quot; (the lens that takes the picture), while the other is used for the viewfinder system, which is usually viewed from above at waist level.

In addition to the objective, the viewfinder consists of a 45-degree mirror (the reason for the word &quot;reflex&quot; in the name), a matte focusing screen at the top of the camera, and a pop-up hood surrounding it. The two objectives are connected, so that the focus shown on the focusing screen will be exactly the same as on the film. However, many inexpensive &quot;pseudo&quot; TLRs are fixed-focus models to save on the mechanical complexity. Most TLRs use leaf shutters with shutter speeds up to 1/500 of a second with a bulb setting.

For practical purposes, all TLRs are film cameras, most often using 120 film, although there are many examples which used 620 film, 127 film, and 35 mm film. Few general-purpose digital TLR cameras exist, since the heyday of TLR cameras ended long before the era of digital cameras, though they can be adapted with digital backs. In 2015, MiNT Camera released Instantflex TL70, a twin-lens reflex camera that uses Fuji instax mini film.

==History==
In traditional cameras, the photographer first viewed the image on a screen of ground glass in the same place that a photographic plate would be placed. After adjusting the camera and closing the objective aperture the ground glass screen was swapped for the photographic plate, and finally the picture could be taken. (Some cameras used this layout as late as the 1960s, for example the Koni-Omegaflex.)
With the addition of a second lens and a permanent piece of ground glass, this made it possible for a photographer to snap a picture immediately after focusing the image instead of having to remove and replace the ground glass screen every shot.
This advantage of course applies to SLR cameras as well, but early SLR cameras caused delays and inconvenience due to moving the mirror needed for viewfinding out of the optical path to the photographic plate. When this process was automated, the movement of the mirror could cause shake in the camera and blur the image.
Using a mirror to allow viewing from above also enabled the camera to be held much more steadily against the body than a camera held with the hands only.

The London Stereoscopic Co&#x27;s &quot;Carlton&quot; model, dating from 1885, is claimed to be the first off-the-shelf TLR camera.
A major step forward to mass marketing of the TLR came with the Rolleiflex in 1929, developed by Franke &amp; Heidecke in Germany. The Rolleiflex was widely imitated and most mass-market TLR cameras owe much to its design. It is said that Reinhold Heidecke had the inspiration for the Rollei TLRs while undertaking photography of enemy lines from the German trenches in 1916, when a periscopic approach to focusing and taking photos radically reduced the risk to the photographer from sniper fire.

TLRs are still manufactured in Germany by DHW Fototechnik, the successor of Franke &amp; Heidecke, in three versions.

==Features==

Higher-end TLRs may have a pop-up magnifying glass to assist the user in focusing the camera. In addition, many have a &quot;sports finder&quot; consisting of a square hole punched in the back of the pop-up hood, and a knock-out in the front. Photographers can sight through these instead of using the matte screen. This is especially useful in tracking moving subjects such as animals or race cars, since the image on the matte screen is reversed left-to-right. It is nearly impossible to accurately judge composition with such an arrangement, however.

Mamiya&#x27;s C-Series, introduced in the 1960s, the C-3, C-2, C-33, C-22 and the Mamiya C330 and Mamiya C220 along with their predecessor the Mamiyaflex, are the main conventional TLR cameras to feature truly interchangeable lenses. &quot;Bayonet-mount&quot; TLRs, notably Rolleis &amp; Yashicas, had both wide-angle and tele supplementary front add-ons, with Rollei&#x27;s Zeiss Mutars being expensive but fairly sharp. Rollei also made separate TLRs having fixed wide-angle or tele lenses: the Tele Rollei and the Rollei Wide, in relatively limited quantities; higher sharpness, more convenient (faster than changing lenses) if one could carry multiple cameras around one&#x27;s neck, but much more costly than using 1 camera with supplements. The Mamiya TLRs also employ bellows focusing, making extreme closeups possible.

Many TLRs used front and back cut-outs in the hinged top hood to provide a quick-action finder for sports and action photography. Late model Rollei Rolleiflex TLRs introduced the widely copied additional feature of a second-mirror &quot;sports finder&quot;. When the hinged front hood knock-out is moved to the sports finder position a secondary mirror swings down over the view screen to reflect the image to a secondary magnifier on the back of the hood, just below the direct view cutout. This permits precise focusing while using the sports finder feature. The magnified central image is reversed both top-to-bottom and left-to-right. This feature made Rolleis the leading choice for press photographers during the 1940s to 1960s.

==Advantages==

A primary advantage of the TLR is in its mechanical simplicity as compared to the more common single-lens reflex cameras (SLR) cameras. The SLR must employ some method of blocking light from reaching the film during focusing, either with a focal plane shutter (most common) or with the reflex mirror itself. Both methods are mechanically complicated and add significant bulk and weight, especially in medium-format cameras.
Because of their mechanical simplicity, TLR cameras are considerably cheaper than SLR cameras of similar optical quality, as well as inherently less prone to mechanical failure.

TLRs are practically different from SLR in several respects. First, unlike virtually all film SLRs, TLRs provide a continuous image on the finder screen. The view does not black out during exposure.
Since a mirror does not need to be moved out of the way, the picture can be taken much closer to the time the shutter is actuated by the photographer, reducing so-called shutter lag. This trait, and the continuous viewing, made TLRs the preferred camera style for dance photography.
The separate viewing lens is also very advantageous for long-exposure photographs. During exposure, an SLR&#x27;s mirror must be retracted, blacking out the image in the viewfinder. A TLR&#x27;s mirror is fixed and the taking lens remains open throughout the exposure, letting the photographer examine the image while the exposure is in progress. This can ease the creation of special lighting or transparency effects.
Models with leaf shutters within the lens, rather than focal-plane shutters installed inside the camera body, can synchronize with flash at higher speeds than can SLRs. Flashes on SLRs usually cannot synchronize accurately when the shutter speed is faster than 1/60th of a second and occasionally 1/125th. Some higher quality DSLRs can synchronize at up to 1/500th of a second. Leaf shutters allow for flash synchronization at all shutter speeds.
SLR shutter mechanisms are comparatively noisy. Most TLRs use a leaf shutter in the lens. The only mechanical noise during exposure is from the shutter leaves opening and closing.

TLRs are also ideal for candid camera shots where an eye-level camera would be conspicuous. A TLR can be hung on a neck strap and the shutter fired by cable release.
Owing to the availability of medium-format cameras and the ease of image composition, the TLR was for many years also preferred by many portrait studios for static poses.

Extreme dark photographic filters like the opaque Wratten 87 can be used without problems, as they cover and thus darken only the taking lens. The image in the viewfinder stays bright.

==Disadvantages==

Few TLR cameras offered interchangeable lenses and none were made with a zoom lens. In systems with interchangeable lenses, such as the Mamiya, the fixed distance between the lenses sets a hard limit on their size, which precludes the possibility of large aperture long-focus lenses. The lenses are also more expensive because the shutter mechanism is integrated with the lens, not the camera body, so each lens pair must include a shutter.
Because the photographer views through one lens but takes the photograph through another, parallax error makes the photograph different from the view on the screen. This difference is negligible when the subject is far away, but is critical for nearby subjects. Parallax compensation may be performed by the photographer in adjustment of the sight line while compensating for the framing change, or for highly repeatable accuracy in tabletop photography (in which the subject might be within a foot (30 cm) of the camera), devices are available that move the camera upwards so that the taking lens goes to the exact position that the viewing lens occupied. (Mamiya&#x27;s very accurate version was called the Para-mender and mounted on a tripod.) Some TLRs like the Rolleiflex (a notable early example is the Voigtländer Superb of 1933) also came with more or less complex devices to adjust parallax with focusing.

It is generally not possible to preview depth of field, as one can with most SLRs, since the TLR&#x27;s viewing lens usually has no diaphragm. Exceptions to this are the Rolleiflex, the Mamiya 105 D and 105 DS lenses, which have a depth-of-field preview.

As the viewfinder of a TLR camera requires the photographer to look down toward the camera, it is inconvenient to frame a photo with a subject that requires the camera to be positioned above the photographer&#x27;s chest unless a tripod is used. In these cases, the camera may be positioned with the lenses oriented horizontally. Due to the TLR&#x27;s square format, the composition need not be altered.
The image in the waist-level finder is reversed &quot;left to right&quot;, which can make framing a photograph difficult, especially for an inexperienced user or with a moving subject. With high-quality TLRs like the Rolleiflex and the Mamiya C220/C330, the waist-level finder can be replaced by an eye-level finder, using a roof pentaprism or pentamirror to correct the image while making it viewable through an eyepiece at the rear of the camera.

The design of the leaf shutter limits almost all TLRs to a maximum shutter speed between 1/100 and 1/500 of a second.

Certain photographic filters are inconvenient without line of sight through the taking lens notably, graduated neutral density filters are hard to use with a TLR, as there is no easy way to position the filter accurately.

==Film formats==


===6×6 format===
The typical TLR is medium format, using 120 roll film with square images. Presently, the Chinese Seagull Camera is still in production along with Lomography&#x27;s Lubitel, but in the past, many manufacturers made them. DHW-Fototechnik GmbH continues to make the Rolleiflex TLR as well. The Ciro-flex, produced by Ciro Cameras Inc., rose dramatically in popularity due in large part to the inability to obtain the German Rollei TLRs during World War II. The Ciro-flex was widely accessible, inexpensive, and produced high quality images. Models with the Mamiya, Minolta and Yashica brands are common on the used-camera market, and many other companies made TLRs that are now classics. The Mamiya C series TLRs had interchangeable lenses, allowing focal lengths from 55 mm (wide angle) to 250 mm (telephoto) to be used. The bellows focusing of these models also allowed extreme closeups to be taken, something difficult or impossible with most TLRs. The simple, sturdy construction of many TLRs means they have tended to endure the years well. Many low-end cameras used cheap shutters however, and the slow speeds on these often stick or are inaccurate.

===127 format===
There were smaller TLR models, using 127 roll film with square images, most famous the &quot;Baby&quot; Rolleiflex and the Yashica 44. The TLR design was also popular in the 1950s for inexpensive fixed focus cameras such as the Kodak Duaflex and Argus 75.

===35 mm format===
Though most used medium format film, a few 35 mm TLRs were made, the very expensive Contaflex TLR being the most elaborate, with interchangeable lenses and removable backs. The LOMO Lubitel 166+, a natively medium format camera, comes with an adapter for 35 mm film. As do most Rolleiflex models with their respective Rolleikin 35mm adapter. Furthermore the Yashica 635 was made specifically for use with 120 and 135 film and was shipped with the appropriate adapters.

===Instant film format===

The only twin lens reflex camera that uses instant film is Instantflex TL70 manufactured by MiNT Camera which is compatible with Fuji instax mini film (film size , picture size ) . It is the world&#x27;s first instant twin lens reflex camera.

===Subminiature format===
Gemflex is a subminiature twin lens reflex camera made by Showa Optica Works (昭和光学精機) in occupied Japan in the 50s. Gemflex resembles the well known Rolleiflex 6×6 twin lens reflex, but much smaller in size. The body of Gemflex is die cast from shatter proof metal.

The smallest photography TLR camera using 35 mm film is the Swiss-made Tessina, using perforated 35 mm film reloaded into special Tessina cassette, forming images of .

Goerz Minicord twin lens reflex made format on double perforated 16 mm film in metal cassette. 6 Element Goerz Helgor F2 lens, metal focal plane shutter B, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 400. Viewing lens uses pentaprism reflex optics for the viewing lens. Picture format on double perforated 16 mm film.

Minox rebadged Sharan Rolleflex 2.8F classic retro TLR film camera, 1/3 scale 6x6 Rolleiflex TLR, using Minox cassette image size , 15 mm F5.6 glass triplet lens, mechanical shutter 1/250 sec.

Japan made Gemflex, a twin lens reflex using 17.5 mm paper back roll film.

It has been argued that the medical gastroscopy camera, the Olympus Gastro Camera is technically the smallest TLR device.

<text>Uelzen () is a district () in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Gifhorn, Celle, Heidekreis, Lüneburg and Lüchow-Dannenberg, and by the state of Saxony-Anhalt (district of Altmarkkreis Salzwedel). The district capital is the town of Uelzen.

==History==
From the Middle Ages on the region was part of the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg and its successor states.

==Geography==
The district comprises the eastern part of the Lüneburg Heath (&quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot;). The Ilmenau river has its source in the district. From here it runs northwards to the town of Lüneburg. The countryside is flat and sparsely populated.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:

<doc id="150011" wikidata="Q7332" url="?curid=150011" title="Bergen-Belsen concentration camp">
<text>Bergen-Belsen (), or Belsen, was a Nazi concentration camp in what is today Lower Saxony in northern Germany, southwest of the town of Bergen near Celle. Originally established as a prisoner of war camp, in 1943, parts of it became a concentration camp. Initially this was an &quot;exchange camp&quot;, where Jewish hostages were held with the intention of exchanging them for German prisoners of war held overseas. The camp was later expanded to hold Jews from other concentration camps.

After 1945, the name was applied to the displaced persons camp established nearby, but it is most commonly associated with the concentration camp. From 1941 to 1945, almost 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and a further 50,000 inmates died there. Overcrowding, lack of food, and poor sanitary conditions caused outbreaks of typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery; leading to the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the first few months of 1945, shortly before and after the liberation.

The camp was liberated on April 15, 1945, by the British 11th Armoured Division. The soldiers discovered approximately 60,000 prisoners inside, most of them half-starved and seriously ill, and another 13,000 corpses lying around the camp unburied. A memorial with an exhibition hall currently stands at the site.

==Operation==

===Prisoner of war camp===

In 1935, the Wehrmacht began to build a large military complex close to the village of Belsen, a part of the town of Bergen, in what was then the Province of Hanover. This became the largest military training area in Germany of the time and was used for armoured vehicle training. The barracks were finished in 1937. The camp has been in continuous operation since then and is today known as Bergen-Hohne Training Area. It is used by the NATO armed forces.

The workers who constructed the original buildings were housed in camps near Fallingbostel and Bergen, the latter being the so-called Bergen-Belsen Army Construction Camp. Once the military complex was completed in 1938–39, the workers&#x27; camp fell into disuse. However, after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; began using the huts as a prisoner of war (POW) camp.

The camp of huts near Fallingbostel became known as Stalag XI-B and was to become one of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s largest POW camps, holding up to 95,000 prisoners from various countries. In June 1940, Belgian and French POWs were housed in the former Bergen-Belsen construction workers&#x27; camp. This installation was significantly expanded from June 1941, once Germany prepared to invade the Soviet Union, becoming an independent camp known as Stalag XI-C (311). It was intended to hold up to 20,000 Soviet POWs and was one of three such camps in the area. The others were at Oerbke (Stalag XI-D (321)) and Wietzendorf (Stalag X-D (310)). By the end of March 1942, some 41,000 Soviet POWs had died in these three camps of starvation, exhaustion, and disease. By the end of the war, the total number of dead had increased to 50,000. When the POW camp in Bergen ceased operation in early 1945, as the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; handed it over to the SS, the cemetery contained over 19,500 dead Soviet prisoners.

In the summer of 1943, Stalag XI-C (311) was dissolved and Bergen-Belsen became a branch camp of Stalag XI-B. It served as the hospital for all Soviet POWs in the region until January 1945. Other inmates/patients were Italian military internees from August 1944 and, following the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising in October 1944, around 1,000 members of the Polish Home Army were imprisoned in a separate section of the POW camp.

===Concentration camp===
In April 1943, a part of the Bergen-Belsen camp was taken over by the SS Economic-Administration Main Office (&quot;SS Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA&quot;). It thus became part of the concentration camp system, run by the &quot;SS Schutzstaffel&quot; but it was a special case. Having initially been designated a &quot;Zivilinterniertenlager&quot; (&quot;civilian internment camp&quot;), in June 1943 it was redesignated &quot;Aufenthaltslager&quot; (&quot;holding camp&quot;), since the Geneva Conventions stipulated that the former type of facility must be open to inspection by international committees. This &quot;holding camp&quot; or &quot;exchange camp&quot; was for Jews who were intended to be exchanged for German civilians interned in other countries, or for hard currency. The SS divided this camp into subsections for individual groups (the &quot;Hungarian camp&quot;, the &quot;special camp&quot; for Polish Jews, the &quot;neutrals camp&quot; for citizens of neutral countries and the &quot;Star camp&quot; for Dutch Jews). Between the summer of 1943 and December 1944 at least 14,600 Jews, including 2,750 minors were transported to the Bergen-Belsen &quot;holding&quot; or exchange camp. Inmates were made to work, many of them in the &quot;shoe commando&quot; which salvaged usable pieces of leather from shoes collected and brought to the camp from all over Germany and occupied Europe. In general the prisoners of this part of the camp were treated less harshly than some other classes of Bergen-Belsen prisoner until fairly late in the war, due to their perceived potential exchange value. However, only around 2,560 Jewish prisoners were ever actually released from Bergen-Belsen and allowed to leave Germany.

In March 1944, part of the camp was redesignated as an &quot;Erholungslager&quot; (&quot;recovery camp&quot;), where prisoners too sick to work were brought from other concentration camps. They were in Belsen supposedly to recover and then return to their original camps and resume work, but many of them died in Belsen of disease, starvation, exhaustion and lack of medical attention.

In August 1944, a new section was created and this became the so-called &quot;women&#x27;s camp&quot;. By November 1944 this camp received around 9,000 women and young girls. Most of those who were able to work stayed only for a short while and were then sent on to other concentration camps or slave-labour camps. The first women interned there were Poles, arrested after the failed Warsaw Uprising. Others were Jewish women from Poland or Hungary, transferred from Auschwitz. Margot and Anne Frank died there in February or March 1945.

===More prisoners===
In December 1944 &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Josef Kramer, previously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, became the new camp commandant, replacing &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; , who had been in post since the spring of 1943. In January 1945, the SS took over the POW hospital and increased the size of Bergen-Belsen. As eastern concentration camps were evacuated before the advance of the Red Army, at least 85,000 people were transported in cattle cars or marched to Bergen-Belsen. Before that the number of prisoners at Belsen had been much smaller. In July 1944 there were 7,300; by December 1944 the number had increased to 15,000; and by February 1945 it had risen to 22,000. Numbers then soared to around 60,000 by April 15, 1945. This overcrowding led to a vast increase in deaths from disease: particularly typhus, as well as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery and malnutrition in a camp originally designed to hold about 10,000 inmates. At this point also, the special status of the exchange prisoners no longer applied. All inmates were subject to starvation and epidemics.

===&quot;Außenlager&quot; (satellite camps)===

Bergen-Belsen concentration camp had three satellite camps. These were at regional armament works. Around 2,000 female concentration camp prisoners were forced to work there. Those who were too weak or sick to continue with their work were brought to Bergen-Belsen.

&quot;Außenlager Bomlitz-Benefeld&quot; at Bomlitz near Fallingbostel was in use from September 3 to October 15, 1944. It was located at the facility of Eibia GmbH, a gunpowder works. Around 600 female Polish Jews were used for construction and production work.

&quot;Außenlager Hambühren-Ovelgönne&quot; (Lager III, Waldeslust) at Hambühren south of Winsen was in use from August 23, 1944, to February 4, 1945. It was an abandoned potash mine, now intended as an underground production site for Bremen plane manufacturer Focke-Wulf. Around 400 prisoners, mostly female Polish or Hungarian Jews, were forced to prepare the facility and to help lay train tracks to it. This was done for the company Hochtief.

&quot;Außenlager Unterlüß-Altensothrieth&quot; (Tannenberglager) east of Bergen was in use from late August 1944 to April 13, 1945. It was located at Unterlüß, where the Rheinmetall-Borsig AG had a large test site. Up to 900 female Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Czech Jews had to clear forest, do construction work or work in munitions production.

Prisoners were guarded by SS staff and received no wages for their work. The companies instead reimbursed the SS for the labour supplied. Wage taxes were also levied by local authorities.

===Treatment of prisoners and deaths in the camp===
Current estimates put the number of prisoners who passed through the concentration camp during its period of operation from 1943 to 1945 at around 120,000. Due to the destruction of the camp&#x27;s files by the SS, not even half of them, around 55,000, are known by name. As mentioned above, treatment of prisoners by the SS varied between individual sections of the camp, with the inmates of the exchange camp generally being better treated than other prisoners, at least initially. However, in October 1943 the SS selected 1,800 men and women from the &quot;Sonderlager&quot; (&quot;special camp&quot;), Jews from Poland who held passports from Latin American countries. Since the governments of these nations mostly refused to honour the passports, these people had lost their value to the regime. Under the pretext of sending them to a fictitious &quot;Lager Bergau&quot;, the SS had them transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were sent directly to the gas chambers and murdered. In February and May 1944 another 350 prisoners from the &quot;special camp&quot; were sent to Auschwitz. Thus, out of the total of 14,600 prisoners in the exchange camp, at least 3,550 died, more than 1,400 of them at Belsen, and around 2,150 at Auschwitz.

In the &quot;Männerlager&quot; (the male section of the &quot;recovery camp&quot;), inmates suffered even more from lack of care, malnourishment, disease and mistreatment by the guards. Thousands of them died. In the summer of 1944, at least 200 men were murdered by orders of the SS by being injected with phenol.

There were no gas chambers at Bergen-Belsen, since the mass-murders took place in the camps further east. Nevertheless, current estimates put the number of deaths at Belsen at more than 50,000 Jews, Czechs, Poles, anti-Nazi Christians, homosexuals, and Roma and Sinti (Gypsies). Among them were French Resistance member Jean Maurice Paul Jules de Noailles, the 6th Duke of Ayen (on April 14, 1945), and Czech painter and writer Josef Čapek (estimated to be in April 1945), who had coined the word &quot;robot&quot;, popularised by his brother Karel Čapek.

The rate at which inmates died at Belsen accelerated notably after the mass transport of prisoners from other camps began in December 1944. From 1943 to the end of 1944 around 3,100 died. From January to mid-April 1945 this rose to around 35,000. Another 14,000 died after liberation between April 15 and the end of June 1945, in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp under British authority.

After the war, there were allegations that the camp (or possibly a section of it), was &quot;of a privileged nature&quot;, compared to others. A lawsuit filed by the Jewish community in Thessaloniki against 55 alleged collaborators claims that 53 of them were sent to Bergen-Belsen &quot;as a special favor&quot; granted by the Germans. 

==Liberation==


When the British and Canadians advanced on Bergen-Belsen in 1945, the German army negotiated a truce and exclusion zone around the camp to prevent the spread of typhus. On April 11, 1945 Heinrich Himmler (the &quot;Reichsführer SS&quot;) agreed to have the camp handed over without a fight. SS guards ordered prisoners to bury some of the dead. The next day, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; representatives approached the British, D Squadron of the Inns of Court Regiment, at the bridge at Winsen and were brought to VIII Corps. At around 1 a.m. on April 13, an agreement was signed, designating an area of around the camp as a neutral zone. Most of the SS were allowed to leave. Only a small number of SS men and women, including the camp commandant Kramer, remained to &quot;uphold order inside the camp&quot;. The outside was guarded by Hungarian and regular German troops who were returned to the German front lines by the British shortly afterwards. Due to heavy fighting near Winsen and Walle, the British were unable to reach Bergen-Belsen on April 14, as originally planned. The camp was liberated on the afternoon of April 15, 1945. The first two to reach the camp were a British Special Air Service officer, Lieutenant John Randall, and his jeep driver, who were on a reconnaissance mission and discovered the camp by chance. American soldiers attached to the British forces also helped liberate the camp.

When British and Canadian troops finally entered they found over 13,000 unburied bodies and (including the satellite camps) around 60,000 inmates, most acutely sick and starving. The prisoners had been without food or water for days before the Allied arrival, partially due to Allied bombing. Immediately before and after liberation, prisoners were dying at around 500 per day, mostly from typhus. The scenes that greeted British troops were described by the BBC&#x27;s Richard Dimbleby, who accompanied them:

Initially lacking sufficient manpower, the British allowed the Hungarians to remain in charge and only commandant Kramer was arrested. Subsequently, SS and Hungarian guards shot and killed some of the starving prisoners who were trying to get their hands on food supplies from the store houses. The British started to provide emergency medical care, clothing and food. Immediately following the liberation, revenge killings took place in the satellite camp the SS had created in the area of the army barracks that later became Hohne-Camp. Around 15,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora had been relocated there in early April. These prisoners were in much better physical condition than most of the others. Some of these men turned on those who had been their overseers at Mittelbau. About 170 of these &quot;Kapos&quot; were killed on April 15, 1945. On April 20, four German fighter planes attacked the camp, damaging the water supply and killing three British medical orderlies.

Over the next days the surviving prisoners were deloused and moved to a nearby German Panzer army camp, which became the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp. Over a period of four weeks, almost 29,000 of the survivors were moved to the displaced persons (DP) camp. Before the handover, the SS had managed to destroy the camp&#x27;s administrative files, thereby eradicating most written evidence.

The British forced the former SS camp personnel to help bury the thousands of dead bodies in mass graves. The personnel were given starvation rations, not allowed to use gloves or other protective clothing, and were continuously shouted at and threatened to make sure that they did not stop working. Some of the bodies were so rotten that arms and legs tore away from the torso. Within two months, 17 staff members had died of typhus due to being forced to handle the bodies with no protection. Another committed suicide, and three others were shot and killed by British soldiers after trying to escape.

Some civil servants from Celle and &quot;Landkreis Celle&quot; were brought to Belsen and confronted with the crimes committed on their doorstep. Military photographers and cameramen of No. 5 Army Film and Photographic Unit documented the conditions in the camp and the measures of the British Army to ameliorate them. Many of the pictures they took and the films they made from April 15 to June 9, 1945, were published or shown abroad. Today, the originals are in the Imperial War Museum. These documents have a lasting impact on the international perception and memory of Nazi concentration camps to this day. According to Habbo Knoch, head of the institution that runs the memorial today: &quot;Bergen-Belsen [...] became a synonym world-wide for German crimes committed during the time of Nazi rule.&quot;

Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was then burned to the ground by flamethrowing &quot;Bren gun&quot; carriers and Churchill Crocodile tanks because of the typhus epidemic and louse infestation. As the concentration camp ceased to exist at this point, the name Belsen after this time refers to events at the Bergen-Belsen DP camp.

There were massive efforts to help the survivors with food and medical treatment, led by Brigadier Glyn Hughes, deputy director of Medical Services of 2nd Army, and James Johnston, the Senior Medical Officer. Despite their efforts, about another 9,000 died in April, and by the end of June 1945 another 4,000 had died. (After liberation 13,994 people died.)

Two specialist teams were dispatched from Britain to deal with the feeding problem. The first, led by A. P. Meiklejohn, included 96 medical student volunteers from London teaching hospitals who were later credited with significantly reducing the death rate amongst prisoners. A research team led by Janet Vaughan was dispatched by the Medical Research Council to test the effectiveness of various feeding regimes.

The British troops and medical staff tried these diets to feed the prisoners, in this order:
* Bully beef from Army rations. Most of the prisoners&#x27; digestive systems were in too weak a state from long-term starvation to handle such food.
* Skimmed milk. The result was a bit better, but still far from acceptable.
* Bengal Famine Mixture. This is a rice-and-sugar-based mixture which had achieved good results after the Bengal famine of 1943, but it proved less suitable to Europeans than to Bengalis because of the differences in the food to which they were accustomed. Adding the common ingredient paprika to the mixture made it more palatable to these people and recovery started.

Some were too weak to even consume the Bengal Famine Mixture. Intravenous feeding was attempted but abandoned. SS doctors had previously used injections to murder prisoners, so some panicked at the sight of the intravenous feeding equipment.

==Aftermath==
===Legal prosecution===

Many of the former SS staff who survived the typhus epidemic were tried by the British military at the Belsen trial. Over the period in which Bergen-Belsen operated as a concentration camp, at least 480 people had worked as guards or members of the commandant&#x27;s staff, including around 45 women. From September 17 to November 17, 1945, 45 of those were tried by a military tribunal in Lüneburg. They included former commandant Josef Kramer, 16 other SS male members, 16 female SS guards and 12 former kapos (one of whom became ill during the trial). Among them were Irma Grese, Elisabeth Volkenrath, Hertha Ehlert, , Johanna Bormann and Fritz Klein. Many of the defendants were not just charged with crimes committed at Belsen but also earlier ones at Auschwitz. Their activities at other concentration camps such as Mittelbau-Dora, Ravensbrück, Neuengamme, the Gross Rosen subcamps at Neusalz and Langenleuba, and the Mittelbau-Dora subcamp at Gross Werther were not subject of the trial. It was based on British military law and the charges were thus limited to war crimes. Substantial media coverage of the trial provided the German and international public with detailed information on the mass killings at Belsen as well as on the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Eleven of the defendants were sentenced to death. They included Kramer, Volkenrath and Klein. The executions by hanging took place on December 13, 1945, in Hamelin. Fourteen defendants were acquitted (one was excluded from the trial due to illness). Of the remaining 19, one was sentenced to life in prison but he was executed for another crime. Eighteen were sentenced to prison for periods of one to 15 years; however, most of these sentences were subsequently reduced significantly on appeals or pleas for clemency. By June 1955, the last of those sentenced in the Belsen trial had been released. Ten other members of the Belsen personnel were tried by later military tribunals in 1946 and 1948, with five of them being executed.

Denazification courts were created by the Allies to try members of the SS and other Nazi organisations. Between 1947 and 1949 these courts initiated proceedings against at least 46 former SS staff at Belsen. Around half of these were discontinued, mostly because the defendants were considered to have been forced to join the SS. Those who were sentenced received prison terms of between four and 36 months or were fined. As the judges decided to count the time the defendants had spent in Allied internment towards the sentence, the terms were considered to have already been fully served.

Only one trial was ever held by a German court for crimes committed at Belsen, at Jena in 1949; the defendant was acquitted. More than 200 other SS members who were at Belsen have been known by name but never had to stand trial. No German soldier was ever put on trial for crimes committed against the inmates of the POW camps at Bergen-Belsen, albeit some were tried for participating in death marches headed towards Bergen-Belsen and in the region around it, despite the fact that the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg had found in 1946 that the treatment of Soviet POWs by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; constituted a war crime.

===Memorial===
The area of the former Bergen-Belsen camp fell into neglect after the burning of the buildings and the closure of the nearby displaced persons&#x27; camp in the summer of 1950. The area reverted to heath; few traces of the camp remained. However, as early as May 1945, the British had erected large signs at the former camp site. Ex-prisoners began to set up monuments. A first wooden memorial was built by Jewish DPs in September 1945, followed by one made in stone, dedicated on the first anniversary of the liberation in 1946. On November 2, 1945, a large wooden cross was dedicated as a memorial to the murdered Polish prisoners. Also by the end of 1945 the Soviets had built a memorial at the entrance to the POW cemetery. A memorial to the Italian POWs followed in 1950, but was removed when the bodies were reinterred in a Hamburg cemetery.
The British military authorities ordered the construction of a permanent memorial in September 1945 after having been lambasted by the press for the desolate state of the camp. In the summer of 1946, a commission presented the design plan, which included the obelisk and memorial walls. The memorial was finally inaugurated in a large ceremony in November 1952, with the participation of Germany&#x27;s president Theodor Heuss, who called on the Germans never to forget what had happened at Belsen.

For a long time, however, remembering Bergen-Belsen was not a political priority. Periods of attention were followed by long phases of official neglect. For much of the 1950s, Belsen &quot;was increasingly forgotten as a place of remembrance&quot;. Only after 1957 did large groups of young people visit the place where Anne Frank had died. After anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled on the Cologne synagogue over Christmas 1959, German chancellor Konrad Adenauer followed a suggestion by Nahum Goldmann, president of the World Jewish Congress, and visited the site of a former concentration camp for the first time. In a speech at the Bergen-Belsen memorial, Adenauer assured the Jews still living in Germany that they would have the same respect and security as everyone else. Afterwards, the German public saw the Belsen memorial as primarily a Jewish place of remembrance. Nevertheless, the memorial was redesigned in 1960–61. In 1966, a document centre was opened which offered a permanent exhibition on the persecution of the Jews, with a focus on events in the nearby Netherlands – where Anne Frank and her family had been arrested in 1944. This was complemented by an overview of the history of the Bergen-Belsen camp. This was the first ever permanent exhibit anywhere in Germany on the topic of Nazi crimes. However, there was still no scientific personnel at the site, with only a caretaker as permanent staff. Memorial events were only organized by the survivors themselves.

In October 1979, the president of the European Parliament Simone Veil, herself a survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, came to the memorial for a speech which focused on the Nazi persecution of Roma and Sinti. This was the first time that an official event in Germany acknowledged this aspect of the Nazi era.
In 1985, international attention was focused on Bergen-Belsen. The camp was hastily included in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s itinerary when he visited West Germany after a controversy about a visit to a cemetery where the interred included members of the &quot;Waffen SS&quot; (see Bitburg controversy). Shortly before Reagan&#x27;s visit on May 5, there had been a large memorial event on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the camp&#x27;s liberation, which had been attended by German president Richard von Weizsäcker and chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the aftermath of these events, the parliament of Lower Saxony decided to expand the exhibition centre and to hire permanent scientific staff. In 1990, the permanent exhibition was replaced by a new version and a larger document building was opened.

Only in 2000 did the Federal Government of Germany begin to financially support the memorial. Co-financed by the state of Lower Saxony, a complete redesign was planned which was intended to be more in line with contemporary thought on exhibition design. On April 15, 2005, there was a ceremony, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation and many ex-prisoners and ex-liberating troops attended. In October 2007, the redesigned memorial site was opened, including a large new Documentation Centre and permanent exhibition on the edge of the newly redefined camp, whose structure and layout can now be traced. Since 2009, the memorial has been receiving funding from the Federal government on an ongoing basis.
The site is open to the public and includes monuments to the dead, including a successor to the wooden cross of 1945, some individual memorial stones and a &quot;House of Silence&quot; for reflection. In addition to the Jewish, Polish and Dutch national memorials, a memorial to eight Turkish citizens who were killed at Belsen was dedicated in December 2012.

 After a day’s journey, we arrived at Bergen-Belsen. This concentration camp was hopelessly overcrowded and we were not accepted. The right hand no longer knew what the left hand was doing, so we were sent to an adjoining Wehrmacht compound. As the soldiers of the Wehrmacht marched out, we moved in. The confusion was unbelievable; this time it was disorder with German perfection. We were moved into clean barracks, equipped for human beings with excellent bathrooms and clean beds stacked three on top of each other. After all we had experienced in the preceding year, this was sheer luxury. There was no mention of the usual camp rituals, no roll calls and no work, but also no food.

 It was shortly after the British Red Cross arrived, though it may have no connection, that a very large quantity of lipstick arrived. This was not at all what we men wanted, we were screaming for hundreds and thousands of other things and I don&#x27;t know who asked for lipstick. I wish so much that I could discover who did it, it was the action of genius, sheer unadulterated brilliance. I believe nothing did more for those internees than the lipstick. Women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. I saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. At last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tattooed on the arm. At last they could take an interest in their appearance. That lipstick started to give them back their humanity.
* &quot;Belsen Uncovered&quot; by Derrick Sington (1946)
 The twentieth century has so far produced no more terrifying example of collective human wickedness than the Belsen Concentration Camp, a black spot which it fell to the lot of the British Army to occupy. This book is the personal story of the first British officer to enter the camp on its liberation and the last to leave, after a stay of five months. The author and two of his N.C.O.&#x27;s between them spoke five languages, so they had unrivalled opportunities for discovering what the inmates, men, women and children, experienced and felt. The evil which produced the concentration camps is fully exposed, and here too will be found a record of how the psychological and medical problems were tackled, as well as such complicated matters as supplies, welfare and rehabilitation.

 But what should you do when faced with 60,000 dead, sick and dying people? We were in the army to fight a war and to beat the enemy. We were good at that, having been in combat for the last ten months, but none of us had any experience of dealing with the situation in Belsen and we were all more or less traumatized by the sights we had seen. I myself, although a &#x27;senior officer&#x27;, had turned 25 years of age only a few days before. Most of the men sent to deal with that human disaster were in their late teens or early twenties, even younger than I was. What we suddenly found ourselves faced with was beyond anyone&#x27;s comprehension

<text>Milutin Milanković (sometimes anglicised as Milutin Milankovitch; , ; 28 May 1879 – 12 December 1958) was a Serbian mathematician, astronomer, climatologist, geophysicist, civil engineer and popularizer of science.

Milanković gave two fundamental contributions to global science. The first contribution is the &quot;Canon of the Earth&#x27;s Insolation&quot;, which characterizes the climates of all the planets of the Solar System. The second contribution is the explanation of Earth&#x27;s long-term climate changes caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun, now known as Milankovitch cycles. This partly explained the ice ages occurring in the geological past of the Earth, as well as the climate changes on the Earth which can be expected in the future.

He founded planetary climatology by calculating temperatures of the upper layers of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as well as the temperature conditions on planets of the inner Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the depth of the atmosphere of the outer planets. He demonstrated the interrelatedness of celestial mechanics and the Earth sciences and enabled a consistent transition from celestial mechanics to the Earth sciences and transformation of descriptive sciences into exact ones.

A distinguished professor of applied mathematics and celestial mechanics at the University of Belgrade, Milanković was a director of the Belgrade Observatory, member of the Commission 7 for celestial mechanics of the International Astronomical Union and vice-president of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Beginning his career as a construction engineer, he retained an interest in construction throughout his life, and worked as a structural engineer and supervisor on a series of reinforced concrete constructions throughout Yugoslavia. He registered multiple patents related to this area.

==Life==
===Early life===
Milutin Milanković was born in the village of Dalj, a settlement on the banks of the Danube in what was then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Milutin and his twin sister were the oldest of seven children raised in a Serb family. Their father was a merchant, landlord, and a local politician who died when Milutin was eight. As a result, Milutin and his siblings were raised by his mother, grandmother, and an uncle. His three brothers died of tuberculosis at a young age. As his health was fickle, Milutin received his elementary education at home (in &quot;the classroom without walls&quot;), learning from his father Milan, private teachers, and from numerous relatives and friends of the family, some of whom were renowned philosophers, inventors, and poets. He attended secondary school in nearby Osijek, completing it in 1896.

In October 1896, at the age of seventeen, he moved to Vienna to study Civil Engineering at the TU Wien and graduated in 1902 with the best marks. In his memoirs, Milanković wrote about his lectures on engineering: &quot;Professor Czuber was teaching us mathematics. His every sentence was the masterpiece of strict logic, without any extra word, without any error.&quot; After graduating and spending his obligatory year in military service, Milanković borrowed money from an uncle to pay for additional schooling at TU Wien in engineering. He researched concrete and wrote a theoretical evaluation of it as a building material. At age twenty-five, his PhD thesis was entitled &quot;Contribution to the Theory of Pressure Curves&quot; (Beitrag zur Theorie der Druckkurven) and its implementation allowed assessment of pressure curves&#x27; shape and properties when continuous pressure is applied, which is very useful in bridge, cupola and abutment construction. His thesis was successfully defended on 12 December 1904; examination committee members were Johann Emanuel Brik, Josef Finger, Emanuel Czuber and Ludwig von Tetmajer. He then worked for an engineering firm in Vienna, using his knowledge to design structures.

===Middle years===
====Structural engineering====
At the beginning of 1905, Milanković took up practical work and joined the firm of Adolf Baron Pittel Betonbau-Unternehmung in Vienna. He built dams, bridges, viaducts, aqueducts, and other structures in reinforced concrete throughout Austria-Hungary. The result was particularly evident in the extraordinary design of a reinforced-concrete aqueduct for a hydroelectric power plant in Sebeș, Transylvania, which Milanković designed at the beginning of his career.

He patented a new type of reinforced concrete ribbed ceiling and published the first paper on armored concrete, titled &quot;Contribution to the theory of reinforced armored pillars&quot;. He published the second paper on the same subject based on new results in 1906. In 1908, he published a paper titled &quot;On membranes of same opposition&quot; in which he proves that the ideal shape for a water reservoir of equally thick walls is that of a drop of water. His six patents were officially recognized and his reputation in the profession was enormous, bringing abundant financial wealth.

Milanković continued to practice civil engineering in Vienna until 1 October 1909 when he was received an offer University of Belgrade to work as an Associate Professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics that comprised three basic branches: rational, celestial mechanics, and theoretical physics. Though he continued to pursue his investigations of various problems pertaining to the application of reinforced concrete, he decided to concentrate on fundamental research.

Milanković continued in design and construction work when he moved to Kingdom of Serbia. In 1912, Milankovitch accepted the invitation of his collegemate from TU Wien and the owner of the construction company Petar Putnik to create a project for bridges on rocky shores on the future route of the Niš - Knjaževac railway, in the Timok Valley through the Nisevac Gorge. Milankovitch, who liked this idea very much, soon drew up structural calculations for all the bridges with reinforced concrete arches.

====Planet&#x27;s insolation====
While studying the works of the contemporaneous climatologist Julius von Hann, Milanković noticed a significant issue, which became one of the major objects of his scientific research: a mystery ice age. The idea of possible astronomically-related climate changes was first considered by astronomers (John Herschel, 1792–1871) and geologists (Louis Agassiz, 1807–1873). Milanković studied the works of Joseph Adhemar whose pioneering theory on the astronomical origins of ice ages were formally rejected by his contemporaries and the amateur scientist James Croll (1821-1890), whose work was effectively forgotten after initial acceptance by contemporaries such as Charles Darwin. Despite having valuable data on the distribution of ice on the Alps across various glaciations, climatologists and geologists had not established the root causes of these cycles. Milanković decided to attempt correctly to calculate the magnitude of such influences. Milanković sought the solution of these complex problems in the field of spherical geometry, celestial mechanics, and theoretical physics.

His first paper was from celestial mechanics in 1910, which concerned the integrals of n-body problem, but from 1912 Milanković began to be interested in cosmic climatology or solar climate. He began working on it in 1912, after he had realized that &quot;most of meteorology is nothing but a collection of innumerable empirical findings, mainly numerical data, with traces of physics used to explain some of them... Mathematics was even less applied, nothing more than elementary calculus... Advanced mathematics had no role in that science...&quot; His first work described the present climate on Earth and how the Sun&#x27;s rays determine the temperature on Earth&#x27;s surface after passing through the atmosphere. He published the first paper on the subject entitled &quot;Contribution to the mathematical theory of climate&quot; in Belgrade in April 1912. His next paper was entitled &quot;Distribution of the sun radiation on the earth&#x27;s surface&quot; and was published on June 1913. In December of that year, this paper was read by Wilhelm Wien, and was soon published in the German journal &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;. He correctly calculated the intensity of insolation and developed a mathematical theory describing Earth&#x27;s climate zones. His aim was an integral, mathematically accurate theory which connects thermal regimes of the planets to their movement around the Sun. He wrote: &quot;...such a theory would enable us to go beyond the range of direct observations, not only in space, but also in time... It would allow reconstruction of the Earth&#x27;s climate, and also its predictions, as well as give us the first reliable data about the climate conditions on other planets.&quot;

He published a paper entitled &quot;The problem of the astronomical theory of ice ages&quot; in 1914. On 14 June 1914, Milanković married Kristina Topuzović and went on his honeymoon to his native village of Dalj in Austro-Hungary, where he heard about the Sarajevo assassination which was the cause of the July crisis. Meanwhile, the Austro-Hungarian Empire began massing troops in the Balkans near the border with the Kingdom of Serbia in preparation for an invasion. At that time, he was arrested as a citizen of Serbia, and at first he spent six weeks under house arrest, but was eventually imprisoned and later sent to a prisoner-of-war camp (K. u. K. Interienirungslager) in Nezsider, Hungary (today Neusiedl am See, Austria). He described his first day in prison, where he waited to be taken to the Esseg fortress as a prisoner of war, in the following words:

... Sat on the bed, I looked around and started synchronizing with my new social position ... In the suitcase I had my printed works and my notes on the cosmic problem, there was clean paper too and I started writing. It was far past midnight when I stopped. I looked around the room, wondering where I was. It felt like I was in a roadhouse on my trip through the Universe.

His wife went to Vienna to talk to Emanuel Czuber, who was his mentor and a good friend. Through his social connections, Professor Czuber arranged Milanković&#x27;s release from prison and permission to spend his captivity in Budapest with the right to work. After six months spent in the prison camp, Milanković was released on December 24, 1914.
 Immediately after arriving in Budapest, Milanković met the Director of the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Science, Kálmán Szily who, as a mathematician, eagerly accepted Milanković and enabled him to work undisturbed in the Academy&#x27;s library and the Central Meteorological Institute. Milanković spent four years in Budapest, almost the entire war. In 1915, Milanković&#x27;s son Vasilije-Vasko was born in Budapest. He used mathematical methods to study the current climate of inner planets of the solar system.

He shared the general opinion at the time that Mars and Venus contained water on their surface. This was logical thinking, since Earth has water, Mars has polar caps, and Venus has white clouds that associate on the water vapor. This significantly influenced his calculations for the basic thermal climate characteristics of these two planets. In 1916 he published a paper entitled &quot;Investigation of the climate of the planet Mars&quot;. He knew the size of Mars and its distance from the Sun, but also that it has a similar rotation speed and axis orientation as Earth. Milanković calculated that the average temperature in the lower layers the atmosphere on Mars is and the average surface temperature is . Also, he concluded that: &quot;This large temperature difference between the ground and lower layers of the atmosphere is not unexpected. Great transparency for solar radiation makes that is the climate of Mars very similar to altitudes climate of our Earth.&quot; In any case, Milanković&#x27;s work suggested that Mars has a harsh climate, and calmed mounting enthusiasm concerning the prospect of discovering the presence of liquid water on the surface of Mars. He discussed the possibility of life on Mars and was skeptical that it could have complex life forms as well and vegetation. In addition to considering Mars, he dealt with the climatic conditions prevailing on Venus and Mercury.

According to his own words, Milankovitch did not know the speed of rotation of Venus, the orientation of the axis, as well as the thickness and composition of the atmosphere. He was awere with Schiaparelli&#x27;s suggestion that Venus has a slow rotation period equal to the duration of its orbits around the Sun, but he was skeptical because he thought that Venus would lose its atmosphere during a long-term day due to the effects of Solar Radiation. At the last, he accepted spectroscopy observations from that time that suggested a shorter rotation period similar to Earth&#x27;s. So he considered a greenhouse effect (water vapor) on Venus calculated the temperature in the outer limit of the atmosphere , the upper layer , the middle layer and the lower layer of the atmosphere as well as a ground temperature of . In his literary work &quot;Through Distant Worlds and Times&quot;, he described of Venus in the following words: Here we are in the temple of Isis and Osiris, more magnificent than Schinkel himself imagined. From its huge dome, covered with a gently mother-of-pearl mosaic, a white mysterious light spills over the interior of this home. That dome, that&#x27;s the sky of Venus. The Sun is never visible on it, only the Sun&#x27;s silvery glow. Not a single star twinkles in this sky; no messenger of the universe reaches this sanctuary...What is this? A storm is raging in my head, blood vessels are beating
like sledgehammers, I&#x27;m out of breath. You are pale, dear miss, your legs are wobbly - you have completely fainted... Half unconscious, I carry you, in my arms, to our Earth...

He also discussed the possibility of life on Venus. He thought that the mystery of this planet lies in the answer to the question about its axis, the speed of rotation or how long a day lasts on Venus.

His calculations of the surface temperature conditions on the neighboring Moon are particularly significant. Milankovitch knew that the moon rotates on its axis in 27.32 days, so lunar daytime on one side of the moon last about 13.5 Earth days. Milankovitch calculated that the temperature after a long moon night, in the early morning on the Moon, or before the rise of the Sun over horizon, was . At noon, it rises on , only to reach its maximum value one Earth day later . At sunset, the temperature drops . According to Milankovitch, a sudden cooling occurs during the night.

From 1912 to 1917, he wrote and published seven papers on mathematical theories of climate both on the Earth and on the other planets. He formulated a precise, numerical climatological model with the capacity for reconstruction of the past and prediction of the future, and established the astronomical theory of climate as a generalized mathematical theory of insolation. When these most important problems of the theory were solved, and a firm foundation for further work built, Milanković finished the manuscript under the title &quot;Mathematische Grundlagen der kosmischen Strahlungslehre&quot; that he sent to his mentor Professor Czuber in Vienna at the end of 1917. Czuber contacted a publishing house in Leipzig, but since there was a shortage of paper in early 1918, the printing of the book was cancelled. Meanwhile, Milanković found a regular job in 1918 as an engineer in a construction company in Budapest.

After the Great War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated and new states such as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Republic of Austria, Kingdom of Hungary and 
Czechoslovak Republic were formed on its remains. Milanković returned from Budapest to Belgrade with his family after a three-day trip by steamboat ″Gizella″ on 19 March 1919. He continued his professorial career, becoming a full professor at the University of Belgrade. Milanković then, with the help of Professor Ivan Đaja, prepared the French text of this work and it was published under the title &quot;Théorie mathématique des phénomènes thermiques produits par la radiation solaire&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Theory of Heat Phenomena Produced by Solar Radiation&quot;) in 1920 in the edition of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (today HAZU) from Zagreb and the Gauthier-Villars in Paris. That same year, he was elected a corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences in Belgrade and the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb.

====Orbital variations and ice ages====
As a consequence of the Russian Civil War, with the arrival of Russian scientists – emigrants, the personnel base of the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade was expanded. Thus, from 1920 Anton Bilimovich (1879–1970), a distinguished scientist, who came from Odessa, took over the lectures on rational mechanics, and from 1925 the lectures on theoretical physics and vector theory were taken over by the newly elected assistant professor Wenceslas S. Jardetzky (1896–1962). Between the two wars, Milankovitch taught celestial mechanics and occasionally the theory of relativity, and after the Second World War until 1955, when he retired, he taught celestial mechanics and the history of astronomy.

Milankovitch&#x27;s works on astronomical explanations of ice ages, especially his curve of insolation for the past 130,000 years, received support from the climatologist Wladimir Köppen and from the geophysicist Alfred Wegener. Köppen noted the usefulness of Milanković&#x27;s theory for paleoclimatological researchers. Milanković received a letter on 22 September 1922 from Köppen, who asked him to expand his studies from 130,000 years to 600,000 years. He accepted Köppen&#x27;s suggestion that cool summers were a crucial factor for glaciation and agreed to calculate the secular progress of insolation of the Earth at the outer limit of the atmosphere for the past 650,000 years for parallels of 55°, 60° and 65° northern latitude, where the most important events of the Quaternary glaciations occurred. After developing the mathematical machinery enabling him to calculate the insolation in any given geographical latitude and for any annual season, Milanković was ready to start the realization of the mathematical description of climate of the Earth in the past. Milanković spent 100 days doing the calculations and prepared a graph of solar radiation changes at geographical latitudes of 55°, 60° and 65° north for the past 650,000 years. Milankovitch, in his early works, used the astronomical values of Stockwell-Pilgram.

These curves showed the variations in insolation which correlated with four Alpine glaciations known at the time (Gunz, Mindel, Riss and Würm glaciation). Köppen felt that Milanković&#x27;s theoretical approach to solar energy was a logical approach to the problem. His solar curve was introduced in a work entitled &quot;Climates of the geological past&quot;, published by Wladimir Köppen and his son-in-law Alfred Wegener in 1924. In September of that year, he attended the lecture given by Alfred Wegener at Congress of German Naturalist in Innsbruck. That same year, he was elected a full member of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences. The Meteorological service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia became a member of International Meteorological Organization – IMO (founded in Brussels in 1853 and in Vienna in 1873) as a predecessor of present World Meteorological Organization, WMO. Milanković served as a representative of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there for many years.
Milanković put the Sun at the center of his theory, as the only source of heat and light in the Solar System. He considered three cyclical movements of the Earth: eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession. Each cycle works on a different time-scale and each affects the amount of solar energy received by the planets. Such changes in the geometry of an orbit lead to the changes in the insolation – the quantity of heat received by any spot at the surface of a planet. These orbital variations, which are influenced by gravity of the Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, form the basis of the Milankovitch cycle.

Between 1925 and 1928 Milanković wrote the popular-science book &quot;Through Distant Worlds and Times&quot; in the form of letters to an anonymous woman. The work discusses the history of astronomy, climatology and science via a series of imaginary visits to various points in space and time by the author and his unnamed companion, encompassing the formation of the Earth, past civilizations, famous ancient and renaissance thinkers and their achievements, and the work of his contemporaries, Köppen and Wegener. In the &quot;letters&quot;, Milanković expanded on some of his own theories on astronomy and climatology, and described the complicated problems of celestial mechanics in a simplified manner.

Köppen proposed to Milanković on 14 December 1926 to extend his calculations to a million years and to send his results to Barthel Eberl, a geologist studying the Danube basin, as Eberl&#x27;s research had unearthed some evidence of previous Ice Ages from before over 650,000 years ago. Eberl published all this in Augsburg in 1930 together with Milanković&#x27;s curves. In 1927, Milanković received an offer from Köppen to collaborate on the Handbook of Climatology (Handbuch der Klimatologie), which was edited by Köppen himself. That same year, Milanković asked his colleague and friend, Vojislav Mišković, to collaborate in the work and calculate astronomical values based on the Le Verrier method. Mišković was a well-established astronomer from the Nice Observatory, who became the head of the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Belgrade and a professor of Theoretical and Practical Astronomy. After almost three years, Mišković and his staff completed the calculation of astronomical values based on the Le Verrier method and using the masses of the planets as known at that time. Milanković used these values in his later works. Subsequently, Milanković wrote the introductory portion of &quot;Mathematical science of climate and astronomical theory of the variations of the climate&quot; (&quot;Mathematische Klimalehre und Astronomische Theorie der Klimaschwankungen&quot;), published by Köppen (&quot;Handbook of Climatology&quot;; &quot;Handbuch der Klimalogie Band 1&quot;) in 1930 in German and translated into Russian in 1939.

In 1935 Milanković published the book &quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot;. 
This textbook used vector calculus systematically to solve problems of celestial mechanics. His original contribution to celestial mechanics is called Milanković&#x27;s system of vector elements of planetary orbits. He reduced six Lagrangean-Laplacian elliptical elements to two vectors determining the mechanics of planetary movements. The first specifies the planet&#x27;s orbital plane, the sense of revolution of the planet, and the orbital ellipse parameter; the second specifies the axis of the orbit in its plane and the orbital eccentricity. By applying those vectors he significantly simplified the calculation and directly obtained all the formulas of the classical theory of secular perturbations. Milanković, in a simple but original manner, first deduced Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation from Kepler&#x27;s laws. Then Milanković treated the two-body and the many-body problems of celestial mechanics.

He applied vector calculus from quantum mechanics to celestial mechanics.

Meanwhile, in 1936 he attended the Third symposium of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Vienna.

In the period from 1935 to 1938 Milanković calculated that ice cover depended on changes in insolation. He succeeded in defining the mathematical relationship between summer insolation and the altitude of the snow line. In this way he defined the increase of snow which would occur as a consequence of any given change in summer insolation. He published his results in the study &quot;New Results of the Astronomic Theory of Climate Changes&quot; in 1938. Geologists received a graph presenting bordering altitudes of ice cover for any period of time during the last 600,000 years. .

====Polar wandering====
Conversations with Wegener, the father of continental drift theory, got Milanković interested in the interior of the Earth and the movement of the poles, so he told his friend that he would investigate polar wandering. In November 1929, Milanković received an invitation from Professor Beno Gutenberg of Darmstadt to collaborate on a ten volume handbook on geophysics and to publish his views on the problem of the secular variations of the Earth&#x27;s rotational poles. In the meantime, Wegener died in November 1930 during his fourth expedition to Greenland. Milanković became convinced that the continents &#x27;float&#x27; on a somewhat fluid subsurface and that the positions of the continents with respect to the axis of rotation affect the centrifugal force of the rotation and can throw the axis off balance and force it to move. Wegener&#x27;s tragedy additionally motivated Milankovich to persevere in solving the problem of polar wandering.

Milanković began working on the problem of the shape of the Earth and the position of the Earth&#x27;s poles in 1932 and 1933 at the suggestion of Alfred Wegener. The Earth as a whole he considered as a fluid body, which in the case of short-duration forces behaves as a solid body, but under an influence behaves as an elastic body. Using vector analysis he made a mathematical model of the Earth to create a theory of secular motion of the terrestrial poles. He derived the equation of secular trajectory of a terrestrial pole and also the equation of pole motion along this trajectory. His equation, also known as Milankovitch&#x27;s theorem, is &quot;v = c grad Ω&quot;.

He drew a map of the path of the poles over the past 300 million years and stated that changes happen in the interval of 5 million years (minimum) to 30 million years (maximum). He found that the secular pole trajectory depends only on the configuration of the terrestrial outer shell and the instantaneous pole position on it, more precisely on geometry of the Earth mass. On this basis he could calculate the secular pole trajectory. Also, based on Milanković&#x27;s model, the continental blocks sink into their underlying &quot;fluidal&quot; base, and slide around, &#x27;aiming to achieve&#x27; isostatic equilibrium. In his conclusion about this problem, he wrote: For an extraterrestrial observer, the displacement of the pole takes place in such a way that the ... Earth&#x27;s axis maintains its orientation in space, but the Earth&#x27;s crust is displaced on its substratum. Milankovitch published his paper on the subject entitled &quot;Numerical trajectory of secular changes of pole’s rotation&quot; in Belgrade in 1932.

Milanković wrote four sections of Gutenberg&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Geophysics&quot; (Handbuch der Geophysik):

* &quot;Stellung und Bewegung der Erde im Weltall&quot;, No I,2 - 1931, (The Earth&#x27;s Position and Movement in Space)
* &quot;Drehbewegungen der Erde&quot;, No. I,6 - 1933, (Rotational Movement of the Earth)
* &quot;Säkulare Polverlagerungen&quot;, No. I,7 - 1933, (Secular shift of the Poles)
* &quot;Astronomiche Mittel zur Erforschung der erdgeschichtlichen Klimate&quot;, No. IX, 7 - 1938, (Astronomic Means for Climate Study during the Earth&#x27;s history)

The lecture on the apparent shift of poles was held at a congress of Balkan mathematicians in Athens in 1934. That same year, 
held a lecture dedicated to the work of Alfred Wegener under the title &quot;Moving of the Earth&#x27;s Poles – A Memory to Alfred Wegener&quot; in Belgrade, which was also published under the same name. Wegener&#x27;s untimely death ended the collaboration between them on this subject.

Milankovitch&#x27;s work on this topic was criticized from the beginning. Milankovitch&#x27;s trajectory of polar wandering was a topic of discussion after World War II. In the 1950s, paleomagnetic data showed different results than Milankovitch&#x27;s theoretical numerical values for polar wandering trajectory.

===Later life===
To collect his scientific work on the theory of solar radiation that was scattered in many books and papers, Milanković began his life&#x27;s work in 1939. This tome was entitled &quot;Canon of Insolation of the Earth and Its Application to the Problem of the Ice Ages&quot;, which covered his nearly three decades of research, including a large number of formulas, calculations and schemes, but also summarized universal laws through which it was possible to explain cyclical climate change – his namesake Milankovitch cycles.

Milanković spent two years arranging and writing the &quot;Canon&quot;. The manuscript was submitted to print on 2 April 1941 – four days before the attack of Nazi Germany and its allies on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941, the printing house where his work was being printed was destroyed; however, almost all of the printed sheet paper remained undamaged in the printing warehouse. After the successful occupation of Serbia on 15 May 1941, two German officers and geology students came to Milanković in his house and brought greetings from Professor of Freiburg. Milanković gave them the only complete printed copy of the &quot;Canon&quot; to send to Soergel, to make certain that his work would be preserved. Milanković did not take part in the work of the university during the occupation, and after the war he was reinstated as professor.

The &quot;Canon&quot; was issued in 1941 by the Royal Serbian Academy, 626 pages in quarto, and was printed in German as &quot;Kanon der Erdbestrahlung und seine Anwendung auf das Eiszeitenproblem&quot;. The titles of the six parts of the book are:
# &quot;The planets&#x27; motion around the Sun and their mutual perturbations&quot;
# &quot;The rotation of the Earth&quot;
# &quot;Secular wanderings of the rotational poles of the Earth&quot;
# &quot;The Earth&#x27;s insolation and its secular changes&quot;
# &quot;The connection between insolation and the temperature of the Earth and its atmosphere. The mathematical climate of the Earth&quot;
# &quot;The ice age, its mechanism, structure and chronology&quot;.
During the German occupation of Serbia from 1941 to 1944, Milanković withdrew from public life and decided to write a &quot;history of his life and work&quot; going beyond scientific matters, including his personal life and the love of his father who died in his youth. His autobiography would be published after the war, entitled &quot;Recollection, Experiences and Vision&quot; in Belgrade in 1952.

====Tower of Babel====
After the war, in 1947, Milanković&#x27;s only son emigrated from the new communist Yugoslavia via Paris, London and Egypt to Australia. Milanković would never see his son again and the only way of correspondence between them would be through letters. Milanković was vice president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences (1948–1958). In 1948, the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union was held in Zürich. Milankovich is listed as a member of Commission 7 for Celestial Mechanics, and “V. Mishkovitch” as member of Commission 19 for Latitude Variation and Commission 20 for Minor Planets. For a short period, he was the head of the Belgrade Observatory (1948 - 1951). At that time, the Cold War between nuclear powers began. In 1953, he was at the Congress of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) held in Rome where he was interrupted during his speech by numerous opponents since radiocarbon dating at that time showed different results than his theory. In the same year, he became a member of the Italian Institute of Paleontology. In November 1954, fifty years after receiving his original diploma, he received the Golden Doctor&#x27;s diploma from the Technical University of Vienna. In 1955, he was also elected as a corresponding member to the Academy of Naturalists &quot;Leopoldina&quot; in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, East Germany.

At the same time, Milankovitch began publishing numerous books and textbooks on the history of science, including &quot;Isaac Newton and Newton&#x27;s Principia&quot; (1946), &quot;The founders of the natural science Pythagoras – Democritus – Aristotle – Archimedes&quot; (1947), &quot;History of astronomy – from its beginnings up to 1727&quot; (1948), &quot;Through empire of science – images from the lives of great scientists&quot; (1950), &quot;Twenty-two centuries of Chemistry&quot; (1953), and &quot;Technology in Ancient times&quot; (1955).

In 1955, Milankovitch retired from the position of professor of celestial mechanics and the history of astronomy at the University of Belgrade. In the same year, he published his last work, which is not from the natural sciences, but from his original profession of structural engineering. The paper was titled &quot;The Tower of Babel of modern technology&quot;. Milankovitch in this work calculated the highest building possible on our Earth. He was inspired by work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder&#x27;s Tower of Babel (older version in Vienna). The building would have a base radius of 112.84 km and a height of 21646 m. Since the building penetrates the Earth 1.4 km, it would have a height of 20.25 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface. At the very top, there would be a wide platform for a meteorological and astronomical station.

In September 1957, Milutin suffered a stroke and died in Belgrade in 1958. He is buried in his family cemetery in Dalj.

==On the speed of light==
Milanković authored two papers on relativity. He wrote his first paper &quot;On the theory of Michelson&#x27;s experiment&quot; in 1924. He was doing research in this theory from 1912. His papers on this matter were on special relativity and both are on the Michelson experiment (now known as the Michelson–Morley experiment) which produced strong evidence against aether theory. In the light of the Michelson experiment he discussed on the validity of the second postulate of special theory of relativity, that the speed of light is the same in every reference frame.

==Revised Julian calendar==

Milanković proposed a revised Julian calendar in 1923. It made centennial years leap years if division by 900 left a remainder of 200 or 600, unlike the Gregorian rule which required that division by 400 left no remainder. (In both systems, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years.) In May 1923 a congress of some Eastern Orthodox churches adopted the calendar; however, only the removal of 1–13 October 1923 and the revised leap year algorithm were adopted by a number of Eastern Orthodox churches. The dates of Easter and related holy days are still computed using the Julian calendar. At the time of Milanković&#x27;s proposal, it was suspected the period of rotation of Earth might not be constant, but it was not until the development of quartz and atomic clocks beginning in the 1930s that this could be proven and quantified. The variation in the period of rotation of Earth is the chief cause of long-term inaccuracy in both the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars.

==Awards and honors==

On June 25, 1923 he was conferred the Saint Sava Order, 3rd degree. On 1925, he was awarded Tunisian Nichan Iftikhar Order, 3rd degree. On 1929, he was awarded, at the proposal of the Ministry of Finances the White Eagle Order, 5th degree. On 1935, he was awarded Greek decoration - Phoenix Battalion Commander&#x27;s Cross. On December 20, 1938 he was awarded the Royal Order of the Yugoslav Crown 3rd degree. In 1965, the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union named an impact crater on the far side of the Moon as Milankovic, which was later confirmed at the 14th IAU General Assembly in 1970. His name is also given to a crater on Mars at the 15th IAU General Assembly in 1973. Since 1993 the Milutin Milankovic Medal has been awarded by the European Geophysical Society (called the EGU since 2003) for contributions in the
area of long-term climate and modeling. A main belt asteroid discovered in 1936 has also been dubbed 1605 Milankovitch. At NASA, in their edition of &quot;On the Shoulders of Giants&quot;, Milanković has been ranked among the top fifteen minds of all time in the field of earth sciences.

==Philosophical view==
Milanković was a materialistic monist and determinist, according to whom nature is &quot;unique&quot;, &quot;boundless, eternal mother of life&quot; and in &quot;the boundless universe, which has no beginning or end in space and time, the same natural laws rule&quot; as on Earth.
==Interesting facts==
Milanković was a great admirer of Nikola Tesla. On behalf of five academics, Milutin Milanković wrote a recommendation that Nikola Tesla be elected a full member of the Royal Serbian Academy, which was done at a ceremonial meeting on March 7, 1937.

<doc id="150016" wikidata="Q408636" url="?curid=150016" title="River Aire">
<text>The River Aire is a major river in Yorkshire, England, in length. Part of the river below Leeds is canalised, and is known as the Aire and Calder Navigation.

The &quot;Handbook for Leeds and Airedale&quot; (1890) notes that the distance from Malham to Howden is direct, but the river&#x27;s meanderings extend that to . Between Malham Tarn and Airmyn, the river drops .

==Course==
The Aire starts at Malham Tarn and becomes a subterranean stream at &#x27;Water Sinks&#x27; about one mile (1.6 km) before the top of Malham Cove, it then flows underground to Aire Head, just below Malham, in North Yorkshire, and then flows through Gargrave and Skipton. After Cononley, the river enters West Yorkshire where it passes through the former industrial areas of Keighley, Bingley, Saltaire and Shipley. It then passes through Leeds and on to Swillington and Woodlesford. At Castleford is the confluence of the Aire and Calder; just downstream of the confluence was the ford where the ancient British road, used by the Romans, crossed on its way north to York. The river re-enters North Yorkshire near Knottingley and in its lower reaches forms part of the boundary between North Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Tests have been conducted to authenticate the actual source of the Aire. The tarn at Malham was dammed and allowed to flood. Observers noted that whilst water surged at Aire Head, it also surged at the bottom of Malham Cove. A significant difference of 30 minutes was noted between the surges with Malham Cove being slower to react to the floodwater.

The section between Malham Tarn and the confluence of the becks at Aire Head is known as Malhamdale. Thereafter the valley is known as Airedale and encompasses Bradford, (even though the river bypasses the city) and by the time it reaches Leeds, the term Airedale is rarely applied.

The River Aire empties into the River Ouse at Airmyn, &#x27;myn&#x27; being an old English word for &#x27;river mouth&#x27;.

==Toponymy==
The name of the Aire is first attested as &quot;Yr&quot; in a charter from 959 AD (as edited in Gray&#x27;s &quot;Cartularium Saxonicum&quot;). The river is named as &quot;darcy&quot; and &quot;ðarcy&quot; (with the ancient eth) in a thirteenth-century transcription of a charter of 963. It is &quot;Eyr’&quot; in 1135 in &quot;The Coucher Book of Selby&quot; and other sources up to 1298. &quot;Eir&quot; is given in 1175–7 in one of the Dodsworth Manuscripts in Farrer&#x27;s &quot;Early Yorkshire Charters&quot;. A range of other spellings are attested, among them &quot;Air&quot; from c. 1160 to 1577 and John Cossins&#x27; 1775 &quot;Plan of the Town of Leedes&quot;, and &quot;Air’&quot; from the thirteenth century to the fourteenth.

The etymology of the name is obscure. Two Celtic etymologies have been proposed. In 1857 it was suggested that &quot;Aire&quot; may come from Common Brittonic *&quot;Isarā&quot; (&#x27;the strong one&#x27;), in which case &quot;Aire&quot; originally meant &#x27;strong river&#x27;. An alternative Celtic etymology suggests that the word is related to Welsh &quot;aer&quot; (&#x27;slaughter&#x27;). 

However, the name could also come from Old Norse &quot;eyjar&quot; (&#x27;islands&#x27;), which might in turn have been inspired by an earlier Old English name &quot;ēg&quot; (&#x27;island&#x27;).

==History==
The deposit of silt by two tributaries close together, the Meanwood Beck from the north and the Hol Beck from the south, created a crossing place and a settlement that became the town of Leeds. The Romans forded the Aire by a paved way at Castleford on the road connecting Doncaster with York, which went north through the town near to the church. At this time, the River Don emptied into the Aire at Snaith, but the Dutch engineer, Cornelius Vermuyden, changed the course of the Don in the 1630s so that it flows into the Ouse after its confluence with the Aire.

During the Great Frost of 1683–84 the river froze solid for a month in Leeds allowing a fair with an ox-roast and sports to take place, as described by Ralph Thoresby.

An Act of Parliament was passed in 1699 to make the river downstream of Leeds navigable (the Aire and Calder Navigation) and a second act extended the navigable river upstream to Bingley. The second act formed the basis of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

Between the mid 19th century and the late 20th, the River Aire was devoid of fish life downstream of Shipley because of pollution. Efforts have been made to return the river to a good wildlife status and fish and other wildlife exist all along the course of the river.

== Power stations ==
There are three thermal power stations alongside the River Aire east of Castleford: Ferrybridge C, Eggborough and Drax. Drax takes its cooling water from the Ouse, but both Ferrybridge and Eggborough drew their water from the Aire. Both of the latter plants stopped generating in 2016, with Eggborough being a stand-by for capacity problems until March 2017.

A hydroelectric power station was installed on Brotherton Weir at Knottingley in November 2017. This £7.5 million project was expected to deliver 500 kilowatts and be operational for 100 years.

== Ecology ==
Because the Aire flows through the former industrial landscape of West Yorkshire, it was heavily polluted. In 2007, Yorkshire Water carried out improvements to Esholt Sewage Works at a cost of £110 million under the EU&#x27;s Fresh Water Fish Directive. Whilst Trout are prevalent above Keighley, the river is host to others such as Chub, Dace, Barbel &amp; Grayling, whilst Sea Trout have been noted as far upriver as Shipley. Work is also being undertaken to make some weirs easier for fish to negotiate. Improvements have allowed Eurasian otters and European water voles to return to the river as the water and food quality is far superior to that when the river was polluted. In the upper reaches of the river around Bell Busk and Malham, white-clawed crayfish are present in the tributaries.

A joint project between the Environment Agency and The Aire Rivers Trust will instal four fish passes on the last four high weirs on the river, with the intent of allowing salmon to return to Skipton for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. The project will also benefit eels, lamprey and other coarse fish. The project is expected to be complete by early 2021.

Castleford Wastewater Treatment Works has had £16 million of investment between 2013 and 2015. The improvements to this plant, which discharges water directly into the Aire, has improved water quality downstream.

Rodley Nature Reserve, Kirkstall Valley Nature Reserve, St Aidans and Fairburn Ings RSPB reserve all lie alongside the Aire.

== Navigation ==
The Aire is navigable upstream to Leeds and downstream has a navigable section into the Aire &amp; Calder Navigation, with navigable access to other canals and waterways. Crown Point in Leeds is listed as the furthest west that can be reached by boat, though the limit is a headroom of . The weir that straddles Crown Point is a listed structure that was constructed in medieval times and first documented in 1636.

Canoeing and rowing are popular sports on the river with two clubs (the Bradford and Bingley Canoe Club and the Bradford Amateur Rowing Club) having landings on the river. Canoeing can be carried out on most parts of the river, with the two clubs having navigable sections protected by weirs next to their landings.

== Leeds flood alleviation scheme==
In October 2017 at Crown Point near Leeds city centre and Knostrop two movable weirs, the first in the UK, were installed in the first phase of a two phase plan to reduce floods. Reducing the height of the weir, by deflating a &#x27;bladder&#x27; has the potential to reduce flood levels by up to one metre upstream. The Knostrop weir was operated during the 2019 England floods. A 600m stretch of land, Knostrop Cut island, was removed allowing the river and canal to merge creating additional flood water capacity. Adrian Gill, area flood risk manager at the Environment Agency said, &quot;The scheme has reduced the risk of flooding to 3,000 homes, 500 business and 300 acres of development land south-east of Leeds Train Station to Woodlesford&quot;.

Phase two will use natural flood management techniques to help slow the flow, helping to protect a further 1,048 homes and 474 businesses. Work on phase two, designed to provide a one-in-100 year level of protection, will take place on an 8 km stretch upstream of Leeds station starting in late 2019. A pilot scheme, costing £500,000 is underway (in November 2019). If additional funding can be secured the flood plain near Calverley will be used for water storage providing a one-in-200 year level of protection.

<text>Living Colour is an American hard rock band from New York City, formed in 1984. The band consists of guitarist Vernon Reid, lead vocalist Corey Glover, drummer Will Calhoun and bassist Doug Wimbish who replaced Muzz Skillings in 1992. Their music is influenced by heavy metal, funk, jazz, hip hop, punk, and alternative rock. The band&#x27;s lyrics range from the personal to the political, including social commentary on racism in the United States.

Living Colour has released six studio albums. The band rose to fame with their debut album &quot;Vivid&quot; in 1988. Although they scored several hits, Living Colour is best known for their signature song &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990 and has been consistently used as the entrance theme for professional wrestler CM Punk since 2011. They were named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, and won their second Grammy Award for their follow-up album &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot; (1990). Their third album, &quot;Stain&quot; (1993), was also well received by music critics. After disbanding in 1995, Living Colour reunited in late 2000, and has since released three more studio albums: &quot;Collideøscope&quot; (2003), &quot;The Chair in the Doorway&quot; (2009) and &quot;Shade&quot; (2017). The band has been working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Shade&quot;.

==History==

===Early years (1984–1986)===
British-born guitarist Vernon Reid had formed several bands in the years before forming Living Colour in New York in 1984, using the British spelling of &quot;colour&quot;. Reid assembled several bands under the name Vernon Reid&#x27;s Living Colour from 1984 to 1986. Reid was well known on the downtown New York jazz scenes because of his tenure in Ronald Shannon Jackson&#x27;s Decoding Society.

Early band members included bassists Alex Mosely, Jerome Harris and Carl James, drummers Greg Carter, Pheeroan akLaff and J. T. Lewis, keyboardist Geri Allen, and vocalists D. K. Dyson and Mark Ledford, with Reid occasionally singing lead vocals himself. The band&#x27;s sound was vastly different from the songs later in their significant label recordings. Material from this period included instrumental jazz/funk workouts, politically pointed punk rock burners, experimental excursions via Reid&#x27;s guitar synth, and an early version of the song &quot;Funny Vibe&quot;, which was reworked for their debut album &quot;Vivid&quot;.

===Mainstream success (1986–1991)===

In 1986 a stable lineup was formed, consisting of vocalist/actor Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun (who had graduated with honors from Berklee College of Music). After hiring managers Jim Grant and Roger Cramer, the band hired prodigy lighting designer Andy Elias in November 1986 to strengthen their live shows with explosive visual productions. The band became experienced at touring and performed regular gigs at the club CBGB. Around this time, their career also benefited from Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger&#x27;s involvement. Jagger&#x27;s interest in Living Colour was piqued when Vernon Reid auditioned for the album &quot;Primitive Cool&quot;; Jagger then arranged to see them live at CBGBs. Jagger went on to produce two of their demos. His endorsement encouraged major record labels to renew their interest in Living Colour, resulting in a recording contract with Epic Records. Interviewed in 2018, Vernon Reid looked back on the deal as a bittersweet triumph; &quot;We had to get the co-sign from a person who literally embodied what rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is, the fact that he had to come see us, and dig us, for us to get at the back of the line is crazy.&quot;

&quot;Vivid&quot;, released on May 3, 1988, gathered sales momentum when, later that year, MTV began playing the video for &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;. The album reached #6 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. On April 1, 1989, the band performed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Four months later, the band gained further exposure as an opening act, along with Guns N&#x27; Roses, for The Rolling Stones&#x27; Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour.

In 1990, the band&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot;, featured songs in a variety of musical contexts; jazz fusion, punk rock, Delta blues, hip hop (cameos by Queen Latifah and Doug E. Fresh), funk, thrash metal, jive, and hints of electronica were all represented. The album reached #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. Other guests included Maceo Parker and Little Richard.

In 1991, Living Colour joined the inaugural Lollapalooza tour, and released an EP of outtakes entitled &quot;Biscuits&quot;.

===Second lineup and breakup (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Skillings left the band and was replaced by Doug Wimbish. This new lineup released their third full-length album, &quot;Stain&quot;, in March 1993. The album reached #26 in the U.S., a further drop since its debut. Despite retaining their strong fan base, Living Colour disbanded in January 1995 after failing to settle on common musical goals during their fourth studio album sessions. Four of these tracks were included on the compilation &quot;Pride&quot;. Following the breakup, individual band members released a variety of solo efforts.

===Reunion and subsequent events (2000–present)===
Living Colour re-formed on December 21, 2000, at CBGB as a gig billed &quot;Head»Fake w/ special guests&quot;. Head»Fake was the current drum and bass project headed by Calhoun and Wimbish. Glover was on the bill to sing a few songs, and Reid came on after three songs. The reunion was followed by the release of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Collideøscope&quot;, in 2003, their first album not to chart in the United States, although it was critically praised. In 2005, Sony Records released &quot;Live from CBGB&#x27;s&quot;, a live album recorded on December 19, 1989, as well as another best-of compilation, &quot;Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour&quot;, with songs from &quot;Vivid&quot; to &quot;Collideøscope&quot;.
On September 22, 2006, Skillings joined the band for the first time in fourteen years when they played at a private party that drummer Jack DeJohnette threw for his wife, Lydia. Wimbish could not come back from his base in London to play for the event, so Skillings agreed to take over for the special private event.

The band performed a week-long European Tour starting on December 12, 2006. In May 2007, the band released their first live DVD – &quot;On Stage At World Cafe Live&quot;. On July 11, 2008, the band performed at the 1980s hard rock-themed Rocklahoma festival at Pryor, Oklahoma. Once again, Skillings performed with them in August 2008 for a Black Rock Coalition Band of Gypsys tribute in Harlem. They performed &quot;Them Changes&quot; and &quot;Power of Soul&quot;.

On October 25, 2008, MVD Audio and CBGB Records released &quot;CBGB OMFUG MASTERS: August 19, 2005 The Bowery Collection&quot;, a soundboard collection of songs from the Save CBGB&#x27;s benefit show. On November 25, 2008, Inakustik and MVD released &quot;The Paris Concert&quot;, a DVD recorded at New Morning, in Paris, France, during their 2007 European Tour. The band released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Chair in the Doorway&quot;, on September 15, 2009, on Megaforce Records. The album sold approximately 2,800 copies in its first week and landed at #161 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This was the band&#x27;s first album to chart since &quot;Stain&quot; in 1993. The band toured the world in support of the record.

In 2013, Living Colour performed &quot;Cult of Personality&quot; live during CM Punk&#x27;s entrance at WrestleMania 29 for his match against The Undertaker.

On July 2, 2014, Living Colour announced on their official website that they were putting the finishing touches on their upcoming sixth album &quot;Shade&quot;, which was released on September 8, 2017. &quot;&quot;Shade&quot; is the sound of a band coming to terms with its shadows and light, From the blue pulpit of Robert Johnson to the mean red streets of Brooklyn to the golden lure of Hollywood, &quot;Shade&quot; is the next chapter of a unique American journey,&quot; Reid stated on the official website. The album includes ten originals and three covers: Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Preachin&#x27; Blues&quot;, The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot; and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; available on CD, MP3, and vinyl.

On August 19, 2016, the band released a cover of The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot; from an upcoming EP entitled &quot;Mixtape&quot; which was released on September 9. It features appearances from Chuck D, Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Prodigal Sunn, and Kyle Mansa. Also in 2016, the band performed &quot;Cult of Personality&quot; on The Howard Stern Show.

By late 2018, Living Colour had begun working on new material for a possible EP or seventh full-length studio album. When asked about a month after the release of &quot;Shade&quot; if fans would have to wait another four years for the follow-up album, Reid replied, &quot;Well I don&#x27;t know about all that. It&#x27;s intriguing to be back in this cycle.&quot;

On September 2, 2022 during a performance at Rock in Rio in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, guitarist Steve Vai joined Living Colour on stage for a rendition of &quot;Cult of Personality.&quot;

The band announced on December 10, 2022 that they had entered the studio to begin recording their seventh studio album.

In 2023, the band embarked on a US tour with Extreme.

==Acclaim and legacy==
Living Colour was ranked No. 70 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

&quot;Cult of Personality&quot; was re-recorded for &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, with an updated solo, as the original masters could not be used.

In October 2006, &quot;Love Rears Its Ugly Head&quot; was ranked and voted 303 out of the 2006 songs featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; have called the band &quot;funk metal pioneers.&quot;

In early 2009, WWE used &quot;Cult of Personality&quot; in the video promoting the induction of Stone Cold Steve Austin into its Hall of Fame. Outside of his use of it in professional wrestling.

In 2011, WWE wrestler CM Punk returned with Cult of Personality as his theme song for his highly appreciated Summer of Punk run. Punk had used this song before when he used to perform for Ring of Honor. Upon joining WWE, he didn&#x27;t try to get the song as his theme because he believed that WWE won&#x27;t get a song licensed for a mid-card wrestler. He used the song for his AEW run as well between 2021 and 2023. CM Punk also entered to the song for his debut mixed martial arts bout at UFC 203 and subsequently at UFC 225 for his fight versus Mike Jackson.

In 2023 when WWE tried to license Cult of Personality again from Living Colour, Corey phoned Punk and said that they won&#x27;t go ahead with it, if the song is not for Punk. CM Punk convinced them and had the song remastered for his return.

<text>The River Spen or Spen Beck, in West Yorkshire, England is a tributary of the River Calder. It rises north of Cleckheaton, runs through Liversedge and flows into the Calder to the south of Dewsbury at Ravensthorpe. The average rainfall for the river valley of between 600–1000mm per annum when combined with the steep narrow river channel, makes the Spen susceptible to regular flooding. It is referred to in the name of the local parliamentary constituency, Batley and Spen, to account for the villages and suburbs of Batley in the Spen Valley, such as Liversedge and Gomersal. 

==Course==

The River Spen is formed at the confluence of Hunsworth Beck and Nann Hall Beck in Cleckheaton. The river flows south past industrial premises parallel to a dismantled railway line before turning south east on the outskirts of Liversedge. It continues south east through the industrial centre of the town before returning southwards along the edge of Heckmondwike. On the outskirts of Ravensthorpe, the river turns south east again before joining the River Calder.

==Natural history==

The Spen is mainly an urban waterway and has been polluted by sewage effluent and industrial waste, though levels of pollutants and mine water discharges have decreased since 1999. Heavy rain can cause pollutant levels to rise and the river suffers from tipping and urban litter.

Several non-native species of plant are found along the river including giant hogweed, Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed. Bistort, wild garlic, nettles and dandelions are found in abundance in the meadows between the conurbations.

==Leisure==

The disused railway line adjacent to the riverbank is part of the Spen Valley Greenway (National Cycle Route 66) from Dewsbury to Oakenshaw near Bradford. The greenway is home to a collection of artworks, including &quot;A Flock of Swaledale Sheep&quot;, constructed from recycled industrial scrap by Sally Matthews, and &quot;Rotate&quot; by Trudi Entwistle which comprises 40 giant steel hoops set in a circle.

<text>Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve is a protected area in West Yorkshire, England, noted for its avian biodiversity.
The reserve has recorded around 280 bird species, remarkable for an inland site in the United Kingdom. This is explained by the site being on migration routes as well as the diversity of habitats.

==History==
It was designated a local nature reserve in 1957 under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (1949). Since the late 1970s it has been managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) on behalf of the local naturalists who set it up.

==Geography==
The reserve is in the Lower Aire Valley, south and west of Fairburn, near Castleford. It includes the whole of Fairburn &amp; Newton Ings SSSI. It is also a Statutory Bird Sanctuary (one of only 10 in England) with a focus mainly on wildfowl and waders, although many other birds can be seen.

The word &quot;ings&quot; (singular &quot;ing&quot;) is of Old Norse origin and means &quot;damp or marshy land that floods&quot;, a reference to the area being flooded regularly by the River Aire. Lying alongside the River Aire, the nature reserve includes a large lake and a number of smaller lakes, ponds and dikes. The area has been the scene of industrial and mining operations for 150 years, and, although the valley floods naturally, the permanent waterbodies are the result of subsidence of former coal-mine workings, up to underground, providing habitats for wildfowl and many other birds.

The site is bordered by predominantly arable farmland to the north and east, and urban environments to the south and west. One third of the site has been developed from 26 million cubic metres of colliery spoil which have been landscaped to create a large complex of herb rich grassland, wetlands and woodland.

Habitats at Fairburn Ings include flood meadows, wet fenland, marsh and reed bed, woodland and scrub. Listed in terms of the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, the reserve contains: 
* UK BAP habitats:
**mesotrophic lakes,
**reedbed, 
**lowland meadow. 
* BAP species of these habitats include: grey partridge (&quot;Perdix perdix&quot;), European turtle dove (&quot;Streptopelia turtur&quot;), Eurasian skylark (&quot;Alauda arvense&quot;), song thrush (&quot;Turdus philatelist&quot;), Eurasian tree sparrow (&quot;Passer montanus&quot;), linnet (&quot;Carduelis cannabina&quot;), Eurasian bullfinch (&quot;Pyrrhula pyorrhoea&quot;), reed bunting (&quot;Emberiza schoeniclus&quot;), corn bunting (&quot;Milaria calandra&quot;), water vole (&quot;Arvicola terrestris&quot; ) and pipistrelle bat (&quot;Pipistrellus pippistrellus&quot;).

Birds of conservation concern of these habitats include: the black-necked grebe (&quot;Podiceps nigrocollis&quot;), garganey (&quot;Anas querquedula&quot;), Common redshank (&quot;Tringa totanus&quot;), whooper swan (&quot;Cygnus cygnus&quot;) and European golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis apricalia&quot;).

==Visitor facilities==
There is a visitor centre and five hides. Entrance to the reserve is free but there is a charge for car parking.

<doc id="150029" wikidata="Q917000" url="?curid=150029" title="River Witham">
<text>The River Witham is a river almost entirely in the county of Lincolnshire in the east of England. It rises south of Grantham close to South Witham at , passes through the centre of Grantham (where it may be closely followed using the Riverside Walk through Wyndham Park and Queen Elizabeth Park), passes Lincoln at and at Boston, , flows into The Haven, a tidal arm of The Wash, near RSPB Frampton Marsh. The name &quot;Witham&quot; seems to be extremely old and of unknown origin. Archaeological and documentary evidence shows the importance of the Witham as a navigable river from the Iron Age onwards. From Roman times it was navigable to Lincoln, from where the Fossdyke was constructed to link it to the River Trent. The mouth of the river moved in 1014 following severe flooding, and Boston became important as a port.

From 1142 onwards, sluices were constructed to prevent flooding by the sea, and this culminated in the Great Sluice, which was constructed in 1766. It maintained river levels above Boston, and helped to scour the channel below it. The land through which the lower river runs has been the subject of much land drainage, and many drains are connected to the Witham by flood doors, which block them off if river levels rise rapidly. The river is navigable from Brayford Pool in Lincoln to Boston. Its locks are at Lincoln, Bardney and the Grand/Great Sluice. Passage through the latter is restricted typically to 4-hour intervals during daylight when the tidal levels are suitable. The river provides access for boaters to the Witham Navigable Drains, to the north of Boston, and to the South Forty-Foot Drain to the south, which was reopened as part of the Fens Waterways Link, a project to link the river to the Nene flowing through the city of Peterborough. From Brayford Pool the Fossdyke Navigation links to the Trent.

==Route==
The Witham&#x27;s course, which flows to the north and then to the south-east may be the result of glaciation (and possibly isostatic rebound) redirecting older rivers. The source of the river is on high ground near South Witham, Lincolnshire, at around above ordnance datum (AOD). After briefly flowing to the east to reach South Witham, it flows generally north, passing through Colsterworth where it is crossed by the A1 road, which largely follows the line of the river to Newark on Trent. At Great Ponton, it is joined by the Cringle Brook on its left bank, and continues through Grantham, where it has already descended to AOD. After Barkston it turns to the west to pass through Marston. Foston Beck joins on the left bank, and at Long Bennington it resumes its northerly course. Beyond Claypole and near Barnby in the Willows it forms the border between Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire for about , before passing through an Army training area near Beckingham. The River Brant joins on the right bank, before it passes through North Hykeham to reach Lincoln, where it is only AOD.

The upper waters are important for agricultural water extraction, and for coarse fish such as roach, common bream and pike; small mammals like water voles, and native crayfish. A gap in the limestone scarp (see Lincolnshire Wolds) near Ancaster may represent an earlier course of the River Trent towards Boston, but is now occupied by the River Slea.

In Lincoln, the river flows into Brayford Pool and exits along a narrow channel that passes under the medieval High Bridge. The bridge not only restricts navigation due to its small size, but the volume of water that can pass through the gap is limited in times of flood. This is alleviated by the Sincil Dyke, which leaves the main channel at Bargate Weir and runs for through the industrial areas to the south of the main city centre. It used to rejoin the main channel at Stamp End, but was re-routed into the South Delph, a drainage ditch constructed by John Rennie in the early 19th century that joins the main channel below Bardney lock. The origins of the Sincil Dyke are unknown, but it is known to have been used as a drainage channel in the mid-13th century and is thought to be pre-medieval or even Roman. Parts of it were culverted in 1847 to allow the construction of Lincoln Central railway station.

From Lincoln, the river again turns first east, then south, making a cut through a belt of upland known as the Lincoln Gap. This section has also been suggested as a lower course of the Trent during and before periods of glaciation.

From Dogdyke near Coningsby to Boston, the north bank of the river was used by a section of the Great Northern Railway from Lincoln to Boston.
A long-distance footpath, the Water Rail Way, follows the course of the river from Lincoln to Boston. The path uses sections of the river towpath and abandoned railway tracks, and has been opened in stages, with the final being completed in September 2008. The path is now part of Route 1 of the National Cycle Network and features a number of sculptures along its length, each commissioned from local artists. They include Lincoln longwool sheep at Stixwould, Lincoln Red cows at Washingborough, and Lincoln curly pigs, which became extinct in 1972, at Southrey.

==History==

The name &quot;Witham&quot; seems to be extremely old, apparently predating Anglo-Saxon, Roman, and even Celtic influence. The meaning is uncertain, although one possibility is &quot;Wye-om&quot;, meaning &quot;river plain&quot;, and the river has been known as the Witham since Saxon times. However, it was known as the &quot;Grant Avon&quot; in Ancient British times, meaning &quot;divine stream&quot;, and the fact that the main town on the upper river was &quot;Grant-ham&quot; may support this. John Leland writing in the 16th century noted that it was also called the Lindis, and others referred to it by that name. The present course may be a combination of two rivers, with the upper river originally emptying into Brayford Mere, to the west of Lincoln, and draining along the course of the Fossdyke, while the Langworth River emptied into another mere to the east of Lincoln, located between Washingborough and Chapel Hill. From there, the water flowed along a tidal creek to reach the sea. There was a ridge of high ground between the two meres, and the Romans cut a channel through it as part of some drainage works.

Archaeological evidence points to river navigation as far back as the Iron Age. Artefacts such as the Iron Age Witham Shield, found in the river near Washingborough in 1826, and the Fiskerton Boat, a log boat found near Fiskerton during flood defence work in 2001 have been recovered and are on display at the British Museum in London or The Collection in Lincoln.

The Witham was an important navigation in Roman times. Lincoln (Lindum)—the meeting point of Ermine Street, joining London to York, and Fosse Way, leading to Leicester and Bath—was an important Roman fort that became one of only four colonia in Britain. Most important Roman cities were situated near navigable water, which enabled goods to be transported in bulk, but Lincoln did not possess this advantage, and so the Romans constructed the Fossdyke from Lincoln to Torksey on the River Trent, improved the River Witham from Lincoln to The Wash, and built the Car Dyke from Lincoln to the River Cam near Cambridge. The Witham thus gave Lincoln access to the east coast, while the Fossdyke gave access to the Trent and further on to the Humber.

There have been claims that the Witham was originally tidal up to Lincoln, but that seems unlikely. Prior to the construction of the Grand Sluice, the lower river was affected by tides, but the highest they normally reached was Dogdyke or Chapel Hill, and Lincoln is considerably higher than these locations, by some . Wheeler argues that it &quot;would not have been possible for the tide to flow up to Lincoln,&quot; given the present geological conditions.

Trading continued throughout the medieval period evidenced by the importance of Torksey, which was then a flourishing town, now only a small village. However, the Fossdyke needed much maintenance to keep it clear of silt. Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel, and there were inquiries in 1335, 1365 and 1518 to consider the state of the Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region to maintain it. Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes, but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways, and having finally decided it was too large a cost, James I presented the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln.

The Witham originally flowed into The Wash at Bicker Haven, where the port of Drayton was established in the Welland estuary, and it was only as a result of massive flooding in 1014 that it diverted itself to flow into The Haven at Boston. This gave rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13th centuries, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.
The river was affected by silting which restricted trade despite the construction of various sluices and barriers from 1142 onwards, when the first sluice was built below Boston. Other sluices were erected at Boston in 1500 and at Langrick in 1543, but navigation was again difficult on both the river and the Fossdyke by 1660. In 1671 an Act of Parliament was obtained for the improvement of the Navigation. In 1743, John Grundy, Sr. and his son John Grundy, Jr. were commissioned to produce a detailed survey of the river. They produced an engraved map in 1743 and a printed report, running to 48 pages, in the following year. The main recommendation was a new cut to eliminate the &quot;prodigious meandering course&quot; of the channel above Boston. Although the estimated cost of £16,200 dissuaded the landowners from taking action at the time, the report formed the basis for improvements in the 1760s.

===Canalisation===
Following meetings of Landowners held in 1752 and 1753, they asked John Grundy Jr, as his father had died in 1748, to re-evaluate his plans from 1744 and consider a plan for a &quot;Grand Sluice&quot; that had been produced by Daniel Coppin in 1745. Grundy suggested that the 1744 cut should be extended by a further into Boston, and that the sluice could then be built on the extension. The landowners moved the location of the sluice nearer to Boston, but otherwise approved his report, although no action was taken. John Grundy was again consulted in 1757, and Langley Edwards of King&#x27;s Lynn was asked to review the positioning of the sluice in 1760. The landowners then asked John Smeaton to liaise with Grundy and Edwards, and the three engineers produced a joint report in 1761, with estimates of £38,000 for drainage works and £7,400 for improvements to navigation. The report was approved, although a meeting held in January 1762 decided that the new cut should revert to the alignment suggested by Grundy in 1753. The location of the Grand Sluice would be as suggested by Edwards in 1760. Grundy produced another engraved map, and parliamentary approval for the works was obtained in June 1762.

Once the Act of Parliament was obtained, Edwards became the engineer for the project, and drew up the detailed plans, which Grundy and Smeaton checked and altered slightly, after which they had no further involvement with the scheme. Construction was started in April 1763, and the drainage element of the project, which included the sluice, was finished in 1768, having cost £42,000. Work on three locks and other work connected with navigation cost £6,000 and continued until 1771. The locks were located at Stamp End, Kirkstead and Barlings. The Grand Sluice was a major construction which maintained the height of water above Boston to near normal high tide level and had massive flood gates to cope with any tides above this. It was completed in 1766 and was effective in scouring the Haven below it and increasing silting of the river above it.

The 1762 act created the Witham Navigation Commissioners and the Witham Drainage General Commissioners, who continued to promote drainage schemes actively, creating a drainage network known as the Witham Navigable Drains that transformed much of northern Lincolnshire from fen to farming land. Today many of these channels are managed by the Witham First, Third and Fourth District Internal Drainage Boards and Upper Witham Internal Drainage Board. These four internal drainage boards reduce the flood risk to the surrounding properties, land and environment.

In 1791, as part of the campaign to promote the construction of the Horncastle Canal, the Commissioners of the River Witham asked the engineer William Jessop to assess the state of the Fossdyke Navigation and the Witham, with particular reference to the problems of navigating through Lincoln, where the channel was restricted by a medieval bridge. He proposed two solutions; the first avoided the route through the city entirely, by utilising the course of the Sincil Dyke to the south, while the second involved lowering the bottom of the channel through the Glory Hole bridge, which was only deep at normal water levels. The Commissioners had imposed a toll on all traffic passing under the bridge, but decided that a channel bypassing the city would have grave financial consequences. They opted for improving the existing channel and the work to remove the wooden floor, to lower the river bed under the bridge and to underpin its foundations was completed in 1795. The Commissioners dropped the collection of tolls at the bridge, but the amount they received from traffic passing through the locks increased as the volume of traffic grew in response to the easier passage through the bridge.

===The Grand Sluice===
When completed in 1766, Edwards&#x27; Grand Sluice consisted of three channels each wide, fitted with pointed gates on both sides, and a lock adjacent to the north bank, which could be used as an additional flood relief channel if required. The lock was originally very small, but was lengthened to its current in 1881. The pointed doors on the non-tidal side of the sluice were replaced by steel guillotine gates between 1979 and 1982.

===Improvements===

The state of the Witham had deteriorated by 1802, and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice. He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed, and the associated staunch was in danger of collapse. He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere, and also suggested that access to Boston should be through the Witham Navigable Drains, rather than the Grand Sluice, or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice, to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour. In 1803, he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt. Four years later, he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings should be removed, and replaced by one near Washingborough church. The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808, and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work, to be carried out by a company of proprietors. They could borrow £30,000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £70,000 for the navigation element. Two new locks were built, one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney, which replaced the original locks. A new channel was cut near Fiskerton, upstream of Bardney, and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was dropped. While Stamp End lock was being rebuilt, an alternative route was provided, utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph. Rennie recorded that Branston Delph, Carlton Dike, Nocton Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time. The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.

Tolls on the Witham had gradually risen as improvements had been made. £263 was raised in 1763–4, and had reached £898 by 1790. In 1819, income exceeded £4,100 for the six months from March to September, and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year. By 1826, over £180,000 had been spent on improvements, and another £40,000 was needed. However, the proprietors were still optimistic, and commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River Ancholme, but although he made two proposals, neither was implemented. Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels or in barges hauled by horses, but in March 1816, the first steam packet boat arrived on the river. It was named &quot;Witham&quot; and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson, whose yard was on Sincil Dyke. Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817, fortunately without causing injury to any of the crew or the 30 passengers, a second steam packet was operating by July 1817, and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats. During a flood in 1828, one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels. In the following year, a Lincoln man, William Pool invented a new type of paddlewheel, which resulted in the boats travelling faster, and in 1836, wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats.

Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848, 15 years after the first proposal. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build railways in the area, and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke. Under the arrangement, they would take over both navigations, and guarantee a fixed income for the proprietors. They would then merge with the London and York Railway. Both proposals had been absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (GNR) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained, but the original agreement was retained, and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £10,545 per year to the proprietors. This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years, plus five per cent. The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on mortgages amounting to £24,692 which the proprietors held, but had redeemed them by 1857. The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river, and opened on 17 October 1848.

Most of the stations were located near to the landing stages which the steam packets used, and the railway did all it could to draw passengers away from the river. This included the provision of fourth-class carriages, with fares set at a halfpenny per mile, in 1850, and by 1863, the steam packet boats had ceased operation. Freight traffic also declined, with coal passing through the Grand Sluice dropping from 19,535 tons in 1847 to 3,780 tons in 1857. Nevertheless, the railway company had to maintain the river, and in 1871, spent £5,000 on making Bardney lock deeper by at the request of the drainage commissioners. The GNR leased the navigation to the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Committee in 1882, and in 1897, by which time the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had become the Great Central Railway, they built a large warehouse beside Brayford Pool, with a transhipment dock next to it. Total traffic on the river had fallen to 18,548 tons in 1905, and averaged 5,870 tons during the years of the First World War, mainly general merchandise and agricultural produce. With the nationalisation of the waterways following the Second World War, the navigation eventually became the responsibility of British Waterways as a result of the Transport Act 1962, and since 2 July 2012 has been managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust.

==Current navigation==
Today, commercial traffic, apart from tour boats, has ceased above the port of Boston (The Haven) and only pleasure craft carry on through the lock at the Grand Sluice into the Witham. Although the lock is only long, it is possible for longer boats to pass through it at certain states of the tide. Unlike many such sea locks, the reverse-facing gates close on every tide, as the normal high tide water level is higher than the level of the river, while at low tides there is insufficient water in the Haven to allow exit from the lock. Passage is therefore restricted to a brief period approximately two hours before or after high water. It is still possible to navigate many of the drains in small vessels, and a new lock, completed in December 2008, provides entry to the South Forty-Foot Drain from below the Grand Sluice so that vessels will be able to reach the Fens without venturing out to the Wash, as part of the Fens Waterways Link.

The Witham is navigable from Brayford Wharf in Lincoln to Boston. There are two locks between Boston and Lincoln – one at Bardney and the other in Lincoln itself, the Stamp End Lock which is unusually a guillotine lock. The main obstruction to navigation is the High Bridge or Glory Hole in Lincoln, a medieval structure which is only about wide and high at normal river levels. In times of flood it is unnavigable. The bridge spans the river for , and consists of an arch built in c1160, with extensions added in 1235, 1540 to 1550 and 1762/3. It is the only British bridge which still has secular medieval buildings standing on it, and is believed to be the second oldest masonry arch bridge in the country. It is currently a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I Listed Building.

There are traffic lights on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, which are used to indicate the state of the river in times of flood. Green indicates that flows are low or normal, and boats can proceed along this stretch. Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates that flows are very high and boats must not use the section.

===Connecting waterways===
There are a number of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are protected by flood doors. These consist of a single pair of mitre gates that are designed to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain. Several of these are navigable to the more adventurous boater. The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau, which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford. At Antons Gowt, a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains, a system of drainage ditches which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston. Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth, and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils, the Inland Waterways Association, the Environment Agency, Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Witham system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, physical modification of the channel for land drainage, and run-off from agricultural and rural land. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

In March 2018, the river suffered the worst incidence of pollution ever recorded in Lincolnshire, when Omex Agriculture released ammonia into the water. It resulted in over 100,000 fish dying between Bardney and the Wash, for which the company was given a remediation notice as defined by the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2015. They must carry out a range of improvements to the river to ensure that its habitat is restored. Once the ammonia had been flushed out, 1.5 million fish larvae and 70,000 roach and bream were released into the river. The remediation notice was only the second to be issued since the legislation was introduced.

<text>The River Welland is a lowland river in the east of England, some long. It drains part of the Midlands eastwards to The Wash. The river rises in the Hothorpe Hills, at Sibbertoft in Northamptonshire, then flows generally northeast to Market Harborough, Stamford and Spalding, to reach The Wash near Fosdyke. It is a major waterway across the part of the Fens called South Holland, and is one of the Fenland rivers that were laid out with washlands. There are two channels between widely spaced embankments with the intention that flood waters would have space in which to spread while the tide in the estuary prevented free egress. However, after the floods of 1947, new works such as the Coronation Channel were constructed to control flooding in Spalding, and the washlands are no longer used solely as pasture, but may be used for arable farming.

Significant improvements were made to the river in the 1660s, when a new cut with 10 locks was constructed between Stamford and Market Deeping, and two locks were built on the river section below Market Deeping. The canal section was known as the Stamford Canal, and was the longest canal with locks in Britain when it was built. The river provided the final outlet to the sea for land drainage schemes implemented in the seventeenth century, although they were not completely successful until a steam-powered pumping station was built at Pode Hole in 1827. Navigation on the upper river, including the Stamford Canal, had ceased by 1863, but Spalding remained an active port until the end of the Second World War.

The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.

Wildlife in the river varies along its length, the faster headwaters being a habitat for trout and the slower lower reaches for perch. The estuary conditions and flat landscapes beyond Fosdyke favour wading birds and migratory species.

==Geography==
The River Welland, with its tributaries, forms a river system with a catchment area of . Within this area, of waterway are designated as &quot;main river&quot;, and are therefore managed for flood control by the Environment Agency under the River Welland Catchment Flood Management Plan (CFMP). Of this total, the below Spalding are tidal, and have sea walls to protect the adjacent land from flooding, while are fresh water, but run through low-lying land, and are therefore embanked. Within the catchment area, are below sea level, and would be flooded without such defences.

The basin runs in a broadly south-west to north-east direction, with an extension to the north around the West Glen and East Glen rivers. The underlying geology consists of Lias clays at the western end of the catchment, with Lincolnshire limestone in the centre, including the valleys of the Glen. The eastern third is mostly alluvial soils, and it is this part that relies on artificial pumping to prevent flooding. Rainfall over the area varies between per year, which is quite light, and because the land is efficiently drained during the winter months, there are few reserves, making the area prone to drought in the summer months.

For much of its length the Welland forms the county boundary between Northamptonshire and Leicestershire or Rutland, and lower down between Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.

==Course==

The Welland rises in the Hothorpe Hills in the parish of Sibbertoft, Northamptonshire and it issues at Spring Croft, Church Street. Sibbertoft sits astride one of the principal watersheds in England. Within , the small stream forms the border between Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. It flows westwards, before looping round, passing through the grounds of Hothorpe Hall in Theddingworth, now a conference centre, to flow generally eastwards through Lubenham to Market Harborough. One of the driveways to Thorpe Lubenham Hall is carried over the river by an early nineteenth century ashlar bridge which is a Grade II listed structure. To the east of Lubenham, the river passes Old Lubenham Hall, part of an H-plan house built in the late sixteenth century and modified in the early eighteenth century. King Charles I is believed to have stayed there before the Battle of Naseby. Three arms of a square moat surround the house, and the site is a scheduled ancient monument.

===Market Harborough to Stamford===
The county border leaves the river on the west side of Market Harborough, as the town is wholly in Leicestershire, and picks it up again on the east side. The River Jordan joins the Welland in the centre of Market Harborough, flowing northwards to the railway station. Langton Brook and Stonton Brook join from the west near Welham. The county border meanders from side to side across relatively straight sections of the river, suggesting that the channel has been engineered. A three-arched bridge, built in 1881 of fine ashlar masonry, with a causeway to the south, carries the Welham to Weston by Welland road over the river, while a four-arched bridge dating from the early nineteenth century carries the Ashley to Medbourne road. Macmillan Way, a long-distance footpath, crosses on its way from Abbotsbury in Dorset to Boston, Lincolnshire. Medbourne Brook joins from the north, after which the river approaches a dismantled railway and is joined by the Stoke Albany Brook, approaching from the south. The river remains on the south side of the railway, while the county border follows a meandering course to the north of it, but rejoins the river near the Bringhurst to Cottingham road. The bridge over the river is plain, but to the north of it is an eighteenth-century causeway, some long, which is made of stone and pierced by seven large arches and numerous smaller arches for drainage pipes. The causeway has two large semi-circular passing places on its western side.

The Welland passes to the north of Corby near Rockingham, and then to the south of Caldecott, where it becomes the county border between Northamptonshire and Rutland, and the Eye Brook, which has been dammed to form the Eyebrook Reservoir, joins from the north. As it flows past Harringworth, the river forms two channels, with the county border following the smaller, northern channel. It is crossed by the Welland Viaduct, with its 82 brick arches, which was completed in 1879, and carries the Oakham to Kettering Line over the valley. Apart from viaducts carrying suburban lines into London, it is the longest railway viaduct to be built in Britain. Uppingham Brook flows eastwards from Uppingham to join on the north bank, and the Jurassic Way long-distance footpath crosses the river at Turtle Bridge. This probably dates from the fourteenth century, although it was widened in 1793, and a parapet has been added subsequently. On the road from Barrowden to Wakerley, there is a medieval bridge with five pointed arches, which was widened in the eighteenth century. Fineshade Brook flows from the south to join the river near Duddington, where there is a well-known mill building of earliest known date 1664. A limestone ashlar bridge with four arches crosses the river, dating from the fifteenth century but widened in 1919. After the river passes under a railway bridge at Ketton, its flow is swelled by the River Chater. The county border again leaves the river to the west of Stamford while below the town the river forms the border between Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.

===Stamford to Spalding===
Just before Stamford, the Great North Road, now labelled the A1, crosses the river, and a pumping station on the north bank at Stamford Meadows has pumped large quantities of water to the Rutland Water reservoir since its construction in 1975. Stamford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded so the Roman Ermine Street crossed the Welland there. The A16 road crosses the river by a three-arched stone bridge designed by Edward Browning in 1845. Below it, Albert Bridge is made of iron with stone piers, and was erected by Stamford Town Council in July 1881, to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood. Beyond Stamford, the river passes the site and ruins of the Benedictine St Leonard&#x27;s Priory. Hudd&#x27;s Mill marks the point at which the Stamford Canal left the river. The present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771. The River Gwash, which the canal crossed on the level, joins from the north, and the remains of the canal follow the river on its north bank. Below Uffington, the county border follows the old course of the river, first to the south to Tallington and then to the north, while the main course now flows along the Maxey Cut to Peakirk. The old course consists of two streams, fed by sluices from the Maxey Cut, which meander to The Deepings. The eastern stream supplied power to Lolham and Maxey mills, while the western stream did the same for Tallington Mill, which dates from around 1700, West Deeping mill, and Molecey&#x27;s mill, which still retains its seventeenth-century undershot waterwheel, modified in the 19th century to Poncelet&#x27;s improved design, and the only surviving waterwheel of its type in Lincolnshire. At the western edge of Market Deeping the two streams join, and they are also joined by the Greatford Cut, which has carried the diverted waters of the West Glen river since the early 1950s.

This section is crossed by King Street, which follows the course of a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the original channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the county&#x27;s involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth-century stone rubble arched bridge carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. Another pair of early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings, carry the road over the northernmost channel.

The bridge at Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, and is a Grade II* listed stone structure with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit to the edge of Spalding, the river is laid out with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These washlands were designed to be flooded &quot;in extremis&quot;, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.

===Spalding to Fosdyke Bridge ===
Beyond the river banks, much of the fertile arable land is composed of marine silt, which suits the bulb-growing for which Spalding is famous. The commercial growing of bulbs was pioneered in the 1880s, with the first large-scale tulip fields introduced by Sam Culpin in 1907. At its peak in 1939, there were of bulb fields, and 3000 tons of flowers were exported through Spalding railway station. Tulips were grown on around in 1965, but this had reduced to less than by 1999.

Passing through Spalding, where most of the flow is diverted through the Coronation channel, the town is protected by Marsh Road sluice and a sea lock to the east. Below the town, it is approached by Vernatt&#x27;s Drain, which runs parallel to the river carrying water pumped from Deeping Fen, and is crossed by the A16 road bridge. Nearby is Pinchbeck Marsh Pumping Station, which houses the last beam engine and scoop wheel to be used in the Fens for land drainage. It was built in 1833, and ran until 1952, when it was replaced by electric pumps. It now forms part of a museum of land drainage run by the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, in partnership with South Holland District Council. Vernatt&#x27;s Drain passes through a sluice to join the river, while the sluice that protects the entrance to the River Glen is navigable, to allow boats to reach Tongue End, some upstream from its mouth. There are pumping stations for Sea Dike and Lords Drain, and the outfalls of the Risegate Eau and Five Towns drainage channels before the final bridge at Fosdyke is reached.

===Fosdyke Wash===
After passing Fosdyke Bridge the river passes into Moulton Marsh where it is joined by the Holbeach River, the river from this point then enters a area of extensive salt marshes with estuary like features which make up what is known as &#x27;The Fosdyke Wash&#x27; at the very south-western edge of The Wash where the salt marshes becomes indistinguishable from the sea and from here the river quickly loses the traditional characteristics of being a river as the main river banks move away from the river itself at this point to become the main sea embankments and this leaves the river without a distinguishable mouth as it merely becomes a deep tidal channel known as the “Welland Outfall”, where it finally flows into The Wash itself in a area known as the &#x27;Boston Deeps&#x27; at Tabs Head, where it also meets the mouth of The Haven close to the RSPB nature reserve at Frampton Marsh.

===Points on course===








==History==

The origin of the name for the river is unknown but appears to be Pre-English. In Old English the form was &quot;Weolud&quot; and may have changed to the Middle English form due to folk-etymology or Scandinavian influence. The Welland (&quot;Weolud&quot;) is first mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for 921 AD.

Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen during the reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong embankment to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king&#x27;s liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.
The river was one of the earlier rivers to be granted an act of Parliament for improvements, to allow navigation to Stamford. The (13 Eliz. 1. c. &quot;1&quot;) was granted in the reign of Elizabeth I in 1571, and detailed how Stamford had prospered as a result of the river, but also stated that mills built between Stamford and Deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable, for they had diverted the water. Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this. There is no evidence that any work was carried out under the terms of the act.

The powers were revived in 1620, when Stamford Corporation was given permission by the Commission of Sewers to build a new artificial cut, which would run from the eastern edge of Stamford near Hudd&#x27;s Mill, to Market Deeping, where it would rejoin the river. The decision was ratified in 1623 by a grant of James I, and the corporation expected to have the work completed by 1627. However, they were unable to find a suitable contractor to carry out the work, and failed to reach agreement on terms with David Cecil in 1636, and two other potential contractors after that. Finally in 1664, an alderman from Stamford called Daniel Wigmore took the job. He built the cut and 12 locks, which included the High Lock and the Low Lock on the river at Deeping St James, at a cost of £5,000. In return for his expenditure, he was given the lease of the tolls for the next 80 years, for which he paid a rent of one shilling (five pence). The cut, known as the Stamford Canal, is one of the earliest post-Roman canals in England. It opened in 1670, around 100 years before the start of the Industrial Revolution which brought about the &quot;golden age for canals&quot; in Britain. When built, it was the longest canal with locks in Britain, and was very busy with barges carrying flour, malt, coal, timber and limestone.

The people of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James, together with other villages along the river presented a petition to Elizabeth I, requesting that the fens should be drained, as the banks of the river and of the neighbouring Glen were in a poor state of repair. They suggested that Thomas Lovell should undertake the work, which he did, at a cost of £12,000, for which he received of the land which was reclaimed as a result of the work. Unrest in the early 1600s resulted in most of the works being destroyed, but in 1632 a group of adventurers led by the Earl of Bedford were granted permission to drain Deeping Fen, South Fen and Crowland. The work included making the Welland deeper and wider from Deeping St James to its outfall beyond Spalding, and the construction of side drains. These included a drain running from Pode Hole to below Spalding, which is still known as Vernatt&#x27;s Drain, after one of the adventurers called Sir Philibert Vernatti. Although declared completed in 1637, efficient drainage would have to wait until the construction of Pode Hole pumping station in 1827.

At Crowland the river used to split into two channels, one broadly following the present course of the river, and the other joining the old South Ea to reach the River Nene near Wisbech. Dugdale, writing in 1662, described the Spalding channel as &quot;a most slow course&quot;. The river no longer flows through Crowland, but the unique triangular Trinity Bridge, which spanned the junction, remains in the centre of the town.

Spalding had been a port from a time before any of the river improvements were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river during the reign of Henry III, for they claimed that here it was part of the sea. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.

===Deeping Fen===
The drainage of Deeping Fen was again addressed when the Draining Deeping Fen Act 1664 (16 &amp; 17 Cha. 2. c. 11) awarded the Earl of Manchester and others of land in return for the drainage works. They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the river, to ensure that both the Welland and the Glen were kept clean and free-flowing, and to ensure that no tolls were charged for navigation on any part of the river below East Deeping. The inadequacy of the outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion that the only way to improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of scouring sluices on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt&#x27;s drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly in payment for the work. He sold one-third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730. Cowbit sluice on the Welland had six wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel. At high tide, water was penned in Cowbit Wash, between banks which were set well back from the main channel. The bed of the river below the sluice was loosened by dragging wooden rollers with iron spikes over it. At low tide, the sluice gates were opened, and the flow scoured out the silt for some downstream. A navigation lock was constructed beside the sluice, so that vessels could still gain access to the river above. Perry died in February 1733, and was buried in Spalding churchyard. The lock lasted until it was removed by the Welland commissioners in 1813.

Perry was succeeded by John Grundy, Sr., who published a paper in 1734 on flow in open drains. He calculated theoretic flow rates, and then used observation in the field to modify the results. He oversaw a programme of repairs to the Deeping Bank, which ran for along the north and west side of the river, while John Scribo was employed to do the same for the Country Bank, which ran for on the south and east. Grundy made the river deeper above Spalding, and also constructed a sluice and reservoir at the mouth of the Glen. The reservoir covered and provided water to scour the channel below the sluice. His son, John Grundy, Jr., took over after the death of his father in 1748, and spent nearly £10,000 on bank repairs between then and 1764. He rebuilt Perry&#x27;s sluice soon after 1750, with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent the tide moving upstream, and rebuilt the navigation lock in 1754. After 1764, Thomas Hogard became the surveyor of works, but Grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer.

Hogard devised a scheme to cut a new channel from the junction of the Welland and the Glen to Wyberton, on the estuary of the River Witham below Boston. At the end of the cut, there would be a huge sluice and a navigation lock. The Adventurers asked Thomas Tofield for a second opinion, who suggested a shorter cut from Spalding to Fosdyke. They requested help from Grundy, who proposed a cut to Fosdyke, and that the outfall of Vernatt&#x27;s drain should be moved downstream. Improvements to the drain were carried out under an act of Parliament, the Fen Drainage Act 1774 (14 Geo. 3. c. 16) obtained in 1774, and another act of Parliament, the Lincoln Drainage, etc. Act 1794 (34 Geo. 3. c. 102), was obtained in 1794 to sanction the Wyberton cut, although the work was not carried out, and Grundy&#x27;s cut was built under a new act of Parliament of 1801.

Several prominent civil engineer considered the problems of Deeping Fen and the river outfall at the end of the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the Deeping Fen Act 1801. The channel above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the fen. One of Rennie&#x27;s recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act of Parliament in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage Deeping Fen until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland &amp; Deepings Internal Drainage Board.

===The Outfall===
Plans to re-route the outfall along a new channel which would meet the River Witham at The Scalp, near Boston, were authorised in 1794, but the money could not be raised at the time, due to the financial crisis caused by the French Wars. Grundy&#x27;s shorter channel had been finished by 1810, improving both drainage and navigation. James Walker reported in 1835 on further improvements, making the recommendation that the river below Spalding should be constrained between high banks, so that the scouring action of the water would dredge its own channel. Rather than excavating, which he estimated would cost £70,000, he suggested using fascines made of thorn branches, around which silt would be deposited. Such a scheme would only cost £13,000, and the work went on for many years. The effects of the embankments had resulted in the bed of the river below Fosdyke being around lower by 1845. In 1867, the River Welland Outfall Act enabled the trustees to raise money to repair the walls where the tide had washed away some of the fill behind the fascines. A dredger was employed between 1889 and 1890, which had been invented by a Mr Harrison, the superintendent of works.

With the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief engineer for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. &amp; C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed at the same time to exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the risk of flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013, and by 2020 had completed 36 enhancement projects.

==Navigation==

The river as far as Stamford was used by the Romans for navigation, as it formed part of a system including the Car Dyke, which ran along the western edge of the Fens and crossed the river near the modern Folly River. Navigation to Stamford was improved by the canal. Boats used on the canal were small lighters, around wide, capable of carrying from seven to fourteen tons, and normally worked in trains of four vessels. With the arrival of the railways, river trade declined. The Midland Railway reached Peterborough in 1846, and opened their line to Melton Mowbray, passing through Stamford, in 1848. Carriage of coal on the upper river stopped, and the locks deteriorated. By April 1863, all traffic had ceased, and Stamford Corporation tried to sell the line at auction, but failed because their ownership of it was disputed.

Trade on the lower river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was simultaneously silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased by the end of the Second World War.

A water taxi service was launched in Spalding in July 2005. Its route is from just off Spalding&#x27;s High Street upstream along the river, turning onto the Coronation Channel, and going to Springfields Outlet Shopping &amp; Festival Gardens, and back.

Vessels of and drawing can still proceed along the estuary at high water, and can travel inland as far as Fulney lock. They cannot pass through the lock as it is only and at normal summer water levels, can accommodate boats drawing . The river is officially navigable to the point at which the Folly River joins it, but the length of boats allowed on this section is restricted to long, considerably less than the lock dimensions would suggest. Navigation on this stretch was severely restricted by Four Mile Bar footbridge, which provided just of headroom, but this was increased when a new single-span arched bridge was installed in early 2007 by the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership. Smaller boats such as canoes, which can be carried around obstructions, can continue up to Stamford, but they must use the old course of the river through the Deepings, rather than the Maxey cut.

Below Spalding, there were no restrictions on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, to comply with the provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it to be replaced by a fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original Act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. Thus, the lock can only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.

The principle of there being no tolls for use of the river was established by the 1664 Act of Parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 Act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an Act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. From there to the Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.

==Wildlife==
In its upper reaches the river supports a wild brown trout population and the occasional grayling. Chub and perch dominate the middle reaches around Stamford, with pike, perch, zander, roach, bream, rudd, ruffe, gudgeon and eels inhabiting the lower lengths around Spalding.

A collaboration between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency has resulted in the construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.

Large numbers of swans and geese use the river around Crowland, and out to sea. Smaller populations of each can be seen around the Stamford Meadows, and further upstream.

In 2015, a grey seal found its way from the Wash up the river and spent a few weeks sleeping in gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further downstream in Spalding as it eventually made its way back to the sea.

On the south bank of the river below Fosdyke bridge, the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have established Moulton Marsh nature reserve, on a strip of land where soil was excavated to raise the banks in 1981. Habitat is provided by some broad-leafed woodland, covering , several salt-water lagoons and tidal scrapes, covering , and of saltmarsh. A variety of birds can be seen, including little grebe and water rail, which spend the winter on the lagoons, while the scrapes, which consist of shallow pools and muddy shorelines, are visited by common redshank and little egret.

Between the river mouth and the River Witham, a large expanse of saltmarsh provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, Eurasian whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Welland was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Witham () is a town and civil parish in the Braintree district, in the county of Essex, England. In the 2011 census, it had a population of 25,353. It is twinned with the town of Waldbröl, Germany. Witham stands on the Roman road between the cities of Chelmsford ( south-west) and Colchester ( north-east). The River Brain runs through the town and joins the River Blackwater on the outskirts.

==History==

===Early history===
Excavations by Essex County Council Field Archaeological unit at the recent Maltings Lane development discovered evidence of Neolithic occupation at Witham, including human remains and several trackways across ancient marsh. Excavations of the Witham Lodge (Ivy Chimneys) area of the town in the 1970s unveiled remains of a Roman temple as well as a pottery kiln. This would have been alongside the main Roman road from Colchester to London and used as a stopover point on the long journey. Another notable find during the excavation was a votive offering pool in the grounds of the temple, containing several artefacts that would have been offered to the gods.

In 913, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Edward the Elder marched from Hertford to reconquer Essex, and encamped in Witham on his route to set up a base at Maldon. Witham&#x27;s position on the Roman road in relation to the major Viking army based at Colchester was the most likely reason for this, and it would have effectively cut Essex in two.

The place-name Witham is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 913 (mentioned above), where it appears as &quot;Witham&quot;. It also appears as &quot;Witham&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name may mean &#x27;village in a bend&#x27;. Another suggestion is that the name is part Brythonic (probably from a cognate of Gwydd = &quot;Woods&quot; in modern Welsh) and &quot;ham&quot;, a very common Saxon village designation.

The manor of Witham was given to the Knights Templar in 1148. To the north of the current town is Cressing Temple which was the earliest foundation of Templar lands in Britain, built over 700 years ago. The manor of Witham was held by the Church after the dissolution of the Templars in England in . The manor was sold to Sir John Southcott in , he was a prominent Judge and Politician from Devon. His heirs held the manor for almost two centuries, until 1648 when the Southcott family had their lands destroyed for supporting the royalist cause in the English Civil War.

The town as it is now started life on &quot;Chipping Hill&quot;, which is the location of St Nicolas&#x27;s Church. As the years went by, the hamlet grew to become &quot;Witham&quot; and St Nicolas&#x27;s Church of England Church (a unique spelling) serves a congregation of around 150 people each Sunday. During the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century, Admiral Sir William Luard was the town&#x27;s most prominent citizen, a resident of Chipping Hill and a founder and patron of St Nicolas&#x27;s Church. His funeral cortège through the town in 1910 was witnessed by thousands.

In the 18th century, Witham briefly enjoyed a period as an affluent spa town after the discovery of a mineral-bearing spa by a Dr Taverner. Witham was also a centre of the wool trade until the decline of the industry in the late 17th century.

===Witham rail crash===
Witham railway station was the scene of a serious accident 09:27 on 1 September 1905. The London Liverpool Street-to-Cromer 14-coach express derailed whilst travelling at speed through the station. Ten passengers and a luggage porter were killed when several of the carriages somersaulted on to the platforms causing considerable damage to the rolling stock and the station. Seventy-one passengers were seriously injured. It remains to this day the worst loss of life in a railway accident in Essex.

In 2005, an opportunity to commemorate the centenary was missed and the incident is now largely forgotten. Ben Sainty, a signalman, whose quick action averted the next train hitting the wreckage, has a road named after him in the town, Ben Sainty Court.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The town expanded greatly in the late 1960s and 1970s, when the Greater London Council built three large council estates on the west and north sides of the town, and a smaller one to the south, for families from London to move to as part of the &quot;New Town and Expanded Town overspill policy&quot; of that time. A famous one-time resident of the town was the author Dorothy L. Sayers, whose statue stands opposite the town&#x27;s library, which is a short distance from the author&#x27;s house. The library stands on the site of the old Whitehall cinema, which closed in the late 1970s and which was itself a conversion of the White Hall country house.

Witham has grown in size after the development of the Maltings Lane estate to the south of the town between 2002 and 2003. This was followed, in 2012, by the moving of Chipping Hill Primary School from its old premises in Church Street to a new-build in Owers Road. The development of this area has continued, including the opening of an Aldi superstore in 2015.

Approved developments in this period include the reconstruction of both the New Rickstones Academy and the Maltings Academy, completed in 2011; the Marston&#x27;s pub and restaurant on Gershwin Boulevard, completed in 2013 with the adjacent Seymour House day nursery; the refurbishment and opening of a Morrisons store in the old premises of the Jack &amp; Jenny pub in 2014; and the newly-built Witham Leisure Centre on Spinks Lane, replacing Bramston Sports Centre, completed in 2014.

==Transport==
The town is served by Witham railway station, situated on the Great Eastern Main Line operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. Trains take approximately 40–45 minutes to reach . The station is also the junction for a branch line to Braintree. Another branch line went from Witham to Maldon, but this has now been dismantled having been closed to passengers in 1964.

Witham is situated on the A12 trunk road between Chelmsford and Colchester, which was originally a Roman road from London to Colchester. The A12 used to run in a straight line through the middle of the town, but a by-pass now completely avoids the town.

Witham is on National Cycle Route 16.

The town has a large number of residents who commute to work in London because of its excellent transport links. This is evident by Witham railway station&#x27;s appearance within the 150 busiest railway stations in Great Britain, which would not be expected based on the town&#x27;s population alone.

==Economy and facilities==
Witham has a mainly linear town centre, focused on the high street and two shopping precincts to form a cross that bisects the high street; these are the Newlands Shopping Centre of 1970s design to the north and the Grove Centre of a 1980s brick design to the south. There are also a range of small shops, restaurants, pubs, major high-street banks and several national commercial chains. The town also has five supermarkets: Tesco in the Grove Centre, Morrisons near the railway station, Asda on Highfields Road, Aldi at the southern entrance to the town and Lidl that recently opened towards the centre of town on the old Bramston sports centre site.

A significant industrial presence remains in the town, concentrated on three industrial estates on the eastern side of the town close to the junction with the A12. There are also commercial offices located in the town centre area.

In March 2007, Crittall Windows closed its Braintree factory and returned to Witham to occupy a new factory on the Freebournes Industrial Estate. The factory Crittall moved into was built for J.L. French in 2001, but never used for production. The new Crittall factory is visible on the right hand side of the road exiting Witham towards Colchester, via the A12.

In December 2013, the financial service provider Cofunds relocated to the former Marsh building on the Grove, bringing approximately 600 jobs to the town.

==Sport and leisure==

Witham has a Non-League football club Witham Town F.C. who play at Spa Road.

There is also a rugby club situated behind the football ground.

Witham also has a hockey club formed in 1924 and is now made up of 5 men&#x27;s teams and 3 women&#x27;s teams. Witham also participates in the local mixed league as well as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s summer league and indoor league. Witham hockey club play on the astro turf across the road from Maltings Academy on Spinks Lane. The hockey club share a clubhouse with the cricket club which is situated next to the recreation ground, commonly known as the Maldon Road Park, on Maldon Road.

Leisure facilities include Benton Hall Golf and Country Club, a pool club, and a library which occupies the site of what was the town&#x27;s long-closed cinema, the Whitehall. A &quot;River Walk&quot; runs for through the town and is home to a range of wildlife. Witham Leisure Centre is located in Spinks Lane, adjacent to the former Bramston Sports Centre.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Braintree and Witham Times&quot; which publishes on Wednesdays. The &quot;Colchester Gazette&quot; also covers the town.

==Education==
There are two secondary schools in Witham, Maltings Academy and New Rickstones Academy. Maltings Academy achieved 94% A*- C GCSE grades in 2012. (51% including English and Maths) and an above national average of 99% of pupils gaining at least one GCSE in 2012. The two schools are part of the AET Academies chain. New Rickstones Academy was rated Good by Ofsted in January 2015 and Maltings Academy was rated Outstanding by Ofsted in March 2015.

The town&#x27;s primary schools are Templars, Holy Family Catholic School, Howbridge, Powers Hall, Chipping Hill (which became a primary school in September 2010), Rivenhall CoE, Elm Hall Primary, Southview, and Silver End Primary. Both Chipping Hill School and Powers Hall Junior School received Outstanding OfSTED reports in 2008.Chipping Hill was named the Top School in East Anglia by the Sunday Times. 

The Chatten free school is a special educational needs school which opened in 2021. The school provides up to 75 places to pupils from across Essex with severe, complex autism.

==Governance==
Witham is part of the Witham constituency of the House of Commons. The local Member of Parliament (MP) is the former Conservative Home Secretary Priti Patel, who was elected at the 2010 general election, becoming the first Asian female Conservative MP.

The constituency includes Hatfield Peverel, Langford, Wickham Bishops, Marks Tey, Tiptree, Tolleshunt Knights, Stanway Kelvedon, and Coggeshall. Although regarded as a safe seat for the Conservatives, Patel suffered a significant drop in vote share in the 2024 general election, going from a majority of 24,082 in the 2019 election down to 5,145.

Witham is under the jurisdiction of Witham Town Council (its parish council), Braintree District Council and Essex County Council. Witham Town Council is based at Witham Town Hall.

Witham, and parts of the Braintree district, hold one of the best recycling schemes in the UK, with compulsory recycling, reaching over 50% recycling.

On 1 October 1933 the parish of Rivenhall was abolished and merged with Witham, parts of Faulkbourne and Kelvedon were also added. Witham was an urban district from 1894 to 1 April 1974 when it became an unparished area of Braintree non-metropolitan district. On 1 April 1982 the parishes of Witham, Rivenhall and Silver End were formed from the unparished area.

<text>The River Nene ( or ) flows through the counties of Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, and Norfolk in Eastern England from its sources in Arbury Hill in Northamptonshire. Flowing Northeast through East England to its mouth at Lutton Marsh into The Wash in the North Sea, the Nene and its tributaries drain an area of about , with a population of 750,000. 

The Nene&#x27;s main tributaries include the River Ise, Wootton Brook, Willow Brook, and Harper&#x27;s Brook. At long, it is the tenth-longest in the United Kingdom, and is tidal for up to Dog-in-a-Doublet sluice, near Peterborough. 

The river forms the boundary between Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, and is navigable for , from Northampton to The Wash.

==Etymology==
Spelling of the river&#x27;s name has altered over time; it was called the &quot;Nenn&quot; or &quot;Nyn&quot; in an 1810 engraving by draughtsmen George Cole and John Roper, while the Ordnance Survey of 1885 used what has since become standard spelling, &quot;Nene&quot;. The origin and meaning of the River Nene&#x27;s name is unknown. The earliest known examples, which date back to the 10th century AD, have been linked to Indo-European root words for snow, rain, or washing, but a direct connection is purely speculative. According to the British toponymist and medieval scholar Victor Watts, &quot;The name is certainly pre-English, possibly pre-Celtic&#x27;. The same name appears in the Neen, the former name of the River Rea in Shropshire, which is retained in the hamlet of Neen Savage.

=== Pronunciation ===
The pronunciation of the river&#x27;s name varies by locality. In Northampton it is usually pronounced (), and around Peterborough it is usually pronounced (). The point at which the pronunciation of the Nene changes has been moving further inland for many years; the current edition of the nautical publisher Imray&#x27;s &quot;Map Of The River Nene&quot; suggests that it now begins at Thrapston.

==Course==
The River Nene is the tenth-longest river in the United Kingdom. From one of its sources, that near Arbury Hill, to Northampton, the river falls a total of in . For the remainder of its course, the Nene falls less than . It has a catchment area of and a mean flow of . The final from Northampton to the Wash is navigable.

The river&#x27;s most westerly source can be found near the village of Badby, near Daventry. On the eastern slopes of Arbury Hill, and in pools between Arbury Hill and Sharmans Hill, are two tributaries that converge at Dodford Mill to form the upper reaches of the Daventry Nene. The northern stream flows by the villages of Badby and Newnham to the confluence, whilst the southerly stream runs through Fawsley Park and past the village of Everdon before the confluence. From Dodford, the river passes through the village of Weedon where it flows under the main west coast railway line, the Grand Union Canal, and Watling Street. A little west of Weedon, the river converges with a further northerly tributary arising at Nenmoor Spring to the northwest of West Haddon. The river then flows towards Northampton, passing Flore and Nether Heyford, where it is joined by small streams on either bank. A little past Bugbrooke Mill, the Nene passes under the M1 motorway and falls over a weir towards Kislingbury.

Another tributary merges from the south at Kislingbury. The Nene&#x27;s course is closely followed by the Grand Union Canal&#x27;s Northampton arm at Upton Mill.

===Northampton===

At Upton Mill, another tributary, called Wootton Brook, joins the river from the south. The River Nene now approaches Northampton town from the west, passing between the suburbs of St James (locally known as Jimmy&#x27;s End), Cotton End and Far Cotton. The Nene&#x27;s third northern source, the Naseby Source or Brampton Nene, converges at the Carlsberg Brewery. This tributary flows through the north of Northampton where several streams join. Three of these streams supply water for reservoirs at Pitsford, Hollowell and Ravensthorpe, north of Northampton, before joining the Brampton Nene. At Cotton End, the Nene passes under South Bridge, then through Beckett&#x27;s Park and past the University of Northampton&#x27;s Waterside Campus, which is on the site of the former Northampton Power Station, on the south bank of the river opposite Midsummer Meadow on the north bank. Northampton Sea Cadets is based in Nunn Mills, and uses the river for the training of boating skills, following the training schemes of the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) and the British Canoe Union (BCU). A short way downstream, a weir can divert some of the Nene&#x27;s flow to supply the Nene Whitewater Centre.

The River Nene at Northampton was the location of England&#x27;s first water-powered cotton spinning mill. It was installed on the site of a former corn mill, to the south-west of the town centre, in 1742.

===Nene Valley===
From Northampton, the river flows along a broad valley, formed by the enormous amount of water released by the melting ice during the Ice Age, towards the east coast. The Nene now meanders through this wide, flat valley with flood plains, lakes, pools and mature gravel pits on either bank, a byproduct of the large glacial deposits in the valley. At Great Billing is Billing Aquadrome, a popular caravan and camping park with leisure facilities and a funfair, which is based around the river and various mature gravel pits. The park is popular with fishermen and water skiers alike. The river&#x27;s landscape is now dominated by mature gravel pit lakes. Some gravel extraction still takes place along the valley&#x27;s basin. At Cogenhoe (pronounced locally) the river passes through a watermill. The mill is a red-brick building built in the late nineteenth century, with a slate roof, from which all the machinery has been removed. Adjacent is a Mill House, built of coursed limestone rubble, and dated 1725. At Earls Barton the river again passes an area of mature gravel pit lakes, and lock gates numbers 9 and 10. Further on, the river passes through Doddington Lock No 11 and the nearby Hardwater Watermill. This watermill, mentioned in the Domesday Book, ground wheat into flour for almost 1000 years. Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, used the mill as a hiding place after escaping from Northampton Castle in 1164 and fleeing down the Nene to be sheltered by the miller before fleeing to France. The watermill ceased grinding flour after the Second World War. The present buildings date from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and have been converted into dwellings.

===Wellingborough===

The river&#x27;s course turns to the north-east, passing the town of Wellingborough on its north bank and the village of Little Irchester to the south. At Wellingborough, the river passes through Victoria Mills. Founded in 1886 by the Whitworth family, they are still run by the firm today, producing fine flours for the bakery trade. In front of the mill, there remains a jetty from the days when the river was used for transportation of goods to and from the mills. A little further on, the river is joined from the north by the River Ise. On the opposite bank are the remains of the Roman town of Irchester. The river now passes under a viaduct that carries the Midland Main Line, which links London St Pancras to Sheffield in northern England via Luton, Bedford, Kettering, Leicester, Derby and Chesterfield.

Passing Irthlingborough on its north-western bank, the Nene now flows past the demolished Nene Park, one of the former grounds of Kettering Town F.C. Further on, the river is crossed by the disused track bed of the Northampton and Peterborough Railway which was constructed in 1845. The river is now characterised by large curving meanders as it passes the villages of Little Addington, Great Addington, Woodford and Denford.

===Thrapston===
At Denford the river divides into two channels, one of which is used for navigation. The channels approach the town of Thrapston, passing under two adjacent viaducts. One carries the busy A14 trunk road; the other carries the disused railway track bed. Between the town of Thrapston and the village of Islip, the Nene is spanned by a low nine-arched bridge. Just north of Thrapston the river forms part of the of Titchmarsh Nature Reserve. The reserve, designated in 1989, consists of two lakes, a woodland, river banks and areas of grass and scrub in which some ponds have been dug. The reserve is operated by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. At Aldwincle another tributary, called Harpers Brook, joins the Nene from the north-west. Harpers Brook flows between gravel pit lagoons before converging with the river. The river flows south of Oundle passing Barnwell Country Park and Oundle Marina under a bridge of the A605 road. At , the Romans bridged the river with Ermine Street in the first century. Between Oundle marina and Peterborough the Nene falls, with navigation passing through 11 locks on the way.

===Peterborough===
Having passed among the gentle hills of Northamptonshire the river enters the rural part of the City of Peterborough, passing the Nene Valley Railway and through the Nene Park. upstream of the city centre is Woodston Wharf—the site of the old sea lock—originally the extent of the tidal River Nene until the Dog-in-a-Doublet lock at Whittlesey was opened in 1937. To the east of Peterborough city centre a branch of the river passes under the former Great Eastern Railway, now connected to the main East Coast main line and running through to Cambridge via Whittlesey and Ely. The branch terminates, for navigation, at Stanground Lock, a connection to the Middle Levels, the drainage system of the Fens through which access is possible to the River Great Ouse. Below Peterborough, the river forms the border between Cambridgeshire and Norfolk for about .

Continuing downstream leads to the &#x27;Embankment&#x27; area and after the cathedral city itself, passing through Whittlesey the landscape changes to the Nene Washes in The Fens and their vast horizons. Beyond Flag Fen the river flows under the A47 bridge at Guyhirn, through the port of Wisbech, then Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire, and it finally enters The Wash between two towers known as &quot;the lighthouses&quot;.

The Nene links the Grand Union Canal to the River Great Ouse, via the Middle Level Navigations. Much of its route has been upgraded to a wide canal with locks at regular intervals. Some sections where artificial cuts run adjacent to the course of the river are known as the &quot;Nene Navigation&quot;.

==Navigation==
The Nene is navigable from just above its junction with the Northampton Arm of the Grand Union Canal to the sea. Most leisure use is between Northampton and Peterborough, where it makes a junction with the Middle Level Navigations at Stanground Sluice, which give access to the River Ouse. There is no longer any significant commercial traffic above the Port of Wisbech.

===Above Peterborough===

The first recorded attempts to improve the upper river for navigation occurred in 1567 and 1606, when the people of Northampton commissioned surveys. In 1653, a printed pamphlet suggested that 33 locks to bypass the mills could be built for £8,000, to make the river navigable. Eventually, an act of Parliament, the &#x27; (13 Ann. c. 19) was obtained, which appointed large numbers of Commissioners, but stated that work could only proceed if any nine of them could find someone to make the entire river navigable. No-one was prepared to take on the task, although it appears from the Act that the river was navigable from Peterborough to Alwalton at the time. The act was superseded by a second act of Parliament, the &#x27; (11 Geo. 1. c. 19), which allowed the river to be improved in stages, the work to be carried out at the contractor&#x27;s expense, with the cost to be recouped from tolls. Robert Wright and Thomas Squire agreed to these terms for the section from Peterborough to the bridge at Oundle North in September 1726, and completed the work by 1730. Squire then agreed to the same terms for the next section to Thrapston in 1736, and completed it by late 1737. This part of the river was then designated as the Eastern Division.
A failure to find anyone prepared to work on the Western Division from Thrapston to Northampton resulted in a third act, the (29 Geo. 2. c. 69) being obtained, which allowed the Commissioners to borrow money to finance the work. Lenders would become proprietors of the navigation, and the work was to begin at Thrapston and extend the navigable section towards Northampton. It took the Commissioners two years to agree who should carry out the work, but on 22 June 1758, John Smith jnr from Attercliffe, Yorkshire was contracted to construct 20 pound locks, 20 horse haling bridges and various other works at a cost of £14,070. The river opened to navigation in stages over the next three years, with a great celebration being held at Northampton on 7 August 1761 when the work was completed.
The proprietors had the right to use tolls as they saw fit, and the Commissioners found that they had no powers to ensure the navigation was maintained in good order. They obtained another act of Parliament, the (34 Geo. 3. c. 85), which aimed to rectify the situation, but it was not until 1801 that Thomas Wright replied to their requests, and some repairs were made. There was little traffic and income from tolls was low, at just £488 per year between 1801 and 1804. The commissioners were also keen to see a link constructed from Northampton to the Grand Junction Canal, but the canal company argued that there was an insufficient supply of water. It was agreed that a link would be built in two halves, but that there would be of railway in the middle. When built, the canal company constructed the entire link as a railway, which opened in 1805. In a bid to get a navigable link, the Commissioners opposed the bill to build a link between the Grand Junction Canal and the Old Union Canal, but relented when they had a firm agreement that a navigable link to Northampton would be built. The link cost £35,000, was supervised by Benjamin Bevan, and was built between 1812 and 1815. It was nearly long, and dropped through 17 locks.

Tolls rose to a little over £1,000 per year, but the Commissioners decided that the canal boats damaged the locks, and all traffic had to be transferred to river barges. This order was withdrawn in 1827, but the condition of the river gradually deteriorated, and the arrival of the Blisworth to Peterborough Railway in 1845 further reduced profitability. Flooding was also a problem, but the Commissioners had no powers to act as Commissioners of Sewers, to address the problems of drainage. With serious flooding in December 1848, a public meeting was held, and a committee was elected to consider Nene drainage. The main problem was a restriction at Wisbech, and the engineer James Rendel estimated that £120,000 was required to reconstruct the river below Peterborough. The Nene Valley Drainage and Improvement Act 1852 was obtained to allow this work to be completed.

===Below Peterborough===
Below Peterborough, the river meandered to Tydd Gote, where it shared an outfall to the Wash with the River Great Ouse. Once the latter was diverted to Bishop&#x27;s Lynn in 1236, the Nene outfall deteriorated. Navigation was improved in the 1470s when Morton&#x27;s Leam, a straight channel between Peterborough and Wisbech, was constructed by Bishop Morton. It was improved in 1570 and 1631. In 1631 a sluice was built at Wisbech by Vermuyden.

Morton&#x27;s Leam was largely superseded by Smith&#x27;s Leam, a straight cut from Peterborough to Guyhirn made by the Bedford Level Corporation in 1728. In order to improve the mouth of the river, which followed a tortuous route through salt marshes, the construction of a new channel was proposed by Nathaniel Kinderley, and work started on it in 1721. It was nearly completed when Wisbech Corporation&#x27;s support turned to opposition, and they destroyed the work. The cut was eventually completed in 1773, but was not long enough to be a complete success. The Wisbech Canal, opened in 1797, joined the river at Wisbech, the canal was filled in during the 1960s.

Various proposals for improvements near Wisbech were made, notably in 1814 by John Rennie and again in 1821 by Thomas Telford, but all were opposed by Wisbech Corporation. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1827 to enable the works and Wisbech contributed £30,000 to the project. The contractors for the new cut below Wisbech were Jolliffe and Banks, who charged £149,259 for the channel. Once the old channel was dammed up, the tidal scour in the new channel was sufficient to remove silt deposits, and large volumes of stone were needed to stabilise the banks. The effects on the Port of Wisbech were immediate, with tonnage rising from in 1830 to in 1845.

The Nene Valley Drainage and Navigation Improvement Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. cxxviii) gave the commissioners wide powers to manage the river, but created an administrative structure that was too complex to be workable. With the river in a poor state, James Rendel was appointed as engineer, and began dredging the channel and raising the banks, which cost £124,000. Another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1854, to allow the Commissioners to borrow £325,000 to pay for the work. A new iron swing bridge was built in Wisbech, to replace a narrow stone bridge which restricted the flow of the river, and although it was tested on installation, it was not operated subsequently. In 1856 a very high tide came within two feet of the newly installed pilings. Dams across the river were built at Waldersea and Guyhirn, and an underwater weir was constructed below the bridge at Wisbech. Wisbech Corporation took the Commissioners to court in 1859 for obstructing the river, and when an initial judgement was made in their favour, gangs of men destroyed most of the Waldersea dam overnight. An appeal to the Court of Chancery by the Commissioners also failed, and the dams were removed, as was the Wisbech weir, after an accident involving a train of lighters.

Navigation was always hampered by the Northey Gravel shoal near Dog-in-a-Doublet. Together with a sluice, this prevented salt water from entering the Thorney River, and the Duke of Bedford had obtained an injunction in 1865 to prevent interference with it. An appeal to have the injunction removed in 1880 failed. A dock covering was built at Sutton Bridge at this time, but the outer wall collapsed on 9 June 1881, a few days before it was officially opened, and the estimated repair costs of £160,000 resulted in the project failing. Sporadic traffic managed to use the river, but its condition continued to deteriorate. In 1893, a boating tragedy occurred near Sutton Bridge, in which 9 people died.

===Reconstruction===
By the time the Nene Catchment Board took control of the river, as a result of the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the river was &quot;in unparalleled decay and dilapidation&quot;. They rebuilt all of the locks, and replaced the remaining staunches with locks. A new lock and sluice were built at Dog-in-a-Doublet, to prevent salt water passing up the river, and to maintain water levels to Peterborough. The Thorney River was closed for navigation, arrangements were made for the supply of fresh water to the Thorney Estate, and the Northey Gravel shoal was blown up with dynamite. The banks of the river at Wisbech were protected with piling for a distance of , and a new quay was built. A new concrete bridge was built at Wisbech, at the time it was the largest portal bridge in the country, the span being 92.5 feet. The benefits of the new works were proved in the floods of 1947, when land bordering the Nene was not inundated.

The new locks resulted in some commercial traffic returning to the river. The Port of Wisbech can handle ships up to long and with a draught of , and remains a commercial port in 2021. It also caters for smaller boats, with a major expansion of the facilities at the yacht harbour completed in May 2000.

=== Eagre ===
In a lecture at Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum John Gardiner recalled seeing the rush of the tide below, and an &#x27;eagre&#x27; or &#x27;tidal bore&#x27;, which was a great wave that came rolling up on the tide from the mouth of the Nene, one to four feet high in height. This ceased after the opening of a new cut.

===Operation===
There are canal locks at fairly regular intervals which will accommodate boats up to , with a draught of , although most of the boats on the upper river are canal-type narrowboats and river cruisers. Below Peterborough, boats are restricted by the size of Dog-in-a-Doublet lock, which is (a measured width of ) with draught, while below Wisbech, small ships can be accommodated. All but a handful of the locks have conventional mitre gates at the upstream end and a single vertically lifting guillotine gate at the downstream end. This arrangement permits the use of the locks as additional weirs in time of flood, when the mitre gates are chained open and the guillotines lifted to allow the water to flow straight through. This precludes navigation at these times.

Traditionally the guillotines were manually operated by turning a large wheel some 150 times to raise or lower the gate; since the locks have to be left empty this operation will always have to be done twice to pass through. In recent years the Environment Agency, who are the navigation authority for the river, have been installing electric operation of the guillotines and in some cases replacing them altogether with mitre gates.

==Flooding==
===January 1978 floods===
On 11 and 12 January, the 1978 North Sea storm surge caused extensive coastal flooding. Higher water levels were reached than during the devastating North Sea flood of 1953. Flooding affected both banks of the river at Wisbech. A 70-year-old woman was reported drowned in her flooded home in Wisbech after the Nene burst its banks forcing 1000 people to evacuate their homes. Clarkson Geriatric Day Hospital was closed for weeks as repairs were made.

===Easter 1998 floods===
On 8 and 9 April 1998, constant torrential rain caused flooding across large parts of the English Midlands. On Good Friday, 10 April 1998, the floods peaked and many rivers burst their banks. The Nene was badly affected, flooding low-lying parts of Northampton, Wellingborough, Earls Barton and other settlements on its banks. The town centre of Northampton lies on the northern slope of the Nene Valley and escaped the river&#x27;s flooding. However, the Cotton End, Far Cotton and St James End areas of the town occupy the flood plain and have borne the brunt of severe flooding over the years, culminating in the 1998 Easter floods. In 2002, a siren warning system was installed in Northampton to warn residents in the event of further flooding, and embankments and flood walls were bolstered to protect the town. In Kislingbury village, a flood alleviation scheme was completed in 2004.

In 2007, the Government announced it would spend £6 million on flood defences at Upton Mill in the west of Northampton; wetland areas and embankments were to be constructed along the river.

=== 2013 flood ===
In December 2013, the 2010 £12 million project to protect 10,590 residents and 1,200 businesses with an improved flood defence regime prevented another major incursion of water. The water came within inches of reaching the top of the flood walls and water poured across the roads near flood gates, bringing traffic on North End Road, Wisbech to a standstill.

==The Nene in the arts==
In 2016, composer, Benjamin Till was commissioned by NMPAT (Northamptonshire Music and Performing Arts Trust) to create a major orchestral and choral work about the Nene. The composition was scored for 800 musicians and premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in 2017, before being performed at Northampton&#x27;s Derngate Theatre and Peterborough Cathedral. The piece quotes tradition folk melodies from towns and villages along the river, and explores ghost stories, myths and legends associated with the Nene.

==Namesakes==
The river gave its name to a boat &quot;Nene&quot; of Wisbech, one of whose crew was drowned in the river in 1830, the former football team Wisbech Nene Rovers, the former Nene College of Higher Education in Northampton, now the University of Northampton, the Nene derby, and also to the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s practice being to name their gas turbine designs after British rivers. The river may also be linked to the fact that Sir Henry Royce was born in Alwalton, a village which is by the river, near Peterborough. The former Nene Inn on Nene Parade, Wisbech were both named after the river. Nene Pet Supplies on Nene Quay, Wisbech are also both named after the river.

<text>In lambda calculus, the Church–Rosser theorem states that, when applying reduction rules to terms, the ordering in which the reductions are chosen does not make a difference to the eventual result.

More precisely, if there are two distinct reductions or sequences of reductions that can be applied to the same term, then there exists a term that is reachable from both results, by applying (possibly empty) sequences of additional reductions. The theorem was proved in 1936 by Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser, after whom it is named.

The theorem is symbolized by the adjacent diagram: If term &quot;a&quot; can be reduced to both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, then there must be a further term &quot;d&quot; (possibly equal to either &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;) to which both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; can be reduced.
Viewing the lambda calculus as an abstract rewriting system, the Church–Rosser theorem states that the reduction rules of the lambda calculus are confluent. As a consequence of the theorem, a term in the lambda calculus has at most one normal form, justifying reference to &quot;&quot;the&quot; normal form&quot; of a given normalizable term.

==History==
In 1936, Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser proved that the theorem holds for β-reduction in the λI-calculus (in which every abstracted variable must appear in the term&#x27;s body). The proof method is known as &quot;finiteness of developments&quot;, and it has additional consequences such as the Standardization Theorem, which relates to a method in which reductions can be performed from left to right to reach a normal form (if one exists). The result for the pure untyped lambda calculus was proved by D. E. Schroer in 1965.

==Pure untyped lambda calculus==
One type of reduction in the pure untyped lambda calculus for which the Church–Rosser theorem applies is β-reduction, in which a subterm of the form formula_1 is contracted by the substitution formula_2. If β-reduction is denoted by formula_3 and its reflexive, transitive closure by formula_4 then the Church–Rosser theorem is that:
:formula_5

A consequence of this property is that two terms equal in formula_6 must reduce to a common term:
:formula_7

The theorem also applies to η-reduction, in which a subterm formula_8 is replaced by formula_9. It also applies to βη-reduction, the union of the two reduction rules.

===Proof===
For β-reduction, one proof method originates from William W. Tait and Per Martin-Löf. Say that a binary relation formula_10 satisfies the diamond property if:
:formula_11

Then the Church–Rosser property is the statement that formula_4 satisfies the diamond property. We introduce a new reduction formula_13 whose reflexive transitive closure is formula_4 and which satisfies the diamond property. By induction on the number of steps in the reduction, it thus follows that formula_4 satisfies the diamond property.

The relation formula_13 has the formation rules:
*formula_17
*If formula_18 and formula_19 then formula_20 and formula_21 and formula_22

The η-reduction rule can be proved to be Church–Rosser directly. Then, it can be proved that β-reduction and η-reduction commute in the sense that:
:If formula_23 and formula_24 then there exists a term formula_25 such that formula_26 and formula_27.

Hence we can conclude that βη-reduction is Church–Rosser.

==Variants==
The Church–Rosser theorem also holds for many variants of the lambda calculus, such as the simply-typed lambda calculus, many calculi with advanced type systems, and Gordon Plotkin&#x27;s beta-value calculus. Plotkin also used a Church–Rosser theorem to prove that the evaluation of functional programs (for both lazy evaluation and eager evaluation) is a function from programs to values (a subset of the lambda terms).

In older research papers, a rewriting system is said to be Church–Rosser, or to have the Church–Rosser property, when it is confluent.

<doc id="150037" wikidata="Q916461" url="?curid=150037" title="The Jam">
<text>The Jam were an English rock band formed in 1972 in Woking, Surrey, consisting of Paul Weller, Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler. They released 18 consecutive top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; and &quot;Just Who Is the 5 O&#x27;Clock Hero?&quot; remain the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, &quot;The Gift&quot;, reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.

The band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1970s punk and new wave and 1960s beat music, soul and rhythm and blues. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their mod image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form the Style Council and later started a solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam&#x27;s original compositions and played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker 330. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band&#x27;s songs, including the hits &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot;, &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot;, &quot;Going Underground&quot; and &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;.

==History==
===Formation (1972–1976)===
The Jam formed at Sheerwater Secondary School in Woking, Surrey, England, in 1972. The line-up consisted of Paul Weller on bass and lead vocals with various friends. They played their first gigs at Michael&#x27;s, a local club. The line-up began to solidify in the mid-1970s with Weller, guitarist/vocalist Steve Brookes and drummer Rick Buckler. In their early years, their sets consisted of covers of early American rock and roll songs by the likes of Chuck Berry and Little Richard. They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who&#x27;s debut album &quot;My Generation&quot; and became fascinated with Mod music. As he said later, &quot;I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing Motown, Stax and Atlantic covers. I bought a Rickenbacker guitar, a Lambretta GP 150 and tried to style my hair like Steve Marriott&#x27;s circa &#x27;66.&quot; Eventually Brookes left the band, but although they advertised for a new guitarist (Gary Webb later known as Gary Numan claims to have failed an audition) he was not replaced. Up to this point Weller had been playing bass and Foxton had been the band&#x27;s second guitar player; he persuaded Foxton to take over bass duties. The line-up of Weller, Foxton, and Buckler would persist until the end of the Jam&#x27;s career.

Throughout their career, the Jam were managed by Weller&#x27;s father, John Weller, who then managed Paul&#x27;s subsequent career until his death in 2009. The Jam were signed to Polydor Records by Chris Parry in February 1977.

===Early recordings (1977)===
On 29 April 1977, Polydor released the Jam&#x27;s debut single, &quot;In the City&quot;, which charted in the Top 40 in the UK. On 20 May, the band released their debut album of the same name. The album, like those of the Clash and Sex Pistols, featured fast, loud and pointed songs. What set it apart from the records of those two bands was its more prevalent 1960s rock influences. The Jam covered Larry Williams&#x27;s &quot;Slow Down&quot; (also covered by the Beatles) and the theme song of the 1960s TV series &quot;Batman&quot;.

On 1 May 1977, the Jam joined the Clash&#x27;s White Riot Tour as an opening act, alongside the Buzzcocks, the Slits, Subway Sect, and the Prefects at Guildford Civic Hall and concluded the tour on 30 May 1977 at the California Ballroom in Dunstable.

The Jam had political lyrics, condemning police brutality (&quot;In the City&quot;) and expansionist development (&quot;Bricks and Mortar&quot;). One of their most openly political songs, &quot;Time for Truth&quot;, bemoaned the decline of the British Empire and expressed disparaging sentiments about &quot;Uncle Jimmy&quot; (the Prime Minister, James Callaghan) in no uncertain terms (&quot;Whatever happened to the great Empire?&quot; / &quot;I think it&#x27;s time for truth, and the truth is you lost, Uncle Jimmy&quot;). These pro-Empire sentiments and ostentatious displays of the Union Flag began to earn the group the tag of &quot;Conservative&quot;.

After the non-LP single &quot;All Around the World&quot; nearly reached the UK Top 10, the Jam, having achieved a notable and loyal following in such a short time, were pressed to produce more material quickly. Their second album, &quot;This Is the Modern World&quot;, was released later in 1977. Bruce Foxton, generally considered a lesser songwriter than Weller, contributed two songs to the LP (&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Them You&#x27;re Sane&quot; and &quot;London Traffic&quot;), both of which attracted criticism. His composing output gradually decreased, leaving Weller firmly established as the band&#x27;s chief songwriter.

===&quot;All Mod Cons&quot; (1978)===
In March 1978, the Jam released &quot;News of the World&quot;, a non-album single that was written and sung by Foxton. It charted at No. 27 in the UK, and was the band&#x27;s second biggest hit to date. This was the only Foxton solo composition to be released as a Jam A-side. When the band went back into the studio to record a third album of primarily Foxton contributions, their songs were dismissed by producers as poor, and they held off recording an album in hopes that Weller would once again find inspiration. &quot;News of the World&quot; was used in the opening theme of the BBC television show &quot;Mock the Week&quot; during its extended run.

The Jam released their next single, the double A-side &quot;David Watts&quot;/&quot;&#x27;A&#x27; Bomb in Wardour Street&quot;. &quot;David Watts&quot; was a cover of a Kinks song, throughout which Weller and Foxton traded lead vocals. &quot;&#x27;A&#x27; Bomb in Wardour Street&quot; was a Weller original. It became their most successful 7&quot; since &quot;All Around the World&quot;.

It was not until their next single, &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot;, that the Jam really regained their former critical acclaim. Around this time, the Jam slimmed their team of two producers to one, Vic Coppersmith-Heaven, who helped develop the group&#x27;s sound. In November, the Jam released their third LP, &quot;All Mod Cons&quot;. The twelve tracks included three of the tracks previously released as singles (&quot;David Watts&quot;, &quot;&#x27;A&#x27; Bomb In Wardour Street&quot;, and &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot;) and two songs previously rejected for single release, the manic &quot;Billy Hunt&quot; and the acoustic ballad &quot;English Rose&quot;.

===&quot;Setting Sons&quot; &amp; &quot;Sound Affects&quot; (1979–1981)===
Following two successful and critically acclaimed non-LP singles, &quot;Strange Town&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Young&quot;, the band released &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; in advance of their new album, &quot;Setting Sons&quot;, released in November 1979. The LP also saw their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album began life as a concept album about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme.

The band&#x27;s first single of 1980 was intended to be &quot;Dreams of Children&quot;. Due to a labelling error, however, the A- and B-sides of the single were reversed, resulting in the more conventional &quot;Going Underground&quot;, the single&#x27;s planned flipside, getting much more airplay and attention. The single was eventually officially recognised (and listed) as a double A-side by the time the release reached No. 1 in the UK.

&quot;Sound Affects,&quot; released in November 1980, was a No. 2 hit in the UK and peaked at No. 72 on the US Billboard charts, the band&#x27;s most successful album in the US. Weller said that he was influenced by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall.&quot; It included the acoustic &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;. According to Weller he wrote &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, a bitter slice-of-life commentary on the drudgery of modern working-class life, in around 15 minutes upon returning inebriated from the pub. Despite being only available as an import single, it peaked at No. 21 on the UK charts. Despite the group&#x27;s lack of commercial success in America, it even made American magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.

&quot;Start!&quot;, released before the album, became another No. 1 single. Commenting on its similar bassline to The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; cut &quot;Taxman&quot;, Foxton said &quot;Basslines like &quot;Start!&quot; just come to you. It’s not an intentional thing...it’s not quite like &quot;Taxman&quot;, note-wise – you couldn’t sue me for it.&quot;

===&quot;The Gift&quot; and break-up (1981–1982)===
Two non-LP singles, &quot;Funeral Pyre&quot; and &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (named after Colin Macinnes&#x27; novel of the same title) were released in 1981, both reaching No. 4 on the UK charts.

The 1982 release &quot;The Gift&quot; – the band&#x27;s final studio LP – was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 on the UK charts while spending an unprecedented 16 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It featured several soul, funk, and Motown-stylised songs;, most notably the No. 1 single &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;. While the song was described by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; as &quot;a class-war tirade set to a post-punk Northern Soul groove&quot;, it was in reality a tale about dealing with hardship in a small, downtrodden English town. &quot;Town Called Malice&quot; is one of a handful of Jam songs Weller still performs (along with &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, &quot;Man in the Corner Shop&quot;, &quot;Strange Town&quot;, &quot;Art School&quot;, &quot;Start!&quot; and &quot;In the Crowd&quot;).

When &quot;Town Called Malice&quot; reached number one in the UK the group had the honour of performing both it and its double A-side, &quot;Precious&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. After the string-laden soul ballad &quot;The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had to Swallow)&quot; peaked at No. 2, the band followed with their finale and another No. 1, &quot;Beat Surrender&quot;. The latter featured Tracie Young on vocals; a few months later, she also guested on the Style Council&#x27;s debut single &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot;.

On 30 October 1982, after a world tour, Weller announced his intention to disband the Jam. They also made their final appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;The Tube&quot; to promote &quot;Beat Surrender&quot;. The tour included five consecutive nights at the Wembley Arena. The last date on the original itinerary had been scheduled for 9 December 1982 at Guildford Civic Hall, close to the band&#x27;s hometown of Woking. Due to ticket demand, an additional date was added at the Brighton Conference Centre on 11 December 1982 for their last performance.

The decision to split was solely Weller&#x27;s. Explaining at the time that he disliked the idea of continuing for as long as possible simply because they were successful, he later told &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; in advance of a 2015 Sky documentary on the band, &quot;I wanted to end it to see what else I was capable of, and I&#x27;m still sure we stopped at the right time. I&#x27;m proud of what we did but I didn&#x27;t want to dilute it, or for us to get embarrassing by trying to go on forever. We finished at our peak. I think we had achieved all we wanted or needed to, both commercially and artistically.&quot;

Weller&#x27;s decision to move on, announced by his father, the band&#x27;s manager, at an extraordinary band meeting in the summer of 1982, &quot;came as a shock&quot; to Buckler and Foxton, who wanted to keep the band together. Buckler told the &quot;Woking News and Mail&quot; in 2012: &quot;It was like we were going to be driving over a cliff at the end of the year, and you keep thinking &#x27;Well, maybe he&#x27;ll change his mind&#x27;.&quot; Both Buckler and Foxton described the experience as bitter, but in later years both expressed understanding, if not complete acceptance.

Following the split, Foxton did not speak to Weller for over 20 years, and Buckler said in 2015 that he still had not spoken to Weller since, despite repeated attempts by Buckler and Foxton in 1983 and 1984 to meet up with and talk to Weller. As the farewell tour neared its end, Polydor released a live album titled &quot;Dig the New Breed&quot;, a collection of songs from various concert performances over the band&#x27;s five-year career which, while commercially successful, met with mixed reviews. The month after the final concert in Brighton, Polydor re-released all sixteen of the band&#x27;s singles, nine of which re-entered the UK charts on 22 January 1983.

==Post-split releases==
&quot;Snap!&quot; was the first Jam compilation album released after the band split, reaching No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart in 1983. This was followed by &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, released in 1991, which also peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

A five-CD box set &quot;Direction Reaction Creation&quot;, featuring all of the Jam&#x27;s studio material (plus a disc of rarities) peaked at No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart upon its release in 1997; an unprecedented achievement for a box set. In 2002, Virgin Radio counted down the top 100 British music artists of all-time as polled by listeners and the Jam were No. 5 on the list. Weller made two other appearances in the poll; as part of The Style Council at No. 93 and as a solo artist at No. 21.

==Post-split careers==

In early 1983, Weller announced the formation of a new band, the Style Council, a duo with keyboard player Mick Talbot, formerly of the minor mod revival band the Merton Parkas. They would eventually split in 1989. He subsequently embarked on a successful career as a solo artist.

Following a short stint recording demos with Jake Burns and Dolphin Taylor, previously of Irish punk outfit Stiff Little Fingers, Foxton released his debut single &quot;Freak&quot; on Arista Records. Entering the UK Singles Chart at No. 34 on 30 July 1983, it eventually peaked at No. 23 and secured an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Foxton&#x27;s solo album &quot;Touch Sensitive&quot; followed in 1984, but subsequent singles &quot;This Is the Way&quot;, &quot;It Makes Me Wonder&quot; and &quot;My Imagination (S.O.S.)&quot; failed to enter the Top 40. A final single &quot;Play This Game to Win&quot; was released on Harvest Records in November 1986.

Foxton went on to replace Ali McMordie in a reformed Stiff Little Fingers in 1990, remaining with the band until January 2006, when he quit to pursue other projects. Later that year he joined Simon Townshend (Pete Townshend&#x27;s brother), and Mark Brzezicki and Bruce Watson (both of Big Country) in the band Casbah Club, which released an album called &quot;Venustraphobia&quot;.

After the Jam split, Buckler formed Time UK with Jimmy Edwards and Ray Simone, formerly of Masterswitch, ex-Tom Robinson Band guitarist Danny Kustow and (briefly) former Radio Stars/Sparks bassist Martin Gordon. The band released three singles &quot;The Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Playground of Privilege&quot; and &quot;You Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; before folding. In 1986, Buckler and Foxton released the single &quot;Entertain Me&quot; under the name Sharp.

In 2006, Buckler, who had not been playing for several years after Sharp quit, formed a band named the Gift, playing material from &quot;the Jam&quot; with musicians Russell Hastings and David Moore. Hastings, who spent many years as a local musician including a couple of years in a Jam tribute band, took on guitar and lead vocal duties. In 2006, Foxton performed on stage with The Gift at some of their concerts, and went on to join the band as bassist, with Moore moving to second guitar and keyboards. At this point the group changed its name to From the Jam. In a 2007 press release, Foxton and Buckler announced they were working on a new album and UK tour, which led to press speculation about a full or partial reunion of the Jam, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;In the City&quot;. Weller did not take part, and has publicly expressed his lack of interest in any type of reformation. In a 2006 interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, Weller stated a reunion of the Jam would &quot;never, ever happen&quot;, and that reformations are &quot;sad&quot;. He said: &quot;Me and my children would have to be destitute and starving in the gutter before I&#x27;d even consider that, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll happen anyway ... The Jam&#x27;s music still means something to people and a lot of that&#x27;s because we stopped at the right time, it didn&#x27;t go on and become embarrassing.&quot;

After the Jam split, Weller and Foxton reportedly did not speak to one another for 20 years. In June 2006, it was reported that Weller and Foxton met backstage at The Who&#x27;s Hyde Park concert, and a ten-minute conversation ended with an embrace. Foxton claimed that the two became friends again in 2009 and this led to them collaborating for two tracks on Weller&#x27;s solo album &quot;Wake Up the Nation&quot; in early 2010. In May 2010, Weller and Foxton appeared together on stage for the first time in 28 years at The Albert Hall in London, performing three songs together. Foxton ruled out a Jam reunion.

==In popular culture==
From 26 June to 27 September 2015, an exhibition entitled &quot;The Jam: About the Young Idea&quot; ran at Somerset House in London. For the first time, all three members of the band, the Weller family and music archivist Den Davis opened up their archives for the exhibition. Despite Foxton&#x27;s reported hopes that the opening would bring all three together on stage for the first time since their 1982 split, Buckler did not attend. &quot;NME&quot; reported at the time that, while Foxton and Weller apparently reconciled no later than 2010, &quot;Weller and Buckler are said to have not been in the same room since their band’s demise.&quot; The exhibition was curated by Tory Turk, Nicky Weller (Paul&#x27;s sister) and Russell Reader.

In September 2015, &quot;The Jam: About the Young Idea&quot;, the documentary film, directed by Bob Smeaton, was broadcast on Sky Arts. The documentary was released on DVD, packaged with a recording of their 1980 live performance on German TV show Rockpalast.

&quot;About the Young Idea&quot; was an exhibition held at the Cunard Building in Liverpool, which was opened by Buckler and ran from 1 July to 6 October 2016. Curators Nicky Weller, Den Davies and Russell Reader drew together a wide range of memorabilia including personal items provided by the band members.

<text>The River Great Ouse ( ) is a river in England, the longest of several British rivers called &quot;Ouse&quot;. From Syresham in Northamptonshire, the Great Ouse flows through Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to drain into the Wash and the North Sea near Kings Lynn. Authorities disagree both on the river&#x27;s source and its length, with one quoting 
and another . Mostly flowing north and east, it is the fifth longest river in the United Kingdom. The Great Ouse has been historically important for commercial navigation, and for draining the low-lying region through which it flows; its best-known tributary is the Cam, which runs through Cambridge. Its lower course passes through drained wetlands and fens and has been extensively modified, or channelised, to relieve flooding and provide a better route for barge traffic. The unmodified river would have changed course regularly after floods.

The name &quot;Ouse&quot; is from the Celtic or pre-Celtic *&quot;Udso-s&quot;, and probably means simply &quot;water&quot; or slow flowing river. Thus the name is a pleonasm. The lower reaches of the Great Ouse are also known as &quot;Old West River&quot; and &quot;the Ely Ouse&quot;, but the entire length of the river is often referred to simply as the Ouse in informal usage (the word &quot;Great&quot; which originally meant simply big or, in the case of a river, long is used to distinguish this river from several others called the Ouse).

==Course==
The river has several sources close to the villages of Syresham and Wappenham in South Northamptonshire. It flows through Brackley, provides the Oxfordshire/Northamptonshire border, then into Buckinghamshire where it flows through Buckingham, the Milton Keynes urban area (at Stony Stratford and Newport Pagnell) and Olney, then Kempston in Bedfordshire, which is the current head of navigation.

Passing through Bedford, it flows on into Cambridgeshire through St Neots, Godmanchester, Huntingdon, Hemingford Grey and St Ives, reaching Earith. Here, the river enters a short tidal section before branching in two. The artificial, very straight Old Bedford River and New Bedford River, which remain tidal, provide a direct link north-east towards the lower river at Denver in Norfolk.

The river previously ran through Hermitage Lock into the Old West River, then joined the Cam near Little Thetford before passing Ely and Littleport to reach the Denver sluice. Below this point, the river is tidal and continues past Downham Market to enter the Wash at King&#x27;s Lynn. It is navigable from the Wash to Kempston Mill near Bedford, a distance of which contains 17 locks. It has a catchment area of and a mean flow of as measured at Denver Sluice.

Its course has been modified several times, with the first recorded modification in 1236, as a result of flooding. During the 1600s, the Old Bedford and New Bedford rivers were built to provide a quicker route for the water to reach the sea. In the 20th century, construction of the Cut-Off Channel and the Great Ouse Relief Channel have further altered water flows in the region, and helped to reduce flooding.

Improvements to assist navigation began in 1618, with the construction of sluices and locks. Bedford could be reached by river from 1689. A major feature was the sluice at Denver, which failed in 1713, but was rebuilt by 1750 after the problem of flooding returned. Kings Lynn, at the mouth of the river, developed as a port, with civil engineering input from many of the great engineers of the time. With the coming of the railways the state of the river declined so that it was unsuitable either for navigation or for drainage. The navigation was declared to be derelict in the 1870s.

A repeated problem was the number of authorities responsible for different aspects of the river. The drainage board created in 1918 had no powers to address navigation issues, and there were six bodies responsible for the river below Denver in 1913. When the Great Ouse Catchment Board was created under the powers of the Land Drainage Act 1930, effective action could at last be taken. There was significant sugar beet cargo traffic on the river between 1925 and 1959, with the last known commercial traffic sailing in 1974. Leisure boating had been popular since 1904, and the post-war period saw the creation of the Great Ouse Restoration Society in 1951, who campaigned for complete renovation of the river navigation. Until 1989, the river was in the care of the Anglian Water Authority until water privatisation, when the Environment Agency became the drainage and ecology authority as well as being the navigation authority.

The Ouse Washes are an internationally important area for wildlife. Sandwiched between the Old Bedford and New Bedford rivers, they consist of washland which is used as pasture during the summer but which floods in the winter, and are the largest area of such land in the United Kingdom. They act as breeding grounds for lapwings, redshanks and snipe in spring, and are home to varieties of ducks and swans during the winter months.

==History: drainage and navigation==

The river has been important both for drainage and for navigation for centuries, and these dual roles have not always been complementary. The course of the river has changed significantly. In prehistory, it flowed from Huntingdon straight to Wisbech and then into the sea. In several sequences, the lower reaches of the river silted, and in times of inland flood, the waters would breach neighbouring watersheds and new courses would develop – generally in a progressively eastwards fashion. In the Dark Ages, it turned to the west at Littleport, between its present junctions with the River Little Ouse and the River Lark, and made its way via Welney, Upwell and Outwell, to flow into The Wash near Wisbech. At that time it was known as the Wellstream or Old Wellenhee, and parts of that course are marked by the Old Croft River and the border between Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. After major inland flood events in the early 13th century it breached another watershed near Denver and took over the channel of the old Wiggenhall Eau, and so achieved a new exit and so joined the Wash at Kings Lynn. Parts of the old course were later used for the River Lark, which flows in the reverse direction along the section below Prickwillow, after the main river was moved further to the west. The original northern course began to silt up, depriving Wisbech of a reliable outlet to the sea, and was kept navigable by diverting the River Nene east to flow into it in the 1470s.

The Land Drainage Act 1601 (43 Eliz. 1. c. 11) allowed &#x27;adventurers&#x27;, who paid for drainage schemes with their own money, to be repaid in land which they had drained. The act covered large tracts of England, but no improvements were made to the region through which the Great Ouse flowed until 1618, Arnold Spencer and Thomas Girton started to improve the river between St Ives and St Neots. Six sluices were constructed, and Spencer attempted to obtain permission to improve the river to Bedford, but the bill for the related act of Parliament was defeated, despite support from Bedford Corporation. Some dredging was done, and Great Barford became an inland port, but he lost a lot of money on the scheme, and the condition of the river worsened.

Below Earith, thirteen Adventurers working with the Earl of Bedford formed a corporation to drain the Bedford Levels. Cornelius Vermuyden was the engineer, and a major part of the scheme was the Old Bedford River, a straight cut to carry water from Earith to a new sluice near Salters Lode, which was completed in 1637. The sluice was not popular with those who used the river for navigation, and there were some attempts to destroy the new works during the turmoil of the English civil wars. A second drainage act of Parliament was obtained in 1649, and Vermuyden oversaw the construction of the New Bedford River, parallel to the Old Bedford River, which was completed in 1652. There was strong opposition from the ports and towns on the river, which increased as the old channel via Ely gradually silted up. Above Earith, Samuel Jemmatt took control of the river, and navigation was extended to Bedford in 1689 by the construction of new staunches and sluices.
Between St Ives and Bedford, there were ten sluices, which were pound locks constructed at locations where mill weirs would have prevented navigation. There were also five staunches, which were flash locks constructed near to fords and shallows. Operation of the beam and paddle provided an extra volume of water to carry the boats over such obstructions. On the lower river, a combination of high spring tides and large volumes of floodwater resulted in the complete failure of Denver sluice in 1713. While there were celebrations among the navigators, the problem of flooding returned, and the channel below Denver deteriorated. Charles Labelye therefore designed a new sluice for the Bedford Level Corporation, which was constructed between 1748 and 1750 and included a navigation lock. No tolls were charged on the river below St Ives or on the New Bedford, and those responsible for drainage complained about damage to the sluices and to banks by the horses used for towing boats. A bill for a new act of Parliament to regulate the situation was defeated in 1777 after fierce opposition, and it was not until 1790 that a &#x27;Haling Act&#x27;, the (30 Geo. 3. c. 83), was passed, which ensured that tolls were charged and landowners were repaid for damage to the banks caused by horses. These measures were a success, as there were few complaints once the new system was in place.

===Port of King&#x27;s Lynn===

After the river had been diverted to King&#x27;s Lynn, the town developed as a port. Evidence for this can still be seen, as two warehouses built in the 15th century for trade with the Hanseatic League have survived. However, the harbour and the river below Denver sluice were affected by silting, and the problem was perceived to be the effects of the sluice. Sand from The Wash was deposited by the incoming tide, and the outgoing tide did not carry it away again. Colonel John Armstrong was asked to survey the river in 1724, and suggested returning it to how it was prior to the construction of the drainage works. John Smeaton rejected this idea in 1766, suggesting that the banks should be moved inwards to create a narrower, faster-flowing channel. William Elstobb and others had suggested that the great bend in the river above King&#x27;s Lynn should be removed by creating a cut, but it took 50 years of arguing before the (35 Geo. 3. c. 77) was obtained to authorise it, and another 26 years until the cut was finally opened in 1821. During this time, most of the major civil engineers of the time had contributed their opinions. The original project head and chief engineer was Sir Thomas Hyde Page.

The work was overseen by John Rennie and Thomas Telford and construction took four years. It proved to be too narrow, resulting in further silting of the harbour, and was widened at an additional cost of £33,000 on Telford&#x27;s advice. The total cost for the cut was nearly £500,000, and although the navigators, who had opposed the scheme, benefitted most from it, there were new problems for drainage, with the surrounding land levels dropping as the peaty soil dried out. The Eau Brink Act 1795 created Drainage Commissioners and Navigation Commissioners, who had powers over the river to St Ives, but both bodies were subject to the Bedford Levels Corporation. Although often in opposition, the two parties worked together on the construction of a new lock and staunch at Brownshill, to improve navigation above Earith.

In 1835, King William IV brought a case against the Ouse Bank Commissioners regarding a mandamus writ issued in 1834 about the Eau Brink Cut and possible damages it caused to the King&#x27;s Lynn harbour.

===The Railway Age===
Denver sluice was reconstructed in 1834, after the Eau Brink Cut had been completed. Sir John Rennie designed the new structure, which incorporated a tidal lock with four sets of gates, enabling it to be used at most states of the tide. Sir Thomas Cullam, who had inherited a part share of the upper river, invested large amounts of his own money in rebuilding the locks, sluices and staunches in the 1830s and 1840s. The Bedford Level Act 1827 (53 Geo. 3. c. ccxiv) created commissioners who dredged the river from Hermitage Lock to Littleport bridge, and also dredged several of its tributaries. They constructed a new cut near Ely to bypass a long meander near Padnall Fen and Burnt Fen, but although the works cost £70,000, they were too late to return the navigation to prosperity. Railways arrived in the area rapidly after 1845, reaching Cambridge, Ely, Huntingdon, King&#x27;s Lynn, St Ives, St Neots and Tempsford by 1850. The river below King&#x27;s Lynn was improved by the construction of the Marsh Cut and the building of training walls beyond that to constrain the channel, but the railways were welcomed by the Bedford Levels Corporation, for whom navigation interfered with drainage, and by King&#x27;s Lynn Corporation, who did not want to be superseded by other towns with railway interchange facilities.

A large interchange dock was built at Ely, to facilitate the distribution of agricultural produce from the local region to wider markets. In addition, coal for several isolated pumping stations was transferred to boats for the final part of the journey, rather than it coming all the way from King&#x27;s Lynn. Decline on most of the river was rapid, with tolls halving between 1855 and 1862. Flooding in 1875 was blamed on the poor state of the navigation, and it was recommended that it should be abandoned, but there was no funds to obtain an act of Parliament to create a drainage authority. The navigation was declared to be derelict by three county councils soon afterwards. It was then bought by the &quot;Ouse River Canal and Steam Navigation Ltd&quot;, who wanted to link Bedford to the Grand Junction Canal, but they failed to obtain their act of Parliament. A stockbroker called L. T. Simpson bought it in 1893, and spent some £21,000 over the next four years in restoring it. He created the Ouse Transport Company, running a fleet of tugs and lighters, and then attempted to get approval for new tolls, but was opposed by Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire county councils. Protracted legal battles followed, with Simpson nailing the lock gates together, and the county councils declaring that the river was a public highway. The case, &quot;Simpson v Godmanchester Corporation&quot;, eventually reached the House of Lords in 1904, who allowed Simpson to close the locks.

===The Leisure Age===
Simpson&#x27;s victory in 1904 coincided with an increased use of the river for leisure. As he could not charge these boats for use of the locks, the situation was resolved for a time in 1906 by the formation of the River Ouse Locks Committee, who rented the locks between Great Barford and Bedford. Over 2,000 boats were recorded using Bedford Lock in a three-month period soon afterwards. Despite pressure from local authorities and navigation companies, the upper river was closed for trade, and a royal commission reported in 1909 on the poor state of the lower river, the lack of any consistent authority to manage it, and the unusual practice of towing horses having to jump over fences because there were no gates where they crossed the towing path. The Ouse Drainage Board was formed in 1918, but had no powers to deal with navigation issues, and it was not until the powers of the Land Drainage Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 44) were used to create the Great Ouse Catchment Board that effective action could be taken.

The catchment board bought the navigation rights from Simpson&#x27;s estate, and began to dredge the river and rebuild the locks. There was an upturn in commercial traffic from 1925, when the sugar beet factory at Queen Adelaide near Ely was opened. They operated six or seven tugs and a fleet of over 100 barges, and three tugs and 24 barges from the Wissington sugar beet factory on the River Wissey also operated on the river. Local commercial traffic continued around Ely until after the Second World War. The sugar beet traffic ceased in 1959, and the last commercial boat on the upper river was &quot;Shellfen&quot;, a Dutch barge converted to carry of diesel fuel, which supplied the remote pumping stations until 1974, when the last ones were converted to electricity.

Below Denver, the situation was complicated by the fact that there were six bodies with responsibility for the river in 1913. No dredging took place, as there was no overall authority. The training walls were repaired in 1930 by the King&#x27;s Lynn Conservancy Board, and the Great Ouse Catchment Board reconstructed and extended them in 1937. After major flooding in 1937 and 1947, and the North Sea flood of 1953, flood control issues became more important, and the Cut-Off Channel was completed in 1964, to carry the headwaters of the River Wissey, River Lark and River Little Ouse to join the river near Denver sluice. The Great Ouse Relief Channel, which runs parallel to the main river for from here to Wiggenhall bridge, was constructed at the same time. It joins the river at a sluice above King&#x27;s Lynn, and was made navigable in 2001, when the Environment Agency constructed a lock at Denver to provide access.

By 1939, the Catchment Board had reopened the locks to Godmanchester and then to Eaton Socon; in 1951 the Great Ouse Restoration Society was formed to continue the process, and successfully campaigned for and assisted with the restoration. The Restoration Society campaign included the establishment of the Bedford to St. Neots Canoe Race in 1952 to publicise the case for navigational restoration. Now known as the Bedford Kayak Marathon, it is the longest established canoe race in the UK. In 1961 its organisers formalised canoeing activities on the river by forming the Viking Kayak Club. 

Since 1996, the river has been the responsibility of the Environment Agency, who issue navigation licences. The upper river was fully reopened to Bedford with the rebuilding of Castle Mills lock in 1978.

===Navigation connections===
The non-tidal reaches of the river are used for leisure boating, but remain largely separated from the rest of the British inland waterway system. Several of its tributaries are navigable, including the River Cam, the River Lark, the River Little Ouse and the River Wissey. Close to Denver sluice, Salters Lode lock gives access to the Middle Level Navigations, but the intervening section is tidal, and deters many boaters. Access to the Middle Level Navigations used to be possible via the Old Bedford River and Welches Dam lock, but the Environment Agency piled the entrance to the lock in 2006 and this route is no loger available for navigation. The proposed Fens Waterways Link, which aims to improve navigation from Lincoln to Cambridge may result in this section being upgraded, or a non-tidal link being created at Denver.

There are two more proposed schemes to improve connections from the river to the Midlands waterway network (in addition to the Gt OuseNene link via the Middle Level).
*The first is for a Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway, to connect the river to the Grand Union Canal. This idea was first proposed in 1812, when John Rennie the Elder costed a junction canal from Fenny Stratford to Bedford. His estimate of £180,807 scared investors, and no progress was made. In 1838, there was another (failed) proposal to extend the Newport Pagnell Canal. The idea was revived once more in the 1880s, when the Ouse River Canal and Steam Navigation Ltd bought the river with the aim of creating the link. A bill for an enabling act of Parliament was defeated, although Major Marindin, acting for the Board of Trade, was optimistic about the likely benefits. The modern version of the proposal is in progress since 1994, by the Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway Trust, who have formed a partnership with 25 bodies, including local councils, British Waterways (and its successor, the Canal &amp; River Trust) and various government agencies. A feasibility study was carried out in 2001, which looked at nine possible routes; by 2006, the cost of the preferred route was between £100 and £200 million.
*The second scheme is for an extension of the Great Ouse Relief Channel to link it to the River Nar, and provide a non-tidal link to King&#x27;s Lynn. The project would include a large marina, and would be part of a much larger regeneration project for the south side of the town. Two locks would be required to raise boats from the Relief Channel to the River Nar.

==Wildlife==
As the water quality has improved, otters have returned to the river in numbers such that fishing lakes now require fencing to protect stocks. Paxton Pits nature reserve near St Neots has hides from which otters are regularly seen. Coarse fishing is still popular, with a wide range of fish in the river, but it is many years since large sturgeon were caught. Seals have been recorded as far upstream as Bedford. Huntingdonshire seems to be the most popular area for breeding animals in recent years. 

==Tributaries==
Tributaries of the River Great Ouse: (upstream [source] to downstream by confluence)
*Padbury Brook: Two streams that join to form one watercourse just south of Padbury in Buckinghamshire: the eastern twin starts near Addington and the Claydons and flows northwest to join the western twin, which starts near Somerton in Oxfordshire. From here it flows due East, through Fewcott, Stoke Lyne, Fringford and Twyford, before joining its twin and flowing north to join the Great Ouse east of Buckingham.

*Soham Lode
*River Lark
*River Little Ouse
*River Wissey
*Old Bedford River
*New Bedford River (also known as Hundred Foot Drain)
*River Nar
*Gaywood River
*Babingley River

==Water sports==

In 1944 the annual Boat Race between the Oxford and Cambridge universities took place on this river, between Littleport and Queen Adelaide, the first time that it had not been held on the Thames; it was won by Oxford. The 2021 Boat Race was again held on the river because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Great Ouse has been used by three clubs from Cambridge University for the training of rowers, with the Boat Club (CUBC), the Women&#x27;s Boat Club (CUWBC) and the Lightweight Rowing Club (CULRC), all using facilities at Ely; the clubs merged in 2020. 

The Great Ouse is a very popular river for canoeing and kayaking, particularly around Bedford which is a regional centre for the sport. Viking Kayak Club organise the Bedford Kayak Marathon with canoe racing held along the Embankment on Bedford&#x27;s riverside and dates back to the original Bedford to St Neots race in 1952, believed to be the first of its kind in the country.
Bedford also benefits from the presence of weirs and sluices, creating white water opportunities. Viking organise national ranking Canoe Slalom events at the Cardington Artificial Slalom Course (CASC), which was the first artificial whitewater course in the UK, opened in 1982 adjacent to Cardington Lock, in a partnership with the Environment Agency who use it as a flood relief channel. CASC is also the venue each year for the UK&#x27;s National Inter Clubs Slalom Finals, the largest canoe slalom event by participation in the UK.

Since 1978, the Bedford River Festival has been held every two years, to celebrate the link between Bedford and the coast. In addition to craft often seen on the river, the 2008 festival featured a reconstruction of a 1st-century currach, consisting of a wicker framework covered in cow hide, and capable of carrying ten people.

<text>The nene (Branta sandvicensis), also known as the nēnē or the Hawaiian goose, is a species of bird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The nene is exclusively found in the wild on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Hawaii. In 1957, it was designated as the official state bird of the state of Hawaii.

The Hawaiian name &quot;nēnē&quot; comes from its soft call. The specific name &quot;sandvicensis&quot; refers to the Sandwich Islands, a former name for the Hawaiian Islands.

==Taxonomy==
The holotype specimen of &quot;Anser sandvicensis&quot; Vigors (List Anim. Garden Zool. Soc., ed.3, June 1833, p.4.) is held in the vertebrate zoology collection at World Museum, National Museums Liverpool, with accession number NML-VZ T12706. The specimen was collected from the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) and came to the Liverpool national collection via the Museum of the Zoological Society of London collection, Thomas Campbell Eyton’s collection, and Henry Baker Tristram’s collection.

It is thought that the nene evolved from the Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;), which most likely arrived on the Hawaiian islands about 500,000 years ago, shortly after the island of Hawaii was formed. The Canada goose is also the ancestor of the prehistoric giant Hawaii goose (&quot;Branta rhuax&quot;) and the nēnē-nui (&quot;Branta hylobadistes&quot;). The nēnē-nui was larger than the nene, varied from flightless to flighted depending on the individual, and inhabited the island of Maui. Similar fossil geese found on Oahu and Kauai may be of the same species. The giant Hawaii goose was restricted to the island of Hawaii and measured in length with a mass of , making it more than four times larger than the nene. It is believed that the herbivorous giant Hawaii goose occupied the same ecological niche as the goose-like ducks known as moa-nalo, which were not present on the Big Island. Based on mitochondrial DNA found in fossils, all Hawaiian geese, living and extinct, are closely related to the giant Canada goose (&quot;B. c. maxima&quot;) and dusky Canada goose (&quot;B. c. occidentalis&quot;).

==Description==
The nene is a large-sized goose at tall. Although they spend most of their time on the ground, they are capable of flight, with some individuals flying daily between nesting and feeding areas. Females have a mass of , while males average , 11% larger than females. Adult males have a black head and hindneck, buff cheeks and heavily furrowed neck. The neck has black and white diagonal stripes. Aside from being smaller, the female Nene is similar to the male in colouration. The adult&#x27;s bill, legs and feet are black. It has soft feathers under its chin. Goslings resemble adults, but are a duller brown and with less demarcation between the colors of the head and neck, and striping and barring effects are much reduced.

==Habitat and range==
The nene is an inhabitant of shrubland, grassland, coastal dunes, and lava plains, and related anthropogenic habitats such as pasture and golf courses from sea level to as much as . Some populations migrated between lowland breeding grounds and montane foraging areas.

The nene could at one time be found on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lānai, Molokai, Oʻahu and Kauai. Today, its range is restricted to Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, and Kauai. A pair arrived at the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge on Oʻahu in January 2014; two of their offspring survived and are seen regularly on the nearby golf courses at Turtle Bay Resort.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Breeding===
The breeding season of the nene, from August to April, is longer than that of any other goose; most eggs are laid between November and January. Unlike most other waterfowl, the nene mates on land. Nests are built by females on a site of her choosing, in which one to five eggs are laid (average is three on Maui and Hawaii, four on Kauai). Females incubate the eggs for 29 to 32 days, while the male acts as a sentry. Goslings are precocial, able to feed on their own; they remain with their parents until the following breeding season.

===Diet===
The nene is a herbivore that will either graze or browse, depending on the availability of vegetation. Food items include the leaves, seeds, fruit, and flowers of grasses and shrubs.

==Conservation==
The nene population stands at 3,862 birds, making it the world&#x27;s rarest goose. It is believed that it was once common, with approximately 25,000 Hawaiian geese living in Hawaii when Captain James Cook arrived in 1778. Hunting and introduced predators, such as small Indian mongooses, pigs, and feral cats, reduced the population to 30 birds by 1952. The species breeds well in captivity, and has been successfully re-introduced. In 2004, it was estimated that there were 800 birds in the wild, as well as 1,000 in wildfowl collections and zoos. There is concern about inbreeding due to the small initial population of birds. The nature reserve WWT Slimbridge, in England, was instrumental in the successful breeding of Hawaiian geese in captivity. Under the direction of conservationist Peter Scott, it was bred back from the brink of extinction during the 1950s for later re-introduction into the wild in Hawaii. There are still Hawaiian geese at Slimbridge today. They can now be found in captivity in multiple WWT centres. Successful introductions include Haleakalā and Piiholo ranches on Maui. NatureServe considers the species &quot;Imperiled&quot;.

<text>The Red River (), also called the Red River of the North () to differentiate it from the Red River in the south of the continent, is a river in the north-central United States and central Canada. Originating at the confluence of the Bois de Sioux and Otter Tail rivers between the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota, it flows northward through the Red River Valley, forming most of the border of Minnesota and North Dakota and continuing into Manitoba. It empties into Lake Winnipeg, whose waters join the Nelson River and ultimately flow into Hudson Bay.

The Red River is about long, of which about are in the United States and about are in Canada. The river falls on its trip to Lake Winnipeg, where it spreads into the vast deltaic wetland known as Netley Marsh. Several urban areas have developed on both sides of the river, including the city of Winnipeg in Canada, as well as the Fargo-Moorhead and Grand Forks–East Grand Forks metropolitan areas, both of which straddle the North Dakota–Minnesota border. Long an important highway for trade, the Red River has been designated a Canadian Heritage River.

==History==
The watershed of the Red River was part of Rupert&#x27;s Land, the concession established by the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in north central North America. The Red was a key trade route for the company, and contributed to the settlement of British North America. The river was long used by fur traders, including the French and the Métis people, who established a community in this area some time before the British defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Following that, they took over French possessions in Canada. Settlers of the Red River Colony established farming along the river, and their primary settlement developed as Winnipeg, Manitoba. What became known as the Red River Trails, nineteenth-century oxcart trails developed originally by the Métis, supported the fur trade and these settlements. They contributed to further development of the region on both sides of the international border.

==Geography==

The Red River begins at the confluence of the Bois de Sioux and Otter Tail rivers, on the border of Wahpeton, North Dakota and Breckenridge, Minnesota. Downstream, it is bordered by the twin cities of Fargo, North Dakota – Moorhead, Minnesota, and Grand Forks, North Dakota – East Grand Forks, Minnesota. It crosses the Canada–United States border just before reaching the town of Emerson, Manitoba. Manitoba&#x27;s capital, Winnipeg, is at the Red&#x27;s confluence with the Assiniboine River, at a point called The Forks. Together with the Assiniboine, the Red River fully encloses the endorheic basin of Devils&#x27; Lake and Stump Lake.

The Red flows further north before draining into Lake Winnipeg which then drains through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay, both part of the Hudson Bay watershed. The mouth of the Red River forms a freshwater river delta called the Netley–Libau Marsh. The Netley Marsh is west of the Red and the Libau Marsh is east, forming a wetland.

Southern Manitoba has a frost-free season of between 120 and 140 days per year in the Red River Valley.

==Geology==
The Red River flows across the flat lake bed of the ancient glacial Lake Agassiz, an enormous glacial lake created at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation from meltwaters of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As this continental glacier decayed, its meltwaters formed the lake. Over thousands of years, sediments precipitated to the bottom of the lakebed. These lacustrine soils are the parent soils of today&#x27;s Red River Valley. The river is very young; it developed only after Lake Agassiz drained, about 9,500 years ago.

The word &quot;valley&quot; is a misnomer. While the Red River drains the region, it did not create a valley wider than a few hundred feet. The much wider floodplain is the lake bed of the ancient glacial lake. It is remarkably flat; from its origin near Breckenridge, Minnesota, to the international border near Emerson, Manitoba, its gradient is only about 1:5000 (1 metre per 5 kilometres), or approximately 1 foot per mile. The river, slow and small in most seasons, does not have the energy to cut a gorge. Instead it meanders across the silty bottomlands in its progress north. In consequence, high water has nowhere to go, except to spread across the old lakebed in &quot;overland flooding&quot;. Heavy snows or rains, especially on saturated or frozen soil, have caused a number of catastrophic floods, which often are made worse by the fact that snowmelt starts in the warmer south, and waters flowing northward are often dammed or slowed by ice. These periodic floods have the effect of refilling, in part, the ancient lake.

==Floods==

Floods happen in the Red River when the water level increases over the tops of riverbanks due to significant precipitation over the same area for long periods, in the forms of persistent thunderstorms, rain, or snow combined with spring snow melt and ice jam. Major floods in historic times include those of 1826, 1897, 1950, 1997, 2009, 2011, and there has been significant flooding many years in between. Geologists have found evidence of many other floods in prehistoric times of equal or greater size. These &quot;paleofloods&quot; are known from their effects on local landforms, and have been the subject of scholarly studies. After the disastrous 1950 flood, which resulted in extensive property damage and losses in Winnipeg, the province of Manitoba undertook flood prevention by constructing the Red River Floodway. Completed in 1968, it diverts floodwaters around the city to less settled areas farther down the river. Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, suffered widespread destruction in the flood of 1997. 75% of the population in the former city was evacuated, and all of the latter. Many of the residential areas along the rivers were inundated and all the homes had to be destroyed. Afterward, a massive flood protection project was undertaken to protect both cities. Atashi et al. study conducted spatial analyses of the Permanent Water Area (PWA) and Seasonal Water Area (SWA), revealing a specific vulnerable section near Grafton city, located between Grand Forks and Emerson, that is highly susceptible to severe floods.

===1950 flood===

On May 8, 1950, the Red River reached its highest level at Winnipeg since 1861. Eight dikes protecting Winnipeg gave way and flooded much of the city, turning of farmland into an enormous lake. The city turned to the Canadian Army and the Red Cross and The Salvation Army for help, and nearly 70,000 people were evacuated from their homes and businesses. Four of eleven bridges in the city were destroyed, and damage was estimated at between $900 million and $1 billion.

As a result of the floods, a flood control project was constructed to prevent such damage in the future. The Red River Floodway around Winnipeg attracted some derision at the time, as some people thought it was massively overbuilt and was the then-largest earth-moving project in the world. The project was completed under-budget, and has been used for at least some flood control 20 times in the 37 years from its completion to 2006. The Floodway has saved an estimated CA$10 billion in flood damages.

===1997 flood===

In the spring of 1997 a major flood of the Red River caused a total of $3.5 billion in damage and required temporary evacuation of towns and cities on both sides of the border. The cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, suffered the most damage, and most of their populations had to be evacuated. The river crested at more than above datum.

The cities worked with FEMA and the state of Minnesota to clear the floodplains of the river on both sides, prohibiting future housing or businesses in this area. They created the Greater Grand Forks Greenway on both sides, which includes city and state parks, a long bike trail, and other recreational amenities. The trees and greenery help absorb floodwaters. A dike system was constructed outside this area on both sides to protect the cities from future floods. In East Grand Forks, a removable flood wall was constructed in the downtown area so that residents did not lose their connection to the river.

In Winnipeg, the flood crested at above datum at the James Avenue pumping station, making it the third-highest flood at Winnipeg in recorded history. It was surpassed by the floods of 1825, and 1826. The city was largely spared the fate of Grand Forks thanks to the Floodway, which was pushed to its capacity during the 1997 flood.

===2009 flood===

In 2009 the Red River flooded in early spring. By Friday, March 27, the river at Fargo had reached the highest level in recorded history. Its discharge at that location was far in excess of normal flows. The river crested at the James Avenue pumping station in Winnipeg at above datum, making it the fourth-highest flood in recorded history.

===2011 flood===

Due to a wet summer in 2010, as well as an above average amount of snowfall through the winter in the Red River Valley, the Red River spilled its banks. It crested in Winnipeg at the James Avenue pumping station at above datum, as the sixth highest flood levels in recorded history if flood protection such as the Portage Diversion and the Red River Floodway were not in place. That same year there was a surprise major flood on the Assiniboine River. In May 2011, a Manitoba-wide state of emergency was declared in the wake of a 300-year flood on the Assiniboine River at Brandon. Many residents had to be evacuated.

<text>S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) is a type of digital audio interface used in consumer audio equipment to output audio over relatively short distances. The signal is transmitted over either a coaxial cable using RCA or BNC connectors, or a fibre-optic cable using TOSLINK connectors. S/PDIF interconnects components in home theaters and other digital high-fidelity systems.

S/PDIF is based on the AES3 interconnect standard. S/PDIF can carry two channels of uncompressed PCM audio or compressed 5.1 surround sound; it cannot support lossless surround formats that require greater bandwidth.

S/PDIF is a data link layer protocol as well as a set of physical layer specifications for carrying digital audio signals over either optical or electrical cable. The name stands for Sony/Philips Digital Interconnect Format but is also known as Sony/Philips Digital Interface. Sony and Philips were the primary designers of S/PDIF. S/PDIF is standardized in IEC 60958 as IEC 60958 type II (IEC 958 before 1998).

==Applications==
A common use is to carry two channels of uncompressed digital audio from a CD player to an amplifying receiver.

The S/PDIF interface is also used to carry compressed digital audio for surround sound as defined by the IEC 61937 standard. This mode is used to connect the output of a Blu-ray, DVD player or computer, via optical or coax, to a home theatre amplifying receiver that supports Dolby Digital or DTS Digital Surround decoding.

==Hardware specifications==
S/PDIF was developed at the same time as the main standard, AES3, used to interconnect professional audio equipment in the professional audio field. This resulted from the desire of the various stakeholders to have at least sufficient similarities between the two interfaces to allow the use of the same, or very similar, designs for interfacing ICs. S/PDIF is nearly identical at the protocol level, but uses either coaxial cable (with RCA connectors) or optical fibre (TOSLINK; i.e., JIS F05 or EIAJ optical), both of which cost less than the XLR connection used by AES3. The RCA connectors are typically colour-coded orange to differentiate from other RCA connector uses such as composite video. S/PDIF uses 75 Ω coaxial cable while AES3 uses 110 Ω balanced twisted pair.

Signals transmitted over consumer-grade TOSLINK connections are identical in content to those transmitted over coaxial connectors. Optical provides electrical isolation that can help address ground loop issues in systems. The electrical connection can be more robust and supports longer connections.

==Protocol specifications==
S/PDIF is used to transmit digital signals in a number of formats, the most common being the 48 kHz sample rate format (used in Digital Audio Tape) and the 44.1 kHz format, used in CD audio. In order to support both sample rates, as well as others that might be needed, the format has no defined bit rate. Instead, the data is sent using biphase mark code, which has either one or two transitions for every bit, allowing the original word clock to be extracted from the signal itself.

S/PDIF protocol differs from AES3 only in the channel status bits; see for the high-level view. Both protocols group 192 samples into an audio block, and transmit one channel status bit per sample, providing one 192-bit &quot;channel status word&quot; per channel per audio block. For S/PDIF, the 192-bit status word is identical between the two channels and is divided into 12 words of 16 bits each, with the first 16 bits being a control code.


=== Data framing ===

S/PDIF is meant to be used for transmitting 20-bit audio data streams plus other related information. S/PDIF can also transport 24-bit samples by way of four extra bits; however, not all equipment supports this, and these extra bits may be ignored.

To transmit sources with less than 20 bits of sample accuracy, the superfluous bits will be set to zero, and the 4:1–3 bits (sample length) are set accordingly.

==== IEC 61937 encapsulation ====
IEC 61937 defines a way to transmit compressed, multi-channel data over S/PDIF.

* The control word bit 0:1 is set to indicate the presence of non-linear-PCM data.
* The sample rate is set to maintain the needed symbol (data) rate. The symbol rate is usually 64 times the sample rate.
* Data is packed into blocks. Each data block is given a IEC 61937 preamble, containing two 16-bit sync words and indicating the state and identity (type, validity, bitstream number, length) of encapsulated data present. Padding is added to match full block size as required by timing.

A number of encodings are available over IEC 61937, including Dolby AC-3/E-AC-3, Dolby TrueHD, MP3, AAC, ATRAC, DTS, and WMA Pro.

==Limitations==
The receiver does not control the data rate, so it must avoid bit slip by synchronizing its reception with the source clock. Many S/PDIF implementations cannot fully decouple the final signal from influence of the source or the interconnect. Specifically, the process of clock recovery used to synchronize reception may produce jitter. If the DAC does not have a stable clock reference then noise will be introduced into the resulting analog signal. However, receivers can implement various strategies that limit this influence.

<doc id="150055" wikidata="Q163819" url="?curid=150055" title="10,000 Maniacs">
<text>10,000 Maniacs is an American alternative rock band founded in 1981. They have released nine studio albums, six EPs, and five live albums. They achieved their most significant success between 1987 and 1993, when they released four albums that charted in the top 50 in the US: &quot;In My Tribe&quot; (1987), &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Zoo&quot; (1989), &quot;Our Time in Eden&quot; (1992), and the live album &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1993). After the recording (but before the release) of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, original lead singer and songwriter Natalie Merchant left the band to pursue a solo career, while the remaining members continued the band.

==History==
===Early years===

The band was formed as Still Life in 1981 in Jamestown, New York, by Dennis Drew (keyboards), Steven Gustafson (bass), Chet Cardinale (drums), Robert Buck (guitar), and Buck&#x27;s ex-wife Terri Newhouse (vocals). Gustafson invited Natalie Merchant, who was 17 at the time, to do some vocals. John Lombardo, who was in a band named The Mills (along with brother guitarist/vocalists Mark Liuzzo and Paul Liuzzo and drummer Mike Young) and used to play occasionally with Still Life, was invited to join permanently on guitar and vocals. Newhouse and Cardinale left the band in July, and Merchant became the main singer. Various drummers came and left. The band changed its name to Burn Victims and then to 10,000 Maniacs, inspired by the 1964 low-budget horror movie &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot;.

They performed as 10,000 Maniacs for the first time on Labor Day, September 7, 1981, with a line-up of Merchant, Lombardo, Buck, Drew, Gustafson, and Tim Edborg on drums. Edborg left and Bob &quot;Bob O Matic&quot; Wachter was on drums for most of the 1981 gigs. Tired of playing cover songs—though their first notable American hit was a cover of the Cat Stevens hit &quot;Peace Train&quot;—the band started to write their own music, usually with Merchant handling the lyrics and Lombardo the music. In March 1982, with Jim Foti on drums, the band recorded an EP album titled &quot;Human Conflict Number Five&quot;, financed by Drew&#x27;s mother. More gigs followed in 1982. During this time, they lived in Atlanta, Georgia, for a short period at the encouragement of friends who said that many gigs were available there. Discouraged by the lack of actual gigs, and by having to sell plasma and rake leaves to buy food, the band moved back to Jamestown in November 1982 to regroup.
At the beginning of 1983, Jerry Augustyniak joined the band as their permanent drummer. The Maniacs met Augustyniak when they played in Buffalo, New York, where he was in a punk band named the Stains. Between March and July, the band recorded songs for a second record, &quot;Secrets of the I Ching&quot;, their debut album, which was pressed by Mark Records for the band&#x27;s own label Christian Burial Music. The record was well received by critics and caught the attention of respected BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel in London. One song, &quot;My Mother the War&quot;, turned out to be a minor hit in the United Kingdom and entered the independent singles chart. The band toured extensively during 1983 and 1984, and played gigs in the UK.

Peter Leak, an Englishman living in New York City, became interested in the band, made contact and was made their manager. With the help of Leak and Elektra Records A &amp; R (artists and repertoire) man Howard Thompson, 10,000 Maniacs signed to Elektra in November 1984. In the spring of 1985, they recorded their second album, &quot;The Wishing Chair&quot;, in London at Livingston Studios, with Joe Boyd as producer. Though the album was not a blockbuster hit, its status as the band&#x27;s major label debut did win it some notice, and it received significant critical acclaim.

===Breakthrough success===
Frustrated with the lack of success and direction of the band, co-founder Lombardo left 10,000 Maniacs during a rehearsal on July 14, 1986. The remaining five members started recording a new album in Los Angeles with Peter Asher as the producer, who had worked extensively with artists such as James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt. &quot;In My Tribe&quot;, a more pop-rock oriented record, was released on July 7, 1987. The album stayed on the charts for 77 weeks, peaking at No. 37, and established a large U.S. audience for the group. It was also well received in the UK. The album originally contained the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Peace Train&quot;, but the song was removed from some subsequent pressings (post-1989) after the song&#x27;s writer Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam) made comments implying he agreed with a death fatwa against author Salman Rushdie.

10,000 Maniacs&#x27; next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Zoo,&quot; hit No. 13 and went gold, further increasing the group&#x27;s following. In May 1989, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that 10,000 Maniacs had won the songwriter category prize at the New York Music Awards. In 1990, with the help of Lombardo, they remastered their first two records, &quot;Human Conflict Number Five&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the I Ching&quot;, and released them as a compilation titled &quot;Hope Chest: The Fredonia Recordings 1982–1983&quot;. Lombardo and Mary Ramsey, who had formed a folk-rock act named John &amp; Mary, opened gigs for the Maniacs on the Hope Chest Tour in 1990.

The band played a handful of local concerts in 1991, but largely took a break from touring and Merchant spent most of the year working with homeless youth in Harlem. Merchant then revealed to the other members that she would be leaving 10,000 Maniacs for a solo career in two years&#x27; time, allowing for additional 10,000 Maniacs albums, while also acknowledging the financial implications of her departure. A new album, &quot;Our Time in Eden&quot;, was released on September 29, 1992. In 1993, the band performed at the MTV Inaugural Ball for President Clinton in January and on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; on April 21. Merchant made her departure from the band public in an interview on MTV on August 5, 1993, saying she &quot;didn&#x27;t want art by committee anymore.&quot; The &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album was released on October 26, 1993. &quot;The last 10,000 Maniacs gig (July 28, 1993) was the first time I&#x27;d got drunk in nearly two years,&quot; Merchant later recalled. &quot;I laughed a lot and threw lots of flowers out of the hotel window.&quot;

===1994–2001===

After Merchant&#x27;s departure, Elektra Records dropped the band while signing Merchant as a solo artist. The remaining members of 10,000 Maniacs (Augustyniak, Buck, Drew and Gustafson) asked John &amp; Mary to join the band. The revamped band began performing new material almost immediately, initially calling themselves John &amp; Mary, Rob, Steve, Dennis, &amp; Jerry; then they were able to legally regain control of the 10,000 Maniacs name. 10,000 Maniacs released two albums with Ramsey on vocals. In 1997, they released &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; with the band on a new label, Geffen Records, from which their cover of the Roxy Music song &quot;More Than This&quot; became a moderate hit, and followed up in 1999 with &quot;The Earth Pressed Flat&quot; on Bar/None.

In December 1998, Buck took some time off from the band, moving to Texas to focus on a new project named League of Blind Women. 10,000 Maniacs recruited Buffalo-based Michael Lee Jackson of the band Animal Planet to step into the lead guitar role. Buck returned to the band in the summer of 1999. On November 3, 2000, 10,000 Maniacs played with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in Buffalo, New York. It was the last concert they performed with Buck. On December 19, 2000, Buck died of liver failure at the age of 42. He was buried in the Mission Covenant Church Cemetery in Sugar Grove, Pennsylvania.

Following Buck&#x27;s death, 10,000 Maniacs took a break. Gustafson and Drew, with Jeff Erickson, started a band named The Mighty Wallop!. Augustyniak joined a band named Only Humen. On December 5, 2001, a 10,000 Maniacs line-up comprising Gustafson, Drew, Augustyniak, Lombardo and Ramsey played a benefit concert in Toronto, with Buck&#x27;s former guitar technician, Erickson, on lead guitar.

===2002–2007===

In 2002, Gustafson, Drew, and Augustyniak decided that they wished to continue 10,000 Maniacs with a new lead singer. Lombardo showed up at the first band practice, found out that the band had hired Erickson to play lead guitar and Oskar Saville of the Chicago-based band Rubygrass to sing, and quit the band. This lineup toured sporadically between 2002 and 2006, playing at various festivals.

On January 27, 2004, Elektra/Asylum/Rhino Records released &quot;Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure and Unknown Recordings&quot;, a two-CD set compilation, with 31 digitally remastered songs, four of them demos and one unreleased. The second disc contained B-sides and outtakes throughout the band&#x27;s career up to that point, including many covers. Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;These Days&quot; and Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;I Hope That I Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with You&quot; were among those included.

In 2006, John &amp; Mary formed a folk-rock band named the Valkyries. John &amp; Mary &amp; the Valkyries are composed of several longtime Buffalo music scene stalwarts. Ramsey rejoined the current edition of the band for several dates in 2006, playing viola and singing backing vocals. Saville left in 2007, and Ramsey regained the lead vocalist spot.

===2008–2022===

The band—consisting of Augustyniak, Drew, Erickson, Gustafson and Ramsey—remains active, playing shows throughout the United States. In June 2011, the band released the EP &quot;Triangles&quot; on its own label, Ruby Wristwatch Records. The band celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2011 with two sold-out concerts at the Scharmann Theater on the campus of Jamestown Community College. The band spent most of 2012 recording a new album at their studio in Jamestown, New York. In February 2013, they released the album, titled &quot;Music from the Motion Picture&quot;.

Former drummer Robert Wachter died on March 26, 2013, at the age of 49 due to a long illness.

&quot;Twice Told Tales&quot;, an album of traditional British Isles covers, was released on April 28, 2015, on Cleopatra Records. Founding member John Lombardo was brought back into the fold as creative director and to play guitar on the album and following tour. 10,000 Maniacs released its live album &quot;Playing Favorites&quot; on June 3, 2016, their first live album with Mary Ramsey on lead vocals.

===40th anniversary===
The band celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2022 with an extensive tour, billed as 10,000 Maniacs featuring Mary Ramsey, to avoid any confusion as to the status of Natalie Merchant in the band. Ramsey acknowledged the legacy of the band, and the band with Merchant, stating &quot;There are still times when I get mistaken for her, and I feel like it&#x27;s just part of the story. In the beginning it was different, because people obviously wanted to see her — that&#x27;s an understandable situation. But time has healed things up a bit, the wounds and the expectations.&quot; In 2014, Merchant looked back to her time with the band, &quot;I learned so much with 10,000 Maniacs and have great memories being with that band. I&#x27;ll never forget 1987 when it became so crazy. It was exciting and insane in terms of the schedule. It was so intense I was hospitalized. I look back fondly on that period. But I don&#x27;t think the world is craving Natalie Merchant and 10,000 Maniacs.&quot; In 2002, when Merchant was asked if she would ever get back together with the band for a tour, she stated that due to Buck&#x27;s death they could never again play together as a band.

Keyboardist Dennis Drew reflected on the 40-year history of the band, &quot;You don&#x27;t grow up thinking you&#x27;re going to do anything for 40 years. To get to this point, it&#x27;s amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel like 40 years. It&#x27;s been as natural as everything else. We have families, kids and grand-kids on the way. It&#x27;s just been our life. You don&#x27;t retire from this, I don&#x27;t think. They&#x27;ll have to take us off the stage on stretchers.&quot;

===2023–present===
In July 2023, 10,000 Maniacs announced that Mary Ramsey and Jeff Erickson would be leaving the band to pursue other interests, and Leigh Nash would be joining the band as their new lead singer. 10,000 Maniacs also announced that Matt Slocum would be joining the band as their new guitarist. Both Nash and Slocum are founding members of the band Sixpence None the Richer.

In January 2024, 10,000 Maniacs announced on their Facebook page that Nash and Slocum had left to devote time to Sixpence None the Richer, and that Ramsey had returned as lead singer, with guitarist Joe Rozler also joining the group. In April 2024 it was announced that Illinois-based musician, Ben Medina, will be joining on lead guitar.

<doc id="150056" wikidata="Q11885" url="?curid=150056" title="Axl Rose">
<text>W. Axl Rose (born William Bruce Rose Jr.; February 6, 1962) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, and has been the band&#x27;s sole constant member since its inception in 1985.

Possessing a distinctive and powerful wide-ranging voice, Rose has been named one of the greatest singers of all time by various media outlets, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Born and raised in Lafayette, Indiana, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in the early 1980s, where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands, including Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns. In 1985, he co-founded Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he had great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their first album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold. Rose&#x27;s high-profile relationships with Erin Everly and Stephanie Seymour in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s inspired multiple songs, including the number one hit &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;. However allegations of abuse by Rose caused significant controversy, as did the band&#x27;s next release &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; (1988) due to his inclusion of multiple slurs on the song &quot;One in a Million&quot;.

Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; next releases, the twin albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (1991), were widely successful; debuting at No.2 and No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide. Controversy followed Rose during the two-and-a-half-year Use Your Illusion Tour, with riots (including his arrest for inciting the Riverport Riot), rants against the media and bandmates between songs, and feuds with other artists including Metallica and Nirvana. The punk covers album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; (1993) failed to match the success of previous albums, with Rose&#x27;s cover of a Charles Manson song gaining notoriety.

After the tour, in 1994, Rose disappeared from public eye while Guns N&#x27; Roses stalled on making a new album. The band started to fall apart due to personal and musical differences, primarily between Rose and lead guitarist Slash. By the time work on a new album was underway in 1998, only Rose and keyboardist Dizzy Reed remained from the previous tour lineup. In 2001, Rose, the only remaining original member, resurfaced alongside the new lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses at Rock in Rio 3, and subsequently played the decade-long Chinese Democracy Tour to promote the long-delayed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; (2008), the most expensive rock album to ever be produced.

In 2012, Rose was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, though he requested exclusion from the Hall. Rose&#x27;s longstanding public feud with Slash ended when Slash and bassist Duff McKagan rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2016 for the record-breaking Not in This Lifetime... Tour. Also in 2016, Rose toured with AC/DC as a fill-in vocalist for two dozen shows. The NITL tour lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses continued touring in 2020, as well as occasionally released new singles.

== Early life ==
Axl Rose was born William Bruce Rose Jr. in Lafayette, Indiana, the oldest child of Sharon Elizabeth (née Lintner), then 16 years old and still in high school, and William Bruce Rose, then 20 years old. His father has been described as &quot;a troubled and charismatic local delinquent,&quot; and the pregnancy was unplanned. His parents separated when Rose was approximately two years old, prompting his father to abduct and allegedly molest him before disappearing from Lafayette. His mother then married Stephen L. Bailey and changed her son&#x27;s name to William Bruce Bailey. He has two younger siblings—a sister, Amy, and a half-brother, Stuart. (Stuart Bailey would go on to play guitar in several L.A. area bands in the early 90s (Dr. Whiskey, 
the Assassins) as well as work as a musical supervisor in Hollywood.)

As young children, both Rose and his siblings were regularly beaten. Until the age of 17, Rose believed Bailey was his natural father. He never met his biological father as an adult; William Rose Sr. was murdered in Marion, Illinois, in 1984 by a criminal acquaintance who was convicted. Rose did not learn about the murder until years later.

The Bailey household was very religious; Rose and his family attended a Pentecostal church, where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school. Rose later recalled an oppressive upbringing, stating, &quot;We&#x27;d have televisions one week, then my stepdad would throw them out because they were Satanic. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to listen to music. Women were evil. Everything was evil.&quot; He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister. Rose found solace in music from an early age. He sang in the church choir from the age of five, and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio. At Jefferson High School, he participated in the school chorus and studied piano. A second baritone, Rose began developing &quot;different voices&quot; during chorus practice to confuse his teacher. He eventually formed a band with his friends, one of whom was Jeff Isbell, later known as Izzy Stradlin. He also befriended a girl called Anna Hoon, who would later introduce him to her younger brother, Shannon, front man for Blind Melon.

At the age of 17, while going through insurance papers in his parents&#x27; home, Rose learned of his biological father&#x27;s existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, because he did not want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became a local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than twenty times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up to three months. After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends suggested he call himself Axl Rose. He legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.

== Career ==
=== 1983–1986: early years ===
Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Rose met guitarist Kevin Lawrence outside The Troubadour in West Hollywood in March 1983 and joined his band Rapidfire. They recorded a five-song demo in May 1983 at Telstar Studios in Burbank, which, after years of legal action, was released as an EP, &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;, in 2014. After parting ways with Lawrence, he formed the band Hollywood Rose with his childhood friend Izzy Stradlin, who had moved to Los Angeles in 1980, and 16-year-old guitarist Chris Weber. In January 1984, the band recorded a five-song demo featuring the tracks &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;Rocker&quot;, &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;, and &quot;Reckless Life&quot;, which was released in 2004 as &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. Guitarist Slash and drummer Steven Adler, future members of Guns N&#x27; Roses, joined Hollywood Rose before the band&#x27;s dissolution. Rose then joined L.A. Guns. While struggling to make an impact on the Hollywood music scene, Rose held down a variety of jobs, including the position of night manager at the Tower Records/Video location on Sunset Boulevard. Rose and Stradlin also smoked cigarettes for a scientific study at UCLA for the reported wages of $8 per hour ().

In March 1985, encouraged by their manager Raz Cue, Rose and his former L.A. Guns bandmate Tracii Guns formed Guns N&#x27; Roses by merging their respective bands Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns with Stradlin, drummer Rob Gardner and bassist Ole Beich. By June, after several lineup changes, the band consisted of Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The lineup debuted at The Troubadour and proceeded to play the L.A. club circuit, eventually building a devoted fan following. The band attracted the attention of several major record labels, before signing with Geffen Records in March 1986. The following December, they released the four-song EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot; on the Geffen imprint UZI Suicide.

=== 1987–1989: breakthrough with &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; ===
In July 1987, Guns N&#x27; Roses released their debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. Although the record received critical acclaim, it experienced a modest commercial start, selling as many as 500,000 copies in its first year of release. However, fueled by the band&#x27;s relentless touring and the mainstream success of the single &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;—Rose&#x27;s tribute to his then-girlfriend Erin Everly—the album rose to the No.1 position. To date, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which sold in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S.
During the band&#x27;s performance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, in August 1988, two fans were crushed to death when many in the crowd of 107,000 began slam-dancing to &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;. Rose had halted the show several times to calm the audience. From then on, he became known for personally addressing disruptive fans and giving instructions to security personnel from the stage, at times stopping concerts to deal with issues in the crowd. In 1992, Rose stated, &quot;Most performers would go to a security person in their organization, and it would just be done very quietly. I&#x27;ll confront the person, stop the song: &#x27;Guess what: You wasted your money, you get to leave.&#x27;&quot; As a result of the deaths at Monsters of Rock, the festival was canceled the following year.

In November 1988, Guns N&#x27; Roses released the stopgap album &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, which sold more than five million copies in the U.S. alone. The band – and Rose in particular – were accused of promoting racist and homophobic attitudes with the song &quot;One in a Million&quot;, in which Rose warns &quot;niggers&quot; to &quot;get out of my way&quot; and complains about &quot;faggots&quot; who &quot;spread some fucking disease&quot;. During the controversy, Rose defended his use of the racial slur by claiming, &quot;it&#x27;s a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean black.&quot; In 1992, however, he conceded that the song reflected his initial and impressionable perspective when he first arrived in Los Angeles in his late teens, where he experienced culture shock to a lifestyle very much different from the conservative town he grew up in. Rose stated &quot;I was pissed off about some black people [who] were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people. I didn&#x27;t want to support racism.&quot; In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose said he considered himself &quot;pro-heterosexual&quot; but is &quot;not against [homosexuals] doing what they want to do as long as it&#x27;s not hurting anybody else and they&#x27;re not forcing it upon [him]&quot;. He blamed this attitude on &quot;bad experiences&quot; with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father. The controversy led to Guns N&#x27; Roses being dropped from the roster of an AIDS benefit show in New York organized by the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis.
With the success of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; and &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, Rose found himself lauded as one of rock&#x27;s most prominent frontmen. By the time he appeared solo on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in August 1989, his celebrity was such that the influential music magazine agreed to his absolute requirement that the interview and accompanying photographs would be provided by two of his friends, writer Del James and photographer Robert John. MTV anchorman Kurt Loder described Rose as &quot;maybe the finest hard rock singer currently on the scene, and certainly the most charismatic&quot;.

=== 1990–1993: international success with &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; ===
In early 1990, Guns N&#x27; Roses returned to the studio to begin recording the full-length follow-up to &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. Recording sessions initially proved unproductive due to Steven Adler&#x27;s struggle with drug addiction, which made him unable to perform and caused sessions to be delayed for several days at a time. Adler was fired the following July and replaced by Matt Sorum of the Cult. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed also joined the band that year at Rose&#x27;s insistence. Sorum and Reed played their first show with Guns N&#x27; Roses at Rock in Rio 2 in January 1991. The group fired its long-time manager, Alan Niven, in May of that year; Rose reportedly forced the dismissal of Niven against the wishes of his bandmates by refusing to complete the new album until Niven was gone. He was replaced by roadie Doug Goldstein, whom Izzy Stradlin described as &quot;the guy who gets to go over to Axl&#x27;s at six in the morning after he&#x27;s smashed his $60,000 grand piano out of the picture window&quot;.

In May 1991, still without an album to promote, the band embarked on the two-and-a-half-year Use Your Illusion Tour, which became known for its financial success and myriad controversial incidents that occurred during shows, including late starts, on-stage rantings and even riots. Rose received much criticism for his late appearances at concerts, sometimes taking the stage hours after the band was scheduled to perform. In July 1991, 90 minutes into a concert at the Riverport Amphitheater near St. Louis, after on-stage requests from Rose for security personnel to confiscate a fan&#x27;s video camera, Rose himself dived into the crowd to seize it. After being pulled back on stage, he announced, &quot;Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I&#x27;m going home!&quot; and departed, following which some 2,500 fans staged a riot, resulting in an estimated $200,000 in damages.

In September 1991, with enough material completed for two albums, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which debuted at No.2 and No.1 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a feat not achieved by any other group. By the albums&#x27; release, however, Rose&#x27;s relationships with his bandmates had become increasingly strained. His childhood friend Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the group in November 1991; he was replaced by Gilby Clarke of Kill For Thrills. Of his reasons for leaving, Stradlin said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N&#x27; Roses,&quot; citing the riot and Rose&#x27;s chronic lateness as examples, as well as his new-found sobriety making it difficult to be around other bandmates&#x27; continued alcohol and substance abuse.
On April 20, 1992, Rose performed with Elton John at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium singing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; as a duet with John and also sang &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;.

Another riot occurred in August 1992 at Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; appearance, Metallica&#x27;s set was cut short after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N&#x27; Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault in relation to the Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years&#x27; probation.

Guns N&#x27; Roses played its final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour on July 17, 1993, at River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires; it proved to be Rose&#x27;s last live performance with the band for seven and a half years. The following August, Rose testified in court against Steven Adler, who had filed a lawsuit contending that he had been illegitimately fired. When the judge ruled against Rose, he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $2,500,000 and 15% of the royalties for everything Adler recorded prior to his departure. In November of that year, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Rose had included the hidden track &quot;Look at Your Game, Girl&quot;, a song written by convicted murderer Charles Manson, which he intended as a personal message to his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Seymour. Controversy ensued, and the band subsequently pledged to donate any royalties to the son of one of Manson&#x27;s victims.

=== 1994–2000: hiatus ===
Without consultation from his bandmates, Rose did not renew Gilby Clarke&#x27;s contract with the band in June 1994, as he claimed Clarke to be only a &quot;hired hand&quot;. Tension between Rose and Slash reached a breaking point after the latter discovered that Rose had hired his childhood friend Paul &quot;Huge&quot; Tobias as Clarke&#x27;s replacement. Although the band recorded material during this time, it was ultimately not used because, according to Rose, their lack of collaboration prevented them from producing their best work.

In August 1995, Rose legally left the band and created a new partnership under the band&#x27;s name, a step he said he took &quot;to salvage Guns not steal it&quot;. Rose reportedly purchased the full rights to the Guns N&#x27; Roses name in 1997. Slash claimed he and other bandmates signed away rights to the name before the July 5, 1993 show in Barcelona, Spain with Axl delivering an ultimatum: they had to sign the name over to him or he would not perform. (In 2008, however, Rose said Slash&#x27;s claims were false and that the alleged coercion would have rendered the contract legally untenable.)

Slash finally left Guns N&#x27; Roses in October 1996 due to his differences with Rose, while Matt Sorum was fired in June 1997 after an argument over Tobias&#x27;s involvement in the band. Duff McKagan departed the band in August of that year, leaving Rose and Dizzy Reed as the only remaining band members of the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; era.

As the stability of Guns N&#x27; Roses collapsed, Rose withdrew from public view. The band never officially broke up, although it did not tour or perform for several years and no new material was released. Rose continued to recruit new musicians to replace band members who either left or were fired. By the late 1990s, he was considered to be a recluse, rarely making public appearances and spending most of his time in his mansion in Malibu. In various media reports, he was referred to as the &quot;Howard Hughes of rock&quot; and &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest recluse&quot;. Rose was said to spend his nights rehearsing and writing with the various new lineups of Guns N&#x27; Roses, working on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;.

=== 2001–2011: touring in support of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; ===
After a warmup show in Las Vegas a few weeks earlier, Rose resurfaced with Guns N&#x27; Roses at Rock in Rio 3 on January 14, 2001, to commence the decade-long Chinese Democracy Tour, though the majority of its scheduled concerts over the next two years did not take place. A surprise appearance at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards was followed by an incident in November when a riot erupted at Vancouver&#x27;s General Motors Place after Rose failed to show up for a scheduled concert. When venue staff announced the cancellation, a riot broke out, resulting in an estimated $100,000 in damages. As the band&#x27;s lineup continued to evolve, his constant bandmates were guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy Stinson, and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman.

After the tour was canceled by the promoter, Rose again withdrew from the public view. During this time, he joined Slash and Duff McKagan in a lawsuit against Geffen Records in an unsuccessful attempt to block the release of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album, and lent his voice to the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, as the DJ for the radio station, K-DST. In a rare interview in January 2006, Rose said &quot;people will hear music this year.&quot; While Guns N&#x27; Roses toured extensively throughout 2006 and 2007, with several guest appearances by Izzy Stradlin, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; again failed to materialize. Rose did collaborate with his friend Sebastian Bach on his album &quot;Angel Down&quot;.

Fifteen years after its last album, in November 2008, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did not contribute to the album&#x27;s promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing for at least two months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose said he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album&#x27;s release, in December 2009, Guns N&#x27; Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4.

=== 2012–present: Hall of Fame and regrouping; AC/DC ===
Together with the other members of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; classic lineup, Rose was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, their first year of eligibility. He did not attend the induction ceremony in April, however, as he had announced in an open letter three days prior. Rose, who had long been on bad terms with several of his former bandmates, wrote that the ceremony &quot;doesn&#x27;t appear to be somewhere I&#x27;m actually wanted or respected&quot;. He subsequently joined his band in residencies at The Joint in Las Vegas in 2012 and 2014, as part of the Appetite for Democracy Tour celebrating the anniversaries of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; and &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. By mid-2014, the group&#x27;s new album, recorded concurrently with &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, and a remix album were completed and pending release, but no new material emerged.

Rose and Slash reunited for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, one of the most-anticipated reunion tours in rock history. Alongside Dizzy Reed and returning member Duff McKagan, who had previously made guest appearances with the band, they comprised two-thirds of the band&#x27;s &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot;-era lineup, with &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;-era members Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer joining new member Melissa Reese to fill in the rest of the lineup. Rose shared a stage with Slash for the first time in nearly 23 years during the group&#x27;s surprise performance at The Troubadour in April 2016, ahead of its headlining shows at Coachella. The tour was a massive success, and became the third highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

On April 16, 2016, Australian hard rock band AC/DC announced that Rose would be joining them and performing as the lead singer for the remainder of the band&#x27;s Rock or Bust World Tour, after long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson had to stop touring due to hearing problems. Subsequent reports indicated that guitarist Angus Young would be continuing the band with Rose as its official lead singer. This did not happen however; on September 30, 2020, AC/DC officially announced that Brian Johnson, along with Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams had returned to the band in 2018 and recorded an album, showing that Rose only stepped in to help finish the tour and that he was never brought in to replace Johnson.

In 2018, Rose appeared in an episode of &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; as himself, singing an original song &quot;Rock the Rock&quot;. In 2021, Rose again appeared as himself in a cartoon, this time &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot;.

Rose and Guns N&#x27; Roses continued touring after the Not In This Lifetime... Tour, with the Guns N&#x27; Roses 2020 Tour. The group released two singles in 2021, &quot;Absurd&quot; and &quot;Hard Skool&quot;, the first release of newly recorded material since 2008. Hard Skool was heavily praised in comparison to Absurd, which was precorded in 1999.

In 2023, Rose and the band would release the two singles &quot;Perhaps&quot; and &quot;The General&quot;, the latter having a music video uploaded to YouTube on January 24. In addition, they performed live in Indio, California on October.

== Personal life ==

During Rose&#x27;s late teens, a psychiatrist concluded that his delinquent behavior was evidence of psychosis. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In addition, the psychiatrist made note of his high IQ. In a subsequent interview, Rose questioned the diagnosis altogether: 
In contrast to his public image, Rose was not a heavy drug user, though he did not disavow the use of illicit substances entirely and occasionally dabbled. Rose intentionally overdosed on painkillers in 1986 due to stress, stating: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t take it. And I just grabbed the bottle of pills in an argument and just gulped them down and I ended up in the hospital.&quot; Rose&#x27;s experience at the hospital inspired the lyrics to the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Coma&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Rose became a staunch believer in homeopathic medicine, and began regularly undergoing past life regression therapy. He went public with his &quot;uncovered memories&quot; of being sexually abused by his biological father at the age of two, which he said had stunted his emotional growth: &quot;When they talk about Axl Rose being a screaming two-year-old, they&#x27;re right.&quot; His dislike of touring was caused in part by the various illnesses he contracted over time. He expressed his belief that these health problems were caused by him unconsciously lowering his own resistance as a form of &quot;self-punishment&quot;. During the recordings of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, Rose had a personal psychic who would look at photographs of potential employees to &quot;read the auras&quot; and decide if they should be hired.

In early 1986, Rose began a relationship with Erin Everly, the daughter of singer Don Everly of the Everly Brothers. He wrote the song &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; for her, and Everly appeared in the accompanying music video. Rose and Everly were married on April 28, 1990, in Las Vegas. Less than a month later, Rose first filed for divorce. The couple later reconciled, during which Everly became pregnant. The couple picked out baby names, Shiloh Blue if a boy, and Willow Amelia if a girl. She suffered a miscarriage in October 1990, which deeply affected Rose, who had wanted to start a family. Everly left Rose in November after an altercation; they annulled their marriage in January 1991.

In mid-1991, Rose became involved in a tumultuous high-profile relationship with supermodel Stephanie Seymour. During their relationship, Seymour appeared in the music videos for &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain&quot;. Rose became deeply attached to Seymour&#x27;s young son, Dylan, and tried to be a good father figure for the child, as there had been none in his own life. Seymour and Rose became engaged in February 1993, but separated three weeks later.

In response to an informal study that named him the &#x27;World&#x27;s Greatest Singer&quot; based on a study of vocal ranges, Rose told &quot;Spin&quot; in 2014, &quot;If I had to say who I thought the best singers were, I&#x27;d say first that I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a definitive answer as in my opinion it&#x27;s subjective, and second that my focus is primarily rock singers. That said, I enjoy Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, Paul McCartney, Dan McCafferty, Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Roger Daltrey, Don Henley, Jeff Lynne, Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Scott, Etta James, Fiona Apple, Chrissie Hynde, Stevie Wonder, James Brown and a ton of others (predominantly Seventies rock singers) and would rather hear any of them anytime rather than me!&quot; Rose later cited Queen as his favorite band, and Mercury as his favorite singer.

On April 28, 2015, Rose sent a letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo asking Widodo to remove the option of the death penalty in the case of the Bali Nine on grounds of humanitarianism. Rose then criticized Widodo for &quot;ignoring the international outcry&quot; after two were executed.

Rose has used Twitter to criticize various figures in the Trump administration, as well as other figures such as Apple CEO Tim Cook. On May 7, 2020, he used Twitter to criticize Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for the Trump administration&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, to which Mnuchin responded.

Rose was close friends with Lisa Marie Presley,
and performed November Rain at her memorial service after her death in 2023.

==Legal issues==
Rose was arrested over 20 times as a teenager in Indiana.

Rose and Slash were charged with statutory rape in 1985 after Rose allegedly had sexual relations with a minor. Rose was quoted as saying: &quot;This hippy chick wandered in and started fucking with our equipment trying to break stuff. So eventually she wound up running down Sunset naked, all dingy, and didn&#x27;t even know her own name.&quot; After Rose and Slash spent several weeks being fugitives hiding from police, the charges against them were dropped due to lack of evidence.

In November 1987, Rose was arrested onstage after assaulting a security guard during a show. Rose was held backstage and allowed to leave if he apologized to the guards, but refused and was arrested.

In 1990, Rose was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly hitting his next-door neighbor on the head with an empty wine bottle. Rose stated that the neighbor swung a wine bottle at him after he responded to her yelling. There had also been frequent incidents between the two over loud music being played. The run-ins with his neighbor inspired the lyrics to the song &quot;Right Next Door To Hell&quot; on &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;.

In 1992, Rose was arrested for his role in the Riverport Riot, which took place the previous year after Rose cut short a concert at a venue near St. Louis, Missouri. Rose was found guilty of property damage and assault. He was fined $50,000 and given two years probation.

Rose was arrested in 1998 at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona for threatening an airport guard who was searching his luggage. He was charged with a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. Rose&#x27;s publicist stated the incident was a &quot;simple misunderstanding and that Rose was simply trying to protect a fragile memento he had been given.&quot;

Rose was arrested in Sweden in June 2006 for biting a security guard in the leg. The guard had confronted Rose who was arguing with a woman in a hotel lobby. Rose was deemed too intoxicated to be questioned right away by police. He was fined $5,500 for the incident as well as ordered to pay $1,360 in damages to the guard.

===Lawsuits===
In 1992, the audience member who Rose attacked during the Riverport Riot sued him for $210,000 in damages. Rose settled out of court for $160,000.

After separating in 1993, Rose sued Stephanie Seymour claiming she assaulted him at a 1992 Christmas Party. Seymour filed a counter-suit claiming assault and battery by Rose. Both lawsuits were eventually settled out of court. In 1994, Rose&#x27;s ex-wife Erin Everly filed a suit accusing Rose of physical and emotional abuse throughout their relationship. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

In 2004, Rose unsuccessfully sued to prevent the release of &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, featuring early recordings from his band Hollywood Rose. Later that year, Rose was joined by former bandmates Slash and Duff McKagan in unsuccessfully suing to prevent the release of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Slash and McKagan then sued Rose over publishing and songwriting credits in 2006, which Rose claimed were due to a clerical error when switching publishers.

In 2010, former band manager Irving Azoff sued Rose, seeking $1.87 million in unpaid fees related to touring. In a counter-suit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and sabotaged their record sales to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N&#x27; Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff&#x27;s company Live Nation as the promoter.

In November 2010, Rose sued Activision, the publishers of the video game &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, for $20million, claiming Activision had violated an agreement with him to not include any reference to Slash or his band Velvet Revolver in the game in return for a license to use the song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;. Instead, Rose noted that an image of Slash was used on the game&#x27;s front cover. Rose&#x27;s claim was summarily dismissed in February 2013, when the judge ruled that Rose had not brought suit on the contract, which relied on oral promises, within the two-year statute of limitations that began with the game&#x27;s October 2007 release.

Rose threatened legal action in 2014 over the release of Rapidfire (his pre-Hollywood Rose band) recordings, keeping them from digital storefronts for a period of time.

In May 2016, Rose sent a series of DMCA takedown notices to Google, in an attempt to suppress a 2010 image of him that was taken by a &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; photographer and reposted by Gauntlet, under the headline &quot;OMFG Axl Rose is Fat.&quot;, leading to a Streisand effect.

In August 2016, former Guns N&#x27; Roses keyboardist Chris Pitman sued Rose for $125,000 in unpaid wages. The two parties settled in November 2016.

On November 22, 2023, Rose was sued by former &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet, model, and actress Sheila Kennedy, who is claiming that he sexually assaulted her in his hotel room after meeting him in a New York nightclub in 1989. The suit is being filed in New York under the Adult Survivors Act, state legislation which gives sexual assault victims the ability to sue their alleged abusers even if the statute of limitations have expired. The lawsuit was filed two days before the filing period closed. Kennedy previously mentioned being assaulted by Rose in her 2016 memoir &quot;No One&#x27;s Pet&quot; and in the 2021 documentary &quot;Look Away&quot;, which covered women who claimed to be sexually abused in the music industry. Rose&#x27;s attorney said the claim is &quot;fictional&quot; and that Rose has no recollection of ever meeting or spending time with Kennedy.
On February 21, 2024, Rose and his legal team filed to dismiss the lawsuit.

<text>Barrington Ainsworth Levy (born 30 April 1964) is a Jamaican reggae and dancehall artist.

==Career==

Levy was born in Clarendon, Jamaica. He formed a band called the Mighty Multitude, with his cousin, Everton Dacres; the pair released &quot;My Black Girl&quot; in 1977. Levy established his solo career the following year with the release of &quot;A Long Time Since We Don&#x27;t Have No Love&quot;; though the single was a failure, the fourteen-year-old was a popular performer at Jamaican dancehalls. In an August 2014 interview with Midnight Raver, record producer Delroy Wright revealed that it was his brother Hyman Wright who first met Barrington Levy in the mid-1970s through Wade &quot;Trinity&quot; Brammer. According to Delroy Wright, Hyman Wright recorded a host of tracks with Barrington Levy prior to introducing him to Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes. These tracks would eventually appear on the album &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;, which was released on the Jah Life record label. Both record producers recorded several singles with the Roots Radics, including &quot;Ah Yah We Deh&quot;, &quot;Looking My Love&quot;, &quot;Englishman&quot;, &quot;Skylarking&quot;, &quot;Wedding Ring Aside&quot; and &quot;Collie Weed&quot;, all of which became hits and established Levy&#x27;s career. Levy&#x27;s next few singles were similarly successful, including &quot;Shine Eye Girl&quot;, &quot;Wicked Intention&quot;, &quot;Jumpy Girl&quot;, &quot;Disco Music&quot;, &quot;Reggae Music&quot;, &quot;Never Tear My Love Apart&quot;, &quot;Jah&quot;, &quot;You Made Me So Happy&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Young and in Love&quot;. Levy then recorded several duets with Toyan, Jah Thomas and Trinity, and appeared at Reggae Sunsplash in 1980 and 1981. Although albums were not terribly important in Jamaica at the time, Levy released four albums before 1980: &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot;, &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;, &quot;Shine Eye Gal&quot; (United Kingdom) and &quot;Englishman&quot;, a critically acclaimed record. His success led to many earlier studio and sound system performances being reissued without his consent, releases he described as &quot;joke business&quot;.

By the time his 1980 album &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was released, Levy was one of the biggest Jamaican stars, and saw his international fame growing as well, especially in the United Kingdom. Levy made his debut as a producer on the rare 1981 showcase album titled &quot;Run Come Ya&quot;, which was issued on the Canadian Puff Records label.

Taking a break from albums, Levy then released a series of hit singles, including &quot;Mary Long Tongue&quot;, &quot;In the Dark&quot;, &quot;Too Poor&quot;, &quot;I Have a Problem&quot;, &quot;Eventide Fire a Disaster&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;, &quot;You Have It&quot;, &quot;Love of Jah&quot;, &quot;Under Mi Sensi&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot;, &quot;Robberman&quot;, &quot;Black Roses&quot;, &quot;My Woman&quot; and &quot;Money Move&quot;. He began working with Paul &quot;Jah Screw&quot; Love and toured the UK in 1984, where he enjoyed a big hit on the reggae charts with &quot;Under Mi Sensi&quot;, which was followed by the crossover hit &quot;Here I Come&quot;, which reached number 41 in the UK Singles Chart in 1985. He returned to LPs with &quot;Lifestyle&quot; and &quot;Money Move&quot;, followed by a British hit album called &quot;Here I Come&quot;; Levy received the Best Vocalist prize at the British Reggae Awards in 1984. The late 1980s saw Levy, now in his twenties, slow down his recorded output, though he continued to perform and record regularly, and played at Sunsplash every year from 1987 to 1995. His fortunes were revived by two cover versions of Bob Andy songs - &quot;My Time&quot; and &quot;Too Experienced&quot;, both produced by Jah Screw, and he was signed by Island Records in 1991 for the &quot;Divine&quot; album. In 1991 he returned to the UK chart with &quot;Tribal Base&quot;, a single by Rebel MC featuring Levy and Tenor Fly, which reached number 20. In 1993, Levy tried to break in the United States with the &quot;Barrington&quot; album, produced by Lee Jaffe, Andre Betts and Sly &amp; Robbie, but it failed to give him the breakthrough he wanted and his relationship with MCA Records was short-lived.

In the 1990s, Levy continued to release periodic hits in Jamaica, and more rarely in the UK, although his vocals were sampled and used in many underground and released jungle tunes. On 20 June 1991, he appeared on the BBC One music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; alongside Rebel MC (Congo Natty) and Tenor Fly as his track &quot;Here I Come&quot; was sampled by Rebel MC, with the record becoming the UK Top 40 hit &quot;Tribal Base&quot;. 

In 1998, he released &quot;Living Dangerously&quot;, which included a collaboration with one of Jamaica&#x27;s most prolific deejays, Bounty Killer, and with Snoop Dogg. The release was one of Levy&#x27;s most successful since the start of the 1990s, and saw him finally achieve some success in the US. Levy performed on two tracks on Long Beach Dub All Stars 1999 album &quot;Right Back&quot;, and also played a few shows with the band. He was featured on a 1999 track by the Rascalz titled &quot;Top of the World&quot;, also featuring K-os. Levy also appeared on two singles by rapper Shyne (&quot;Bad Boyz&quot; and &quot;Bonnie &amp; Shyne&quot;), and on a track for drum and bass artist Aphrodite&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Aftershock&quot;. &quot;Here I Come&quot; returned to the charts in 2001, with a new version by Levy and Talisman P reaching number 37 in the UK.

In 2004, he contributed to a track on the album &quot;White People&quot; by Handsome Boy Modeling School, a project by Prince Paul and Dan the Automator. He also did some collaborations with Slightly Stoopid on their 2005 album &quot;Closer to the Sun&quot;. Most recently, Levy made a guest appearance on the single &quot;No Fuss&quot; by Red-1 of the Rascalz, from his 2007 album &quot;Beg For Nothing&quot;.

In September 2013, he released the single &quot;Love the Way She Love&quot;, a collaboration with Mr. Vegas, and announced an acoustic album featuring new songs and reworkings of old songs such as &quot;Prison Oval Rock&quot; and &quot;Black Roses&quot;. His album, &quot;Acousticalevy&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2016.

In 2021, Levy was featured on the Gorillaz track &quot;Meanwhile&quot; alongside Jelani Blackman.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Levy at number 119 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. He performed on the West Holts stage at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival.

Since 2011 Levy has been working on his long-awaited album &quot;Survivor&quot; (the album originally had the working title &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. In 2017 he released the first single from the album &quot;GSOAT&quot; yet the album remains unreleased.

Raised in Hong Kong and Britain, she started her career after placing second in 1983&#x27;s Miss Hong Kong Pageant. She achieved critical success in the late 1980s and into the early 2000s, before taking a break from acting following her last starring role in 2004. She rarely makes public appearances except for fashion events and award ceremonies.

Cheung has won numerous accolades at home and abroad for her acting. She won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress 5 times in the span of 11 years from 1990 to 2001, and holds the record for most wins in that category. She also holds the record for most wins for the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress in Taiwan, having won 4 times. In the West, she was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress at Berlin International Film Festival in 1992 and Best Actress at Cannes Film Festival in 2004. In 2004, she became the first Asian actress to be nominated for the French César Award for Best Actress.

Her most acclaimed performances include &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, &quot;Center Stage&quot;, &quot;Green Snake&quot;, &quot;Irma Vep&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Soong Sisters&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Clean&quot;. The Wong Kar-wai–directed &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), in which she plays a cheongsam-wearing character opposite male lead Tony Leung, is a classic in both the film and fashion worlds.

==Early life and education==
Maggie Cheung was born in Hong Kong on 20 September 1964 to Shanghainese parents. She attended St. Paul&#x27;s Primary Catholic School in Happy Valley, where she began at the primary one level. Her family emigrated from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom when she was eight. She spent part of her childhood and adolescence in Bromley, London, and attended St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury. She returned to Hong Kong at the age of 18 in 1982 for a vacation but ended up staying for modelling assignments and other commitments. She also briefly had a sales job at the Lane Crawford department store.

In 1983, Cheung entered the Miss Hong Kong pageant and won the first runner-up and the Miss Photogenic award as well. She was a semi-finalist in the Miss World pageant the same year. After two years as a TV presenter, it led to a contract with TVB (the television arm of the Shaw Bros. Studio).

Cheung is a polyglot as a result of her upbringing in Hong Kong and England and ten years&#x27; stay in Paris. In &quot;Center Stage&quot;, Cheung performed in Cantonese, Mandarin, and Shanghainese fluently, switching languages with ease. In &quot;Clean&quot;, she performed in fluent English, French, and Cantonese.

==Career==
Soon after her debut, Cheung broke into the film industry, starring in comedies. She caught the attention of Jackie Chan, who cast her in &quot;Police Story&quot; (1985) as May, his long-suffering girlfriend. The film was a huge hit and made Cheung a star overnight. Cheung was slated to star in TVB&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of the General Who Never Was&quot;, but due to the death of Barbara Yung who was in the midst of filming &quot;Battlefield&quot;, and &quot;The Feud That Never Was&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Kings of Ideas&quot; (), Yung&#x27;s remaining scenes were assigned to Cheung, and Cheung&#x27;s role was given to Sheren Tang.

Despite her success, Cheung found herself typecast in the roles of comics or weak, clumsy women. Realizing this, Cheung wanted to break away by seeking more dramatic roles. She got this opportunity when Wong Kar-wai cast her in &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (1988), her first of many collaborations with Wong. Cheung often cites the film as the piece that truly began her serious acting career, and she won critical praise for it. In 1989, she won Best Actress awards at the Golden Horse Award and Hong Kong Film Award for her work in &quot;Full Moon in New York&quot; and &quot;A Fishy Story&quot; respectively. In 1991, she became the first Chinese performer to win a Best Actress Award at the prestigious Berlin Film Festival for her work in &quot;Center Stage&quot;.

Cheung subsequently proved her versatility with roles in action films. Her performance in the sci-fi martial arts smash hit &quot;The Heroic Trio&quot; (1992) and its sequel, &quot;Executioners&quot; (1993), impressed both critics and audiences with her martial arts skills. Also in a departure from her usual roles, Cheung played a beautiful and vicious femme fatale in &quot;New Dragon Gate Inn&quot; (1992).

After taking a break in 1994, Cheung returned to film Olivier Assayas&#x27; &quot;Irma Vep&quot; (1996), which helped her break into the international scene. That same year, she won further acclaim for her work in the romantic film &quot;&quot;, in which she played one of a pair of lovers kept apart for ten years by fate and circumstance. The following year, she made her first English-language film in Wayne Wang&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997). Cast as a mysterious young woman named Jean, Cheung held her own alongside the more internationally well-established stars, Jeremy Irons and Gong Li.

After her 1998 marriage to Olivier Assayas, Cheung stayed mainly in France. She returned to Hong Kong to film &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), which won critical acclaim and a second Taiwanese Golden Horse award for Cheung. Thereafter, she starred in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot; (2002) and Wong&#x27;s &quot;2046&quot; (2004). She won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role as a mother who tries to kick her drug habit and reconcile with her long-lost son in &quot;Clean&quot; (2004).
Cheung was a jury member at the 1997 Berlin Film Festival, the 1999 Venice Film Festival, the 2004 Hawaii International Film Festival, the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, and the 2010 Marrakech International Film Festival. And for the first time in its history, the 59th Cannes Film Festival (2006) used a photographic image of a real actress on its poster – that of Cheung.

On 7 February 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; rated Cheung as one of the 22 Great Performers in 2006 for her Cannes winning role as Emily in &quot;Clean&quot;. After 25 years of making movies, she decided to retire from acting to pursue a career as a film composer. She had mentioned she would like to compose music and paint after having fulfilled her acting potential. Her last film appearance was as Mazu, Chinese goddess of the sea, in the film &quot;Ten Thousand Waves&quot; (2010) by British filmmaker and installation artist Isaac Julien.

As UK&#x27;s &quot;Independent&quot; puts it, since her Cannes moment in 2004, Cheung &quot;turned her back on film&quot; and has shifted her focus to philanthropy, making music, and editing. In April 2010, Cheung was appointed as UNICEF&#x27;s Ambassador to China. In July 2011, she was awarded a doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; at the University of Edinburgh. Cheung retired from acting in 2013 and has since kept a low profile.

Cheung has provided celebrity endorsement for Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.

==Post-retirement==
In May 2014, Cheung performed at the 2014 Shanghai Strawberry Music Festival. In June 2019, during a guest appearance on Mango TV reality show &quot;&quot; in which she mentored boyband Next, Cheung spoke frankly about her 2014 performance&#x27;s poor reception.

In 2015, Cheung composed and performed the theme song &quot;If You Were Gone&quot; () for the anthology film Cities in Love. According to producer Gu Xiaodong, Cheung dedicated almost half a year to producing the song. In June 2022, Cheung performed a DJ set at the grand opening of a new Gucci store at The Landmark in Hong Kong.

==Personal life==
Cheung married French director Olivier Assayas in 1998; they divorced in 2001. She began a relationship with German architect Ole Scheeren in 2007. The relationship ended in 2011.

In 2020, the Singaporean publication &quot;Today&quot; wrote that Cheung had no plans to return to acting, instead devoting her time to fashion, music, and producing and editing films.

<doc id="150061" wikidata="Q1163330" url="?curid=150061" title="Maharaja">
<text>Maharaja (also spelled Maharajah or Maharaj; ; feminine: Maharani) is an Indian princely title of Sanskrit origin. In modern India and medieval northern India, the title was equivalent to a prince. However in late ancient India and medieval south India, the title denoted a king.

The form &quot;Maharaj&quot; (without &quot;-a&quot;) indicates a separation of noble and religious offices, although since in Marathi the suffix &quot;-a&quot; is silent, the two titles are near homophones. Historically, the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; was first introduced in the first century BC by the Kushans as a higher ranking variant of &quot;Raja&quot;. Eventually, during the medieval era, the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; came to be used by sovereign princes and vassal princes, and the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; was used by sovereign kings. Eventually, during the Mughal and British eras, Maharajadhiraja too came to be used by princes, though it was used by sovereign kings as well, such as the King of Maratha. 

The title ranks under the titles of Maharajadhiraja Bahadur, Maharajadhiraja and Maharaja Bahadur, equal to Maharana and Maharao and above Raja Bahadur, Raja and Rai.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Maharaja&quot; originates in Sanskrit and is a compound karmadhāraya term from &quot;mahānt-&quot; &quot;great&quot; and &quot;rājan&quot; &quot;ruler, king&quot;). It has the Latin cognates &quot;magnum&quot; &quot;great&quot; and &quot;rex&quot; &quot;king&quot;. Due to Sanskrit&#x27;s major influence on the vocabulary of most languages in Greater India and Southeast Asia, the term Maharaja is common to many modern Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. The Sanskrit title Maharaja was originally used only for rulers who ruled a considerably large region with minor tributary rulers under them. Since medieval times, the title was used by (Hindu) monarchs of lesser states claiming descent from ancient maharajas.

== Indian subcontinent ==
===Raja as a ruler&#x27;s title===
On the eve of independence in 1947, the Indian Empire contained more than 600 princely states, each with its own native ruler, often styled Raja or Rana or Thakur (if the ruler were Hindu) or Nawab (if he were Muslim), with a host of less current titles as well.

The British directly ruled two-thirds of the Indian subcontinent; the rest was under indirect rule by the above-mentioned princes under the considerable influence of British representatives, such as Residents, at their courts.

The word Maharaja may be understood simply to mean &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;king&quot;, in spite of its literal translation as &quot;great king&quot;. This was because only a handful of the states were truly powerful and wealthy enough for their rulers to be considered &#x27;great&#x27; monarchs; the remaining were minor princely states, sometimes little more than towns or groups of villages. The word, however, can also mean emperor in contemporary Indian usage.

The title of Maharaja was not as common before the gradual British colonisation of India, upon and after which many rajas and otherwise styled Hindu rulers were elevated to Maharajas, regardless of the fact that scores of these new Maharajas ruled small states, sometimes for some reason unrelated to the eminence of the state, for example, support to the British in Afghanistan, World War I or World War II. The Maharaja of Punjab in the 19th century was Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He earned this title by keeping the Britishers beyond the Sutlej and even crushed the Afghan Empire. Maharajas in the twentieth century were the Maharaja of Cochin and Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala. Apart from princely states, rulers of some large and extended zamindaris were also awarded the title of Maharaja. The rulers of Jeypore, Darbhanga, Vizianagaram, Parlakhemundi Gidhaur were a few zamindars who were titled Maharaja for their cordiality and contribution to the British Raj.
* Variations of this title include the following, each combining &quot;Maha-&quot; &quot;great&quot; with an alternative form of Raja &#x27;king&#x27;, so all meaning &#x27;Great King&#x27;: &quot;Maharana&quot; (as in Udaipur), ‘’maharaj rana ( as in Jhalawar, ’’ Maharawal&quot; (as in Dungarpur/Jaisalmer), &quot;Maharawat&quot; (Pratapgarh), &quot;Maharao&quot; (as in Kotah, Bundi) and &quot;Maharaol&quot; (as in Baria).
* &quot;Maharajah&quot; has taken on new spellings due to the time change and migration. It has even been shortened to &quot;Mahraj&quot; and &quot;Maraj&quot; but the most common is &quot;Maharajah&quot; and &quot;Maharaj&quot;.
* Despite its literal meaning, unlike many other titles meaning Great King, neither Maharaja nor &quot;Rajadhiraja&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;), nor even its equivalent amongst. Maharaja, &#x27;Maharajadhiraja&#x27;, never reached the standing required for imperial rank, as each was soon the object of title inflation. Instead, the Indian title which is commonly rendered as Emperor is Samrat or Samraj(a), a personal distinction achieved only by the Mauryans and the Vakataka ruler Pravarasena I. Muslim equivalent of emperor would be Padshah (of Persian origin), notably applied to the Mughal dynasty, the paramount power until the British established their raj.

===Compound and dynastic ruler titles===
* &quot;Dharma-maharaja&quot; was the devout title (compare Rajadharma) of the rulers of the Ganga dynasty.

In the Mughal Empire it was quite common to award to various princes (hereditary or not) a series of lofty titles as a matter of protocolary rank. The British would, as paramount power do the same.
Many of these (see also above) elaborate explicitly on the title Maharaja, in the following descending order:
* &quot;Maharajadhiraja Bahadur&quot; (or &quot;Maharajadhiraj Bahadur&quot;): a title of honour, one degree higher than Maharajadhiraja.
* &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; (or &quot;Maharajadhiraj&quot;): one degree higher than Sawai Maharaja Bahadur.
* &quot;Sawai Maharaja Bahadur&quot;: a title of honour, one degree higher than Sawai Maharaja. (the term &quot;bahadur&quot;, originally &#x27;brave&#x27; in Persian, was often used for &#x27;one-degree&#x27; higher&#x27;, and &#x27;sawai&#x27; is &#x27;one and a quarter higher&#x27;, i.e. just a step above bahadur)
* &quot;Sawai Maharaja&quot;: a title of honour one degree higher than Maharaja Bahadur; as granted (directly) to the Rajas of Ajaygarh.
* &quot;Maharaja Bahadur&quot;: a title of honour, one degree higher than Maharaja.



Furthermore, there were various compound titles simply including other princely styles, such as:
* &quot;Maharaja Chatrapati&quot; in Satara, the paramount state of the Maratha Confederacy
* H.H. the &quot;Maharaj Rana&quot; of Jhalawar
* &quot;Maharaja-i-Rajgan&quot;: great prince amongst princes
* &quot;Maharaja Sena Sahib Subah&quot; of Nagpur, another Maratha state
* &quot;Maharaj Babu&quot;: A Rajput title similar to Maharaja. Used by the ruling Chiefs of Hazari Estate, Dohazari of South Chittagong.
* For details concerning various titles containing sahib, see there

Certain Hindu dynasties even came to use a unique style, including a term which as such is not of princely rank, e.g. Maharaja Gaikwar of Baroda, Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior, Maharaja Holkar of Indore, three of the very highest ranking ruling Maratha houses.

===Chakravarti===
Chakravarti is a Sanskrit term for &quot;emperor&quot;. The meaning of chakravarti is &quot;he, whose wheels (of chariot) are moving&quot; which symbolises that the leader who is a war hero, who commands over vast land and sea, the one who rules the people with dedication. In the Mahabharata, the Chakravarti Bharat is known to have ruled the entire sub-continent of India brought golden age to his empire. He is called as chakravarti. The wife of a Chakravartin or a female Chakravartin is called a Chakaravartini.

===Yuvaraja===
Yuvaraja means the crown prince of the kingdom or empire. He is granted with certain powers and responsibilities so that he can be prepared to take over as the Maharaja. His wife is called Yuvarani.

===Rajakumara===
Rajakumara is the son of a king who is not the heir apparent. He is conferred with certain duties or powers per the king&#x27;s wishes. The daughter of a king who is not the heir apparent is called Rajakumari.

=== Maharani ===
Maharani usually denotes the wife of a Maharaja (or Maharana, Maharao, Maharawal) or in rare cases, in some states where it was customary, a woman ruling without a husband.
===Rajamata===
In cases where a child king is crowned, the mother of the king takes charge of the kingdom and acts as a regent. Until the young king is of the age, the Rajmata (Queen mother) administers the kingdom. Famous examples include Rajamata Shetu Lakshmi Bai of Travancore dynasty, Gowri Lakshmi Bai, Maharaji (later Rajamata) Rudrama Devi of Kakatiya dynasty. When the king is present, the Rajamata being the mother of the king, might be given ceremonial roles. A famous Rajamata who functioned with the king is Rajamata Jijabai of the Maratha Kingdom, accompanying the Chhatrapati (king).

===Noble and honorary use===
Like &quot;Raja&quot; and various other titles, &quot;Maharaja&quot; was repeatedly awarded to notables without a princely state, such as zamindars.
* One Raja of Lambagraon, a Jagir (in Himachal Pradesh) who served in the colonial army was granted personally the non-hereditary title of Maharaja of Kangra-Lambagraon and a personal 11-guns salute, so neither honour passed on to his son and heir.
* In the major, Muslim realm of Hyderabad and Berar, there was a system of ennobling titles for the Nizam&#x27;s courtiers, conferring a specific rank without any (e)state of their own, not unlike peerage titles without an actual fief in the UK, the highest titles for Hindu nobles being &quot;Maharaja Bahadur&quot; and &quot;Maharaja&quot;, above &quot;Vant, Raja Rai-i-Rayan Bahadur, Raja Rai Bahadur, Raja Bahadur, Raja&quot; and &quot;Rai&quot;; for their Muslim counterparts there were alternative titles, the highest being Jah and Umara; e.g. the Diwan (Prime Minister) Maharaja Sir Kishen Pershad, held such a Maharaja-title.

===Derived style for princes of the blood===
&quot;Maharaj Kumar&quot; (or Maharajkumar) means son of a Maharaja or Heir-Apparent; the female equivalent is &quot;Maharaj Kumari (Maharajkumari&quot;): daughter of a Maharaja.

=== Nepal ===

The Gorkha Kings of Nepal (now a republic) used the title of Mahārājādhirāja which was &quot;King of Great Kings&quot;, a title of honour, a degree higher than Mahārājā.
Rana Prime ministers of Nepal used the title of Shree Teen Maharaja while the Gorkha Kings used Shree Panch Maharajadhiraja.

== Southeast Asia ==
=== Dali ===
Duan Xingzhi, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Dali, submitted to the Mongol Empire, and in return was enfeoffed as Maharaja (摩诃罗嵯) of Dali, continuing to rule the area (but subordinated to Yuan princes and Muslim governors of Yunnan), until the Ming conquest of Yunnan.

===Indonesia===

When the Indonesian Archipelago was still predominantly Hindu-Buddhist (circa 3rd century CE until the 15th century CE), all of the Indianised kingdoms which ruled different areas of the archipelago was ruled by a &quot;Maharaja&quot; or simply referred by the locals as &quot;Raja&quot;, such as the first and oldest Hindu kingdom of Indonesia the Kutai Martadipura in eastern Borneo, the Tarumanegara, the Srivijaya, the Majapahit and numerous other kingdoms. Traditional titles remain in use for other members of royalty, such as Pangeran Ratu for the heir and other local-Malay titles such as &quot;Paduka Sri&quot;. The title &quot;Maharaja&quot; has been used to refer to kings of ancient Indianised kingdoms, such as Maharaja Mulavarman king of Kutai Martadipura and Maharaja Purnawarman king of Tarumanegara.

Maharaja was also part of the titles of the nobility in the Sumatran sultanate of Aceh. In the past, the title of Maharaja is given to a leader of the unreigning noble family and the Prime Minister Maharaja Mangkubumi. The last Prime Minister of Aceh who was installed to be the Maharaja Mangkubumi, Habib Abdurrahman el Zahir, who also acted as the foreign affairs minister of Aceh but was deposed and exiled to Jeddah by the colonial Dutch East Indies authorities in October 1878.

===Malaysia===
In peninsular Malaysia:
* Maharaja was the title of the monarch of the peninsular Malay state of Johor(e) from 1873 to 1885. The Arabic, Muslim title Sultan, often considered of higher rank, was re-adopted later and remains in current usage.
* The title Bendahara Seri Maharaja was used by the ruler of Pahang (1623–1853 in personal union with Johor, eventually becoming a fief of the Bendahara family), till on 6 August 1882 Tuanku Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah ibni al-Marhum Tun Ali adopted the title, Sultan.

In northern Borneo, the title Maharajah of Sabah and Rajah of Gaya and Sandakan was used from 29 December 1877 to 26 August 1881 by Baron von Overbeck (compare White Rajah).

The Englishman Capt. James Brooke was declared as Rajah Brooke by the Sultan of Brunei for his role in pacifying the Sarawak revolt against the Sultan during the Raffles&#x27; stint. The word &quot;Rajah&quot; derived from the word Maharaja. In 1842, the Sultan of Brunei ceded Sarawak to Rajah Brooke who founded the Kingdom of Sarawak and a line of dynastic monarchs known as the White Rajahs.

In contemporary Malay usage, the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; refers to an emperor, e.g. &quot;Maharaja Jepun&quot; (&quot;Emperor of Japan&quot;).

=== Brunei ===
In Seri Malayas of the Srivijaya, under the Srivijaya satellite empire of the Majapahit Empire dominated over the whole Malayas far-reaching the present Philippine Archipelago, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia under the Srivijaya Empire of the Majapahit King Maharaja Pamariwasa. The latter&#x27;s daughter Es-kander was married to an Arab (Zein Ul-Abidin), the third Makdum who promulgated Koranic studies (Madrassahs) and was a Srivijaya ruler in Seri who were a Srivijaya Monarchy. In the 12th century with the fall of the empire, the Seri King being a Muslim established the Sultanate of Brunei in 1363 with the throne name Sultan Mohamad Shah. In 1426, he established the sultanate of sulu as his death was recorded in 1431 Mt. Makatangis Sulu grave and 1432 Brunei grave. Both Sulu and Brunei claim the honor of his grave, while his brother, a Johore (Singapore) Prince Makdum Karim (Sharif Kabungsuwan of Malabang Lanao) the second Makdum after the first one Makdum Tuan Masha&#x27;ik. Karim ul-makdum re=enforced Islam, a Srivijaya Johore ruler, later established the Sultanate of Maguindanao-Ranao (Mindanao) after taking the political authority of his father-in-law Tomaoi Aliwya of the Maguiindanao family dynasty. He adapted the title as sultan Aliwya (Sharif Kabungsuwan), the first Maguindanao Sultan. The second and third Makdum&#x27;s father was Sultan Betatar of Taif Arabia who was the 9th progeny of Hasan, the grandson of prophet Sayyidina Muhammad.

=== Compound Malay titles ===
The word can also be part of titles used by Malay nobility:
* &quot;Maharaja Lela&quot; was the title of the ruler of the State of Naning (founded 1641), until it was annexed by the United Kingdom to Malacca in 1832.
Most famous was Bendahara Seri Maharaja Tun Mutahir of Malacca (executed 1509) and Datuk Maharaja Lela Pandak Lam of Perak (executed 1876).

The palace marshal of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (head of state) of modern Malaysia is called &quot;Datuk Maharaja Lela Penghulu Istana Negara&quot;.

Eventually, Maharajah Adinda was also used to refer to a particular lineage within the royal families.

=== Thailand ===

The King of Thailand has been called a &quot;Maharaj&quot; ().

<doc id="150062" wikidata="Q1149185" url="?curid=150062" title="Goodstein's theorem">
<text>In mathematical logic, Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is a statement about the natural numbers, proved by Reuben Goodstein in 1944, which states that every Goodstein sequence (as defined below) eventually terminates at 0. Laurence Kirby and Jeff Paris showed that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as second-order arithmetic or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory). This was the third example of a true statement about natural numbers that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic, after the examples provided by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem and Gerhard Gentzen&#x27;s 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of ε0-induction in Peano arithmetic. The Paris–Harrington theorem gave another example.

Kirby and Paris introduced a graph-theoretic hydra game with behavior similar to that of Goodstein sequences: the &quot;Hydra&quot; (named for the mythological multi-headed Hydra of Lerna) is a rooted tree, and a move consists of cutting off one of its &quot;heads&quot; (a branch of the tree), to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules. Kirby and Paris proved that the Hydra will eventually be killed, regardless of the strategy that Hercules uses to chop off its heads, though this may take a very long time. Just like for Goodstein sequences, Kirby and Paris showed that it cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic alone.

== Hereditary base-&quot;n&quot; notation ==
Goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called &quot;hereditary base-&quot;n&quot; notation&quot;. This notation is very similar to usual base-&quot;n&quot; positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein&#x27;s theorem.

To achieve the ordinary base-&quot;n&quot; notation, where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number &quot;m&quot; is written as a sum of multiples of powers of &quot;n&quot;:
:formula_1
where each coefficient &quot;ai&quot; satisfies , and . For example, to achieve the base 2 notation, one writes
:formula_2
Thus the base-2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means . Similarly, 100 represented in base-3 is 10201:
:formula_3
Note that the exponents themselves are not written in base-&quot;n&quot; notation. For example, the expressions above include 25 and 34, and 5 &gt; 2, 4 &gt; 3.

To convert a base-n notation (which is a step in achieving base-&quot;n&quot; representation) to a hereditary base-&quot;n&quot; notation, first rewrite all of the exponents as a sum of powers of &quot;n&quot; (with the limitation on the coefficients ). Then rewrite any exponent inside the exponents in base-&quot;n&quot; notation (with the same limitation on the coefficients), and continue in this way until every number appearing in the expression (except the bases themselves) is written in base-&quot;n&quot; notation.

For example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is , it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as
:formula_4
using the fact that Similarly, 100 in hereditary base-3 notation is
:formula_5

== Goodstein sequences ==

The Goodstein sequence formula_6 of a number &quot;m&quot; is a sequence of natural numbers. The first element in the sequence formula_6 is &quot;m&quot; itself. To get the second, formula_8, write &quot;m&quot; in hereditary base-2 notation, change all the 2s to 3s, and then subtract 1 from the result. In general, the term, formula_9, of the Goodstein sequence of &quot;m&quot; is as follows:
* Take the hereditary base- representation of formula_10.
* Replace each occurrence of the base- with .
* Subtract one. (Note that the next term depends both on the previous term and on the index &quot;n&quot;.)
* Continue until the result is zero, at which point the sequence terminates.

Early Goodstein sequences terminate quickly. For example, formula_11 terminates at the 6th step:

Later Goodstein sequences increase for a very large number of steps. For example, formula_12 starts as follows:

Elements of formula_12 continue to increase for a while, but at base formula_14,
they reach the maximum of formula_15, stay there for the next formula_14 steps, and then begin their descent.

However, even formula_12 doesn&#x27;t give a good idea of just &quot;how&quot; quickly the elements of a Goodstein sequence can increase.
formula_18 increases much more rapidly and starts as follows:

In spite of this rapid growth, Goodstein&#x27;s theorem states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0, no matter what the starting value is.

== Proof of Goodstein&#x27;s theorem ==

Goodstein&#x27;s theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;), we construct a parallel sequence &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) of ordinal numbers in Cantor normal form which is strictly decreasing and terminates. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) goes to 0 &quot;because&quot; it is dominated by &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). Actually, the fact that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) dominates &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) plays no role at all. The important point is: &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;k&quot;) exists if and only if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;k&quot;) exists (parallelism), and comparison between two members of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is preserved when comparing corresponding entries of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). Then if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) terminates, so does &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). By infinite regress, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) must reach 0, which guarantees termination.

We define a function formula_19 which computes the hereditary base representation of and then replaces each occurrence of the base with the first infinite ordinal number ω. For example, formula_20.

Each term &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;) of the sequence &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is then defined as &quot;f&quot;(&quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;),&quot;n+1&quot;). For example, and . Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined.

We claim that formula_21:

Let formula_22 be &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;) after applying the first, 
&quot;base-changing&quot; operation in generating the next element of the Goodstein sequence, 
but before the second &quot;minus 1&quot; operation in this generation. 
Observe that formula_23.

Then formula_24. Now we apply the &quot;minus 1&quot; operation, and formula_25, as formula_26.
For example, formula_27 and formula_28, so formula_29 and formula_30, which is strictly smaller. Note that in order to calculate &quot;f(G(m)(n),n+1)&quot;, we first need to write &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;) in hereditary base notation, as for instance the expression formula_31 is not an ordinal.

Thus the sequence &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is strictly decreasing. As the standard order &lt; on ordinals is well-founded, an infinite strictly decreasing sequence cannot exist, or equivalently, every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals terminates (and cannot be infinite). But &quot;P&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;) is calculated directly from &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;). Hence the sequence &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) must terminate as well, meaning that it must reach 0.

While this proof of Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is fairly easy, the &quot;Kirby–Paris theorem&quot;, which shows that Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of countable nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic.

=== Extended Goodstein&#x27;s theorem ===
The above proof still works if the definition of the Goodstein sequence is changed so that the base-changing operation replaces each occurrence of the base &quot;b&quot; with instead of .
More generally, let &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;3, ... be any non-decreasing sequence of integers with .
Then let the 
term of the extended Goodstein sequence of &quot;m&quot; be as
follows:
* Take the hereditary base &quot;bn&quot; representation of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)(&quot;n&quot;).
* Replace each occurrence of the base &quot;bn&quot; with .
* Subtract one.
An simple modification of the above proof shows that this sequence still terminates. For example, if and if ,
then
formula_32, hence the ordinal formula_33 is strictly greater than the ordinal formula_34

The extended version is in fact the one considered in Goodstein&#x27;s original paper, where Goodstein proved that it is equivalent to the restricted ordinal theorem (i.e. the claim that transfinite induction below ε0 is valid), and gave a finitist proof for the case where formula_35 (equivalent to transfinite induction up to formula_36).

The extended Goodstein&#x27;s theorem without any restriction on the sequence &quot;bn&quot; is not formalizable in Peano arithmetic (PA), since such an arbitrary infinite sequence cannot be represented in PA. This seems to be what kept Goodstein from claiming back in 1944 that the extended Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is unprovable in PA due to Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem and Gentzen&#x27;s proof of the consistency of PA using ε0-induction. However, inspection of Gentzen&#x27;s proof shows that it only needs the fact that there is no primitive recursive strictly decreasing infinite sequence of ordinals, so limiting &quot;bn&quot; to primitive recursive sequences would have allowed Goodstein to prove an unprovability result. Furthermore, with the relatively elementary technique of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, it can be shown that every primitive recursive strictly decreasing infinite sequence of ordinals
can be &quot;slowed down&quot; so that it can be transformed to a Goodstein sequence where , thus giving an alternative proof to the same result Kirby and Paris proved.

== Sequence length as a function of the starting value ==

The Goodstein function, formula_37, is defined such that formula_38 is the length of the Goodstein sequence that starts with &quot;n&quot;. (This is a total function since every Goodstein sequence terminates.) The extremely high growth rate of formula_39 can be calibrated by relating it to various standard ordinal-indexed hierarchies of functions, such as the functions formula_40 in the Hardy hierarchy, and the functions formula_41 in the fast-growing hierarchy of Löb and Wainer:

* Kirby and Paris (1982) proved that
:formula_39 has approximately the same growth-rate as formula_43 (which is the same as that of formula_44); more precisely, formula_39 dominates formula_40 for every formula_47, and formula_43 dominates formula_49
:(For any two functions formula_50, formula_51 is said to dominate formula_52 if formula_53 for all sufficiently large formula_54.)

* Cichon (1983) showed that
:formula_55
:where formula_56 is the result of putting &quot;n&quot; in hereditary base-2 notation and then replacing all 2s with ω (as was done in the proof of Goodstein&#x27;s theorem).

* Caicedo (2007) showed that if formula_57 with formula_58 then
:formula_59.

Some examples:
(For Ackermann function and Graham&#x27;s number bounds see fast-growing hierarchy#Functions in fast-growing hierarchies.)

== Application to computable functions ==

Goodstein&#x27;s theorem can be used to construct a total computable function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove to be total. The Goodstein sequence of a number can be effectively enumerated by a Turing machine; thus the function which maps &quot;n&quot; to the number of steps required for the Goodstein sequence of &quot;n&quot; to terminate is computable by a particular Turing machine. This machine merely enumerates the Goodstein sequence of &quot;n&quot; and, when the sequence reaches &quot;0&quot;, returns the length of the sequence. Because every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates, this function is total. But because Peano arithmetic does not prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates, Peano arithmetic does not prove that this Turing machine computes a total function.

<text>Hugo Lafayette Black (February 27, 1886 – September 25, 1971) was an American lawyer, politician, and jurist who served as a U.S. Senator from Alabama from 1927 to 1937 and as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1937 to 1971. A member of the Democratic Party and a devoted New Dealer, Black endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt in both the 1932 and 1936 presidential elections.

Before he became a senator, Black espoused anti-Catholic views and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. An article from the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reports that he temporarily resigned from the Klan in 1925 to bolster his senatorial campaign, before quietly rejoining in 1926. In 1937, upon being appointed to the Supreme Court, Black said: &quot;Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have had nothing to do with it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization.&quot; Black served as the secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference and the chair of the Senate Education Committee during his decade in the Senate. Having gained a reputation in the Senate as a reformer, Black was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Roosevelt and confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 63 to 16 (six Democratic Senators and 10 Republican Senators voted against him). He was the first of nine Roosevelt appointees to the court, and he outlasted all except for William O. Douglas.

The fifth longest-serving justice in Supreme Court history, Black was one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the 20th century. He is noted for using historical evidence to support textualist arguments, his position that the liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights were imposed on the states (&quot;incorporated&quot;) by the Fourteenth Amendment, and his absolutist stance on the First Amendment, often declaring &quot;No law [abridging the freedom of speech] means no law.&quot; Black expanded individual rights in his opinions in cases such as &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;, and &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot;.

Black&#x27;s views were not uniformly liberal. During World War II, he wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944), which upheld the internment of Japanese Americans ordered by the president Franklin Roosevelt. During the mid-1960s, Black became slightly more conservative. Black opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the pre-1937 Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of this concept made it impossible for the government to enact legislation that conservatives claimed interfered with the freedom of business owners), and believed that there was no basis in the words of the Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965). He also took conservative positions in cases such as &quot;Shapiro v. Thompson&quot;, &quot;Goldberg v. Kelly&quot;, &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines&quot;, and &quot;Cohen v. California&quot; where he distinguished between &quot;pure speech&quot; and &quot;expressive conduct&quot;.

==Early years==
Black was born in Harlan, Clay County, Alabama, on February 27, 1886, the youngest of eight children born to William Lafayette Black and Martha (Toland) Black. In 1890 the family moved to Ashland, the county seat. The family came from a Baptist background.

Black attended Ashland College, an academy located in Ashland, then enrolled at the University of Alabama School of Law. He graduated in 1906 with an LL.B. degree, was admitted to the bar, and began to practice in Ashland. In 1907, Black moved to the growing city of Birmingham, where he built a successful practice that specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.

As a consequence of his defense of an African American who was forced into a form of commercial slavery after incarceration, Black was befriended by A. O. Lane, a judge connected with the case. When Lane was elected to the Birmingham City Commission in 1911, he asked Black to serve as a police court judgehis only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court. In 1912, Black resigned to return to practicing law full time. In 1914, he began a four-year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney.

During World War I, Black resigned to join the United States Army. He served in the 81st Field Artillery, and attained the rank of captain as the regimental adjutant. When the regiment departed for France, its commander was ordered to return to Fort Sill to organize and train another regiment, and he requested Black as his adjutant. The war ended before Black&#x27;s new unit departed the United States, and he returned to law practice. He joined the Birmingham Civitan Club during this time, eventually serving as president of the group. He remained an active member throughout his life, occasionally contributing articles to Civitan publications.

In the early 1920s, Black became a member of the Robert E. Lee Klan No. 1 in Birmingham, and he resigned in 1925. In 1937, after his confirmation to the Supreme Court, it was reported he had been given a &quot;grand passport&quot; in 1926, granting him life membership to the Ku Klux Klan. In response to this news, Black said he had never used the passport and had not kept it. He further stated that when he resigned he completely discontinued his Klan association, that he had never resumed it, and that he expected never to resume his membership.

On February 23, 1921, he married Josephine Foster, with whom he had three children: Hugo L. Black, II (1922–2013), an attorney; Sterling Foster (1924–1996), and Martha Josephine (1933–2019). Josephine died in 1951; in 1957, Black married Elizabeth Seay DeMeritte.

==Senate career==

In 1926, Black sought election to the United States Senate from Alabama, following the retirement of Senator Oscar Underwood. Since the Democratic Party had dominated Alabama politics since disenfranchising most blacks (and Republicans) at the turn of the century, Black easily defeated his Republican opponent, E. H. Dryer, winning 80.9% of the white vote. He was reelected in 1932, winning 86.3% of the vote against Republican J. Theodore Johnson. Senator Black gained a reputation as a tenacious investigator. In 1934, he chaired the committee that looked into the contracts awarded to air mail carriers under Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown, an inquiry which led to the Air Mail scandal. To correct what he termed abuses of &quot;fraud and collusion&quot; resulting from the Air Mail Act of 1930, he introduced the Black–McKellar Bill, later the Air Mail Act of 1934. The following year he participated in a Senate committee&#x27;s investigation of lobbying practices. He publicly denounced the &quot;highpowered, deceptive, telegram-fixing, letterframing, Washington-visiting&quot; lobbyists, and advocated legislation requiring them to publicly register their names and salaries.

In 1935, during the Great Depression, Black became chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, a position he would hold for the remainder of his Senate career. On August 8, 1935, Black, who was chairman of the senate committee investigating lobbying activities, went on NBC&#x27;s &quot;National Radio Forum&quot;. The national audience was shocked to hear Black speak of a $5million electric industry lobbying campaign attempt to defeat the Wheeler–Rayburn bill, known as the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 that had passed in July. The act directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to close down the country&#x27;s corrupt electric holding companies. Black gave a dramatic speech on this four-decade-long political battle.

Critics of Black&#x27;s lobbying committee in leading newspapers, such as the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, described his investigative methods as both &quot;inquisitorial&quot; and &quot;terroristic&quot; and charged that his goal was to intimidate and silence anti-New Dealers. Most controversially, Black, with the backing of the Roosevelt administration, sought to get FCC to order Western Union and other telegraph companies to provide access to copies to several million telegrams sent during the period of February 1 to September 1, 1935. Committee and FCC staffers examined the telegrams at the rate of several thousand per day. The committee&#x27;s goal was to uncover content that had bearing on lobbying, which it defined very broadly to include just about any political commentary. People who had their private telegrams examined included every member of Congress as well as leaders of anti-New Deal organizations. When Black&#x27;s investigation of these telegrams became public knowledge, there was a major outcry in the press. On March 11, 1936, Chief Justice Alfred A. Wheat of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (later renamed the District Court of D.C.) granted an injunction prohibiting the committee from any further examination of more telegrams on the grounds that they secured though against unreasonable search and seizure.

In 1937 he sponsored the Black–Connery Bill, which sought to establish a national minimum wage and a maximum workweek of thirty hours. Although the bill was initially rejected in the House of Representatives, an amended version of it, which extended Black&#x27;s original maximum workweek proposal to forty-four hours, was passed in 1938 (after Black left the Senate), becoming known as the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Black was an ardent supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. In particular, he was an outspoken advocate of the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, popularly known as the court-packing bill, FDR&#x27;s unsuccessful plan to expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court.

Throughout his career as a senator, Black gave speeches based on his belief in the ultimate power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; in his view, the court was improperly overturning legislation that had been passed by large majorities in Congress.

During his Senate career, Black consistently opposed the passage of anti-lynching legislation, as did all of the white Democrats of the Solid South. In 1935 Black led a filibuster of the Wagner-Costigan anti-lynching bill. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post Gazette&quot; reported that when a motion to end the filibuster was defeated, &quot;[t]he southerners—headed by Tom Connally of Texas and Hugo Black of Alabama—grinned at each other and shook hands.&quot;

==Appointment to the Supreme Court==

Soon after the failure of the court-packing plan, President Roosevelt obtained his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired. Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a &quot;thumping, evangelical New Dealer&quot; who was reasonably young, confirmable by the Senate, and from a region of the country unrepresented on the court. The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed, Sherman Minton, and Hugo Black. Roosevelt said Reed &quot;had no fire&quot;, and Minton did not want the appointment at the time. The position would go to Black, a candidate from the South, who, as a senator, had voted for all 24 of Roosevelt&#x27;s major New Deal programs. Roosevelt admired Black&#x27;s use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape the American mind on reforms, his strong voting record, and his early support, which dated back to 1933. Both Reed and Minton were later appointed to the Supreme Court; Reed was the next Justice appointed by Roosevelt, while Minton was appointed by Harry Truman in 1949.

On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt nominated Black to fill the vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, on this occasion, the nomination was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public. But Black was a close friend of Walter Francis White, the black executive secretary of the NAACP, who helped assuage critics of the appointment. &quot;Chambers v. Florida&quot; (1940), an early case where Black ruled in favor of African-American criminal defendants who experienced due process violations, later helped put these concerns to rest.

The Judiciary Committee recommended Black for confirmation by a vote of 13–4 on August 16, and the full Senate took up the nomination the next day. Rumors of Black&#x27;s involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination; no conclusive evidence was presented tying Black to the klan. After rejecting 15–66 a motion to recommit the nomination to the Judiciary Committee for further review, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm on August 17, 1937; ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against. He was sworn into office on August 19, 1937. Shortly after, Black&#x27;s KKK membership became known and there was widespread outrage; nonetheless Black went on to become a prominent champion of civil liberties and civil rights.

Alabama governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black&#x27;s vacated Senate seat. On Black&#x27;s first day on the bench, three lawyers contested Black&#x27;s appointment on the basis of the Ineligibility Clause. The court dismissed this concern in the same year in &quot;Ex parte Levitt&quot;.

==Supreme Court career==
As soon as Black started on the court, he advocated judicial restraint and worked to move the court away from interposing itself in social and economic matters. Black vigorously defended the &quot;plain meaning&quot; of the Constitution, rooted in the ideas of its era, and emphasized the supremacy of the legislature; for Black, the role of the Supreme Court was limited and constitutionally prescribed.

During his early years on the Supreme Court, Black helped reverse several earlier court decisions that were based on a narrow interpretation of federal power. Many New Deal laws that would have been struck down under earlier precedents were thus upheld. In 1939 Black was joined on the Supreme Court by Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas. Douglas voted alongside Black in several cases, especially those involving the First Amendment, while Frankfurter soon became one of Black&#x27;s ideological foes. From 1945 until 1971, Black was the senior associate justice of the Supreme Court. As of 2023, Black is the most recent sitting Supreme Court justice to have received his legal education from a public law school.

===Relationship with other justices===
In the mid-1940s, Justice Black became involved in a bitter dispute with Justice Robert H. Jackson as a result of &quot;Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Local 6167, United Mine Workers&quot; (1945). In this case the court ruled 5–4 in favor of the UMW; Black voted with the majority, while Jackson dissented. However, the coal company requested the court rehear the case on the grounds that Justice Black should have recused himself, as the mine workers were represented by Black&#x27;s law partner of 20 years earlier. Under the Supreme Court&#x27;s rules, each Justice was entitled to determine the propriety of disqualifying himself. Jackson agreed that the petition for rehearing should be denied, but refused to give approval to Black&#x27;s participation in the case. Ultimately, when the court unanimously denied the petition for rehearing, Justice Jackson released a short statement, in which Justice Frankfurter joined. The concurrence indicated that Jackson voted to deny the petition not because he approved of Black&#x27;s participation in the case, but on the &quot;limited grounds&quot; that each Justice was entitled to determine for himself the propriety of recusal. At first the case attracted little public comment. However, after Chief Justice Harlan Stone died in 1946, rumors that President Harry S. Truman would appoint Jackson as Stone&#x27;s successor led several newspapers to investigate and report the &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; controversy. Black and Douglas allegedly leaked to newspapers that they would resign if Jackson were appointed Chief. Truman ultimately chose Fred M. Vinson for the position.

In 1948, Justice Black approved an order solicited by Abe Fortas that barred a federal district court in Texas from further investigation of significant voter fraud and irregularities in the 1948 Democratic primary election runoff for United States Senator from Texas. The order effectively confirmed future president Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s apparent victory over former Texas governor Coke Stevenson.

In the 1960s, Black clashed with Fortas, who by that time had been appointed as an associate justice. In 1968, a Warren clerk called their feud &quot;one of the most basic animosities of the Court&quot;.

===1950s and beyond===
Vinson&#x27;s tenure as chief justice coincided with the Second Red Scare, a period of intense anti-communism in the United States. In several cases the Supreme Court considered, and upheld, the validity of anticommunist laws passed during this era. For example, in &quot;American Communications Association v. Douds&quot; (1950), the court upheld a law that required labor union officials to forswear membership in the Communist Party. Black dissented, claiming that the law violated the First Amendment&#x27;s free speech clause. Similarly, in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, , the court upheld the Smith Act, which made it a crime to &quot;advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States&quot;. The law was often used to prosecute individuals for joining the Communist Party. Black again dissented, writing:

Public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that, in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society.
Beginning in the late 1940s, Black wrote decisions relating to the Establishment Clause, where he insisted on the strict separation of church and state. The most notable of these was &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.

In 1953 Vinson died and was replaced by Earl Warren. While all members of the court were New Deal liberals, Black was part of the most liberal wing of the court, together with Warren, Douglas, William Brennan, and Arthur Goldberg. They said the court had a role beyond that of Congress. Yet while he often voted with them on the Warren Court, he occasionally took his own line on some key cases, most notably &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), which established that the Constitution protected a right to privacy. In not finding such a right implicit in the Constitution, Black wrote in his dissent that &quot;Many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written... about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times... For myself, I must with all deference reject that philosophy.&quot;

Black&#x27;s most prominent ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955. They disagreed on several issues, including the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states, the scope of the due process clause, and the one man, one vote principle.

Black had a number of law clerks who became notable in their own right, including Judges Louis F. Oberdorfer, Truman McGill Hobbs, Guido Calabresi, and Drayton Nabers Jr., Professors John K. McNulty, Stephen Schulhofer, and Walter E. Dellinger III, Mayor David Vann, FCC Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, US solicitor general Lawrence G. Wallace, and trial lawyer Stephen Susman.

==Jurisprudence==

Black&#x27;s jurisprudence is among the most distinctive of any members of the Supreme Court in history and has been influential on justices as diverse as Earl Warren, and Antonin Scalia.

Black&#x27;s jurisprudence had three essential components: history, literalism, and absolutism. Black&#x27;s love of history was rooted in a lifelong love of books, which led him to the belief that historical study was necessary for one to prevent repeating society&#x27;s past mistakes. Black wrote in 1968 that &quot;power corrupts, and unrestricted power will tempt Supreme Court justices just as history tells us it has tempted other judges.&quot;

Second, Black&#x27;s commitment to literalism involved using the words of the Constitution to restrict the roles of the judiciary—Black would have justices validate the supremacy of the country&#x27;s legislature, unless the legislature itself was denying people their freedoms. Black wrote: &quot;The Constitution is not deathless; it provides for changing or repealing by the amending process, not by judges but by the people and their chosen representatives.&quot; Black would often lecture his colleagues, liberal or conservative, on the Supreme Court about the importance of acting within the limits of the Constitution.

Third, Black&#x27;s absolutism led him to enforce the rights of the Constitution, rather than attempting to define a meaning, scope, or extent to each right. Black expressed his view on the Bill of Rights in his opinion in &quot;Adamson v. California&quot; (1947), which he saw as his &quot;most significant opinion written&quot;:

I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn 18th century &#x27;strait jacket&#x27;... Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And it is true that they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the expense of the many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.

In a 1968 public interview, reflecting on his most important contributions, Black put his dissent from &quot;Adamson&quot; &quot;at the top of the list, but then spoke with great eloquence from one of his earliest opinions in &quot;Chambers v. Florida&quot; (1940).

===Judicial restraint===
Black intensely believed in judicial restraint and reserved the power of making laws to the legislatures, often scolding his more liberal colleagues for what he saw as judicially created legislation. Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black: &quot;No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations that go with them.&quot; Conservative Judge Robert Bork wrote, &quot;Justice Black came to have significantly more respect for the limits of the Constitution than Justice Douglas and the other leading members of the Warren majorities ever showed.&quot; One scholar wrote, &quot;No Justice of the Court conscientiously and persistently endeavored, as much as Justice Black did, to establish consistent standards of objectivity for adjudicating constitutional questions.&quot; Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices, opposing a view of justices as social engineers or rewriters of the Constitution. Black opposed enlarging constitutional liberties beyond their literal or historic &quot;plain&quot; meaning, as he saw his more liberal colleagues do. However, he also condemned the actions of those to his right, such as the conservative Four Horsemen of the 1920s and 1930s, who unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the New Deal&#x27;s legislation.

Black forged the 5–4 majority in the 1967 decision &quot;Fortson v. Morris&quot;, which cleared the path for the Georgia State Legislature to choose the governor in the deadlocked 1966 race between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard Callaway. Whereas Black voted with the majority under strict construction to uphold the state constitutional provision, his colleagues Douglas (joined by Warren, Brennan, and Fortas) and Fortas (joined by Warren and Douglas) dissented. According to Douglas, Georgia tradition would guarantee a Maddox victory though he had trailed Callaway by some three thousand votes in the general election returns. Douglas also saw the issue as a continuation of the earlier decision &quot;Gray v. Sanders&quot;, which had struck down Georgia&#x27;s County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used to choose the governor. Black argued that the U.S. Constitution does not dictate how a state must choose its governor. &quot;Our business is not to write laws to fit the day. Our task is to interpret the Constitution&quot;, Black explained.

===Textualism and originalism===
Black was noted for his advocacy of a textualist approach to constitutional interpretation. He took a &quot;literal&quot; or absolutist reading of the provisions of the Bill of Rights and believed that the text of the Constitution is absolutely determinative on any question calling for judicial interpretation, leading to his reputation as a &quot;textualist&quot; and as a &quot;strict constructionist&quot;. While the text of the Constitution was an absolute limitation on the authority of judges in constitutional matters, within the confines of the text judges had a broad and unqualified mandate to enforce constitutional provisions, regardless of current public sentiment, or the feelings of the justices themselves.
Thus, Black refused to join in the efforts of the justices on the court who sought to abolish capital punishment in the United States, whose efforts succeeded (temporarily) in the term immediately following Black&#x27;s death. He claimed that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s reference to takings of &quot;life&quot;, and to &quot;capital&quot; crimes, meant approval of the death penalty was implicit in the Bill of Rights. He also was not persuaded that a right of privacy was implicit in the Ninth or Fourteenth amendments, and dissented from the court&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Griswold&quot; decision which invalidated a conviction for the use of contraceptives. Black said &quot;It belittles that [Fourth] Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but &#x27;privacy&#x27;... &#x27;privacy&#x27; is a broad, abstract, and ambiguous concept... The constitutional right of privacy is not found in the Constitution.&quot;

Justice Black rejected reliance on what he called the &quot;mysterious and uncertain&quot; concept of natural law. According to Black that theory was vague and arbitrary, and merely allowed judges to impose their personal views on the nation. Instead, he argued that courts should limit themselves to a strict analysis of the actual text of the Constitution. Black was, in addition, an opponent of the &quot;Living Constitution&quot; theory. In his dissent to &quot;Griswold&quot; (1965), he wrote:

I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people&#x27;s elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.
Thus, some have seen Black as an originalist. David Strauss, for example, hails him as &quot;[t]he most influential originalist judge of the last hundred years&quot;. Black insisted that judges rely on the intent of the Framers as well as the &quot;plain meaning&quot; of the Constitution&#x27;s words and phrases (drawing on the history of the period) when deciding a case.

Black additionally called for judicial restraint not usually seen in court decision-making. The justices of the court would validate the supremacy of the legislature in public policy-making, unless the legislature was denying people constitutional freedoms. Black stated that the legislature &quot;was fully clothed with the power to govern and to maintain order&quot;.

===Flexibility with textualism and originalism===
One of Black&#x27;s biographers commented:

Black&#x27;s support of &quot;Bolling&quot; seemingly violated his own principles: the Fifth Amendment does not contain, nor can it be read to incorporate, the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause. When a clerk later asked how Black could justify this, he replied: &#x27;A wise judge chooses, among plausible constitutional philosophies, one that will generally allow him to reach results he can believe in—a judge who does not to some extent tailor his judicial philosophy to his beliefs inevitably becomes badly frustrated and angry... A judge who does not decide some cases, from time to time, differently from the way he would wish, because the philosophy he has adopted requires it, is not a judge. But a judge who refuses ever to stray from his judicial philosophy, and be subject to criticism for doing so, no matter how important the issue involved, is a fool.&#x27;

Black also joined Douglas&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Breithaupt v. Abram&quot; which argued that substantive due process prevented police from making an involuntary intrusion into a person&#x27;s body, in this case a blood sample taken while the suspect was unconscious.

===Federalism===
Black held an expansive view of legislative power, whether that be state or federal, and would often vote against judicial review of state laws that could be struck down under the Commerce Clause. Previously, during the 1920s and 1930s, the court had interpreted the commerce clause narrowly, often striking down laws on the grounds that Congress had overstepped its authority. After 1937, however, the Supreme Court overturned several precedents and affirmed a broader interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Black consistently voted with the majority in these decisions; for example, he joined &quot;Mulford v. Smith&quot;, , &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot;, , &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot;, , &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States&quot;, , and &quot;Katzenbach v. McClung&quot;, .

In several other federalism cases, however, Black ruled against the federal government. For instance, he partially dissented from &quot;South Carolina v. Katzenbach&quot;, , in which the court upheld the validity of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In an attempt to protect the voting rights of African Americans, the act required any state with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing its voting laws. Black wrote that the law:

...by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or adopt state constitutional amendments without first being compelled to beg federal authorities to approve their policies, so distorts our constitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in the Constitution between state and federal power almost meaningless.

Similarly, in &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; (1970), he delivered the opinion of the court holding that the federal government was not entitled to set the voting age for state elections.

In the law of federal jurisdiction, Black made a large contribution by authoring the majority opinion in &quot;Younger v. Harris&quot;. This case, decided during Black&#x27;s last year on the court, has given rise to what is now known as &quot;Younger&quot; abstention. According to this doctrine, an important principle of federalism called &quot;comity&quot;—that is, respect by federal courts for state courts—dictates that federal courts abstain from intervening in ongoing state proceedings, absent the most compelling circumstances. The case is also famous for its discussion of what Black calls &quot;Our Federalism&quot;, a discussion in which Black expatiates on:

...proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.

Black was an early supporter of the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; standard for apportionment set by &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;. He had previously dissented in support of this view in &quot;Baker&quot; predecessor case, &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot;.

===Civil rights===
As a senator, Black filibustered an anti-lynching bill. However, during his tenure on the bench, Black established a record more sympathetic to the civil rights movement. He joined the majority in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948), which invalidated the judicial enforcement of racially restrictive covenants. Similarly, he was part of the unanimous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) court that struck down racial segregation in public schools. Black remained determined to desegregate the South and would call for the Supreme Court to adopt a position of &quot;immediate desegregation&quot; in 1969&#x27;s &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot;.

Black authored the court&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, which validated Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to initiate the internment of Japanese Americans on the West Coast during World War II. The decision is an example of Black&#x27;s belief in the limited role of the judiciary; he validated the legislative and executive actions that led to internment, saying &quot;it is unnecessary for us to appraise the possible reasons which might have prompted the order to be used in the form it was&quot;.

Black also tended to favor law and order over civil rights activism. This led him to read the Civil Rights Act narrowly. For example, he dissented in multiple cases reversing convictions of sit-in protesters, arguing to limit the scope of the Civil Rights Act. In 1968 he said, &quot;Unfortunately there are some who think that Negroes should have special privileges under the law.&quot; Black felt that actions like protesting, singing, or marching for &quot;good causes&quot; one day could lead to supporting evil causes later on; his sister-in-law explained that Black was &quot;mortally afraid&quot; of protesters. Black opposed the actions of some civil rights and Vietnam War protesters and believed that legislatures first, and courts second, should be responsible for alleviating social wrongs. Black once said he was &quot;vigorously opposed to efforts to extend the First Amendment&#x27;s freedom of speech beyond speech&quot;, to conduct.

===First Amendment===
Black took an absolutist approach to First Amendment jurisprudence, believing the first words of the Amendment that said &quot;Congress shall make no law...&quot; Black rejected the creation of judicial tests for free speech standards, such as the tests for &quot;clear and present danger&quot;, &quot;bad tendency&quot;, &quot;gravity of the evil&quot;, &quot;reasonableness&quot;, or &quot;balancing&quot;. Black would write that the First Amendment is &quot;wholly &#x27;beyond the reach&#x27; of federal power to abridge... I do not believe that any federal agencies, including Congress and the court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are &#x27;more important interests.

He believed that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered the opinion of the court in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.

In four bar applicant appeals to the Supreme Court, Black advanced the argument that a person&#x27;s political affiliation or beliefs, without action, was not enough to establish evidence of bad moral character. Black argued in &quot;Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners&quot; (1957) that New Mexico could not bar Schware from becoming a lawyer because he might have, at one time, consorted with Communist causes. Schware was, in fact, a decorated veteran who fought in World War II. Black reaffirmed this position in &quot;Konigsberg v. State Bar of California&quot; (1957), where a majority of the court sided with Black. However, in both &quot;Konigsberg v. State Bar of California II&quot; (1961), and &quot;In re Anastaplo&quot; (1961), the majority of justices, over Black&#x27;s vigorous dissent, determined that a person who refused to answer whether they had been a member of an organization on the attorney general&#x27;s Subversive Organizations List could be denied admission to the bar on the basis of bad character. Black wrote, in his &quot;Anastaplo&quot; dissent:

Black&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;McCollum v. Board of Education&quot; (1948) held that the government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot; (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the majority opinion in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.

Justice Black is often regarded as a leading defender of First Amendment rights such as the freedom of speech and of the press. He refused to accept the doctrine that the freedom of speech could be curtailed on national security grounds. Thus, in &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; (1971), he voted to allow newspapers to publish the Pentagon Papers despite the Nixon Administration&#x27;s contention that publication would have security implications. In his concurring opinion, Black stated:

He rejected the idea that the government was entitled to punish &quot;obscene&quot; speech. Likewise, he argued that defamation laws abridged the freedom of speech and were therefore unconstitutional. Most members of the Supreme Court rejected both of these views; Black&#x27;s interpretation did attract the support of Justice Douglas.

However, he did not believe that individuals had the right to speak wherever they pleased. He delivered the majority opinion in &quot;Adderley v. Florida&quot; (1966), controversially upholding a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He also dissented from &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines&quot; (1969), in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in schools, writing:

While I have always believed that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.
Moreover, Black took a narrow view of what constituted &quot;speech&quot; under the First Amendment; for him, &quot;conduct&quot; did not deserve the same protections that &quot;speech&quot; did. For example, he did not believe that flag burning was speech; in &quot;Street v. New York&quot; (1969), he wrote: &quot;It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.&quot; Similarly, he dissented from &quot;Cohen v. California&quot; (1971), in which the court held that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; was speech protected by the First Amendment. He joined Justice Harry Blackmun&#x27;s dissent, which asserted that this activity &quot;was mainly conduct, and little speech&quot;.

As a justice, Black held the view that the court should literally enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an &#x27;activist&#x27; because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power, which informed his dissent in &quot;Anastaplo&quot;.

===Criminal procedure===
Black adopted a narrower interpretation of the Fourth Amendment than many of his colleagues on the Warren Court. He dissented from &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; (1967), in which the court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.

Justice Black originally believed that the Constitution did not require the exclusion of illegally seized evidence at trials. In his concurrence to &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot; (1949), he claimed that the exclusionary rule was &quot;not a command of the Fourth Amendment but... a judicially created rule of evidence&quot;. But he later changed his mind and joined the majority in &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot; (1961), which applied it to state as well as federal criminal investigations. In his concurrence, he indicated that his support was based on the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of the right against self-incrimination, not on the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. He wrote, &quot;I am still not persuaded that the Fourth Amendment, standing alone, would be enough to bar the introduction into evidence... seized... in violation of its commands.&quot;

In other instances, Black took a fairly broad view of the rights of criminal defendants. He joined the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966), which required law enforcement officers to warn suspects of their rights prior to interrogations, and consistently voted to apply the guarantees of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments at the state level.

Black was the author of the landmark decision in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one. Before &quot;Gideon&quot;, the court had held that such a requirement applied only to the federal government.

===Bill of Rights applicable to states, or &quot;incorporation&quot; question===
One of the most notable aspects of Justice Black&#x27;s jurisprudence was the view that the entirety of the federal Bill of Rights was applicable to the states. Originally, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Barron v. Baltimore&quot; (1833). According to Black, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, &quot;incorporated&quot; the Bill of Rights, or made it binding upon the states as well. In particular, he pointed to the Privileges or Immunities Clause, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.&quot; He proposed that the term &quot;privileges or immunities&quot; encompassed the rights mentioned in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.

Black first expounded this theory of incorporation when the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Adamson v. California&quot; (1947) that the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee against self-incrimination did not apply to the states. It was during this period of time that Hugo Black became a disciple of John Lilburne and his claim of &#x27;freeborn rights&#x27;. In an appendix to his dissenting opinion, Justice Black analyzed statements made by those who framed the Fourteenth Amendment, reaching the conclusion that &quot;the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its privileges and immunities clause, was a plain application of the Bill of Rights to the states.&quot;

Black&#x27;s theory attracted the support of Justices such as Frank Murphy and William O. Douglas. However, it never achieved the support of a majority of the court. The most prominent opponents of Black&#x27;s theory were Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II. Frankfurter and Harlan argued that the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights &quot;&quot;, but merely protected rights that are &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty&quot;, which was the standard Justice Cardozo had established earlier in &quot;Palko v. Connecticut&quot;.

The Supreme Court never accepted the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the entirety of the Bill of Rights. However, it did agree that some &quot;fundamental&quot; guarantees were made applicable to the states. For the most part, during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, only First Amendment rights (such as free exercise of religion and freedom of speech) were deemed sufficiently fundamental by the Supreme Court to be incorporated.

However, during the 1960s, the court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all guarantees of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the court failed to accept Black&#x27;s theory of total incorporation, the result of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members.

===Due process clause===
Justice Black was well known for his rejection of the doctrine of substantive due process. Most Supreme Court Justices accepted the view that the due process clause encompassed not only procedural guarantees, but also &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; and fundamental rights. Thus, it was argued that due process included a &quot;substantive&quot; component in addition to its &quot;procedural&quot; component.

Black, however, believed that this interpretation of the due process clause was unjustifiably broad. In his dissent to &quot;Griswold&quot;, he charged that the doctrine of substantive due process &quot;takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom, and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination&quot;. Instead, Black advocated a much narrower interpretation of the clause. In his dissent to &quot;In re Winship&quot;, he analyzed the history of the term &quot;due process of law&quot;, and concluded: &quot;For me, the only correct meaning of that phrase is that our Government must proceed according to the &#x27;law of the land&#x27;—that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions.&quot;

Black&#x27;s view on due process drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons were to be tried in accordance with the Bill of Rights&#x27; procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black&#x27;s view of due process was restrictive in the sense that it was premised on equal &quot;procedures&quot;; it did not extend to &quot;substantive&quot; due process. This was in accordance with Black&#x27;s literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.

None of Black&#x27;s colleagues shared his interpretation of the due process clause. His chief rival on the issue (and on many other issues) was Felix Frankfurter, who advocated a substantive view of due process based on &quot;natural law&quot;—if a challenged action did not &quot;shock the conscience&quot; of the jurist, or violate British concepts of fairness, Frankfurter would find no violation of due process of law. John M. Harlan II largely agreed with Frankfurter, and was highly critical of Black&#x27;s view, indicating his &quot;continued bafflement at... Black&#x27;s insistence that due process... does not embody a concept of fundamental fairness&quot; in his &quot;Winship&quot; concurrence.

===Voting rights===
Black was one of the Supreme Court&#x27;s foremost defenders of the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle. He delivered the opinion of the court in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; (1964), holding that the Constitution required congressional districts in any state to be approximately equal in population. He concluded that the Constitution&#x27;s command &quot;that Representatives be chosen &#x27;by the People of the several States&#x27; means that as nearly as is practicable one man&#x27;s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another&#x27;s&quot;. Likewise, he voted in favor of &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964), which extended the same requirement to state legislative districts on the basis of the equal protection clause.

At the same time, Black did not believe that the equal protection clause made poll taxes unconstitutional. During his first term on the court, he participated in a unanimous decision to uphold Georgia&#x27;s poll tax in the case of &quot;Breedlove v. Suttles&quot;. Then, twenty-nine years later, he dissented from the court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections&quot; (1966), invalidating the use of the poll tax as a qualification to vote, in which &quot;Breedlove&quot; was overturned. He criticized the court for exceeding its &quot;limited power to interpret the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause&quot; and for &quot;giving that clause a new meaning which it believes represents a better governmental policy&quot;. He also dissented from &quot;Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15&quot; (1969), in which a majority struck down a statute that prohibited registered voters from participating in certain school district elections unless they owned or rented real property in their local school district, or were parents or guardians of children attending the public schools in the district.

===Equal Protection Clause===
By the late 1940s, Black believed that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause was a constitutional prohibition against any state governmental actions that discriminated on the basis of race in an invidious or capricious manner. Throughout the remainder of his time on the court, Black saw only race and the characteristics of alienage as the &quot;suspect&quot; categories that were addressed and protected by equal protection, along with the one-man, one-vote principle, all of which merited strict scrutiny. In 1948, he participated in two court decisions that struck down certain California laws that were discriminatory towards aliens: &quot;Takahashi v. Fish &amp; Game Commission&quot; (he wrote the majority opinion) and &quot;Oyama v. California&quot; (he wrote a concurring opinion). During his last full term on the court, he participated in a unanimous decision, &quot;Graham v. Richardson&quot;, striking down statutes that restricted welfare benefits to legal aliens but not to U.S. citizens. The majority opinion stated, &quot;[C]lassifications based on alienage, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. Aliens as a class are a prime example of a &#x27;discrete and insular minority&#x27; for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.&quot;

Consistent with his view that the equal protection clause had a limited meaning, Black did not believe illegitimate children were a suspect class, and he applied only rational basis review to laws that were discriminatory toward such children. In 1968, he joined a dissenting opinion written by Justice Harlan in the case of &quot;Levy v. Louisiana&quot;, in which a majority of the court overturned a decision made by the Louisiana courts to enforce a statute that was discriminatory toward &quot;unacknowledged&quot; illegitimate children. Three years later, he wrote a majority opinion for the case of &quot;Labine v. Vincent&quot;. He reasoned that for a state to treat illegitimate children worse than legitimate children is scarcely any different from treating &quot;concubines&quot; worse than wives, or treating other relatives of a person worse than any other relatives. &quot;It may be possible that some of these choices are more &#x27;rational&#x27; than the choices inherent in Louisiana&#x27;s categories of illegitimates. But the power to make rules to establish, protect, and strengthen family life... is committed by the Constitution of the United States and the people of Louisiana to the legislature of that State. Absent a specific constitutional guarantee, it is for that legislature, not the life-tenured judges of this Court, to select from among possible laws.&quot;

Black apparently did not think of homosexuals as a suspect class either, voting with five other colleagues on the court to uphold the authority of the federal government to deport a gay man just because he was gay, in &quot;Boutilier v. Immigration and Naturalization Service&quot;.

==Retirement and death==

Justice Black admitted himself to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in August 1971, and subsequently retired from the court on September 17. He had a stroke two days later and died on September 25.

Services were held at the National Cathedral, and more than 1,000 people attended. Pursuant to Justice Black&#x27;s wishes, the coffin was &quot;simple and cheap&quot; and was displayed at the service to show that the costs of burial are not reflective of the worth of the human whose remains were present. His remains were interred at the Arlington National Cemetery.

President Richard Nixon nominated Lewis Powell to succeed Black on the Supreme Court. Powell was sworn in on January 7, 1972.

==Ku Klux Klan and anti-Catholicism==
Shortly after Black&#x27;s appointment to the Supreme Court, Ray Sprigle of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote a series of articles, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize, revealing Black&#x27;s involvement in the Klan and describing his resignation from the Klan as &quot;the first move of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator from Alabama&quot;. Sprigle wrote that &quot;Black and the leaders of the Klan decided it was good political strategy for Black to make the senatorial race unimpeded by Klan membership but backed by the power of the Klan. That resignation [was] filed for the duration of the campaign but never revealed to the rank and file of the order and held secretly in the records of the Alabama Realm&quot;.

Roosevelt denied knowledge of Black&#x27;s KKK membership.

In a radio statement on October 1, 1937, Black said in part, &quot;I number among my friends many members of the colored race. Certainly, they are entitled to the full measure of protection accorded by our Constitution and our laws...&quot; Black also said, &quot;I did join the Klan. I later resigned. I never rejoined... Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have had nothing to do with it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to do so.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that about fifty million listeners heard Black&#x27;s address on the radio, reportedly a larger radio audience than any previous speech except the abdication address of King Edward VIII.

Near the end of his life, Black said that joining the Klan was a mistake: &quot;I would have joined any group if it helped get me votes.&quot;

Biographers in the 1990s examined Black&#x27;s views of religious denominations. Ball found regarding the Klan that Black &quot;sympathized with the group&#x27;s economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs&quot;. Newman said Black &quot;disliked the Catholic Church as an institution&quot; and gave numerous anti-Catholic speeches in his 1926 election campaign to Ku Klux Klan meetings across Alabama. However, in 1937 &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; reported on Black&#x27;s appointment of a Jewish law clerk, noting that he &quot;earlier had appointed Miss Annie Butt, a Catholic, as a secretary, and the Supreme Court had designated Leon Smallwood, a Negro and a Catholic as his messenger.&quot; In the 1940s, Black became intrigued by the anti-Catholic writings of Paul Blanshard. Historian J. Mills Thornton emphasizes his close ties to the KKK. The top leader of the Alabama Klan ran his campaign for the Senate, when Black visited most of the KKK locals in Alabama.

===Thurgood Marshall and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;===
Black was one of the nine justices of the Supreme Court who in 1954 ruled unanimously in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs were represented by Thurgood Marshall. A decade later, on October 2, 1967, Marshall became the first African American to be appointed to the Supreme Court, and served with Black on the court until Black&#x27;s retirement on September 17, 1971.

===&quot;United States v. Price&quot;===
In &quot;United States v. Price&quot; (1965), eighteen Ku Klux Klan members were charged with murder and conspiracy for the deaths of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but the charges were dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A. Rainey, were found not guilty; and three of them, including Edgar Ray Killen, had their cases end in a hung jury.

==Legacy==
Hugo Black was twice the subject of covers of &quot;Time&quot; magazine: On August 26, 1935, as a United States senator; and on October 9, 1964, as an associate justice (art by Robert Vickrey).

In 1986, Black appeared on the 5¢ postage stamp in the Great Americans series issued by the United States Postal Service. Along with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. he was one of only two Associate Justices to do so until the later inclusions of Thurgood Marshall, Joseph Story, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and William J. Brennan Jr.

In 1987, Congress passed a law sponsored by Alabama representative Ben Erdreich, designating the new courthouse building for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama in Birmingham, as the &quot;Hugo L. Black United States Courthouse&quot;.

An extensive collection of Black&#x27;s personal, senatorial, and judicial papers is archived at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, where it is open for research.

Justice Black is honored in an exhibit in the Bounds Law Library at the University of Alabama School of Law. A special Hugo Black collection is maintained by the library.

In his hometown of Ashland, a monument to Justice Hugo Black was dedicated on October 15, 2022.

Black served on the Supreme Court for thirty-four years, making him the fifth longest-serving Justice in Supreme Court history. He was the senior (longest serving) justice on the court for an unprecedented twenty-five years, from the death of Chief Justice Stone on April 22, 1946, to his own retirement on September 17, 1971. As the longest-serving associate justice, he was acting chief justice on two occasions: from Stone&#x27;s death until Vinson took office on June 24, 1946; and from Vinson&#x27;s death on September 8, 1953, until Warren took office on October 5, 1953. There was no interregnum between the Warren and Burger courts in 1969.

<doc id="150065" wikidata="Q132065" url="?curid=150065" title="Nennius">
<text>Nennius – or Nemnius or Nemnivus – was a Welsh monk of the 9th century. He has traditionally been attributed with the authorship of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, based on the prologue affixed to that work. This attribution is widely considered a secondary (10th-century) tradition.

Nennius was a student of Elvodugus, commonly identified with the bishop Elfodd of Bangor who convinced British ecclesiastics to accept the Continental dating for Easter, and who died in 809 according to the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;.

Nennius is believed to have lived in the area made up by Brecknockshire and Radnorshire in present-day Powys, Wales. Thus, he lived outside the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, isolated by mountains in a rural society. Because of the lack of evidence concerning the life of Nennius, he has become the subject of legend himself. Welsh traditions include Nennius with Elbodug and others said to have escaped the massacre of Welsh monks by Ethelfrid in 613, fleeing to the north.

==Authorship of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;==

Nennius was traditionally credited with having written the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; . The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; was highly influential, becoming a major contributor to the Arthurian legend, in particular for its inclusion of events relevant to debate about the historicity of King Arthur. It also includes the legendary origins of the Picts, Scots, St. Germanus and Vortigern, and documents events associated with the Anglo-Saxon invasion of the 7th century as contributed by a Northumbrian document.

Evidence suggests that the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; was a compilation of several sources, some of which are named by Nennius, while others are not. Some experts say that this was not the first compiled history of the Britons and that it was largely based on Gildas&#x27; &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; written some three centuries before. Other sources included a &quot;Life of St Germanus&quot; and several royal pedigrees. Most other sources have not survived and therefore cannot be confirmed. The surviving manuscripts of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; appear to be redacted from several lost versions: information about Nennius contained in the &quot;Prologue&quot; and in the &quot;Apology&quot; differs, the &quot;Prologue&quot; containing an expanded form of the &quot;Apology&quot; that is only found in editions copied during the 12th century, leading experts to believe that later versions of the document were altered. The largest known edition contains seventy-six sections including the &quot;Prologue&quot; and the &quot;Apology&quot;. The work was translated into Irish by Giolla Coemgin in and is the earliest example of the original &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, that includes the author&#x27;s name, Nennius.

Originally written as a history of the Britons in an attempt to document a legitimate past, the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; contains stories of legend and superstition alike. The historical accuracy of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is at best questionable, but the document is internally consistent and provides information from and indirectly about Nennius&#x27; sources. Some historians argue that the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; gives good insight into the way 9th century Britons viewed themselves and their past. Nennius makes several attempts to trace the history of the Britons back to the Romans and Celts through his empirical observations of what he refers to as &quot;The Marvels&quot; or &quot;Wonders of Britain&quot;. These include ruins, landmarks and other aspects of the British countryside that Nennius deems worthy of documentation. His explanation of the physical landmarks and ruins take on a mystical interpretation despite Nennius being a Christian monk. Within the writing of Nennius is a sense of nationalist pride attempting to legitimise the people of Britain and embellish the past through legend much as the Romans used the story of &quot;Romulus and Remus&quot; to legitimise the founding of Rome. One such example of Nennius stressing legend is in his accounts of Arthur and his twelve battles. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; would come to be the basis on which later medieval authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth would write the , one of the early Welsh chronicles and romantic histories of King Arthur. Nennius however never refers to Arthur as a King instead calling him a &quot;Dux Bellorum&quot; who lead the kings of Britain in battle, a military commander.

==Debate regarding his life and works==
The Prologue, in which Nennius introduces his purpose and means for writing the &quot;British History&quot;, first appears in a manuscript from the twelfth century. The prologues of all other manuscripts, though only included marginally, so closely resemble this first prologue that William Newell claims they must be copies. &quot;The preface has evidently been prepared by someone who had before him the completed text of the treatise. It appears in the first instance as a marginal gloss contained in a MS. of the twelfth century;&#x27; under ordinary conditions, the chapter would unhesitatingly be set aside as a forgery.&quot; He counters Zimmer&#x27;s argument by reasoning that the Irishman responsible for the &quot;superior&quot; Irish translations might have added his own touches, further claiming that if a Latin version of the &quot;Historia&quot; had been available in the 12th century, it would have been replicated in that language, not translated.

David N. Dumville argues that the manuscript tradition and nature of the Prologue in particular fail to substantiate the claim that Nennius was the author of &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. In his argument against Zimmer, he cites a textual inconsistency in the Irish translation regarding a place called Beulan, concluding that &quot;we must admit to ignorance of the name of [the &quot;Historia&#x27;s&quot;] ninth-century author.&quot;

==Associated historians and authors==
* Gildas – Sixth-century historian who lived in South-west Britain. Wrote &quot;De excidio et conquestu Britanniae&quot;, which focused largely on the history of Christian Britain but fails to give an in-depth look of the pagan period.
* Bede (the Venerable Bede) – Lived in Northumbria about half a century prior to Nennius. He wrote &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum&quot; (Ecclesiastical History of the English People) over many years (completed 731 or 732). It includes a geographical description of the British Isles and focuses on the history of the Anglo-Saxon Church from St. Augustine&#x27;s 597 mission though his preamble covers earlier ages.
* William of Malmesbury – Early twelfth-century historian. Recorded history of Britain by compiling both Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman traditions. He was the first historian of England to make use of topography and ancient monuments as historical sources.
* Geoffrey Gaimar – Twelfth-century Norman historian who wrote &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Engleis&quot;. It was the first known Romance in vernacular verse written in England.

<doc id="150067" wikidata="Q1136198" url="?curid=150067" title="Cape Finisterre">
<text>Cape Finisterre (, ; ; ) is a rock-bound peninsula on the west coast of Galicia, Spain.

In Roman times it was believed to be an end of the known world. The name Finisterre, like that of Finistère in France, derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;end of the earth&quot;. It is sometimes said to be the westernmost point of the Iberian Peninsula. However, Cabo da Roca in Portugal is about farther west and thus the westernmost point of continental Europe. Even in Spain Cabo Touriñán is 124 metres (135 yards) farther west.

Monte Facho is the name of the mountain on Cape Finisterre, which has a peak that is above sea level. A prominent lighthouse is at the top of Monte Facho. The seaside town of Fisterra is nearby.

The Artabri were an ancient Gallaecian Celtic tribe that once inhabited the area.

==Geography==

Cape Finisterre has several beaches, including O Rostro, Arnela, Mar de Fora, Langosteira, Riveira, and Corbeiro. Many of the beaches are framed by steep cliffs leading down to the &quot;Mare Tenebrosum&quot; (or dark sea, the name of the Atlantic in the Middle Ages). The peninsula contains the port and municipality of Fisterra.

There are several rocks in this area associated with religious legends, such as the &quot;holy stones&quot;, the &quot;stained wine stones&quot;, the &quot;stone chair&quot;, and the tomb of the Celtic crone-goddess &quot;Orcabella&quot;.

== Pilgrimage ==
Cape Finisterre is the final destination for many pilgrims on the Way of St. James, the pilgrimage to the shrine of the apostle Saint James the Great in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Cape Finisterre is about 90 km (50 miles) from Santiago de Compostela. The name of this route is Camino Finisterre.

The origin of the pilgrimage to Finisterre is not certain. However, it is believed to date from pre-Christian times and was possibly associated with Finisterre&#x27;s status as the &quot;edge of the world&quot; and a place to see the last sun of the day. The tradition continued in medieval times, when &quot;hospitals&quot; were established to cater to pilgrims along the route from Santiago de Compostela to Finisterre.

Some pilgrims continue on to Muxía, which is a day&#x27;s walk away.

==Pre-Christian beliefs==
There are many pre-Christian sacred locations in the area; they are connected to a variety of myths. There was an &quot;Altar Soli&quot; on Cape Finisterre, where the Celts engaged in sun worship and assorted rituals.

Greco-Roman historians called the local residents of Cape Finisterre the &quot;Nerios&quot;. Monte Facho was the place where the Celtic Nerios from carried out their offerings and rites in honor of the sun. Monte Facho is the site of current archaeological investigations and there is evidence of habitation on Monte Facho circa 1000 BCE. There is a Roman Road to the top of Monte Facho and the remnants of ancient structures on the mountain.

San Guillerme, also known as St. William of Penacorada, lived in a house located on Monte Facho. Near San Guillerme&#x27;s house is a stone now known as &quot;St William&#x27;s Stone&quot; (&quot;Pedra de San Guillerme&quot;). Sterile couples used to copulate on St. William&#x27;s Stone to try to conceive, following a Celtic rite of fertility.

== Maritime history ==
The Phoenicians sailed from this cape to trade with Bronze Age Britain, with a possible point of landing for the Phoenician traders being Mount Batten. 

As it is a prominent landfall on the route from northern Europe to the Mediterranean, several naval battles took place near the Cape. Notable battles include the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Both these battles were between the British Royal Navy and the French Navy, who were constantly battling for control of seas during the 18th century. The coast, known locally as the &quot;Costa da Morte&quot; (Death Coast), has been the site of numerous shipwrecks and founderings, including that of the British ironclad HMS &quot;Captain&quot;, leading to the loss of nearly 500 lives, in 1870.

Additionally, laws governing the colonies of the British Empire (including the 1766 amendment to the Sugar Act 1764) used the latitude of Cape Finisterre as the latitude past which certain goods could not be shipped north directly between British colonies. For instance, it was forbidden to ship sugar cane directly from Jamaica to Nova Scotia, as such a transaction crossed through this latitude. Instead, the laws required that the sugar cane be shipped first from Jamaica to Britain, where it would be re-exported to Nova Scotia. 

Likewise, the latitude of Cape Finisterre was used to signal that a change of flags flown by Norwegian and Swedish merchant ships was required. Following independence and the subsequent union with Sweden in 1814, Norwegian merchant ships were required to fly the Swedish flag (until 1818) and the Swedish flag with the Norwegian (the Dannebrog with the Norwegian lion) flag in the canton. From 1818 to 1821, Swedish merchant ships also flew this flag in place of the Swedish flag (until 1844) when sailing south of Cape Finisterre.

Finisterre was the former name of the current FitzRoy sea area used in the UK Shipping Forecast. It was renamed FitzRoy in 2002 (in honour of the founder of the Met Office) to avoid confusion with the smaller sea area of the same name featuring in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.

In the 2010s and 2020s, the waters of Cape Finisterrre have been the venue for several orca attacks against sailboats at Atlantic Ocean.

==In popular culture==
* In the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta Ruddigore, Richard Dauntless sings of shipping out in &quot;a revenue sloop&quot; and encountering a French merchantman &quot;off Cape Finistere.&quot;
* In the film &quot;Night Train to Lisbon&quot; (2013), Amadeu and Estafania spend the night and the morning in the car at Cape Finisterre. Then, Amadeu is shown sitting on the cliff writing his memoirs on which the film centers.
* In Walter Farley&#x27;s book &quot;The Black Stallion&quot;, a ship is last mentioned sailing north toward England &quot;off Cape Finisterre on the coast of Spain&quot; before foundering in a night storm.

<doc id="150071" wikidata="Q150903" url="?curid=150071" title="Gong Li">
<text>Gong Li (; born 31 December 1965) is a Chinese born Singaporean actress. Regarded as one of the best actresses in China today, she is known for her versatility and naturalistic performance. She starred in three of the four Chinese-language films that have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.

Gong was born in Shenyang, Liaoning, and grew up in Jinan, Shandong. She enrolled at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing, from where she graduated in 1989. While a student at the Academy, she was spotted by director Zhang Yimou and debuted in Zhang&#x27;s &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; in 1987. Gong and Zhang&#x27;s professional and personal relationship received much media attention in the Chinese-speaking world, as they continued to collaborate on a string of critically acclaimed movies, including the Oscar-nominated features &quot;Ju Dou&quot; (1990) and &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; (1991). For her role in the Zhang-directed &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot; (1992), Gong won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival.

Gong also starred in the Chen Kaige-directed Oscar-nominated &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993), for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. In English-language films, she won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), directed by Rob Marshall. Other notable appearances include &quot;Flirting Scholar&quot; (1993), &quot;To Live&quot; (1994), &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997), &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot; (1998), &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; (2000), &quot;Zhou Yu&#x27;s Train&quot; (2003), &quot;Eros&quot; (2004), &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (2006), &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006) and &quot;Saturday Fiction&quot; (2019).

Gong was head of jury at the 2000 Berlin Film Festival and the 2002 Venice Film Festival, the first Asian person to hold such position at both events. Over the course of her career, Gong has won several accolades, including four Hundred Flowers Awards, a Hong Kong Film Award, two Golden Rooster Awards, a Berlin Film Festival, two Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival honors and a David di Donatello Award nomination. She was appointed as a Commander (Commandeur) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France in 2010.

==Early life==
Gong Li was born in Shenyang, Liaoning, China, as the youngest of five children. Her father, Gong Lize, had been a professor of economics at Liaoning University until being transferred to Shandong University a few years before the Cultural Revolution. Her mother, Zhao Ying, originally a college teacher, followed her husband to Shandong and became an accountant at a state-run cotton mill.

Gong grew up in Jinan, the capital of Shandong. She studied in Jinan Sanhe Street Primary School (now Shandong Experimental Primary School). At school, she developed an interest in singing, dancing, and imitation. In Grade 2, she participated in her school’s performing arts troupe. Later, she and her classmates were invited to Shandong People’s Radio Station to sing children’s songs in praise of the oil workers in Daqing.

Gong spent six years at Jinan No.2 Middle School. In 1983, she took her first Gaokao, applying to two art programs at Shandong Normal University and Qufu Normal University, but failed to gain admission. The following year, she applied to Shandong Art Academy and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Arts College, but was unsuccessful again. Her parents discouraged her from pursuing it further, but Gong persisted by working part-time while taking acting lessons from director Yin Dawei in Jinan. In 1985, encouraged by Yin, she applied to the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. Despite scoring 11 points at Gaokao below the requirement, the academy petitioned for her special admission, which was eventually granted by the Ministry of Culture, the superior department then in charge of the academy. Gong was admitted to the Central Academy of Drama in 1985 and graduated in 1989.

==Acting career==
===1987–1989: Career beginnings===
In 1987, while at college, Gong was discovered by Zhang Yimou, who cast her for the lead role in &quot;Red Sorghum,&quot; his first film as a director. The film won the Golden Bear at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, becoming the first Chinese film to win this award. It also won the Golden Rooster Awards and the Hundred Flowers Awards for Best Picture in 1988.

In 1989, Gong starred in Zhang Yimou’s second counterterrorism film, &quot;Codename Cougar&quot;, for which she won the Hundred Flowers Awards for Best Supporting Actress, ushering in a new stage of exploring acting skills and style. On the same year, she took part in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and according to her, Tiananmen taught her that she should have her own opinion, &quot;not just follow blindly.&quot;

===1990–1999: Fifth generation filmmakers and international spotlight===

Over the several years following her 1987 acting debut in &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, Gong received international acclaim for her roles in several more Zhang Yimou films.

In 1990, Gong Continued to cooperate with Zhang Yimou and starred in his family ethics movie &quot;Ju Dou&quot;, which won the Luis Buñuel Special Award at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards, becoming the first Chinese film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Gong also won the Best Actress award at the Varna International Film Festival.

In 1991, Gong starred in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s film &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, which won the Silver Lion award at the 48th Venice Film Festival, and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards. Gong, playing a rebellious mistress in the film, won the Hundred Flowers Awards for Best Actress and was nominated for the David di Donatello Awards and the NSFC for Best Actress. Her performance in the &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; (1991) put her in the international spotlight again.

In 1992, Gong starred in the rural drama &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;, which won the Golden Lion award at the 49th Venice International Film Festival. Gong&#x27;s portrayal of rural woman Qiu Ju not only won the Golden Rooster Awards and the Japanese Movie Critics Awards for Best Actress, but also helped her named Best Actress at the 49th Venice Film Festival.

In 1993, she received a New York Film Critics Circle award for her role in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993). Directed by Chen Kaige, the film was her first major role with a director other than Zhang Yimou. In the same year, she was awarded with the Berlinale Camera at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked her performance in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; as the 89th greatest performance of all time. She also worked with renowned director Stephen Chow in comedy films &quot;God of Gamblers III: Back to Shanghai&quot; (1991) and &quot;Flirting Scholar&quot; (1993).

Immune to political repercussions because of her fame, Gong Li began criticizing the censorship policy in China. Her films &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; and &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot; were initially banned in China for being thinly-veiled critiques of the Chinese government. Regarding the sexual content in &quot;Ju Dou&quot;, Chinese censorship deemed the film &quot;a bad influence on the physical and spiritual health of young people.&quot;

In 1994, Gong played Jia Zhen, the wife of Xu Fugui, in the drama &quot;To Live&quot;, which won the Grand Prix at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. She was also nominated for the Chlotrudis Awards for Best Actress.

In 1995, Gong starred in &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot;, during her breakup with Zhang Yimou, in which she played a seductive stage queen. The film won the Technical Grand Prize of Cannes Film Festival, the National Board of Review for Best Foreign Language film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

These roles established her reputation, according to &quot;Asiaweek&quot;, as 

In 1996, Gong and Chen Kaige collaborated again in the romantic film &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;, which was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Gong has been nominated for her second best Actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards for her role as rebellious teenage girl Ru Yi. She also appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

In 1997, Gong worked with Jeremy Irons on the romantic drama &quot;Chinese Box&quot;, which won the Best Original Music award at the Venice Film Festival. In the same year, Gong was invited to be a jury at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first Chinese to be a jury at the festival.

In June 1998, Gong Li became a recipient of France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

In 1999, Gong and Chen Kaige collaborated for the third film &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot;, which won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

In many of her early movies, Gong represents a tragic victim and an abused soul (physically or emotionally), trying to release herself from an impossible maze of corruption, violence and suppression. In &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot;, an additional tragic element is added to her being as she unintentionally becomes the executioner of new innocent victims, making her realize that she has assisted the dark cynical system.

===2000–2004: Worldwide recognition===
In 2000, Gong won her second international Best Actress trophy for her performance as a struggling single mother in &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; (2000) directed by Sun Zhou at the Montreal World Film Festival. She attended the Montreal World Film Festival that year, where she was awarded a special Grand Prix of the Americas for lifetime achievement for her outstanding achievement. In the same year, Gong was invited by the Berlin Film Festival to be the president of its international jury for the festival&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Gong was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 16 October 2000.

In 2002, Gong was invited to head the jury of the Venice Film Festival.

In 2003, Gong served as the president of the jury of the 16th Tokyo International Film Festival, the first woman to do so.

In the early 2000s, Gong also starred in two films directed by Wong Kar-wai, &quot;2046&quot; and &quot;Eros&quot; (both in 2004), which were seen as &quot;an important opportunity to get rid of the influence of Zhang Yimou&quot;. She also attended the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where she was awarded the Festival Trophy for her contributions to film industry.

===2005–2018: Hollywood and Chinese cinema===

Despite her popularity, Gong avoided Hollywood for years, due to a lack of confidence in speaking English. She made her English speaking debut in 2005 when she starred as Hatsumomo in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. Her performance was met with generally positive reviews. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Corliss to describe her as Gong also won the National Board of Review for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Hatsumomo. Her other English-language roles to date included the Chinese Cuban Isabella of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in 2006 and Lady Murasaki of &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; in 2007. In all three films, she learned her English lines phonetically.

Through three English-language films, Gong has gradually established herself in Hollywood. Speaking of the Hollywood experience, Gong said it broadened her horizons, gave her a better idea of what she liked and allowed her to experiment with different acting styles.

In 2006, Gong worked again with Yimou for historical epic &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot;, for which She won the best Actress at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards. &quot;Time&quot; named her performance as the Empress as the seventh greatest performance of the year. In the same year, she was voted No.1 in the poll of &quot;Most Beautiful Persons in China&quot; held by The Beijing News.

She narrated &quot;Beijing&quot; (2008), an audio walking tour by Louis Vuitton and Soundwalk, which won an Audie Award for Best Original Work in 2009.
In 2010, Gong starred in the World War II-era thriller &quot;Shanghai&quot; as a spy who is disguised as the wife of a triad boss (played by Chow Yun-fat). She turned to documentaries and photographs about World War II, besides taking dancing classes three times a week, to ensure an accurate portrayal of the character. During a press junket for the film, she stated that she was becoming more selective with the Chinese language projects offered to her.

She also emphasized in the interview: 

&quot;Shanghai&quot; was not a hit with critics, with critic Nick Allen writing that &quot;Gong Li is put to a great amount of work as the most active member in the ensemble, but she has scant character aside from his intricate allegiances.&quot; That year, she was named by CNN as one of &quot;Asia&#x27;s 25 Greatest Actors of All Time.&quot;

In 2014, Gong was the president of the jury for the 17th Shanghai International Film Festival, becoming the first woman jury president in the festival’s history. Later that same year, she reunited with Yimou for the film &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which is set during the throes of the Cultural Revolution; this film was their first collaboration since 2006.

In 2016, Gong took on her first action role in &quot;The Monkey King 2&quot;, playing the White Bone Demon.

In 2018, Gong served as the jury president of the 55th Golden Horse Awards.

===2019–present===
In 2019, Gong was cast in Lou Ye&#x27;s period drama &quot;Saturday Fiction&quot;, where she plays an actress who is working undercover gathering intelligence for the Allies. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 76th Venice International Film Festival. Gong learned shooting and hypnosis for the film. &quot;Saturday Fiction&quot; was a box office failure due to the delayed release, but the artistic value of the film and Gong&#x27;s performance gained rave reviews. That year, she was also cast in the live-action adaptation of the 1998 Disney animated film &quot;Mulan&quot;, as a powerful witch. While the film, released in 2020, had a mixed reception, Gong&#x27;s performance was widely praised by critics. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;&#x27;s chief critic, Richard Lawson, wrote in his review: &quot;It is a pleasure as ever to watch Gong do her thing, slinking and thrashing around in a fabulous black witch’s cloak.&quot;
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented: 

In 2020, Gong was cast in Peter Chan&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Leap&quot;, where she plays the hard-driving, real-life head coach of the Chinese women’s national volleyball team Lang Ping. &quot;Leap&quot; grossed more than $100 million at the worldwide box office, and while the film received mixed reviews from critics, Gong&#x27;s performance in the film was highly recognized. The performance swept all the major Hong Kong film industry awards in 2021, including the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards and the HKFDG Awards. She was also nominated for best actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards for the fourth time. The Hong Kong Film Critics Society described her performance as having an &quot;astonishing aura&quot; and wrote that &quot;She fights with conviction in the face of a conservative educational establishment, former teammates and a new generation of young athletes.&quot;

In 2021, Gong was invited to be the jury president of the 11th Beijing International Film Festival, becoming the first female jury president in the festival‘s history.

In 2022, Gong was invited to serve as the Art Chairman of the 12th Beijing Film Festival, responsible for the selected films, assisting in the invitation and recommendation of outstanding films and guests.

==Personal life==
Gong&#x27;s personal and professional relationship with director Zhang Yimou has been highly publicized. Their relationship started in 1986 on the set of &quot;Red Sorghum,&quot; when Zhang was married to his first wife Xiao Hua while Gong was in another relationship. Gong&#x27;s then boyfriend, surnamed Yang, violently assaulted her after finding out her relationship with Zhang. In 1988, Zhang divorced Xiao for Gong. In 1995, soon after shooting &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot;, their 7th collaboration during their relationship, Zhang announced their break-up amidst rumors of Gong&#x27;s affair with Ooi Hoe Seong, then managing director of British American Tobacco in China. According to Gong&#x27;s mother, however, they split due to Zhang&#x27;s reluctance to marry Gong after their 9-year relationship. After their break-up, Zhang invited Gong to star in his films &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, but she declined both. They reunited in 2006 for the film &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; and in 2014 for &quot;Coming Home&quot;.

In November 1996, Gong married Singaporean businessman Ooi Hoe Seong at Hong Kong&#x27;s China Club. The marriage was plagued by persistent rumors of discord. In early 2008, Gong applied for Singapore citizenship. When overseas professional obligations prevented her from showing up at her scheduled August citizenship ceremony, she was harshly criticized for not making it a priority. On Saturday, 8 November 2008, Gong, in an effort to make amends, attended a citizenship ceremony held at Teck Ghee Community Club and received her Singapore citizenship certificate from Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah. Gong was reportedly considering renouncing her Singaporean citizenship after China blacklisted celebrities with foreign passports; however, there is no evidence that she went through with the renunciation. In 2009, Gong and Ooi quietly divorced, though they did not make the news public until three years later.

In 2006, Gong began a relationship with a French photographer, whom she met on the Prague set of &quot;Hannibal Rising.&quot; The relationship lasted for over 8 years.

In 2016, Gong started dating the French composer and musician Jean-Michel Jarre. They married in 2019.

<doc id="150075" wikidata="Q4899685" url="?curid=150075" title="Bevo (drink)">
<text>Bevo was a non-alcoholic malt beverage, or near beer, brewed in the United States by the Anheuser-Busch company beginning in the early 20th century. Bevo enjoyed its greatest success during the time of Prohibition, when beer, wine and distilled liquors were made illegal for thirteen years.

==Prohibition==
The Anheuser-Busch company started brewing Bevo when alcoholic beverages were prohibited in 1916 by the United States armed forces. Production rose greatly with national prohibition in 1919, and Bevo was by far the most popular of the many &quot;cereal beverages&quot; or &quot;near beers&quot; of the time. At the peak of its popularity in the early 1920s, more than five million cases of Bevo were sold annually.
Labels on the bottles billed it as &quot;Bevo the Beverage&quot;. The name &quot;Bevo&quot; was coined from the word &quot;beverage&quot; and the Slavic language word for beer, &quot;pivo&quot;, and was pronounced &quot;Bee-vo&quot;. 

==Decline==
In the late 1920s, bootleg beer and liquor, both smuggled and &quot;homebrew&quot;, cut into Bevo&#x27;s marketshare. With sales flattening to 100,000 cases by 1929, Anheuser-Busch stopped production. 
The Bevo building, with the Renard character prominently displayed at the corners, still operates as a bottling facility at their main brewery in St. Louis, Missouri. The landmark Bevo Mill, constructed by August Anheuser Busch, Sr. in 1917, was closed in 2009, but reopened in October 2009 under new owners.

==Advertising==
Some Bevo advertising featured the character &quot;Renard the Fox&quot; (based on the protagonist of a medieval French folk tale), and promotional mugs with this character were manufactured. In 1930, Anheuser-Busch built a series of boat-bodied cars in its St. Louis shops called the &quot;Bevo Boats&quot; which were used for promotion. Seven are believed to have been built on Pierce-Arrow 8-cylinder chassis while one surviving example was based upon 1930 Cadillac 353 V8.
A contemporary advertisement read &quot;Cooling and invigorating, Bevo the Beverage. Order by the case from your grocer, druggist, or dealer.&quot; The paper label on the back of the bottle read &quot;The All-Year-Round Soft Drink. Appetizing - Healthful - Nutritious - Refreshing. Milk or water may contain bacteria. BEVO never does.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Bevo became part of the popular culture of the time, and is mentioned in various popular songs and vaudeville skits of the era. This led to secondary slang uses of the word; for example, in American military slang a young and inexperienced officer was called a &quot;Bevo&quot;. The University of Texas named its mascot &quot;Bevo&quot;, a name which has stuck to this day.

Irving Berlin included a paean to the drink, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stay Up on Bevo&quot;, in his 1917 army revue, &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;. In addition, in his song &quot;The Near Future&quot;, which includes the ubiquitous lyric &quot;How Dry I Am&quot;, Bevo is featured prominently. As the Prohibition Era was starting, &quot;On the Streets of Cairo&quot; by Jesse G. M. Gluck &amp; Geo. P. Hulten assured people that in Cairo, &quot;you won&#x27;t have to drink pale Bevo, Booze there has a kick.&quot;

In 1919, Tim Moore, a vaudeville comedian who had just arrived in Detroit to fulfill a theatrical booking, wrote this line to a Chicago newspaper editor, &quot;Dry Detroit, Mich.; Dear Pal Tony: Just a few lines to let you know we arrived safely in the home of Ford&#x27;s Tin Lizzies, &quot;Bevo&quot; and other temperate beers.&quot;

Bevo is mentioned in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s short story &quot;The Killers&quot; (1927), John O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s short story &quot;The Bucket of Blood&quot; (1962), Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922), and Thornton Wilder&#x27;s novel &quot;Theophilus North&quot; (1973).

Decades later, Bevo was mentioned in the song &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot; in the musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; as a reference to an objectionable aspect of the culture of young people during the time in which the musical was set (although &quot;The Music Man&quot; was set in 1912, four years prior to Bevo&#x27;s introduction).

In 2009 the beverage was mentioned briefly in the 1927 set webcomic &quot;Lackadaisy&quot; by Tracy Butler.

<doc id="150076" wikidata="Q907767" url="?curid=150076" title="Doctor Strange">
<text>Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #110 (cover-dated July 1963). Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Strange was introduced during the Silver Age of Comic Books in an attempt to bring a different kind of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel Comics.

The character starts as an intelligent and arrogant neurosurgeon who is injured in a car accident. Because his hands had suffered severe nerve damage from the accident, he was told that current medical therapy and rehabilitation would not be enough to enable him to practice again as a surgeon. Unable to accept this prognosis, he travels the world searching for alternative ways of healing, which leads him to the Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme. Strange becomes his student and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the martial arts. He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful Eye of Agamotto and Cloak of Levitation, and takes up residence in a mansion referred to as the Sanctum Sanctorum, located at 177A Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme and, with his friend and valet Wong, defends the world from mystical threats.

In live-action adaptations, the character was first portrayed by Peter Hooten in the 1978 television film &quot;Dr. Strange&quot;. Since 2016, Benedict Cumberbatch has portrayed the role of Stephen Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Artist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee have described the character as having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, &quot;On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics. My character wound up being named Dr. Strange because he would appear in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;.&quot; In a 1963 letter to Jerry Bails, Lee called the character Ditko&#x27;s idea, saying:

===Early years===
&quot;Doctor Strange&quot; debuted in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #110 (July 1963), a split book shared with the feature &quot;The Human Torch&quot;. Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character&#x27;s eight-page origin story in #115 (December 1963). His origin was later retold in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #169 (February 1968). Scripter Lee&#x27;s take on the character was inspired by the &quot;Chandu the Magician&quot; radio program that aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System in the 1930s. He had Doctor Strange accompany spells with elaborate artifacts, such as the &quot;Eye of Agamotto&quot; and the &quot;Wand of Watoomb&quot;, as well as mystical-sounding vocabulary such as &quot;Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!&quot;. Although these often referenced the names of established mythological beings, Lee has said he never had any idea what the incantations meant and used them simply because they sounded mystical and mysterious. Ditko showcased surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly vivid visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students at the time. Comics historian Mike Benton wrote:


&quot;People who read &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e., drug users],&quot; recalled then-associate editor and former &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; writer Roy Thomas in 1971, &quot;because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But I don&#x27;t use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do.&quot;

Originating in the early 1960s, the character was a predictor of trends in the art prior to them becoming more established in the later counterculture of the 1960s. As historian Bradford W. Wright described:

As co-plotter and later sole plotter in the Marvel Method of scripting, Ditko took Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In a 17-issue story arc in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity, who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette filled with the cosmos. Golden Age of Comic Books artist/writer Bill Everett succeeded Ditko as an artist with issues #147–152, followed by Marie Severin through #160 and Dan Adkins through #168, the final issue before the &quot;Nick Fury&quot; feature moved to its own title and &quot;Strange Tales&quot; was renamed &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. Expanded to 20 pages per issue, the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; solo series ran 15 issues, #169–183 (June 1968 – November 1969), continuing the numbering of &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. Thomas wrote the run of new stories, joined after the first three issues by the art team of penciler Gene Colan and inker Tom Palmer through the end.

After plans were announced for a never-released split book series featuring Doctor Strange and Iceman, each in solo adventures. Strange next appeared in the first three issues (December 1971 – June 1972) of the quarterly showcase title &quot;Marvel Feature&quot;. He appeared in both the main story detailing the formation of superhero team the Defenders, and the related back-up story. The character then starred in a revival solo series in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #3–14 (July 1972 – March 1974). This arc marked the debut of another recurring foe, the entity Shuma-Gorath, created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank Brunner, who took over as the regular creative team starting with &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #10. Englehart and Brunner collaborated closely on the stories, meeting over dinner every two months to discuss the series, and their run became known for its psychedelic visuals and plots. In issues #8–10 (May–September 1973), Strange is forced to shut down the Ancient One&#x27;s mind, causing his mentor&#x27;s physical death. Strange then assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Englehart and Brunner created another multi-issue storyline featuring sorcerer Sise-Neg (&quot;Genesis&quot; spelled backward) going back through history, collecting all magical energies, until he reaches the beginning of the universe, becomes all-powerful and creates it anew, leaving Strange to wonder whether this was, paradoxically, the original creation. Stan Lee, seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but &quot;a&quot; god, to avoid offending religious readers. According to Frank Brunner, he and Englehart concocted a fake letter from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas. Marvel unwittingly printed the letter in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #3 and dropped the retraction.

Due to the growing number of Doctor Strange readers, the &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; series segued to the character&#x27;s second ongoing title, &quot;Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts&quot;, also known as &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; vol. 2, which ran 81 issues (June 1974 – Feb. 1987). &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #14 featured a crossover story with &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #44, another series which was being drawn by Gene Colan at the time. In Englehart&#x27;s final story, he sent Strange back in time to meet Benjamin Franklin.

===1980s===
Strange met his allies Topaz in #75 (February 1986) and Rintrah in #80 (December 1986). The series ended on a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum Sanctorum, was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses were Doctor Strange&#x27;s entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker, and several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil serpent god Set expired.

The title was discontinued so that the character&#x27;s adventures could be transferred to another split-book format series. &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 2, #1–19 (April 1987–Oct. 1988) was shared with street heroes Cloak and Dagger. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange&#x27;s quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrecting the Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team&#x27;s title.

===1990s===
Strange was returned to his own series, this time titled &quot;Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme&quot;, which ran 90 issues (November 1988 – June 1996). The initial creative team was writer Peter B. Gillis and artists Richard Case and Randy Emberlin, with storylines often spanning multiple issues. Strange lost the title of &quot;Sorcerer Supreme&quot; in issues #48–49 (Dec. 1992 – Jan. 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the Vishanti, the mystical entities that empower his spells. During this time the series became part of the &quot;Midnight Sons&quot; group of Marvel&#x27;s supernatural comics. Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of chaos magic, as well as a magic construct he used as a proxy. He would form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes, and reunite with the original Defenders. Strange regained his title in &quot;Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme&quot; #80 (August 1995).

Strange appeared with the Human Torch and the Thing in the one-shot publication &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).

The character was featured in several limited series. The first was &quot;Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones&quot; #1–4 (February–May 1999), with a series of spontaneous combustions by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu. Strange was the catalyst for the creation of a trio of sorceresses in &quot;Witches&quot; #1–4 (August–November 2004). The &quot;Strange&quot; limited series (November 2004 – July 2005) by writers J. Michael Straczynski and Samm Barnes updated the character&#x27;s origin. Another limited series, &quot;Doctor Strange: The Oath&quot; #1–5 (December 2006 – April 2007), written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Marcos Martin, focused on Strange&#x27;s responsibilities as sorcerer and doctor.

Doctor Strange has appeared in four graphic novels: &quot;Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa&quot; (1986); &quot;Doctor Strange &amp; Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment&quot; (1989); &quot;Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death&quot; (1992); and &quot;Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen?&quot; (1997).

===2000s===
Strange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s. He appeared regularly in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; under J. Michael Straczynski, before being cast into a time loop by Baron Mordo. He later appeared on and off in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, where he was stated as being part of the secret group known as the Illuminati to deal with future threats to Earth. Ultimately Strange joined the team and allowed them to use his home as a base after the events of the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, which he sat out. Doctor Strange was critical of the federal Superhuman Registration Act and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage.

During Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; time as writer, Doctor Doom attacked the Avengers and manipulated the Scarlet Witch into eliminating most of the mutant population. Doctor Strange&#x27;s failure to recognize Doom&#x27;s hand in the former and to stop the latter caused him to start to doubt his abilities. After he was forced to use dark magic to confront an enraged Hulk, followed by further use of dark spells to save the New Avengers from the Hood&#x27;s supervillain army, Strange renounced his status as Sorcerer Supreme, as he felt that he was no longer worthy of it. The Eye of Agamotto passed the mantle on to Jericho Drumm.

He was also featured in &quot;The Order&quot;, which spun out of the 2001 &quot;Defenders&quot; revival, and the &quot;Indefensible Defenders&quot; mini-series.

===2010s===
Doctor Strange appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 &quot;The New Avengers&quot; series. Jericho Drumm, now newly appointed Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Voodoo, sacrifices himself to stop the powerful mystical entity Agamotto from reclaiming the Eye. A guilt-ridden Strange rejoins the New Avengers, and he offers the team his valet Wong to act as their housekeeper.

Strange eventually regains his position of Sorcerer Supreme, but is possessed by a demon and becomes leader of the Black Priests.

After the various Marvel universes merge into one, Doctor Strange acts as righthand man of Doctor Doom, who has become the ruler of this world after erasing all recollection of the previous separate realities that existed. Circumstances force Strange to open a pod that releases the surviving heroes of the original Marvel continuity, known as Earth-616. Doom kills Doctor Strange.

In 2015, Jason Aaron and Chris Bachalo teamed up for the fourth volume of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. A new character, reluctant librarian Zelma Stanton, agrees to reorganize Strange&#x27;s magical library. Jericho Drumm returns, and the series and a spinoff, &quot;Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic&quot;, sees such characters as Medico Mistico, Magik, Scarlet Witch, Mahatma Doom, Professor Xu, Monako, and Alice Gulliver. With the laws of magic fundamentally altered, and with the loss of his former resources, Doctor Strange is forced to depend on his own physical skills and inventive use of his few functional spells. He eventually no longer has access to most of his former spells or his levitating cape.

During the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Doctor Strange goes on a space mission. He encounters Super-Skrull who has the Time Stone. After defeating Super-Skrull, Doctor Strange claims the Time Stone. Doctor Strange then tracks down the Mind Stone and finds it in Turk Barrett&#x27;s possession as Turk manages to evade him. When Black Widow&#x27;s clone arrives seeking out Doctor Strange where she wants to dispose of the Space Stone, he does not want to take it as he knows what would happen if they are in proximity. Using a magic spell, Doctor Strange speaks to the holders of the Infinity Stones and requests a parley to reform the Infinity Watch. He states to Adam Warlock, Black Widow&#x27;s clone, Captain Marvel, Star-Lord, and Turk Barrett that they need to safeguard them from such calamities even if one of them is Thanos.

==Fictional character biography==

Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D., is a brilliant but highly egotistical doctor. He was born in Philadelphia and raised in New York City. After high school, he went to New York College as a pre-med student, entered medical school at Columbia University and completed his residency at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where his success made him arrogant.

Despite his reputation for being able to handle even the most complicated surgical procedures, Strange is self-centered and greedy, and only treats patients who can afford to pay his exorbitant fees. One night, while speeding in his car, a terrible accident shatters the bones in his hands, leading to extensive nerve damage. He soon finds that his fingers tremble uncontrollably, rendering him unable to perform surgery. Too vain to accept a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to fix his hands and subsequently wastes all of his money on expensive, but unsuccessful treatments.

Broke and ostracized from his colleagues, Strange becomes a drifter. He happens to overhear two sailors in a bar discussing a hermit called the Ancient One (who is actually the Earth&#x27;s Sorcerer Supreme) in the Himalayas, who can heal any ailment. Despite not personally believing in magic, Strange uses the last of his money to track down the aged mystic. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange due to his arrogance, but senses a good side that he attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange then commits a heroic act when he discovers the Ancient One&#x27;s disciple, Baron Mordo, attempting to kill his mentor and usurp his power. After a confrontation with Mordo leads to him being shackled with restraining spells preventing him from either attacking Mordo or warning the Ancient One, Strange desperately and selflessly accepts the Ancient One&#x27;s offer to become his apprentice to have some hope of helping the old man. The Ancient One, pleased at Strange&#x27;s sincere change of heart, accepts Strange as his new student and promptly frees him from the restraining spells while explaining he was aware of Mordo&#x27;s treachery all along. Strange soon becomes Mordo&#x27;s most enduring enemy, as the Ancient One trains the doctor in the mystic arts. After completing his training, Strange returns to New York City and takes up residence within the Sanctum Sanctorum, a townhouse located in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, accompanied by his personal assistant Wong.

As the Ancient One&#x27;s disciple, Strange encounters the entity Nightmare, and other mystical foes before meeting Dormammu, a warlord from an alternate dimension called the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot; who wishes to conquer Earth. Strange is aided by a nameless girl, later called Clea, who is eventually revealed to be Dormammu&#x27;s niece. When Strange helps a weakened Dormammu drive off the rampaging Mindless Ones and return them to their prison, he is allowed to leave the Dark Dimension unchallenged.

In &quot;The Unbelievable Gwenpool&quot; #3, Strange encounters Gwendolyn Poole, who explains herself to be from a reality where all Marvel characters are fictional characters in comic books. As Strange helps her locate her home reality to create a fake background for her in the Marvel Universe so that she can get a Social Security number, driver&#x27;s license and other essential documents, he discovers that Benedict Cumberbatch has been cast to play him in Gwen&#x27;s universe, remarking that he &quot;could see that&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers and skills===
Doctor Strange is a practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells. Strange also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation which enables him to fly; the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet whose light is used to negate evil magic; the Book of the Vishanti, a grimoire which contains vast knowledge of white magic; and the Orb of Agamotto, a crystal ball which is used for clairvoyance.

In addition to his magical abilities, Strange is trained in several martial arts disciplines, including judo, and has shown proficiency with numerous magically conjured weapons including swords and axes. Strange was a skilled neurosurgeon before nerve damage impaired his hands.

Doctor Strange is described as &quot;the mightiest magician in the cosmos&quot; and &quot;more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids&quot; by Eternity, the sentience of the Marvel Universe. He holds the title of Sorcerer Supreme beginning with the 1973 storyline in which the Ancient One dies, and retains the title thereafter, except during an interruption from 1992 to 1995. He relinquishes the title once again in a 2009 storyline, but reclaims it in a 2012 story when he proves himself willing to protect the world even without the title.

===Artifacts and technology===
====&quot;Book of the Vishanti&quot;====
The &quot;Book of the Vishanti&quot;, portrayed as being written by unknown authors, is closely associated with Doctor Strange and is the greatest known source of white magical knowledge on Earth. The &quot;Book of the Vishanti&quot; contains spells of defensive magic and is indestructible. Its counterpart, the &quot;Darkhold&quot;, contains all the knowledge of black magic in the Marvel Universe and is likewise indestructible. It is possible to destroy single pages of either book, but the balancing spell in the other book must be destroyed as well to maintain a mystical balance. A collective of the three powerful magical beings—Agamotto, Oshtur, and Hoggoth—known as the Vishanti must allow the spell to be destroyed.

Even though the book is a tome of benevolent magic, the spells within can still be dangerous when used improperly. This is proven when a young, inexperienced Strange tried to use the &quot;Book of the Vishanti&quot; to resurrect his dead brother Victor, but the spell, known as the Vampire Verses, caused Victor to become the vampire Baron Blood years later.

The first known owner of the book was the Atlantean sorcerer Varnae, who lived around 18,500 BC. The next known owner was the Babylonian god Marduk Kurios. Marduk set a griffin to guard the Book. The sorcerer known as the Ancient One traveled back in time to c. 4000 BC, defeated the griffin, and returned to the 20th century. The Ancient One would remain the book&#x27;s owner, despite a brief loss when the dark wizard Kaluu returned the Book to the Griffin, until he deemed his student, Doctor Strange, worthy of taking it.

Doctor Strange keeps the book in his townhouse library in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. He briefly lost the book when he destroyed his home to prevent the alien wizard Urthona from taking his magical artifacts, but the book was saved by Agamotto, who transported it to his realm and returned it to Strange some time later.

====Cloak of Levitation====

The Cloak of Levitation is depicted as a potent mystical cloak worn by Doctor Strange. The primary purpose of the cloak is to give its wearer the ability to fly. Additionally, the cloak is able to alter its shape, being often used to act as &quot;another set of hands&quot; to attack an opponent when Strange&#x27;s own body has been incapacitated.

There were two distinctly different cloaks worn by Doctor Strange bequeathed to him by his mentor, the Ancient One: a billowing, full-length blue cloak, that had minor abilities and spells woven into it, and the later, red cloak that Strange is usually seen wearing. The first appearance of the first (blue) cloak was in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #114 (November 1963). The first appearance of the second (red) cloak was in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #127 (December 1964). The Cloak of Levitation is seen in a great many battles where it often plays a very significant role. While it is extremely durable, there are a few occasions when it is damaged. Its repair requires that Strange engage an ally, Enitharmon the Weaver.

====Eye of Agamotto====
====Orb of Agamotto====

Aside from the Eye of Agamotto, the Orb of Agamotto is the other occult object that Doctor Strange owns. It is a powerful scrying crystal ball powered by the Agamotto entity to detect the use of magic anywhere in the world, providing Strange with a location and visual. It can also be used to monitor the shields that protect the planets created by the three sanctums. If Agamotto is inside the Orb, it becomes Strange&#x27;s ultimate source of knowledge.

The Orb of Agamotto rests in Doctor Strange&#x27;s Sanctum Sanctorum in a room called the Chamber of Shadows. It usually is inside a display case with three curved legs. When summoned, the glass covering rises and the ball levitates. While powerful, the Orb has been blocked by exceptionally powerful mystic forces (such as Umar) who do not want their exact location known. On at least one occasion, it has been used to open a dimensional portal to the realm of Agamotto. In the film &quot;Thor&quot;, the Orb is briefly shown in Odin&#x27;s Trophy Room in Asgard.

==Sorcerer Supreme==

==Other versions==
Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), Robert Bernstein (scripter, under the pseudonym &quot;R. Berns&quot;), and Jack Kirby (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and Ph.D. with the same surname (called Carl Strange). Making his sole appearance in the Iron Man story &quot;The Stronghold of Dr. Strange&quot; in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #41 (1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak lightning strike.

He has appeared in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; magazine #6 (July 1980), wherein he sends Howard and Beverly back to Earth; and in &quot;She-Hulk&quot;, vol. 4, #20 (Sept 2007), wherein he helps Stu the Intern return to Earth (since Stu&#x27;s extensive knowledge of Marvel Comics continuity reminded him that he could find the Ducktor and how he could be returned by the Mystic Mallard).

===Earth-A/Earth-721===
In &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #21, a non-powered counterpart of Dr. Strange from Earth-A comes to Earth-616 (aka Earth-B) and impersonates the 616 Dr. Strange. The impostor is revealed when he cannot think of a rhyme for the word &quot;Cyttorak&quot;.

===Marvel 1602===
Set in the Marvel 1602 universe. Sir Stephen Strange, both the court physician of Queen Elizabeth I and a magician, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He is the replacement in the 1602 universe for John Dee and is married to a version of Clea. Here, he cannot use his &#x27;Astral Projection&#x27; (which he refers to as a magic mirror) as well as the modern one could, lacking modern materials, and is often physically drained after it is finished, and lacks memory of what he saw in astral form. During this time, he makes indirect contact with Uatu, who warns him about the danger caused by the &#x27;Forerunner&#x27;s&#x27; arrival in the past, but is placed under a compulsion not to speak or act on this knowledge. Eventually, when Elizabeth is dead, he allows himself to be executed for witchcraft and treason so that his head, kept alive by Clea for some time after his execution, can continue to be of help by sharing the information he has gained from Uatu with the other heroes so that they can prevent the destruction of reality.

===Marvel 2099===
Set in the Marvel 2099 universe, the Sorceress Supreme of Earth is a young woman who calls herself &quot;Strange&quot;. She secretly shares her body with a monstrous demon. She is very inexperienced in her powers and uses them recklessly. In one incident, she causes the death of her brother. Her main opponent is Garokk who wishes to use her past torments and inexperience to gain the title of Sorcerer Supreme for himself.

In a &#x27;reset&#x27; 2099 timeline where the Maestro has conquered a decimated world, he apparently kept Strange contained in a mystical circle. When Miguel O&#x27;Hara emerged into this timeline and released Strange, she claimed that the demon possessing her protected her from major world-shifts, working with Miguel to repair an old time machine of Doctor Doom&#x27;s so that he could return to 2015 and avert this timeline. However, after Miguel&#x27;s departure, Strange revealed that she was working with the Maestro and was under the control of the demon within her.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, a version of Strange later appears on Battleworld as a member of the Defenders 2099.

When Miguel returns to a new variation of the 2099 timeline where having superpowers is illegal, he witnesses Moon Knight banishing Strange&#x27;s demon being from her body using a soul sword.

He participates in the multi-zombie attack on Doctor Doom&#x27;s castle, in an effort to capture and devour the unaffected Latverian citizens inside. While part of a multi-zombie chase of Ultimate Reed Richards, he vanishes under a rain of cars launched by Magneto. However, he later resurfaces in &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot; but with limited function as a result of Magneto&#x27;s wrath.

===Ultimate Marvel===
There are two versions of Doctor Strange that reside in the Ultimate Marvel Universe.

====Stephen Strange Sr.====
First appearing in flashbacks, Dr. Stephen Strange married his former student Clea and the two of them had a child named Stephen Strange Jr. Strange Sr. later vanished and Clea decided to raise Stephen Jr. away from magic. The title of &quot;Sorcerer Supreme&quot; was only self-proclaimed by the elder Strange as reported in the comics during a TV news broadcast.

====Stephen Strange Jr.====
As a college student, Stephen Strange Jr. was approached by Wong who told him about his father and took him on as a student. He supports himself as a new-age guru to the rich, powerful, and famous, and is seen as a celebrity appearing on television talk shows. He is known to the public as &quot;Dr. Strange&quot;, although he does not hold a medical degree or doctorate. Stephen Strange Jr. has bemoaned his lack of knowledge in things mystical and usually, just barely saves the day with one last desperate untried spell. Starting in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #107, this Doctor Strange is a member of Daredevil&#x27;s team fighting against the Kingpin, the Ultimate Knights.

In &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Strange is killed by Dormammu when Hulk rampages through his house. A mysterious person later found his body.

===Venomverse===
A Venomized version of Doctor Strange appears in Venomverse, who is responsible for gathering all of the different incarnations of Venom. His Earth was eradicated by the Poisons so he had gathered Venoms from across the multiverse to prevent the Poisons from consuming more of them. He is captured by the Poisons and he realizes that instead of bringing more Venoms to fight, he had brought the Poisons more Venoms to consume. In the climax he sends all of the surviving Venoms to their universes while the bomb built by Rocket Raccoon explodes. His fate is unknown.

===What If?...===
Dr. Strange also exists in several &quot;What If?...&quot; multiverses.
*In &quot;What If...Doctor Strange Had Been Disciple of Dormammu?&quot;, Strange has his hands healed by Mordo and does not become a student of the Ancient One. Mordo later converts Strange into a disciple of Dormammu. When Strange is forced into a battle between Dormammu and the Ancient One, he decides in favor of good, and finally becomes a disciple of the Ancient One.

<doc id="150089" wikidata="Q279843" url="?curid=150089" title="Frankenchrist">
<text>Frankenchrist is the third album by the American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys, released in 1985 on Alternative Tentacles.

The album is an example of the progressive, psychedelic side of Dead Kennedys&#x27; musical personality. The spaghetti Western soundtrack influence is noticeable in the horn parts and in East Bay Ray&#x27;s guitar work. &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; is also noted for its relative lack of traditionally &quot;hardcore&quot; material, with most of the tracks being slower and longer than the majority of other Dead Kennedys songs. &quot;M.T.V. − Get off the Air&quot; is notable for its pointed slam of the music establishment and &quot;Stars and Stripes of Corruption&quot; for its exegesis of vocalist Jello Biafra&#x27;s political philosophies.

==Inspiration==
Biafra said, &quot;One of the main focal points of &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; is if we are going to rise above the need for cops and laws, we can quit using the old American work ethic of seeing how much you can get away with and how much you can scam and who cares whose back you stab.&quot;

==Controversies==
===&quot;Landscape #XX&quot;===
The album was a subject of controversy because the original record sleeve included a poster featuring the painting &quot;Landscape #XX&quot;, or &quot;Penis Landscape&quot;, by H. R. Giger, depicting rows of copulating penises and vulvae. The choice of the painting came as the result of a comment by Jello Biafra to his then-roommate and Dead Kennedys artist, Jayed Scotti, art partner of Winston Smith. Biafra showed Scotti a copy of &quot;Omni&quot; magazine showing several works of art by Giger, including &quot;Penis Landscape&quot;, printed in 1977, for a Paris art collection. Biafra said he wanted to use the piece on the upcoming album cover. Scotti phoned New York agent Les Barany and explained the project. Barany contacted Giger to ask permission, then contacted Mike Bonanno of Alternative Tentacles Records; Giger agreed to let the label use a reproduction chrome of the artwork for $600, half the usual price. Biafra presented the idea to the other members of the band, but the idea was rejected as the album cover and as an interior gatefold double LP album. Finally it was accepted as an inserted poster. Jayed Scotti created the production mechanicals by hand for the poster. The poster was printed and inserted in the &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; album with an additional sticker on the outside shrinkwrap, warning buyers of the contents.

Biafra was brought to trial for distributing harmful matter to minors, and though the case did not result in a conviction, Alternative Tentacles was almost driven to bankruptcy. It was only through the support of fans that the label was able to stay alive. Biafra gained attention as a champion of free speech, and was subsequently one of the most active opponents of the Parents Music Resource Center.

=== Shriners ===
&quot;Frankenchrist&quot;&#x27;s front cover itself depicts a Shriners parade, featuring Shriners members driving miniature cars, wearing their distinctive red fez hats. The four Shriners members pictured in the photograph sued Dead Kennedys in 1986. The image was originally photographed and published by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in the 1970s, a decade before the &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; usage by Dead Kennedys and Alternative Tentacles in 1985.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;There are some bad tracks with forced, awkward lyrics, but the LP does contain two of the DKs’ finest moments: &#x27;MTV — Get Off the Air&#x27; and &#x27;Stars and Stripes of Corruption&#x27;, one of the most powerful political statements ever committed to vinyl.&quot;

Byron Coley at &quot;Spin&quot; said the album was, &quot;organically interchangeable with any other like-sized hunk they&#x27;ve previously coughed up. It would be unjust, though, not to mention that the band sounds better than ever. Unfortunately, this band’s instrumental sound must forever take a backseat to the wormy vocal histrionics of Mr. Jello Biafra.&quot;

<doc id="150091" wikidata="Q213919" url="?curid=150091" title="George Foreman">
<text>George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer, entrepreneur, minister, and author. In boxing, he competed between 1967 and 1997 and was nicknamed &quot;Big George&quot;. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. As an entrepreneur, he is known for the George Foreman Grill.

After a troubled childhood, Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Having turned professional the next year, he won the world heavyweight title with a stunning second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Unable to secure another title opportunity, Foreman retired after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977.

Following what he referred to as a born again experience, Foreman became an ordained Christian minister. Ten years later he announced a comeback, and in 1994 at age 45 won the unified WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight championship titles by knocking out 26-year-old Michael Moorer. He dropped the WBA belt rather than face his mandatory title defense soon after, and following a single successful title defense against Axel Schulz, Foreman relinquished his IBF title as well on June 28, 1995. At 46 years and 169 days old, he was the oldest world heavyweight champion in history. Foreman is the oldest to ever win the world heavyweight boxing championship of major honors and the second-oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins (at light heavyweight). He retired in 1997 at the age of 48, with a final record of 76 wins (68 knockouts) and 5 losses.

Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Foreman as the eighth-greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2002, he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by &quot;The Ring&quot;. &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of all time. He was a ringside analyst for HBO&#x27;s boxing coverage for 12 years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million.

==Early life==
George Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas. He grew up in the Fifth Ward community of Houston, Texas, with six siblings. Although he was raised by J. D. Foreman, whom his mother had married when George was a small child, his biological father was Leroy Moorehead. By his own admission in his autobiography, George was a troubled youth. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and spent time as a mugger. At age 16, Foreman had a change of heart and convinced his mother to sign him up for the Job Corps after seeing an ad for the Corps on TV. As part of the Job Corps, Foreman earned his GED and trained to become a carpenter and bricklayer. After moving to Pleasanton, California, with the help of a supervisor, he began to train. Foreman was interested in football and idolized Jim Brown, but gave it up for boxing.

==Amateur career==
===1968 Summer Olympics===

Foreman won a gold medal in the boxing/heavyweight division at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. In the finals, Foreman defeated the Soviet Union&#x27;s Jonas Čepulis; the referee stopped the fight in the second round. Čepulis&#x27; face was already bleeding in the first round from Foreman&#x27;s punches, and had to take a standing eight count early in the second round. Čepulis, fighting out of Lithuania, was a 29-year-old veteran with a 12-year-long amateur career, having over 220 fights in his record, quite experienced, and 10 years older than Foreman.
* Round of 16: defeated Lucjan Trela (Poland) on points, 4–1
* Quarterfinal: defeated Ion Alexe (Romania) referee stopped contest, 3rd round
* Semifinal: defeated Giorgio Bambini (Italy) by a second-round knockout
* Final: defeated Jonas Čepulis (Soviet Union) referee stopped contest, second round
After winning the gold-medal fight, Foreman walked around the ring carrying a small U.S. flag and bowing to the crowd. Foreman maintained that earning the Olympic gold medal was the achievement he was most proud of in his boxing career, more so than either of his world titles.

===Highlights===
* He won his first amateur fight on January 26, 1967, by a first-round knockout in the Parks Diamond Belt Tournament.
* He won the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&#x27;s&quot; Golden Gloves Tournament in the Junior Division in February 1967.
* In February 1967, he knocked out Thomas Cook to win the Las Vegas Golden Gloves in the Senior Division.
* In February 1968, he knocked out L.C. Brown to win the&quot; San Francisco Examiner&#x27;s&quot; Senior Title in San Francisco.
* In March 1968, he won the National Boxing Championships heavyweight title in Toledo, Ohio, vs. Henry Crump of Philadelphia in the final.
* He sparred five rounds on two different occasions in July 1968 with former World Heavyweight Champion Sonny Liston (Liston sparred in 22-oz custom-made Everlast gloves, Foreman later recalled that Liston was &quot;No doubt the scariest human being I&#x27;ve met in the ring, the only man to make me back up consistently&quot;.)
* On September 21, 1968, he won his second decision over Otis Evans to make the U.S. boxing team for the Mexico City Olympic Games.
* Foreman had a 16–4 amateur boxing record going into the Olympics. He won the Olympic Games Heavyweight Gold Medal after the referee stopped the fight against finalist Jonas Čepulis in the second round. He was trained for the Olympic Games by Robert (Pappy) Gault.
* His amateur record was 22–4 when he turned professional.

==Professional career==
=== Early career ===
Foreman turned professional in 1969 with a three-round knockout of Donald Walheim in New York City. He had a total of 13 fights that year, winning all of them (11 by knockout).

In 1970, Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title, winning all 12 of his bouts (11 by knockout). Among the opponents he defeated were Gregorio Peralta, whom he decisioned at Madison Square Garden, although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter-punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated George Chuvalo by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated Charlie Polite in four rounds and Boone Kirkman in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman&#x27;s first world-level wins. Peralta was the number-10 ranked heavyweight in the world in January 1970 per &quot;The Ring&quot;, while Chuvalo was number seven in the world per their March 1971 issue.

In 1971, Foreman won seven more fights, winning all of them by knockout, including a rematch with Peralta, whom he defeated by knockout in the 10th and final round in Oakland, California, and a win over Leroy Caldwell, whom he knocked out in the second round. After amassing a record of 32–0 (29 KO), he was ranked as the number-one challenger by the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council.

=== First reign as heavyweight champion ===

====Foreman vs. Frazier====
In 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from Muhammad Ali, Frazier had won the title from Jimmy Ellis and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten Oscar Bonavena and Jerry Quarry. Despite Foreman&#x27;s superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.

The Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by TKO. In ABC&#x27;s rebroadcast, Howard Cosell made the memorable call, &quot;Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!&quot; Before the fight, Frazier was 29–0 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37–0 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier&#x27;s balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman&#x27;s combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee Arthur Mercante eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.

====Foreman vs. Roman====

Foreman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion. They said he sneered and was rarely available to the press. Foreman later said he was emulating former world champion and occasional sparring partner Sonny Liston. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion José Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked the number-seven heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of &quot;The Ring&quot;. Foreman ended the fight in two minutes, one of the fastest knockouts in a heavyweight championship bout.

====Foreman vs. Norton====

Foreman&#x27;s next defense was against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in Caracas, Venezuela, he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer Ken Norton (who was 30–2), a boxer noted for his heavy punch and crossed-armed defense (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of Muhammad Ali in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and narrowly losing the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.) After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes. Norton did not hit the canvas, but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. &quot;Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn&#x27;t want him to get into the fight&quot;, Foreman said when interviewed years later. This fight became known as the &quot;Caracas Caper&quot;.

Foreman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40–0 record with 37 knockouts.

====Foreman vs. Ali====


Foreman&#x27;s next title defense, on October 30, 1974, in Kinshasa, Zaire, against Muhammad Ali, was historic. The bout, promoted as the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, exceeded even its wildest expectations.

During training there in mid-September Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being reopened. He later commented: &quot;That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa—the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.&quot; Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public, while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having crushed undefeated heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and toppled formidable challenger Ken Norton both within two rounds.
When Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali&#x27;s sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali&#x27;s head. The ring ropes were unusually loose, and Foreman later charged that Angelo Dundee (Ali&#x27;s longtime trainer) had loosened them as part of Ali&#x27;s tactic to lean back and away from the wild swings before clinching Foreman behind the head; Dundee stated that not only did he tighten the ropes because they were so loose due to the heat, Ali came up with the &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; strategy entirely on his own. Ali had been known as a fighter of speed and movement, but the rope-a-dope technique worked exactly to plan, since Foreman had not had a fight that lasted past the fourth round since 1971.

Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body in exchange for the opportunity to land a hard jolt to Foreman&#x27;s head. Ali later said he was &quot;out on his feet&quot; twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. By mid-bout an increasingly confident Ali began to taunt the exhausted champion relentlessly, who had been reduced to mere pawing and landing harmless rubber-armed blows. Late in the eighth round Ali came off the ropes with a series of successively harder and more accurate right hooks to the side and back of Foreman&#x27;s head, leaving him dazed and careening backwards. After a lightning two-punch flurry squared him up, Ali ended the bout with a combination of solid left hook and straight right flush to the jaw that sent Foreman windmilling hard to the canvas, the first time he had been down in his career. At the stoppage, Ali led on all three scorecards by 68–66, 70–67, and 69–66.

Foreman later reflected, &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t my night&quot;. Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Though he sought a rematch with Ali, he was unable to secure one. In some quarters it was suggested Ali was ducking him, while taking on low-risk opponents such as Chuck Wepner, Richard Dunn, Jean Pierre Coopman, and Alfredo Evangelista. However, Ali also fought formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle, and accepted rematches with Frazier and Ken Norton, the only two men to have beaten him up until that time.

===Return to the ring===

==== Foreman vs. Five ====
Foreman announced an exhibition match in 1975, billed as Foreman vs Five, where he would fight five contenders in one night. Following his first loss to Muhammad Ali and a subsequent year-long hiatus, the event was meant to re-spark interest in Foreman and showcase his strength and ability to knockout opponents. The first criticisms came as the opponents Foreman was fighting were revealed to be journeymen with sub-par or inexperienced records. This energy transferred over to the night of the event as Foreman was met with boos from the crowd as well as antagonistic chants of &quot;Ali! Ali! Ali&quot; as he made his appearance and walked out to the ring. While in the ring, Foreman began to verbally spar with Ali, who was commentating ring-side with Howard Cosell. After knocking-out opponents, Foreman would walk over to his corner and begin to taunt Ali, to which Ali responded by yelling advice to Foreman&#x27;s opponents mid-fight. Foreman was met with jeers all throughout the night as the crowd grew increasingly displeased at Foreman&#x27;s defeats of his first three opponents, all by knockout. After the initial victories, Foreman, now completely enraged and exhausted, was unable to beat his last two opponents, who were met with cheers and applause for lasting against the former champion. The event was initially meant to bolster support for Foreman&#x27;s comeback, though the public was now even more unsure of his abilities. This state of affairs would last until the marvel that was Foreman&#x27;s first professional comeback with Ron Lyle.

==== Foreman vs. Lyle ====
In 1976, he announced a professional comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent was to be Ron Lyle, who had been defeated by Ali in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the number-five rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of &quot;The Ring&quot;. At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed to the canvas. Lyle remained down, giving Foreman a KO victory. The fight was named by &quot;The Ring&quot; as &quot;The Fight of the Year&quot;.

==== Foreman vs. Frazier II ====

For his next bout, Foreman chose to face Joe Frazier in a rematch. Frazier was then the world&#x27;s number-three heavyweight per &quot;The Ring&quot;. Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32–3, having lost only to Foreman and Ali twice, and Foreman was 41–1, with his sole defeat at the hands of Ali. However, their rematch began competitively, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches. Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision, which was knocked loose during the bout. Unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out Scott LeDoux in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year.

==== Foreman vs. Young ====
Foreman had a life-changing year in 1977. After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at Pensacola, Florida, Foreman flew to Puerto Rico a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatize. His opponent was the skilled boxer Jimmy Young, who had beaten Ron Lyle and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round seven, but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round twelve before losing by unanimous decision. Referee Waldemar Schmidt had it 118–111, judge Cesar Ramos scored it 116–112, and judge Ismael Wiso Fernandez scored it 115–114, all to Young.

=== Retirement ===
Foreman became ill in his dressing room after the fight. He was suffering from exhaustion and heatstroke and stated he had a near-death experience. He spoke of being in a hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and felt that he was in the midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if this is death – I still believe there is a God!&quot;

After this experience, Foreman became a born-again Christian, dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the minister of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

===Comeback===
In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a &quot;death sentence&quot;). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times, including a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi when referee Carlos Padilla stopped the fight.

Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first retirement, although he found keeping his balance harder after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man had improved and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).

By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, most notably the successful George Foreman Grill. His public persona improved considerably, and the formerly aloof, intimidating Foreman was replaced by a cheerful, friendly man who engaged in self-deprecation on The Tonight Show. He also befriended Ali and as the latter had done, made himself a celebrity outside of boxing. Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the undisputed heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield.

====Foreman vs. Cooney====

In 1990, Foreman met former title challenger Gerry Cooney in Atlantic City. Cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity, but was well regarded for his punching power. Cooney wobbled Foreman in the first round, but Foreman landed several powerful punches in the second round. Cooney was knocked down twice and Foreman finished with a KO. Foreman went on to win four more fights that year.

===World title challenges===
====Foreman vs. Holyfield====

The following year, Foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield for the world title in a pay-per-view boxing event. Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield&#x27;s best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points, with scores of 116–111, 115–112, and 117–110. Although &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Round of the Year&quot; was not awarded in 1991, the seventh round, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, has been called a historic round of boxing and the remarkable high point of the fight.

====Foreman vs. Stewart====

A year later, Foreman fought journeyman Alex Stewart, who had previously been stopped in the first round by Mike Tyson. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round, but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded. By the end of the 10th and final round, Foreman&#x27;s face was bloodied and swollen, but the judges awarded him a majority decision win, with scores of 94–94 and 94–93 twice.

====Foreman vs. Morrison====

In 1993, Foreman received another title shot, although this was for the vacant WBO title. Foreman&#x27;s opponent was Tommy Morrison, a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he turned his back on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision, with two scores of 117–110 and one score of 118–109.

In this period, Foreman also starred briefly in the situation comedy &quot;George&quot; on ABC. The show, which featured Foreman as a retired boxer, premiered in November 1993, and ran for 10 episodes, where nine aired. The show was co-produced by actor and former boxer Tony Danza.

===Second reign as heavyweight champion===
====Foreman vs. Moorer====

In 1994, Foreman again sought to challenge for the world championship after Michael Moorer had beaten Holyfield for the IBF and WBA titles.
Having lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion.

Foreman&#x27;s title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to &quot;pull the trigger&quot; on his punches. Entering the 10th round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards, with two judges had it 88–83 and one had it 86–85, all to Moorer. However, he launched a comeback in the 10th round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then, a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip, and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.

In an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: He became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a world championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.

====Foreman vs. Schulz====

Shortly after the 1994 Moorer fight, Foreman began talking about a potential superfight with Mike Tyson, then the youngest heavyweight champion on record. In 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Foreman as stating, &quot;If he doesn&#x27;t sign with Don King, we&#x27;ll fight before the end of the year... I can&#x27;t be bothered having trouble with Don King. Every contract has some complication.&quot; Tyson signed with King (and by 1998, was suing him for $100 million); the bout never materialized.

The WBA demanded that Foreman fight their number-one challenger, who at the time was the competent, but aging, Tony Tucker. For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt.

On April 22, 1995, Foreman fought midlevel underdog prospect Axel Schulz, of Germany, in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range, and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision, with one judge ruled the fight a draw with a score of 114–114, while the other two had the fight 115–113 in favor of Foreman. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany; Foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title, yet continued to be recognized as the Lineal Heavyweight Champion.

===Post-title career===
====Foreman vs. Briggs====
In 1996, Foreman returned to Tokyo, scoring an easy win over the unrated Crawford Grimsley by a 12-round decision, with scores of 116–112, 117–111, and 119–109. In 1997, he faced contender Lou Savarese, winning a close split decision (113–114, 115–112, and 118–110) in a grueling, competitive encounter. Then, yet another opportunity came Foreman&#x27;s way as the WBC decided to match him against Shannon Briggs in a 1997 &quot;eliminator bout&quot; for the right to face WBC champion Lennox Lewis. After 12 rounds, in which Foreman consistently rocked Briggs with power punches, almost everyone at ringside saw Foreman as the clear winner. Like Foreman&#x27;s fight with Schulz, the decision was highly controversial, but this time the decision went in favor of Foreman&#x27;s opponent, with Briggs awarded a majority decision. One judge scored the bout 114–114, while the other two judges scored it 117–113 and 116–112 for Briggs. Foreman had fought for the last time, at the age of 48.

===Second retirement===

A travelogue series of the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts called &quot;The Walt Disney Magic Hour&quot; hosted by Foreman was supposed to debut as part of PAX&#x27;s debut lineup in 1998, but never made it to air.

Foreman was gracious and philosophical in his loss to Briggs, but announced his &quot;final&quot; retirement shortly afterwards. However, he did plan a return bout against Larry Holmes in 1999, scheduled to take place at the Houston Astrodome on pay-per-view. The fight was to be billed as &quot;The Birthday Bash&quot; due to both fighters&#x27; upcoming birthdays. Foreman was set to make $10 million and Holmes was to make $4 million, but negotiations fell through and the fight was cancelled. With a continuing affinity for the sport, Foreman became a respected boxing analyst for HBO.

Foreman said he had no plans to resume his career as a boxer, but then announced in February 2004 that he was training for one more comeback fight to demonstrate that the age of 55, like 40, is not a &quot;death sentence&quot;. The bout, against an unspecified opponent (rumored to be Trevor Berbick), never materialized (Foreman&#x27;s wife was widely thought to have been a major factor in the change of plans). George Foreman left the sport of boxing after leaving HBO to pursue other opportunities.

==Ministerial career==
In his youth, Foreman grew up largely without the presence of religion in his life. After a boxing match with heavyweight Jimmy Young, Foreman was in the locker room and suddenly felt that he was dying. Wanting to survive, he prayerfully offered &quot;to devote his boxing prize money to charity&quot; when he heard a voice saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want your money...I want you.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:

George Foreman stated that in this crisis experience, he became born again Christian. Following this, HBO boxing commentator Larry Merchant commented that &quot;There was a transformation from a young, hard character who felt a heavyweight champion should carry himself with menace to a very affectionate personality.&quot; Foreman was welcomed by members of The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, a Holiness Pentecostal church on Lone Oak Road in Houston, where he eventually became the pastor in 1980. Under his leadership, the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center in order to minister to children and adolescents in the area. 
Foreman declared that &quot;I&#x27;m always studying the Bible&quot; and stated that &quot;The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don&#x27;t know.&quot; Foreman leads three church services per week, in which his sermons aim &quot;to reveal something about the Bible that they [his congregation] didn&#x27;t know&quot;. Foreman opines that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what you achieve, what you accomplish in this life...The most important thing is to keep your eye on the true prize, and that&#x27;s serving God.&quot;

==Other works==
In 2022, Foreman competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Venus Fly Trap&quot;. He was eliminated on &quot;Hall of Fame Night&quot; alongside George Clinton as &quot;Gopher&quot;.

Foreman also served as an executive producer on &quot;Big George Foreman&quot;, a 2023 Christian film based on his sporting and spiritual life.

==Personal life==

Foreman has been married to Mary Joan Martelly since 1985. He had four previous marriages: to Adrienne Calhoun from 1971 to 1974, Cynthia Lewis from 1977 to 1979, Sharon Goodson from 1981 to 1982, and Andrea Skeete from 1982 to 1985.

Foreman has 12 children: five sons and seven daughters. His five sons are George Jr., George III (&quot;Monk&quot;), George IV (&quot;Big Wheel&quot;), George V (&quot;Red&quot;), and George VI (&quot;Little Joey&quot;). On his website, Foreman explains, &quot;I named all my sons George Edward Foreman so they would always have something in common. I say to them, &#x27;If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!&#x27;&quot; As with his father, George III has pursued a career in boxing and entrepreneurship. George IV appeared on the second season of the reality television series &quot;American Grit&quot;, where he placed seventh.

His seven daughters are Natalia, Leola, Freeda, Michi, Georgetta, Isabella, and Courtney. Natalia and Leola are from his marriage to Mary Joan Martelly. His daughters from separate relationships were Freeda, Michi, and Georgetta. He adopted a daughter, Isabella Brandie Lilja (Foreman), in 2009, and another, Courtney Isaac (Foreman), in 2012. Freeda had a 5–1 record as a pro boxer, retired in 2001, and died in 2019 at age 42 in an apparent suicide. Isabella Foreman lives in Sweden, where she has blogged since 2010 under the name of BellaNeutella.

In recognition of Foreman&#x27;s patriotism and community service, the American Legion honored him with its James V. Day &quot;Good Guy&quot; Award during its 95th National Convention in 2013.

==George Foreman Grill==
When Foreman came back from retirement, he argued that his success was due to his healthy eating. He was approached by Salton, Inc., which was looking for a spokesperson for its fat-reducing grill. , the George Foreman Grill has sold over 100 million units.

Although Foreman has never confirmed exactly how much he has earned from the endorsement, Salton paid him $138 million in 1999 for the right to use his name. Prior to that, he was paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), yielding an estimated total of over $200 million just from the endorsement through 2011, substantially more than he earned as a boxer.

<text>Ralf Hütter (born 20 August 1946) is a German musician and composer best known as the lead singer and keyboardist of Kraftwerk, which he founded with Florian Schneider in 1970, and became the only consistent member of the band (although he briefly departed from the band for several months in 1971), and the only one to appeared on every band&#x27;s albums. On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk was announced as one of the inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Hütter was born on 20 August 1946 in Krefeld, Germany. In 2009 he lived near Düsseldorf. He met Florian Schneider while studying improvisation at the Robert Schumann Hochschule. The pair started performing at happenings and art gallerys in the late 1960s, subsequently incorporating electronic sounds and building their own Kling Klang Studio. He is a vegetarian. Hütter is a secretive musician who avoids interviews. 

Hütter is an enthusiastic cycling fan, a fact reflected in some of the band&#x27;s work. It was widely claimed that, when he was on tour, the group&#x27;s bus would drop off Hütter 100 miles away from the next venue and he would cycle the rest of the way, a story that Hütter later confirmed. The band members took up cycling when recording the album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; in the late 1970s. Ralf Hütter had been looking for a new form of exercise. The single &quot;Tour de France&quot; includes sounds that follow this theme, including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single&#x27;s release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based around cycling. At the time this did not happen, but the project eventually was released as &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; in 2003.

Hütter was involved in a serious cycling accident in May or June 1982, during the initial period of recording for the 1986 album &quot;Electric Café&quot;. He was in a coma as a result. Karl Bartos claimed the first thing Hütter said when he awoke from his coma was &quot;Where is my bicycle?&quot;, a story Hütter later disputed in a June 2009 interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
