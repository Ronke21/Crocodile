<text>James Vernon Taylor (born March 12, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.

Taylor achieved his breakthrough in 1970 with the single &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; and had his first hit in 1971 with his recording of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, written by Carole King in the same year. His 1976 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was certified Diamond and has sold 11 million copies in the US alone, making it one of the best-selling albums in US history. Following his 1977 album &quot;JT&quot;, he has retained a large audience over the decades. Every album that he released from 1977 to 2007 sold over 1 million copies. He enjoyed a resurgence in chart performance during the late 1990s and 2000s, when he recorded some of his most-awarded work (including &quot;Hourglass&quot;, &quot;October Road&quot;, and &quot;Covers&quot;). He achieved his first number-one album in the US in 2015 with &quot;Before This World&quot;.

Taylor is also known for his covers, such as &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&quot; and &quot;Handy Man&quot;, as well as originals such as &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;. He played the leading role in Monte Hellman&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;.

==Early years==
James Vernon Taylor was born at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on March 12, 1948. His father, Isaac M. Taylor, worked as a resident physician at the hospital and came from a wealthy Southern family. Taylor is of English and Scottish descent from the Taylor family of the Montrose area, with the former being rooted in Massachusetts Bay Colony; his ancestors include Edmund Rice, an English colonist who co-founded Sudbury, Massachusetts. His mother, Gertrude (née Woodard; 1921–2015), studied singing with Marie Sundelius at the New England Conservatory of Music and was an aspiring opera singer before she married Isaac in 1946. Taylor is the younger brother of musician Alex Taylor (1947–1993) and the older brother of musicians Kate Taylor (born 1949) and Livingston Taylor (born 1950). His youngest sibling, a brother named Hugh (born 1952), was also a musician; Hugh eventually left the music industry and has operated The Outermost Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Aquinnah, Massachusetts, with his wife since 1989.

In 1951, Taylor and his family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated. Taylor later said, &quot;Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, caused by local copper mining [Taylor&#x27;s later song, &quot;Copperline&quot; was a nostalgic salute to that area where Taylor grew up], plus the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people.&quot; James attended a public primary school in Chapel Hill. Isaac&#x27;s career prospered, but he was frequently away from home on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1955 and 1956. Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971. Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

Taylor took cello lessons as a child in North Carolina, before learning the guitar in 1960. His guitar style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate&#x27;s keyboards: &quot;My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand.&quot; Spending summer holidays with his family on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar felt that Taylor&#x27;s singing had a &quot;natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that &quot;thing&quot;.&quot; Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly. By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as &quot;Jamie &amp; Kootch&quot;.

In 1961, Taylor went to Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts. He faltered during his junior year, feeling uneasy in the high-pressure college prep environment despite having a good scholastic performance. The Milton headmaster later said, &quot;James was more sensitive and less goal-oriented than most students of his day.&quot; He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at Chapel Hill High School. There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964, they cut a single in Raleigh that featured James&#x27;s song &quot;Cha Cha Blues&quot; on the B-side. Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year, where he started applying to colleges to complete his education. But he felt part of a &quot;life that [he was] unable to lead&quot;, and he became depressed; he slept 20 hours each day, and his grades collapsed. In late 1965 he committed himself to McLean, a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, where he was treated with chlorpromazine, and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure. As the Vietnam War escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from the Selective Service System, when he appeared before them, uncommunicative, with two white-suited McLean assistants. Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital&#x27;s associated Arlington School. He later viewed his nine-month stay at McLean as &quot;a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve&quot;, and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well. As for his mental health struggles, Taylor thought of them as innate and said: &quot;It&#x27;s an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings.&quot;

==Career==
===1966–1969: Early career===
At Kortchmar&#x27;s urging, Taylor checked himself out of McLean and attended Elon University for a semester before he moved to New York City to form a band. They recruited Joel O&#x27;Brien, formerly of Kortchmar&#x27;s old band King Bees to play drums, and Taylor&#x27;s childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of academic Jerome Wiesner) to play bass. After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine. They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as &quot;Knocking &#x27;Round the Zoo&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk Now&quot;, and &quot;The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream&quot;. In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt. By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village, alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People.

Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar&#x27;s dismay. In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Night Owl&quot;, backed with his &quot;Brighten Your Night with My Day&quot;. Released on Rainy Day Records, distributed by Jubilee Records, it received some radio airplay in the Northeast, but only charted at nationally. Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album. After a series of poorly chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport, Bahamas for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up. (A UK band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song &quot;Smile a Little Smile for Me&quot;. The Flying Machine was briefly referenced in Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, and following his success as a solo artist, the band&#x27;s recordings were later released in 1971 as &quot;James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine&quot;.)

Taylor would later say of this New York period, &quot;I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs.&quot; Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown heroin addiction during the final Flying Machine period: &quot;I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink.&quot; He hung out in Washington Square Park, playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment. Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions. Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly.

Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After recording some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A&amp;R head for the Beatles&#x27; newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot;, to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: &quot;I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great ... and he came and played live, so it was just like, &#x27;Wow, he&#x27;s &quot;great&quot;.&#x27;&quot; Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for &quot;opening the door&quot; to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, &quot;I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before.&quot;
Living chaotically in various places with various women, Taylor wrote additional material, including &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot;, and rehearsed with a new backing band. Taylor recorded what would become his first album from July to October 1968, at Trident Studios, at the same time the Beatles were recording &quot;The White Album&quot;. McCartney and an uncredited George Harrison guested on &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot;, whose lyric &quot;holy host of others standing around me&quot; referred to the Beatles, and the title phrase of Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot; provided the lyrical starting point for Harrison&#x27;s classic &quot;Something&quot;. McCartney and Asher brought in arranger Richard Anthony Hewson to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual &quot;link&quot; passages between them; they would receive a mixed reception, at best.

During the recording sessions, Taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and methedrine. He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders. Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, &quot;James Taylor&quot;, in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US. Critical reception was generally positive, including a complimentary review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; by Jon Landau, who said that &quot;this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I&#x27;ve inhaled in a good long while. It knocks me out.&quot; The record&#x27;s commercial potential suffered from Taylor&#x27;s inability to promote it because of his hospitalization, and it sold poorly; &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; was released as a single but failed to chart in the UK and only reached on the U.S. charts.

In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night stand at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. On July 20, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him. His set at Newport was cut short after 15 minutes, when festival co-founder George Wein announced on stage that the Apollo 11 astronauts had landed on the moon. Shortly thereafter, Taylor broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and was forced to stop playing for several months. However, while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969 signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.

===1970–1972: Warner Bros. and career breakthrough===

Once he had recovered, Taylor moved to California, keeping Asher as his manager and record producer. In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;, and featuring the participation of Carole King, the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor&#x27;s critical and popular breakthrough, buoyed by the single &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, a song about both Taylor&#x27;s experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, with &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; selling more than 1.5 million copies in its first year and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor&#x27;s talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for Album of the Year. It went on to be listed at on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, with &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; listed as on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004.

During the time that &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; was released, Taylor appeared with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys in a Monte Hellman film, &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;. In October 1970, he performed with his then partner Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, and the Canadian band Chilliwack at a Vancouver benefit concert that funded Greenpeace&#x27;s protests of 1971 nuclear weapons tests by the US Atomic Energy Commission at Amchitka, Alaska; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as &quot;Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace&quot;. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor&#x27;s next album began.

He appeared on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, singing &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;, &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, and &quot;Country Road&quot;, on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story of him as &quot;the face of new rock&quot;. It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;″ Heathcliff and to &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, and said, &quot;Taylor&#x27;s use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music.&quot; One of the writers described his look as &quot;a cowboy Jesus&quot;, to which Taylor later replied, &quot;I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison.&quot;

Released in April 1971, &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot; also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor&#x27;s biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King&#x27;s new &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell), which reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot;, also made the Top 40 and reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached on the album charts, which would be Taylor&#x27;s highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, &quot;Before This World&quot;, which went to superseding Taylor Swift. In early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;; King also won Song of the Year for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5 million copies in the United States.

November 1972 heralded the release of Taylor&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;One Man Dog&quot;. A concept album primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by Linda Ronstadt along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and John McLaughlin. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot;, peaked at on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, &quot;One Man Parade&quot;, barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter Carly Simon on November 3, in a small ceremony at her Murray Hill, Manhattan apartment. A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at Radio City Music Hall turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years. They had two children, Sarah Maria &quot;Sally&quot; Taylor, born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon &quot;Ben&quot; Taylor, born January 22, 1977. During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other&#x27;s albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez &amp; Charlie Foxx&#x27;s &quot;Mockingbird&quot; and a version of The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Devoted to You&quot;.

===1973–1976: Continued success and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
Taylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. &quot;Walking Man&quot; was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and Linda McCartney and guitarist David Spinozza. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.
However, Taylor&#x27;s artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album &quot;Gorilla&quot; reached and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a version of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&quot;, featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached in America and in Canada. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood &quot;Mexico&quot;, featuring a guest appearance by Crosby &amp; Nash, also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, &quot;Gorilla&quot; showcased Taylor&#x27;s electric, lighter side that was evident on &quot;Walking Man&quot;. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with songs such as &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Wandering&quot; and &quot;Angry Blues&quot;. It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, &quot;Sarah Maria&quot;.

&quot;Gorilla&quot; was followed in 1976 by &quot;In the Pocket&quot;, Taylor&#x27;s last studio album to be released under Warner Bros. Records. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including Art Garfunkel, David Crosby, Bonnie Raitt, and Stevie Wonder (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single &quot;Shower the People&quot;, an enduring song that hit on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit 22 on the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching and being criticized, particularly by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Still, &quot;In The Pocket&quot; went on to be certified gold.

With the close of Taylor&#x27;s contract with Warner, in November, the label released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11× Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the RIAA, and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.

===1977–1981: Move to Columbia Records===
In 1977 Taylor signed with Columbia Records. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. &quot;JT&quot;, released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;, earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977, issue, &quot;&quot;JT&quot; is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That&#x27;s not meant to criticize Taylor&#x27;s earlier efforts. ... But it&#x27;s nice to hear him sounding so healthy.&quot; &quot;JT&quot; reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album&#x27;s Triple Platinum status ties it with &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; as Taylor&#x27;s all-time biggest-selling studio album. It was propelled by Jimmy Jones&#x27;s and Otis Blackwell&#x27;s &quot;Handy Man&quot;, which hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart and reached on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop &quot;Your Smiling Face&quot;, an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t Leave L.A.&quot;, which Danny Kortchmar wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only .

Back in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with Paul Simon on Art Garfunkel&#x27;s recording of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on Broadway, he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled &quot;Flag&quot;, featuring a Top 30 version of Gerry Goffin&#x27;s and Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;. (Two selections from &quot;Flag&quot;, &quot;Millworker&quot; and &quot;Brother Trucker&quot; were featured on the PBS production of the Broadway musical based on Studs Terkel&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;&quot;, which Terkel himself hosted. Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed &quot;Brother Trucker&quot; in character.) Taylor also appeared on the No Nukes concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the &quot;No Nukes&quot; album and film.

On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with Mark David Chapman who would murder John Lennon just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: &quot;The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.&quot; The next night, Taylor, who lived in a building next-door to Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: &quot;I heard him shoot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions.&quot;

In March 1981, Taylor released the album &quot;Dad Loves His Work&quot; whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other. The album was another Platinum success, reaching and providing Taylor&#x27;s final real hit single in a duet with JD Souther, &quot;Her Town Too&quot;, which reached on the Adult Contemporary chart and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===1981–1996: Troubled times and new beginnings===

Simon announced her separation from Taylor in September 1981 saying, &quot;Our needs are different; it seem[s] impossible to stay together&quot; and their divorce finalized in 1983. Their breakup was highly publicized. At the time, Taylor was living on West End Avenue in Manhattan and on a methadone maintenance program to cure him of his drug addiction. Over the course of four months starting in September 1983, spurred on in part by the deaths of his friends John Belushi and Dennis Wilson and in part by the desire to be a better father to his children Sally and Ben, he discontinued methadone and overcame his heroin habit.

Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. &quot;I had ... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while&quot;, he recalled in 1995:

The song &quot;Only a Dream in Rio&quot; was written in tribute to that night, with lines like &quot;I was there that very day and my heart came back alive.&quot; The October 1985 album, &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song &quot;Everyday&quot;, released as a single reached . On the album track &quot;Only One&quot;, the backing vocals were performed by an all-star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.

Taylor&#x27;s next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released &quot;Never Die Young&quot;, highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum &quot;New Moon Shine&quot; provided Taylor some popular songs with &quot;Copperline&quot; and &quot;(I&#x27;ve Got to) Stop Thinkin&#x27; About That&quot;, both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer amphitheater circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc &quot;Live&quot; album captures this, with a highlight being Arnold McCuller&#x27;s descants in the codas of &quot;Shower the People&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot;. He provided a guest voice to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;, and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in &quot;Randy Newman&#x27;s Faust&quot;.

===1997–present: Current ventures===

==== 1997–2008 ====

In 1997, after six years since his last studio album, Taylor released &quot;Hourglass&quot;, an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor&#x27;s troubled past and family. &quot;Jump Up Behind Me&quot; paid tribute to his father&#x27;s rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill. &quot;Enough To Be on Your Way&quot; was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker&#x27;s divorce, which took place in 1996. &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; found that &quot;one of the themes of this record is disbelief&quot;, while Taylor told the magazine that it was &quot;spirituals for agnostics&quot;. Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and &quot;Hourglass&quot; was a commercial success, reaching on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (Taylor&#x27;s first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on &quot;Little More Time With You&quot;. The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since &quot;JT&quot;, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998.

Flanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor&#x27;s Platinum-certified &quot;October Road&quot; appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that &quot;I thought I&#x27;d passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17.&quot; The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a &quot;limited edition&quot; two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with Mark Knopfler, &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot;, which also appeared on Knopfler&#x27;s album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician Alison Krauss in singing &quot;The Boxer&quot; at the Kennedy Center Honors Tribute to Paul Simon. They later recorded the Louvin Brothers duet, &quot;How&#x27;s the World Treating You?&quot; In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released &quot;James Taylor: A Christmas Album&quot; with distribution through Hallmark Cards.
Always visibly active in environmental and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the Vote for Change tour playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for John Kerry and against George W. Bush in that year&#x27;s presidential campaign. Taylor&#x27;s appearances were joint performances with the Dixie Chicks.

Taylor performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and &quot;America&quot; for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the 2008 NBA Finals in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the NHL&#x27;s Winter Classic game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins.

In December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; entitled &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;. He sang Sam Cooke&#x27;s classic &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor&#x27;s wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on CMT&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot; alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, MusiCares honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer Natalie Maines acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him. They performed his song, &quot;Shower the People&quot;, with a surprise appearance by Arnold McCuller, who has sung backing vocals on Taylor&#x27;s live tours and albums for many years.

In the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled &quot;James Taylor at Christmas&quot;, and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed Randy Newman&#x27;s song &quot;Our Town&quot; for the Disney animated film &quot;Cars&quot;. The song was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York honoring newly sworn in Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer.

Taylor&#x27;s next album, &quot;One Man Band&quot; was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music Label, where he joined with Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor&#x27;s most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins—accompanied solely by the &quot;one man band&quot; of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, Larry Goldings. The digital discrete 5.1 surround sound mix of &quot;One Man Band&quot; won a TEC Award for best surround sound recording in 2008.
On November 28–30, 2007, Taylor accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as Tom Waits, Neil Diamond, and Elton John, performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank (a member of America&#x27;s Second Harvest, the nation&#x27;s Food Bank Network). Parts of the performance shown on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, &quot;I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly&quot;. Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his &quot;One Man Band&quot; DVD and tour performances.

In December 2007, &quot;James Taylor at Christmas&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award. In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including Luis Conte, Michael Landau, Lou Marini, Arnold McCuller, Jimmy Johnson, David Lasley, Walt Fowler, Andrea Zonn, Kate Markowitz, Steve Gadd and Larry Goldings. The resulting live-in-studio album, named &quot;Covers&quot;, was released in September 2008. The album forays into country and soul while being the latest proof that Taylor is a more versatile singer than his best-known hits might suggest. The Covers sessions stretched to include &quot;Oh What a Beautiful Morning&quot;, from the musical Oklahoma!, a song that his grandmother had caught him singing over and over at the top of his lungs when he was seven years old. Meanwhile, in summer 2008, Taylor and this band toured 34 North American cities with a tour entitled James Taylor and His Band of Legends. An additional album, called &quot;Other Covers&quot;, came out in April 2009, containing songs that were recorded during the same sessions as the original &quot;Covers&quot; but had not been put out to the full public yet.

==== Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 campaign and inaugural celebration ====

During October 19–21, 2008, Taylor performed a series of free concerts in five North Carolina cities in support of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential bid.

Taylor appeared briefly in the 2009 movie &quot;Funny People&quot;, where he played &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; for a MySpace corporate event as the opening act for the main character.

On January 1, 2010, Taylor sang the American national anthem at the NHL Winter Classic at Fenway Park, while Daniel Powter sang the Canadian national anthem.

On March 7, 2010, Taylor sang the Beatles&#x27; &quot;In My Life&quot; in tribute to deceased artists at the 82nd Academy Awards.
In March 2010, he commenced the Troubadour Reunion Tour with Carole King and members of his original band, including Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar. They played shows in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and North America with the final night being at the Honda Center, in Anaheim, California. The tour was a major commercial success and in some locations found Taylor playing arenas instead of his usual theaters or amphitheaters. Ticket sales amounted to over 700,000 and the tour grossed over $59 million. It was one of the most successful tours of the year.

He appeared in 2011 in the ABC comedy &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot; as the ex-husband of the character played by Allison Janney, and he performs a duet of sorts on Leon Russell&#x27;s 1970 classic &quot;A Song for You&quot;.

On September 11, 2011, Taylor performed &quot;You Can Close Your Eyes&quot; in New York City at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

On November 22, 2011, Taylor performed &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; with Taylor Swift, who was named after him, at the last concert of her Speak Now World Tour in Madison Square Garden. They also sang Swift&#x27;s song, &quot;Fifteen&quot;. Then, on July 2, 2012, Swift appeared as Taylor&#x27;s special guest in a concert at Tanglewood.

==== Barack Obama&#x27;s 2012 campaign and second inauguration ====
He was active in support of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2012 reelection campaign and opened the 2012 Democratic National Convention singing three songs. He performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at the President&#x27;s second inauguration.

==== 2013–present ====
On April 24, 2013, Taylor performed at the memorial service for slain MIT police officer Sean Collier, who was killed by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the men responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Taylor was accompanied by the MIT Symphony Orchestra and three MIT a cappella groups while performing his songs &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; and &quot;Shower the People&quot;.

On September 6 and 7, 2013, he performed with the Utah Symphony and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Thirtieth Anniversary O.C. Tanner Gift of Music Gala Concert at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City. He called the choir &quot;a national treasure&quot; In addition to the symphony and choir he was backed by some of his touring band: pianist Charles Floyd, bassist Jimmy Johnson and percussionist Nick Halley.

After a 45-year wait, James earned his first album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with &quot;Before This World&quot;. The album, which was released on June 16 through Concord Records, arrived on top the chart of July 4, 2015, more than 45 years after Taylor arrived on the list with &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; (on the March 14, 1970, list). The album launched atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 97,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending June 21, 2015, according to Nielsen Music. Of its start, pure album sales were 96,000 copies sold, Taylor&#x27;s best debut week for an album since 2002&#x27;s &quot;October Road&quot;.

Taylor cancelled his 2017 concert in Manila as a protest to the extrajudicial killings of suspects in the Philippine Drug War.

In January 2020, Taylor released his audio memoir &quot;Break Shot: My First 21 Years&quot; on the streaming service Audible.

Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;American Standard&quot; was released on February 28, 2020. &quot;American Standard&quot; debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, making Taylor the first act to earn a top 10 album in each of the last six decades. In May 2020, James Taylor and Jackson Browne rescheduled their 2020 tour dates to 2021 due to the COVID-19 crisis. On November 24, 2020, the album was nominated for a Grammy in the category of &quot;Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album&quot;. At the 63rd Grammy Awards, the album won the award, the first for James Taylor after being nominated in the same category in the 50th Grammy Awards in 2008 for James Taylor at Christmas.

On August 20, 2022, Taylor performed at Tanglewood in celebration of John Williams&#x27; 90th birthday, where he sang &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;, &quot;Sweet Baby John&quot; and &quot;Your Smiling Face&quot;. Taylor appeared with Carole King in the 2022 documentary &quot;Carole King and James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name&quot;.

Taylor performed multiple songs, including &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; at a rally held by Tim Walz on October 24, 2024 in Wilmington, North Carolina as part of the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.

==Personal life==

Taylor married singer Carly Simon in November 1972, in a low-key ceremony at Simon&#x27;s home in New York. Taylor was 24 and Simon 29; they divorced in 1983. Their children, Sally and Ben, are also musicians.

Taylor married actress Kathryn Walker at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on December 14, 1985. She helped him fight his heroin addiction, but they divorced in 1996.

In 1995, Taylor began dating Caroline &quot;Kim&quot; Smedvig, the director of public relations and marketing for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. They had met when he performed with John Williams and the Boston Pops orchestra. They were married at the Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Boston on February 18, 2001. Part of their relationship was worked into the 2002 album &quot;October Road&quot;, specifically on the songs &quot;On the 4th of July&quot; and &quot;Caroline I See You&quot;. Following the birth of their twin sons Rufus and Henry in April 2001, they settled in Lenox, Massachusetts. Their son Henry has toured as a backing vocalist with his father as of 2021.

==Awards and recognition==

In 2006, Taylor was the Grammy Award-sponsored MusiCares Person of the Year. At a black tie ceremony held in Los Angeles, musicians from several eras paid tribute to Taylor by performing his songs, often prefacing them with remarks on his influence on their decisions to become musicians. Artists include Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Taj Mahal, Dr. John, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, David Crosby, Sheryl Crow, India.Arie, The Chicks, Jerry Douglas, Alison Krauss, and Keith Urban.

<text>Albert &quot;Alberto&quot; Dávila (born August 10, 1954) is an American former professional boxer who was the World Boxing Council (WBC) bantamweight champion of the world. His career spanned the 1970s and 1980s in the bantamweight division, and his reign as world champion occurred in parts of 1983 and 1984. Dávila lost world bantamweight championships matches three times, and temporarily left the sport. After his return, he was given a fourth title fight, versus Kiko Bejines, in 1983. Trailing after 11 rounds, Dávila scored a knockout of Bejines to win the title, but Bejines died shortly afterward due to injuries suffered during the fight. Following one successful title defense, Dávila suffered back injuries, leading the WBC to strip him of his title. He later fought in two more world championship fights, losing both. Dávila is a member of the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Boxing career==

===Early life and career===
Originally from Texas, and later Pomona, California, Dávila, who is of Mexican descent, took up boxing at the age of 12, and worked out daily at a boxing gym for six years. He graduated from Pomona Garey High School. In his professional debut, on March 1, 1973, Dávila defeated Carlos Villareal in a four-round bout decided on points. After 13 consecutive victories, he lost for the first time against Cecil Escobido in July 1974 by a split decision. Dávila boxed with many of the best boxers of the bantamweight division during the following years. He beat Lupe Pintor by a 10-round decision in 1976, and lost to Wilfredo Gómez by a knockout in Puerto Rico, the first fight in which he was knocked out. In 1978, Dávila challenged Carlos Zarate for the WBC&#x27;s world title, losing by a knockout. Later that year, he fought for the World Boxing Association championship against Panama&#x27;s Jorge Luján. The bout took place in the Louisiana Superdome, and was part of the undercard for a world heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks. The fight ended in a decision victory for Luján. After Pintor beat Zarate for the WBC title, Dávila was given a second chance at that belt in a 1980 rematch with the Mexican world champion, and lost by a 15-round decision. At one point, he retired from boxing for a time, working as a beer delivery man. Dávila was inactive for all of 1981, returning in early 1982 and going seven fights without a loss through April 1983.

===Kiko Bejines fight===
In March 1983, Pintor suffered a motorcycle accident and was forced into a lengthy absence, leaving the WBC bantamweight crown vacant. The WBC assigned its number one challenger, Dávila, to face its third-ranked fighter, Kiko Bejines, for the interim title. The fight was held in Los Angeles, and most of it was described by Associated Press sports writer Ken Peters as &quot;uneventful&quot;. Bejines held a lead on two of the three judges&#x27; scorecards at the end of 11 rounds (the third had the fight even), and Dávila rushed out of his corner and attacked Bejines right away in round 12. With 25 seconds elapsed in the round, a right hand to Bejines&#x27; chin struck, followed by a pair of left hands and a right. Bejines fell to the floor and was counted out, giving Dávila the victory and WBC interim bantamweight championship. Unconscious after the fight, Bejines was airlifted to a nearby hospital and revealed to be in critical condition. He died as a result of his injuries. Dávila stayed at the medical center where Bejines was into the late night hours following the fight, and later said that he was &quot;in mourning with (Bejines&#x27;) family.&quot;

===WBC title reign===
Pintor moved into the super bantamweight division, and Dávila eventually became the full WBC bantamweight champion. He returned to the ring two months after the Bejines bout for a fight against Julio Rodrigues in which the WBC title was not at stake. In the summer of 1984, he defended the title against Dominican Enrique Sanchez in Miami, in a fight held outdoors. The early rounds saw Sanchez take control of the contest; an eight-punch flurry by him in round two caused Dávila to stagger. However, the fight turned in round six, as rain fell onto the ring. Dávila scored a knockdown near the end of round ten, and continued his attack on Sanchez at the start of the next round, earning a technical knockout to retain his title. After the fight, he compared to rain to &quot;holy water&quot;, saying &quot;It revived me. It was a miracle.&quot;

The WBC stated that Dávila would automatically give up his championship if he did not fight Pintor by August 15, 1984. A title defense was instead scheduled on September 14, 1984, versus Miguel Lora, but in a sparring session two weeks before the fight date, Dávila injured his back. This led to a postponement. Later, he worsened his injury while doing yardwork, leading to a yearlong absence from fighting. As a result, his belt was stripped by the WBC; it was officially vacated in the WBC&#x27;s rankings on March 23, 1985.

===Later career===
In 1987, he attempted to become a world champion again by traveling to Colombia and challenging Lora, but he lost a 12-round decision. He won a few fights after his loss to Lora, including a decision victory over Edel Geronimo in March 1987.

His next fight came three months later against Frankie Duarte, whom he had knocked out in a 1977 bout. The North American Boxing Federation (NABF) bantamweight championship was at stake, along with California&#x27;s title in the division. Despite a left eye that had a cut over it, Dávila was leading on the judges&#x27; scorecards entering the 10th round. With 51 seconds left in the round, a doctor stopped the bout due to the cut, giving a technical knockout win to Duarte. Dávila filed an official protest, seeking to have the result overturned. He claimed that an accidental headbutt during round four caused the cut; under the rules of the NABF, fights halted after three rounds went to a judges&#x27; decision. The protest was voted on in July by California&#x27;s State Athletic Commission; the voters deadlocked 3–3, leaving the result unchanged. In a bout held at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California on November 3, 1987, against Mexico&#x27;s Juan Estrada, Dávila suffered an accidental headbutt and was given the victory through a technical decision.

The NABF bantamweight championship was later vacated by the federation due to Duarte&#x27;s &quot;inactivity&quot;. Dávila was matched against Gil Contreras for the belt in April 1988, with a second WBC title match against Lora promised to him if he won. After scoring an eighth-round knockdown of Contreras, Dávila narrowly won a unanimous decision; all three judges had him ahead by either one or two points. The rematch versus Lora was scheduled at the Great Western Forum for August 1. Dávila, nearly 34 at the time, was the oldest bantamweight championship participant. For the second time, Dávila lost to Lora by a judges&#x27; decision after 12 rounds. Following the fight, he announced his retirement. His final win–loss record has been given alternately as 55–10–1 and 56–10 with one no contest.

==Fighting style==
Dávila was not considered a powerful puncher during his career, with fewer than half his career wins coming by knockout. Instead, he was thought of as a strong technical boxer. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Jim Murray called Dávila &quot;a picture boxer&quot;, saying that he fought &quot;with his brains instead of his face.&quot; Murray credited Dávila&#x27;s style to his childhood gym experience, when he discovered that he could avoid being punched if his opponent made the first move. Scott Ostler, another &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist, wrote of Dávila, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing marketable about him, except for one thing. He can fight.&quot; However, Dávila did attempt to gain support from Latino fans by fighting as Alberto Dávila, rather than using his given name, Albert.

==Later life and personal life==
Following his career as a boxer, Dávila began to work as a trainer. However, he quit in 1995 after one of the fighters he trained, David Kamau, lost to Julio César Chávez in a decision he disagreed with; he believed that Kamau would not have been able to win a decision, regardless of the circumstances. He later said, &quot;I thought to myself, I can&#x27;t do this to a fighter. I can&#x27;t betray him, so I got out. Dávila then worked in Irvine, California, as a laborer. In 1997, the World Boxing Hall of Fame inducted him. As of 2007, he resided in Upland. Dávila got married in 1975; he had met his wife, Roberta, in high school. The couple has six children: three sons and daughters each. One of their daughters, Alyssa, played soccer at the University of Southern California, and was a member of the Trojans&#x27; 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship-winning team.

<doc id="148383" wikidata="Q168289" url="?curid=148383" title="Arquebus">
<text>An arquebus ( ) is a form of long gun that appeared in Europe and the Ottoman Empire during the 15th century. An infantryman armed with an arquebus is called an arquebusier.

The term &quot;arquebus&quot; was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, but it originally referred to &quot;a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing&quot;. These &quot;hook guns&quot; were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 15th century. The addition of a shoulder stock, priming pan, and matchlock mechanism in the late 15th century turned the arquebus into a handheld firearm and also the first firearm equipped with a trigger.

The exact dating of the matchlock&#x27;s appearance is disputed. It could have appeared in the Ottoman Empire as early as 1465 and in Europe a little before 1475. The heavy arquebus, which was then called a musket, was developed to better penetrate plate armor and appeared in Europe around 1521. Heavy arquebuses mounted on war wagons were called &quot;arquebus à croc&quot;. These carried a lead ball of about .

A standardized arquebus, the &quot;caliver&quot;, was introduced in the latter half of the 16th century. The name &quot;caliver&quot; is an English derivation from the French &quot;&quot; – a reference to the gun&#x27;s standardized bore. The caliver allowed troops to load bullets faster since they fitted their guns more easily, whereas before soldiers often had to modify their bullets into suitable fits, or even made their own prior to battle.

The matchlock arquebus is considered the forerunner to the flintlock musket.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;arquebus&quot; is derived from the Dutch word (&quot;hook gun&quot;). which was applied to an assortment of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries. It originally referred to &quot;a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing&quot;. The first certain attestation of the term &quot;arquebus&quot; dates back to 1364, when the lord of Milan Bernabò Visconti recruited 70 &quot;archibuxoli&quot;, although in this case it almost certainly referred to a hand cannon. The &quot;arquebus&quot; has at times been known as the &quot;harquebus&quot;, &quot;harkbus&quot;, &quot;hackbut&quot;, &quot;hagbut&quot;, &quot;archibugio&quot;, &quot;haakbus&quot;, &quot;schiopo&quot;, &quot;sclopus&quot;, &quot;tüfenk&quot;, &quot;tofak&quot;, &quot;matchlock&quot;, and &quot;firelock&quot;.

===Musket===
The musket, essentially a large arquebus, was introduced around 1521, but fell out of favor by the mid-16th century due to the decline of armor. The term, however, remained and &quot;musket&quot; became a generic descriptor for smoothbore gunpowder weapons fired from the shoulder (&quot;shoulder arms&quot;) into the mid-19th century. At least on one occasion &quot;musket&quot; and &quot;arquebus&quot; were used interchangeably to refer to the same weapon, and even referred to as an &quot;arquebus musket&quot;. A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as &quot;double arquebuses&quot;. The &quot;matchlock&quot; firing mechanism also became a common term for the arquebus after it was added to the firearm. Later flintlock firearms were sometimes called &quot;fusils&quot; or &quot;fuzees&quot;.

==Mechanism and usage==

Prior to the appearance of the serpentine lever by around 1411, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock, which appeared roughly around 1475, changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when squeezed, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle.

While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming General Qi Jiguang composed an 11-step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: &quot;One, clean the gun. Two, pour the powder. Three, tamp the powder down. Four, drop the pellet. Five, drive the pellet down. Six, put in paper (stopper). Seven, drive the paper down. Eight, open the flashpan cover. Nine, pour in the flash powder. Ten, close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire.&quot; Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.

The development of volley fire—by the Ottomans, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Dutch—made the arquebus more feasible for widespread adoption by militaries. The volley fire technique transformed soldiers carrying firearms into organized firing squads with each row of soldiers firing in turn and reloading in a systematic fashion. Volley fire was implemented with cannons as early as 1388 by Ming artillerists, but volley fire with matchlocks was not implemented until 1526 when the Ottoman Janissaries utilized it during the Battle of Mohács. The matchlock volley fire technique was next seen in mid-16th-century China as pioneered by Qi Jiguang and in late-16th-century Japan. Qi Jiguang elaborates on his volley fire technique in the &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;:

In Europe, William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg theorized that by applying to firearms the same Roman counter march technique as described by Aelianus Tacticus, matchlocks could provide fire without cease. In a letter to his cousin Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, on 8 December 1594, he wrote:

Once volley firing had been developed, the rate of fire and efficiency was greatly increased and the arquebus went from being a support weapon to the primary focus of most early modern armies.

The wheellock mechanism was utilized as an alternative to the matchlock as early as 1505, but was more expensive to produce at three times the cost of a matchlock and prone to breakdown, thus limiting it primarily to specialist firearms and pistols.

The snaphance flintlock was invented by the mid-16th century and then the &quot;true&quot; flintlock in the early 17th century, but by this time the generic term for firearms had shifted to &quot;musket&quot;, and flintlocks are not usually associated with arquebuses.

==History==



===Origins===
The earliest known examples of an &quot;arquebus&quot; date back to 1411 in Europe and no later than 1425 in the Ottoman Empire. This early firearm was a hand cannon, whose roots trace back to China, with a serpentine lever to hold matches. However it did not have the matchlock mechanism traditionally associated with the arquebus. The exact dating of the matchlock addition is disputed. The first references to the use of what may have been arquebuses (&quot;tüfek&quot;) by the Janissary corps of the Ottoman army date them from 1394 to 1465. However, it is unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but according to Gábor Ágoston the fact that they were listed separately from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggest they were handheld firearms.

In Europe, a shoulder stock, probably inspired by the crossbow stock, was added to the arquebus around 1470 and the appearance of the matchlock mechanism is dated to a little before 1475. The matchlock arquebus was the first firearm equipped with a trigger mechanism. It is also considered to be the first portable shoulder-arms firearm.

===Ottomans===
The Ottomans made use of arquebuses as early as the first half of the fifteenth century. During the Ottoman–Hungarian wars of 1443–1444, it was noted that Ottoman defenders in Vidin had arquebuses. Based on the earliest known contemporary written sources, Godfrey Goodwin dates the first use of the arquebus by the Janissaries to no earlier than 1465. According to contemporary accounts, 400 arquebusiers served in Sultan Murad II&#x27;s campaign in the 1440s when he crossed Bosporus straits and arquebuses were used in combat by the Ottomans at the second battle of Kosovo in 1448. Ottomans also made some use of Wagon Fortresses which they copied from the Hussites, which often involved the placing of arquebusiers in the protective wagons and using them against the enemy. Arquebusiers were also used effectively at the battle of Bashkent in 1473 when they were used in conjunction with artillery.

===Europe===
The arquebus was used in substantial numbers for the first time in Europe during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (r. 1458–1490). One in four soldiers in the infantry of the Black Army of Hungary wielded an arquebus, and one in five when accounting for the whole army, which was an unusually high proportion at the time. Although they were present on the battlefield King Mathias preferred enlisting shielded men instead due to the arquebus&#x27;s low rate of fire. While the Black Army adopted arquebuses relatively early, the trend did not catch on for decades in Europe and by the turn of the 16th century only around 10% of Western European infantrymen used firearms. Arquebuses were used as early as 1472 by the Portuguese at Zamora. Likewise, the Castilians used arquebuses as well in 1476. The French started adopting the arquebus in 1520. However, arquebus designs continued to develop and in 1496 Philip Monch of the Palatinate composed an illustrated &quot;Buch der Strynt un(d) Buchsse(n)&quot; on guns and &quot;harquebuses&quot;.

The effectiveness of the arquebus was apparent by the Battle of Cerignola of 1503, which is the earliest-recorded military conflict where arquebuses played a decisive role in the outcome of the battle.

In Russia, a small arquebus called &quot;pishchal&quot; () appeared in 1478 in Pskov. The Russian arquebusiers, or &quot;pishchal&#x27;niki&quot;, were seen as integral parts of the army and one thousand &quot;pishchal&#x27;niki&quot; participated in the final annexation of the Pskov Republic in 1510 as well as the conquest of Smolensk in 1512. The Russian need to acquire gunpowder weaponry bears some resemblance to the situation the Iranians were in. In 1545, two thousand &quot;pishchal&#x27;niki&quot; (one thousand on horseback) were levied by the towns and outfitted at treasury expense. Their use of mounted troops was also unique to the time period. The &quot;pishchal&#x27;niki&quot; eventually became skilled hereditary tradesmen farmers rather than conscripts.

Arquebuses were used in the Italian Wars in the first half of the 16th century. Frederick Lewis Taylor claims that a kneeling volley fire may have been employed by Prospero Colonna&#x27;s arquebusiers as early as the Battle of Bicocca (1522). However, this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an overinterpretation as well as a mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers knelt to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. This is contested by Idan Sherer, who quotes Paolo Giovio saying that the arquebusiers kneeled to reload so that the second line of arquebusiers could fire without endangering those in front of them.

===Mamluks===
The Mamluks in particular were conservatively against the incorporation of gunpowder weapons. When faced with cannons and arquebuses wielded by the Ottomans they criticized them thus, &quot;God curse the man who invented them, and God curse the man who fires on Muslims with them.&quot; Insults were also levied against the Ottomans for having &quot;brought with you this contrivance artfully devised by the Christians of Europe when they were incapable of meeting the Muslim armies on the battlefield&quot;. Similarly, musketeers and musket-wielding infantrymen were despised in society by the feudal knights, even until the time of Miguel de Cervantes (1547–1616). Eventually the Mamluks under Qaitbay were ordered in 1489 to train in the use of &quot;al-bunduq al-rasas&quot; (arquebuses). However, in 1514 an Ottoman army of 12,000 soldiers wielding arquebuses devastated a much larger Mamluk army. The arquebus had become a common infantry weapon by the 16th century due to its relative cheapness—a helmet, breastplate and pike cost about three and a quarter ducats while an arquebus only a little over one ducat. Another advantage of arquebuses over other equipment and weapons was its short training period. While a bow potentially took years to master, an effective arquebusier could be trained in just two weeks.

===Asia===
The arquebus spread further east, reaching India by 1500, Southeast Asia by 1540, and China sometime between 1523 and 1548. They were introduced to Japan in 1543 by Portuguese traders who landed by accident on Tanegashima (種子島), an island south of Kyūshū in the region controlled by the Shimazu clan. By 1550, arquebuses known as &quot;tanegashima&quot;, &quot;teppō (鉄砲)&quot; or &quot;hinawaju (火縄銃)&quot; were being produced in large numbers in Japan. The &quot;tanegashima&quot; seem to have utilized snap matchlocks based on firearms from Goa, India, which was captured by the Portuguese in 1510. Within ten years of its introduction upwards of three hundred thousand tanegashima were reported to have been manufactured. The tanegashima eventually became one of the most important weapons in Japan. Oda Nobunaga revolutionized musket tactics in Japan by splitting loaders and shooters and assigning three guns to a shooter at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, during which volley fire may have been implemented. However, the volley fire technique of 1575 has been called into dispute in recent years by J. S. A. Elisonas and J. P. Lamers in their translation of &quot;The Chronicle of Oda Nobunaga&quot; by Ota Gyuichi. In Lamers&#x27; &quot;Japonius&quot; he says that &quot;whether or not Nobunaga actually operated with three rotating ranks cannot be determined on the basis of reliable evidence.&quot; They claim that the version of events describing volley fire was written several years after the battle, and an earlier account says to the contrary that guns were fired en masse. Even so, both Korean and Chinese sources note that Japanese gunners were making use of volley fire during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592 to 1598.

====Iran====
Regarding Iranian use of the arquebus, much of the credit for their increase in use can be attributed to Shah Ismail I who, after being defeated by the firearm-using Ottomans in 1514, began extensive use of arquebuses and other firearms himself with an estimated 12,000 arquebusiers in service less than 10 years after his initial defeat by the Ottomans. According to a 1571 report by Vincentio d&#x27;Alessandri, Persian arms including arquebuses &quot;were superior and better tempered than those of any other nation&quot;, suggesting that such firearms were in common use among middle eastern powers by at least the mid-16th century. While the use of 12,000 arquebusiers is impressive, the firearms were not widely adopted in Iran. This is in no small part due to the reliance on light cavalry by the Iranians. Riding a horse and operating an arquebus are incredibly difficult which helped lead to both limited use and heavy stagnation in the technology associated with firearms. These limitations aside, the Iranians still made use of firearms and Europe was very important in facilitating that as Europeans supplied Iran with firearms and sent experts to help them produce some of the firearms themselves. Iran also made use of elephant mounted arquebusiers which would give them a clear view of their targets and better mobility.

====Southeast Asia====
Southeast Asian powers started fielding arquebuses by 1540. Đại Việt was considered by the Ming to have produced particularly advanced matchlocks during the 16–17th century, surpassing even Ottoman, Japanese, and European firearms. European observers of the Lê–Mạc War and later Trịnh–Nguyễn War also noted the proficiency of matchlock making by the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese matchlock was said to have been able to pierce several layers of iron armour, kill two to five men in one shot, yet also fire quietly for a weapon of its caliber.

====China====
The arquebus was introduced to the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century and was used in small numbers to fight off pirates by 1548. There is, however, no exact date for its introduction and sources conflict on the time and manner in which it was introduced. Versions of the arquebus&#x27; introduction to China include the capture of firearms by the Ming during a battle in 1523, the capture of the pirate Wang Zhi, who had arquebuses, in 1558, which contradicts the usage of arquebuses by the Ming army ten years earlier, and the capture of arquebuses from Europeans by the Xu brother pirates, which later came into possession of a man named Bald Li, from whom the Ming officials captured the arquebuses. About 10,000 muskets were ordered by the Central Military Weaponry Bureau in 1558 and the firearms were used to fight off pirates.

Qi Jiguang developed military formations for the effective use of arquebus equipped troops with different mixtures of troops deployed in 12-man teams. The number of arquebuses assigned to each team could vary depending on the context but theoretically in certain cases all members of the team could have been deployed as gunners. These formations also made use of countermarch volley fire techniques. Firearm platoons deployed one team in front of them at the blast of a bamboo flute. They started firing after their leader fired and fired once at the blast of a trumpet, and then spread out according to their drilling pattern. Each layer could also fire once at the blowing of a horn and were supported by close-quarters troops who could advance should the need arise. To avoid self-inflicted injuries and ensure a consistent rate of fire in the heat of battle, Qi emphasized drilling in the procedure required to reload the weapon. Qi Jiguang gave a eulogy on the effectiveness of the gun in 1560:

===European arquebus formations===

In Europe, Maurice of Nassau pioneered the countermarch volley fire technique. After outfitting his entire army with new, standardized arms in 1599, Maurice of Nassau attempted to recapture Spanish forts built on former Dutch lands. In the Battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600, he administered the new techniques and technologies for the first time. The Dutch marched onto the beach where the fort was located and fully utilized the countermarching tactic. By orienting all of his arquebusiers into a block, he was able to maintain a steady stream of fire out of a disciplined formation using volley fire tactics. The result was a lopsided victory with 4,000 Spanish casualties to only 1,000 dead and 700 wounded on the Dutch side. Although the battle was principally won by the decisive counterattack of the Dutch cavalry and despite the failure of the new Dutch infantry tactic in stopping the veteran Spanish tercios, the battle is considered a decisive step forward in the development early modern warfare, where firearms took on an increasingly large role in Europe in the following centuries.

&quot;Musket&quot; eventually overtook &quot;arquebus&quot; as the dominant term for similar firearms starting from the 1550s. Arquebuses are most often associated with matchlocks.

===Use with other weapons===
The arquebus had many advantages but also severe limitations on the battlefield. This led to it often being paired up with other weaponry to mitigate these weaknesses. Qi Jiguang from China developed systems where soldiers with traditional weaponry stayed right behind the arquebusiers to protect them should enemy infantry get too close. Pikemen were used to protect the arquebusiers by the English and the Venetians often used archers to lay down cover fire during the long reloading process. The Ottomans often supported their arquebusiers with artillery fire or placed them in fortified wagons, a tactic they borrowed from the Hussites.

==Comparison to bows==

Sixteenth-century military writer John Smythe thought that an arquebus could not match the accuracy of a bow in the hands of a highly skilled archer; other military writers such as Humfrey Barwick and Barnabe Rich argued the opposite. An arquebus angled at 35 degrees could throw a bullet up to or more. An arquebus shot was considered deadly at up to 400 yards (360 m) while the heavier Spanish musket was considered deadly at up to 600 yards (550 m). During the Japanese Invasions of Korea, Korean officials said they were at a severe disadvantage against Japanese troops because their arquebuses &quot;could reach beyond several hundred paces&quot;. In 1590, Smythe noted that arquebusiers and musketeers firing at such extreme distances rarely seemed to hit anything and instead decided to argue &quot;effective&quot; range, claiming that English archers like the ones from the Hundred Years&#x27; War would be more effective at 200–240 yards (180–220 m) than arquebusiers or musketeers, but by that point there were no longer enough skilled archers in England to properly test his theories.

Perhaps the most important advantage of the arquebus over muscle-powered weapons like longbows was sheer power. A shot from a typical 16th-century arquebus boasted between of kinetic energy, depending on the powder quality. A longbow arrow by contrast was about , while crossbows could vary from depending on construction. Thus, arquebuses could easily defeat armor that would be highly effective against arrows or bolts, and inflict far greater wounds on flesh. The disparity was even greater with a 16th-century heavy musket, which were .

Most high-skilled bowmen achieved a far higher rate of shot than the matchlock arquebus, which took 30–60 seconds to reload properly. The arquebus did, however, have a faster rate of fire than the most powerful crossbow, a shorter learning curve than a longbow, and was more powerful than either. The arquebus did not rely on the physical strength of the user for propulsion of the projectile, making it easier to find a suitable recruit. It also meant that, compared to an archer or crossbowman, an arquebusier lost less of his battlefield effectiveness due to fatigue, malnutrition, or sickness. The arquebusier also had the added advantage of frightening enemies (and horses) with the noise. Wind could reduce the accuracy of archery, but had much less of an effect on an arquebus. During a siege, it was also easier to fire an arquebus out of loopholes than it was a bow and arrow. It was sometimes advocated that an arquebusier should load his weapon with multiple bullets or small shot at close ranges rather than a single ball. Small shot did not pack the same punch as a single round ball but the shot could hit and wound multiple enemies.

An arquebus also has superior penetrating power to a bow or crossbow. Although some plate armors were bulletproof, these armors were unique, heavy, and expensive. A cuirass with a tapul was able to absorb some musket fire due to being angled. Otherwise, most forms of armor a common soldier would wear (especially cloth, light plate, and mail) had little resistance against musket fire. Arrows, however, were relatively weaker in penetration, and heavier than bows or crossbows that required more skill and reload time than the standard bows.

Producing an effective arquebusier required much less training than producing an effective bowman. Most archers spent their whole lives training to shoot with accuracy, but with drill and instruction, the arquebusier was able to learn his profession in months as opposed to years. This low level of skill made it a lot easier to outfit an army in a short amount of time as well as expand the small arms ranks. This idea of lower-skilled, lightly armoured units was the driving force in the infantry revolution that took place in the 16th and 17th centuries and allowed early modern infantries to phase out the longbow.

An arquebusier could carry more ammunition and powder than a crossbowman or longbowman could with bolts or arrows. Once the methods were developed, powder and shot were relatively easy to mass-produce, while arrow making was a genuine craft requiring highly skilled labor.

However, the arquebus was more sensitive to rain, wind, and humid weather. At the Battle of Villalar, rebel troops experienced a significant defeat partially due to having a high proportion of arquebusiers in a rainstorm which rendered the weapons useless. Gunpowder also ages much faster than a bolt or an arrow, particularly if improperly stored. Also, the resources needed to make gunpowder were less universally available than the resources needed to make bolts and arrows. Finding and reusing arrows or bolts was a lot easier than doing the same with arquebus bullets. This was a useful way to reduce the cost of practice or resupply oneself if control of the battlefield after a battle was retained. A bullet must fit a barrel much more precisely than an arrow or bolt must fit a bow or crossbow, so the arquebus required more standardization and this made it harder to resupply by looting bodies of fallen soldiers. Gunpowder production was also far more dangerous than arrow or bolt production.

An arquebus was also significantly more dangerous to its user. The arquebusier carries a lot of gunpowder on his person and has a lit match in one hand. The same goes for the soldiers next to him. Amid the confusion, stress and fumbling of a battle, arquebusiers are potentially a danger to themselves. Early arquebuses tended to have a drastic recoil. They took a long time to load making them vulnerable while reloading unless using the &#x27;continuous fire&#x27; tactic, where one line would shoot and, while the next line shot, would reload. They also tended to overheat. During repeated firing, guns could become clogged and explode, which could be dangerous to the gunner and those around him.

Furthermore, the amount of smoke produced by black-powder weapons was considerable, making it hard to see the enemy after a few salvos, unless there was enough wind to disperse the smoke quickly. (Conversely, this cloud of smoke also served to make it difficult for any archers to target the opposing soldiers who were using firearms.) Before the wheellock, the need for a lit match made stealth and concealment nearly impossible, particularly at night. Even with successful concealment, the smoke emitted by a single arquebus shot would make it quite obvious where the shot came from, at least in daylight. While with a bow or crossbow a soldier could conceivably kill silently, this was of course impossible with an explosion-driven projectile weapon, such as the arquebus. The noise of arquebuses and the ringing in the ears that it caused could also make it hard to hear shouted commands. In the long run, the weapon could make the user permanently hard of hearing. Though bows and crossbows could shoot over obstacles by firing with high-arcing ballistic trajectories they could not do so very accurately or effectively. Sir John Smythe blamed the declining effectiveness of the longbow in part on English commanders who would place firearms at the front of their formations and bowmen at the back, where they could not see their targets and aim appropriately.

==Cultural references==
Arquebuse de L&#x27;Hermitage, a clear spirit made by macerating and distilling a large variety of plants, was supposedly invented in 1857 by a herbalist of the Marist Brothers in the Hermitage Monastery in Saint-Genis-Laval, France although other sources assert it was produced in France and Piedmont since the 18th century. Its name has been ascribed to the sensation of drinking it and to its use in treating the wounded. It remains in production by various companies and is drunk as a digestif.

<doc id="148385" wikidata="Q388502" url="?curid=148385" title="Pisco">
<text>Pisco is a colorless or yellowish-to-amber-colored spirit produced in winemaking regions of Peru and Chile. Made by distilling fermented grape juice into a high-proof spirit, it was developed by 16th-century Spanish settlers as an alternative to orujo, a pomace brandy that was being imported from Spain. It had the advantages of being produced from abundant domestically grown fruit and reducing the volume of alcoholic beverages transported to remote locations.

==Etymology==

The oldest use of the word &quot;pisco&quot; to denote Peruvian aguardiente dates from 1764. The beverage may have acquired its Quechua name from the Peruvian town of Pisco, once an important colonial port for the exportation of viticultural products, which is located on the coast of Peru in the valley of Pisco, by the river with the same name. From there, &quot;Aguardiente de Pisco&quot; was exported to Europe, especially Spain, where the beverage&#x27;s name was abbreviated to &quot;Pisco&quot;.

The Viennese newspaper &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot; in 1835 reported on the Peruvian spirit made from Italia grapes:

In the &quot;Medical Lexikon&quot; of Robley Dunglison (1858) it is stated that, following observations of Swiss Johann Jakob von Tschudi:
Chilean linguist Rodolfo Lenz said that the word &quot;pisco&quot; was used all along the Pacific coast of the Americas from Arauco to Guatemala, and that the word would be of Quechua origin meaning &quot;bird&quot;.

This claim is disputed by Chilean linguist Mario Ferreccio Podesta, who supports the former Real Academia Española etymology according to which &quot;pisco&quot; was originally a word for a mud container. However, the Real Academia Española later supported Lenz&#x27;s theory, and underlines the Quechua origin.

Other origins for the word &quot;pisco&quot; have been explored, including a Mapudungun etymology where &quot;pishku&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;something boiled in a pot&quot;, which would relate to the concept of burned wine (Spanish: &quot;vino quemado&quot;).

The term influenced the Mexican Spanish use of the slang term &quot;pisto&quot; to denote distilled spirits generally.

==History==
===Early Aguardientes===

Unlike the land in most of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, where only very few vineyards were established (mostly for the production of sacramental wine), some locations in the Viceroyalty of Peru were quite suitable for growing grape vines. By 1560, Peru was already producing wine for commerce; over time, a significant wine industry arose in the region. It grew sufficiently strong and threatening to the Spanish mercantilist policies that in 1595 the Spanish Crown banned the establishment of new vineyards in the Americas to protect the exports of its native wine industry; however, this order was largely ignored. As further protectionist measures, the Crown forbade exportation of Peruvian wine to Panama in 1614 and Guatemala in 1615.

In 1572, Santa Maria Magdalena, a town in Peru, had a port by the name &quot;Pisco&quot;. Pisco became a crucial route for distribution of an alcoholic beverage – aguardiente. Port of Pisco shortened the name to just Pisco, which was the name of the grape liqueur that was originated in the area.

Distillation of the wine into pisco began in earnest around the turn of the 17th century, perhaps in response to these pressures. Until the early 18th century, however, most aguardiente was still primarily used to fortify wine, in order to prevent its oxidation, rather than drunk on its own. This method of conservation corresponds with fortified wines that were shipped to Italy and Spain from other parts of the world &quot;e.g.&quot;, wines from Madeira and Marsala.

In the 17th century, production and consumption of wine and pisco were stimulated by the mining activities in Potosí, by then the largest city in the New World.

===Recession of Peruvian pisco===

Historians state that the first grapes ever imported arrived in 1553. The production of pisco started at the end of the 16th century. After the process of fermentation and distillation the juice from the grapes was then made in to liquor. This juice was then stored in clay jars called piscos.

The entire southern coast of Peru was struck by the 1687 Peru earthquake, which destroyed the cities of Villa de Pisco and Ica. Wine cellars in the affected area collapsed and mud containers broke, causing the nation&#x27;s wine-growing industry to collapse.

In the early 18th century, wine production in Peru exceeded that of pisco. By 1764, pisco production dwarfed that of wine, representing 90% of the grape beverages prepared. With the suppression of the Society of Jesus in Spanish America, Jesuit vineyards were auctioned off, and new owners typically did not have the same expertise as the Jesuits – leading to a production decline.

In the late 18th century the Spanish Crown allowed the production of rum in Peru, which was cheaper and of lower quality than pisco. In the 19th century demand for cotton in industrialized Europe caused many Peruvian winegrowers to shift away from vineyards to more lucrative cotton planting, contributing further to the decline of wine production and the pisco industry which depended on it. This was particularly true during the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865) when cotton prices skyrocketed due to the Blockade of the South and its cotton fields.

Pisco was also popular in the US, in San Francisco and nearby areas of California since the 1830s, during the Gold Rush, in the 1860s, and early to mid 1900s.

== Origin dispute ==
There has been some controversy over whether Pisco originated in Chile or Peru. Both countries say that pisco is their national drink. Peru and Chile both rely on agricultural development for exportation. However, culture and history is what drives this dispute. Both countries want to show national spirit and have the right to call the centuries-old pisco their own. There may never be a specific geographical designation when it comes to the branding of pisco. There will almost never be a label that says &quot;Peruvian pisco&quot; or &quot;Chilean pisco&quot; as there is a special agreement for protection of the beverage. This agreement prohibits many kinds of branding that suggest country names.

==Variants==
===Peruvian pisco===


Peruvian pisco must be made in the country&#x27;s five official D.O. (Denomination of Origin) departments—Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna (only in the valleys of Locumba Locumba, Sama and Caplina)— established in 1991 by the government.

In Peru, pisco is produced only using copper pot stills, like single malt Scotch whiskies, rather than continuous stills like most vodkas. Unlike the Chilean variety, Peruvian pisco is never diluted after it is distilled and enters the bottle directly at its distillation strength. The production of a regular Peruvian Pisco bottle requires 8 kilograms of grapes, and a Mosto Verde variety needs 12 kg.

Many types of grapes were used to produce pisco, leading to a wide variation in flavor, aroma, viscosity and appearance of the liquor. This harmed attempts to export the product under a single denomination, resulting in numerous regulations setting a baseline for a product to carry the name. Four distinct types of pisco were thus designated:

:*Puro (&quot;Pure&quot;), made from a single variety of grape, mostly Quebranta, although Mollar or Common Black can be used; however, no blending between varieties is accepted (&quot;pure&quot; pisco should contain only one variety of grape).
:*Aromáticas (&quot;Aromatic&quot;), made from Muscat or Muscat-derived grape varieties, and also from Albilla, Italia and Torontel grape varieties; once again, the pisco should only contain one variety of grape in any production lot.
:*Mosto Verde (&quot;Green Must&quot;), distilled from partially fermented must, this must be distilled &quot;before&quot; the fermentation process has completely transformed sugars into alcohol.
:*Acholado (&quot;Multivarietal&quot;), blended from the must of several varieties of grape.

Some other specific restrictions of note are:
:*Aging: Pisco must be aged for a minimum of three months in vessels of &quot;glass, stainless steel or any other material which does not alter its physical, chemical or organic properties&quot;.
:*Additives: No additives of any kind may be added to the pisco that could alter its flavor, odor, appearance or alcoholic proof.

Peru currently exports three times more pisco than Chile. In 2008, Peruvian pisco exports 48 percent more than Chile compared to the year before that, exceeding 1 million dollars, although Chile produces about three times as much pisco as Peru. Chile is also the top importer of pisco from Peru: 34% of the pisco produced in Peru is exported to Chile. Annually, the pisco production in 2013 reached 30 million litres in Chile and 9.5 million litres in Peru.

Peruvian pisco won over 20 gold medals and was named the best liquor of the world in the Concours Mondial de Bruxelles 2011.

===Chilean pisco===

Chilean pisco must be made in the country&#x27;s two official D.O. (Denomination of Origin) regions—Atacama and Coquimbo—established in 1931 by the government.
Most of it is produced with a &quot;boutique&quot; type of distillate. Other types are produced with double distillation in copper and other materials.

During the adaptation of many vineyards to pisco production, the most widespread grape was used as raw material, the Muscat, with some vineyards preferring the Torontel and Pedro Jiménez varieties. As is the case with Peru, regulations for pisco designations have been enacted in Chile, including the following classifications:
:*Pisco Corriente o Tradicional, 30% to 35% (60 to 70 proof)
:*Pisco Especial, 35% to 40% (70 to 80 proof)
:*Pisco Reservado, 40% (80 proof)
:*Gran Pisco, 43% or more (86 or more proof)

Regulation for pisco production in Chile is quite high. Chilean distilleries are required to grow their own grapes and are grouped into two categories based in aromatic expressiveness: Muscat types (Pink Muscat, Muscat of Alexandria) are very fragrant, while Pedro Jiménez, Moscatel de Asturia and Torontel are more subtle.

The &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Reserve&quot; variations are very similar in flavor and color, both being subtly sweet and of a clear birch to transparent color. The flavor is much stronger than regular pisco with aromatic refreshing tones.

== Manufacturing process ==
The processes of making pisco all come from the fermentation of specific grapes called Muscat or Italia grapes. The grapes are then distilled in copper basins. However, before this, the grapes have to go through a process called grape-stomping. Grapes stomping usually occurs in the afternoon to avoid the dry heat on the coast of Peru. A group of men spread around the winepress and stomp on the grapes for about 6 intervals. During this process the men will enjoy their time as they sing, joke around, and have pisco punch. The grape juice then falls into a saturation basin called puntaya. Here the juice will sit for 24 hours. Later, the juices are restored in fermentation tubs. The fermentation process usually lasts 7 days. This is so the natural yeasts in the grape skin take in sugars and process it into alcohol. Usually, the pisco producers will control the temperature of the fermentation so the heat does not increase. Otherwise, the natural aroma of the grapes will evaporate and not give the pisco a certain characteristic that is crucial in high quality pisco. When the fermentation process is over, the pisco is distilled in large copper basins.

==Ecological concerns==
Chile has taken steps to have a clean and environmentally friendly production of pisco. In order to crack down on pollution, and to increase competitiveness, the National Council for Clean Production agreed with the pisco producers and pisco grape agronomists to collaborate, signing an Agreement of Clean Production (APL). Capel, by itself invested more than CL$ 800 million.

Peru&#x27;s production of pisco remains artisanal and does not alter the physical, chemical or organic properties before bottling. The pisco must be bottled directly after aging, without alteration or adding any product which could alter the odor, flavor or appearance.

==Appellation of origin==
The right to use an appellation of origin for pisco is hotly contested between Peru and Chile, though historians generally believe that pisco originated from Peru.

Peru claims the exclusive right to use the term &quot;pisco&quot; only for products from Peru, but they have not generally been able to persuade other countries to adopt that interpretation. Chile, in contrast, regards the term &quot;pisco&quot; as generic, and it argues the spirit is simply a &quot;type&quot; of alcoholic beverage made from grapes (as in the case of whisky and vodka). It cites the name being used to designate a similar grape brandy produced in both countries and maintains two regions of Chile, Atacama and Coquimbo, that it authorizes to use the term.

Large-market countries (e.g., the European Union, the United States, France, Italy, Mexico, Canada, Australia, etc.) generally allow products of both Peru and Chile to be identified as &quot;pisco&quot;. The European Commission considers that pisco originates from Peru, but also allows the term to be used for products from Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC110/2008&quot;&gt; Annex III of EC Regulation 110/2008, amended. Retrieved 2019-03-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cocktails==

Some of the most popular cocktails with pisco include:

* Pisco sour is made with pisco, egg whites and dash of bitters.
* Chilcano (Pisco, Ginger Ale, Lime wedge, or wheel, for garnish). It has variations with lime, blood orange, grapefruit, and pineapple.
* Monkey Tail (Cola de Mono or Colemono), is a traditional Chilean drink served around Christmas time. It contains aguardiente
* Pisco Punch, the first known pisco cocktail, invented in San Francisco, California, in the 19th century. It contains pineapple, gum arabic, and syrup, among other ingredients.
* Serena Libre, sweeter than Pisco Sour, made with Chilean papaya juice and sugar.
* Pisquiña, very similar to Caipirinha, it has Pisco, Chilean Pica lime juice, white sugar and ice.
* Mojito de Cuma, a Chilean version of a cocktail similar to Mojito, is made with Pisco, Sprite, Seven Up or a similar soda and mint leaves. Thanks to those sodas&#x27; sweetness, it doesn&#x27;t require sugar.
* Piscola Blanca, a variation of Piscola in Chile with clear sodas.
* Pisagua Chilean Pisco with carbonated water.
* Pischela, another variation of Chilean Piscola, similar to a British &quot;submarine&quot; it is Pisco with beer, preferably a blonde beer.
* Terremoto, a traditional Chilean cocktail made of Pipeño strengthened with Pisco, Fernet (optional), pineapple ice cream and Grenadine syrup.
* Piscoffee, Pisco with iced coffee and ice. Also is a variation of Irish coffee with pisco instead of whiskey.
* Cóctel de Algarrobina, Peruvian Pisco with algarrobina syrup (or carob syrup), cinnamon, egg yolk, and cream.
* Pisco Flip, a flip on the traditional Pisco Sour, made with egg yolks instead of whites.
* Cupid&#x27;s Cup, Peruvian pisco, aperol, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg whites. A thyme sprig is used for decoration.
* Tampisco Bay, a cocktail inspired by Tampa Bay, Florida. Made using pisco and fresh cucumber juice, agave nectar, jalapeño slices, and red bell pepper slices and served in an ice filled highball glass.

===Mixed drinks===
Some examples of mixed drinks with pisco include:
* Canario
* Capitán
* Chilcano de Pisco, a Peruvian cocktail made with Pisco, lemon juice, ice, bitters, and ginger ale.
* Piscola, also called &quot;national cocktail&quot; in Chile ( or ) a cocktail prepared mixing Coca-Cola and pisco. Other combinations of Pisco and cola include the Perú Libre differentiating the same drink made with different origin piscos.
* Pisco Sorpresa, a cocktail originated in East London, inspired by the Latin American classic. Involves shaking gin, Cointreau, triple sec, Bacardi and pisco, adding raspberry juice, pouring into a cocktail glass and finishing off with a dash of soda, grenadine and a squeeze of lemon.
* Piscotheque
* Roller Pisco
* Don Alfredo, a Peruvian cocktail made with mosto verde Pisco, St Germain, lime juice, ice and soda water.

==Consumption==
Per capita consumption of pisco in Chile is 3 litres per year; an average of 18% of pisco production by value is &quot;premium pisco&quot;. Peruvian annual per capita consumption was reported in 2008 as 0.5 litres and growing (at the expense of market shares for rum and whisky, although whisky remains the most popular spirit in Peru). 2014 reports mention also an increase of 3.5 million liters per year for the internal market.

The top importer of Peruvian pisco is Chile, with an estimated import value of US$1.6 million in 2016. The United States is the second highest importer, with an estimated import value of US$1.4 million.

<text>The Yeomen of the Guard; or, The Merryman and His Maid, is a Savoy Opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 3 October 1888 and ran for 423 performances. This was the eleventh collaboration of fourteen between Gilbert and Sullivan.

The opera is set in the Tower of London during the 16th century, and is the darkest, and perhaps most emotionally engaging, of the Savoy Operas, ending with a broken-hearted main character and two very reluctant engagements, rather than the usual numerous marriages. The libretto does contain considerable humour, including a lot of pun-laden one-liners, but Gilbert&#x27;s trademark satire and topsy-turvy plot complications are subdued in comparison with the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-Shakespearean, or early modern English, in style.

Critics considered the score to be Sullivan&#x27;s finest, including its overture, which is in sonata form, rather than being written as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of the other Gilbert and Sullivan overtures. This was the first Savoy Opera to use Sullivan&#x27;s larger orchestra, including a second bassoon and third trombone. Most of Sullivan&#x27;s subsequent operas, including those not composed with Gilbert as librettist, use this larger orchestra.

==Background==

When the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, finished its run at the Savoy Theatre, no new Gilbert and Sullivan opera was ready, and for nearly a year the stage was devoted to revivals of the company&#x27;s old successes &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;. For several years leading up to the premiere of &quot;Yeomen&quot;, Sullivan had expressed the desire to leave his partnership with W.S. Gilbert in order to turn to writing grand opera and other serious works full-time. Before the premiere of &quot;Yeomen&quot;, Sullivan had recently been lauded for the successful cantata &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; and would produce his grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, only 15 months after &quot;Yeomen&quot;.

In the autumn of 1887, after another attempt to interest his collaborator in a plot where the characters, by swallowing a magic pill, became who they were pretending to be (Sullivan had rejected this idea before), Gilbert made an effort to meet his collaborator half way. Gilbert claimed that the idea for the opera came to him while he was waiting for the train in Uxbridge and spotted an advertisement for The Tower Furnishing and Finance Company, illustrated with a Beefeater. On Christmas Day, 1887, he read to Sullivan and Carte his plot sketch for an opera set at the Tower of London. Sullivan was &quot;immensely pleased&quot; and, with much relief, accepted it, writing in his diary, &quot;Pretty story, no topsy turvydom, very human, &amp; funny also&quot;.

Although not a grand opera, &quot;Yeomen&quot; provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date. The two set to work on the new opera, taking longer to prepare it than they had taken with many of their earlier works. Gilbert made every effort to accommodate his collaborator, even writing alternative lyrics to some songs. Sullivan had trouble setting one lyric in particular, &quot;I have a song to sing-O!&quot;, with its increasing length in each stanza. He asked Gilbert if he had anything in mind when writing it. Gilbert hummed a few lines from a sea shanty, and Sullivan knew what to do.

The first act was rather long and contained an unusual number of sentimental pieces. As opening night approached, Gilbert became increasingly apprehensive. Would the audience accept this serious, sentimental tone from one of the duo&#x27;s &quot;comic&quot; operas? Gilbert and Sullivan cut two songs from Act I and part of the Act I finale, partly to decrease the number of sentimental pieces near the beginning of the opera. Gilbert, always nervous himself on opening nights, came backstage before the performance on opening night to &quot;have a word&quot; with some of the actors, inadvertently conveying his worries to the cast and making them even more nervous. Jessie Bond, who was to open the show with a solo song alone on stage, recalled saying to him, &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan&#x27;t be able to sing a note!&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

Phoebe Meryll sits at the spinning wheel, sighing about the pain of love. Wilfred Shadbolt – the head jailer and assistant torturer at the Tower of London – arrives, and Phoebe mocks him, disgusted by his profession. Wilfred, who is in love with Phoebe, has noticed her interest in one of the prisoners at the Tower, Colonel Fairfax. He gleefully conveys the news that Fairfax is to be beheaded, for the crime of sorcery, that very day. Phoebe replies that Fairfax is merely a scientist and alchemist (and a handsome one at that) and leaves Wilfred to suffer from his love for her. The citizens and Yeomen arrive, singing of the Yeomen&#x27;s bravery and valiant deeds. Dame Carruthers, the housekeeper of the Tower, dismisses protestations by Phoebe of Fairfax&#x27;s innocence and, vexed by Phoebe&#x27;s criticism of the Tower, sings its praises. After everyone leaves, Phoebe is joined by her father, Sergeant Meryll, who reports that her brother Leonard has been appointed a Yeoman for his valour in battle. Leonard is on his way from Windsor, where the court sits, and may bring with him a reprieve for the Colonel. Leonard Meryll enters bearing a dispatch for the Lieutenant of the Tower but no reprieve. Sergeant Meryll is eager to save Fairfax, for the Colonel served with him in battle and twice saved Sergeant Meryll&#x27;s life. He hatches a plan: Leonard will hide away and Fairfax, sprung from his cell, will assume Leonard&#x27;s guise. Phoebe is charged with getting the key to Fairfax&#x27;s cell from the lovesick jailer, Wilfred.

Fairfax enters under guard by an escort of Yeomen. Sir Richard Cholmondeley, the Lieutenant of the Tower, sees him and greets him sadly, as they are old friends. Fairfax bears his impending execution bravely and philosophically, prompting tears from Phoebe and even Sergeant Meryll. Fairfax asks a boon of the Lieutenant: the charge of sorcery was the doing of his wicked cousin Sir Clarence Poltwhistle, a Secretary of State, who will inherit his estate if he dies unmarried. He therefore wishes to be married by his confessor to any available woman, it matters not whom, who will receive a hundred crowns for her hour of matrimony. The Lieutenant agrees and leaves.
Jack Point, a jester, and Elsie Maynard, a young singer, are pursued by a rowdy crowd that demands merriment and threatens the two strolling players. Elsie, objecting to a man&#x27;s rude attentions, boxes his ears, which gives Point a moment to quieten and amuse the crowd. The two entertainers offer to perform the song of &quot;The Merryman and his Maid&quot;: it tells of a lovelorn merryman who is jilted by a maiden in favour of an arrogant lord, but the latter rejects her, and she returns on her knees to the merryman to beg for his love, and all ends happily. The song over, the crowd grows unruly again, and violence is averted only by the Lieutenant&#x27;s arrival. Point and Elsie introduce themselves and explain that Elsie&#x27;s mother Bridget is very ill and they seek money to buy medicine for her. The Lieutenant offers Elsie a chance to earn a hundred crowns (a very substantial sum) by marrying a condemned gentleman immediately. Point, who intends to marry Elsie someday, is assured that the groom will be beheaded directly after the ceremony. Elsie consents and is blindfolded and led off by Wilfred for the secret ceremony. The Lieutenant tells Point that he has a vacancy for a jester, and Point tells him of his skills and tries out some jokes. The Lieutenant leads Point off to discuss the employment further.

Wilfred leads Elsie back from her anonymous meeting with the priest and the prisoner and leaves her to reflect on her impending widowhood. Meanwhile, Wilfred wonders what they were up to in Fairfax&#x27;s cell. Phoebe arrives and seductively distracts him as she steals his keys, which she gives surreptitiously to her father, who goes to free Fairfax from his cell. She keeps Wilfred busy until her father returns the keys, which she returns to Wilfred&#x27;s belt, and leaves the confused and hopeful jailer to his fantasies of marrying her. Meryll disguises Fairfax as his son Leonard.
The Yeomen come to greet &quot;Leonard&quot;, who insists that the tales of his bravery are exaggerated. He flounders when Phoebe greets him, not having been introduced to her, but Wilfred helpfully identifies her, telling Fairfax (with a strong dose of wishful thinking) that he, Wilfred, is betrothed to Phoebe. He commends her to the care of her &quot;brother&quot; until the marriage. The headsman enters, and all is ready for the execution. Wilfred, Fairfax (still disguised as Leonard) and two Yeomen go to fetch Fairfax. The Yeomen return and Fairfax announces his own disappearance. The Lieutenant blames the jailer, Wilfred, and declares his life forfeit instead. Wilfred protests his innocence and all wonder – not all honestly – how the prisoner could have escaped. Point is distraught at the escape of Elsie&#x27;s husband, and Elsie faints into Fairfax&#x27;s arms, as all rush off to hunt for Fairfax.

===Act II===
Two days have passed, and the Yeomen continue searching in vain for the escaped prisoner. Dame Carruthers enters with her niece Kate and berates the Yeomen for letting Fairfax escape. Jack Point (now employed by the Lieutenant), sits brushing up on his jests and bitterly reflecting on his profession, when Wilfred comes by. Point taunts the failed jailer, and Wilfred says he&#x27;d rather be a jester. This gives Point an idea. He reveals the secret wedding and agrees to teach the oaf the art of jesting if Wilfred will publicly swear that Wilfred shot Fairfax dead as he swam across the river to escape. Wilfred agrees to swear to this lie.
Meanwhile, Fairfax, still disguised as Leonard Meryll, laments his hurried marriage to a bride he cannot identify, for her face was concealed by the blindfold. Sergeant Meryll says that Elsie, the girl who fainted at the execution, and who has been placed in Meryll&#x27;s charge, has recovered, but that her illness gave Dame Carruthers an excuse to take up quarters in his house while she nursed the girl. He has spurned the old woman&#x27;s obvious overtures for years. Carruthers then happens by, together with her niece Kate, and notes that the latter heard Elsie talking in her sleep about her secret wedding. The other three leave Fairfax alone, pleased to find that his mystery wife is the fair Elsie. He decides to test her loyalty by pretending to woo his own wife, still disguised as Leonard. She rejects &quot;Leonard&#x27;s&quot; overtures, as a married woman should, and he is about to reveal himself to her.

Just then, a shot is heard from the wharf and everyone enters. Wilfred, with the jester&#x27;s corroboration, declares that he struggled with someone creeping about, discovered it was Colonel Fairfax, who dived into the river, and seizing an arquebus, Wilfred shot him dead. The Lieutenant orders the Yeomen to search for the body, and Wilfred is celebrated as a hero. Elsie, Fairfax, Phoebe and Point are left alone, and Point asks Elsie, as she is now free, to marry him. Fairfax, still disguised as &quot;Leonard&quot;, tells Point that he doesn&#x27;t know how to woo (it is not to be done in the manner of a jester!), and he undertakes to instruct Point in this art, following this up with a most effective demonstration on Elsie. Point, slow to see that Fairfax is wooing the girl for himself (and that Elsie has fallen for the heroic &quot;Leonard&quot;), finally protests. Fairfax tells Point that he has shown him how to woo and that he should apply the teachings &quot;elsewhere&quot;. Phoebe, seeing her adored Fairfax pledged to another, bursts into tears, while Point, shocked by the turn of events, wishes he was dead.

Wilfred sees Phoebe weeping and she, rendered incautious by anger and hurt, and by her scorn for the jailer, inadvertently reveals that &quot;Leonard&quot; is in fact Fairfax. Realizing the game is up, she desperately buys Wilfred&#x27;s silence by agreeing to marry him (after a long engagement). The real Leonard then returns and announces that Fairfax&#x27;s reprieve has finally arrived. Sergeant Meryll enters, followed surreptitiously by Dame Carruthers. Phoebe tells him of her folly and goes with Wilfred, whereupon Dame Carruthers reveals herself to Meryll and threatens to expose the three schemers who had freed Fairfax illegally. He resignedly buys her silence with his offer of marriage.

Elsie arrives joyfully for her wedding to the man she still knows as &quot;Leonard&quot;, but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught over the loss of &quot;Leonard&quot;, does not turn to see his face. He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute. Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, &quot;Leonard&quot;, but he says that his heart is like a &quot;massive rock&quot; and claims her as his bride. Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally recognises him as her adored one. All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, &quot;The Merryman and his Maid&quot;, with wrenching sorrow. Elsie &quot;drops a tear&quot; for Point, but turns back to her love. As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.

==Cut and changed music==
Like most of the Savoy Operas, &quot;Yeomen&quot; went through significant cuts and alterations during rehearsal, and after the authors&#x27; deaths further changes have become traditional. Much of the cut music from &quot;Yeomen&quot; survives, has been recorded, and is available for performance.
Wilfred&#x27;s solo about his unrequited love for Phoebe, &quot;When jealous torments rack my soul&quot;, was cut in rehearsal after Savoy Theatre favourite, Rutland Barrington, decided to withdraw from the production and take a leave from the company to try his hand as a producer and theatre manager. It was intended to be sung after Phoebe&#x27;s opening solo in Act I, &quot;When maiden loves&quot;, and the ensuing passage of dialogue between Phoebe and Wilfred. In recent decades this song has been occasionally restored in productions of the opera, including in the 1993 recording by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company.

Just before Leonard&#x27;s entrance in the first act, Sergeant Meryll originally had a nostalgic solo about his son Leonard&#x27;s childhood, &quot;A laughing boy but yesterday&quot;. This number did not please Gilbert, who called it an &quot;introduced and wholly irrelevant song.&quot; It was sung in the first night performance but was cut thereafter. It was restored, possibly for the first time, in 1962, for a production at the Tower of London, and has been heard in a number of recordings and productions since, without becoming part of the standard score. Fairfax&#x27;s first solo, &quot;Is life a boon?&quot;, is the second version of that song. Gilbert thought that Sullivan&#x27;s first setting (in time) was too similar to many of the other tenor ballads in the Savoy Operas, and he urged the composer to rewrite it. Sullivan complied, but also saved the first version, leaving an unusual example of two separate settings of the same lyric. The revised version is invariably used in performance.

Before opening night, the third and fourth yeomen&#x27;s couplets in the Act I finale – in which they remind &quot;Leonard&quot; of his brave deeds – were cut, though they remained in the vocal score until around the 1920s. The third yeoman had also joined Fairfax when he tells the Lieutenant that the prisoner has escaped. When the solo couplets were cut, the third yeoman was deleted from this passage as well, leaving it a trio for Fairfax and two other yeomen.

The Act II duet for Sergeant Meryll and Dame Carruthers, &quot;Rapture, rapture&quot;, was often cut in 20th-century D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company performances, apparently because it was thought to detract from the serious tone of the ending of the work. However, D&#x27;Oyly Carte eventually restored the duet, and in modern productions it is usually performed. As originally written, the duet ended with five chords leading directly into the Act II finale. Those chords do not appear in vocal scores, and modern performances usually delete them, bringing the duet to a full close so that the gentle opening bars of the finale are not covered by applause.
At some point, before 1920 or so, the &quot;Oh day of terror&quot; section of the Act II finale had the parts for Kate and Phoebe significantly reduced. In the original conception, these characters echoed Elsie, with an &quot;Oh, Leonard&quot; solo for Kate, and cries to &quot;Come thou to her side, and claim her as thy loving bride&quot; sung along with Elsie. The modern version leaves Elsie singing her line by herself, puts Kate with the chorus, gives Phoebe a mixture of Dame Carruthers&#x27; part and her old one, and changes Phoebe and Dame Carruthers&#x27; lyrics. There was one other cut made after Gilbert&#x27;s death: Separate lyrics for Elsie and Point, not found elsewhere, were cut during the &quot;All frenzied, frenzied with despair they rave&quot; section of the Act I finale.

The 1993 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording includes all the cut music and both versions of &quot;Is life a boon?&quot;

==Productions==
&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; was immediately a hit in London, with a successful New York run following shortly thereafter. Percy Anderson designed the original costumes, while the set was by Hawes Craven. The first English provincial tour opened in 1888, and from then on it was a fixture in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory, with at least one official touring company playing it somewhere in almost every season until the company&#x27;s closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Anderson in 1919 and 1927, and Peter Goffin designed new sets and costumes in 1940. In Australia, the opera&#x27;s first authorised performance was on 20 April 1889 at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, produced by J. C. Williamson, which gave regular performances thereafter in Australasia until the 1960s. In 1932, &quot;Yeomen&quot; became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast on the radio in its entirety.

In America in the 20th century, it was played on Broadway by various companies in 1915, 1933, 1935 and 1944, in addition to D&#x27;Oyly Carte tours, and in other New York theatres by the American Savoyards, the Light Opera of Manhattan, Bronx Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, among others. 21st century productions include a 2009 production at the Tower of London by the Carl Rosa Opera Company, a 2010 production by the G&amp;S Opera Company at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival and then at Oxford Castle. and a 2022 staging by English National Opera.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:

==Analysis of the text and music==

The opera is different from the rest of the series in a number of respects. Its tone is somewhat darker and more serious in character. There is no satire of British institutions. Instead of the opera opening with a chorus, the curtain rises on a single figure seated at a spinning-wheel singing a touching ballad. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s review of &quot;Yeomen&quot; was very admiring of Sullivan&#x27;s efforts:
:The accompaniments...are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly... We place the songs and choruses in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage. (Allen, p. 312).

&quot;The Times&quot; noted, &quot;It should ... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things.&quot; Deems Taylor later wrote that &quot;The trouble with the book of &#x27;The Yeomen&#x27; is that it is a grand opera story, but not grand enough; some of the lyrics, delightful as they are, sound out of mood with the plot. The score suffers from the same defect. It is serious in intent, but not weighty enough to carry the story. Altogether, the piece is a grand opera written in terms of operetta. None of which prevents many of the numbers, taken by themselves, from being among the best that Gilbert and Sullivan ever wrote.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2022, Michael Simkins praised the opera strongly: &quot;Yeomen is surely their most human and richly textured work. ... [It] was not only Gilbert’s most nuanced dramaturgy, but some of Sullivan’s greatest music. Libretto and score are perfectly blended into an operetta that by turns amuses, chills and tugs at the heartstrings.
Some critics suggested that Gilbert took too much of his story from William Vincent Wallace&#x27;s 1845 opera, &quot;Maritana&quot;, in which a street singer is married in secret to a gentleman. Another antecedent of &quot;Yeomen&quot; is Gilbert&#x27;s 1875 tragedy, &quot;Broken Hearts&quot;. There, the love triangle among Prince Florian, Lady Vavir and the hunchbacked servant Mousta parallels the triangle in &quot;Yeomen&quot; among Fairfax, Elsie and Point.

The opera actually concerns Yeomen Warders, who are guardians of the Tower of London (and the crown jewels) and are selected for this position as a reward for long and meritorious service to the crown. Today, they act as tour guides at the Tower of London. The Yeomen Warders are often incorrectly referred to as Yeomen of the Guard, which is actually a distinct corps of royal bodyguards. Gilbert shared this confusion (or didn&#x27;t care to be precise in the matter) by naming the opera &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;. However, Gilbert and Sullivan were careful to replicate the historical Tower as closely as possible in the opera&#x27;s settings, costumes and music. For instance, during the Act I finale, the bell of St. Peter&#x27;s tolls for the coming execution as was the custom at the time.

The character of the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Richard Cholmondeley, is the only character in all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that is based overtly on an historical figure. Cholmondeley was the Lieutenant of the Tower from 1513 to 1520, during the reign of Henry VIII. Cholmondeley lost some favour with the City of London authorities during the Evil May Day riots of 1517: He ordered the firing of some of the Tower&#x27;s artillery at the city to try to quell rioting by gangs of young Londoners who took control of London for several days and were attacking foreigners, especially the wealthy foreign merchants and bankers of Lombard Street, London. Nevertheless, Cholmondeley continued serving at the Tower for three more years until ill-health forced him to resign. He was responsible for the rebuilding of the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, the parish church of the Tower of London, where there is a prominent tomb in his memory.

==Historical casting==

The following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at various times through to the company&#x27;s 1982 closure. Note that the 4th Yeoman was no longer included in the cast after the original London and New York productions, and the 3rd Yeoman was no longer included after the first London revival in 1897. After the Second Repertory Season in 1909, the Headsman was no longer separately credited.



==Recordings==

Many recordings have been made of this opera. Of those recorded by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1950 and 1964 recordings are well regarded. The 1993 &quot;New&quot; D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording includes all of the &quot;cut&quot; material. Marriner&#x27;s recording from the same year contains some of the dialogue and is considered strong. The 1995 Mackerras recording is also admired. The 1982 Brent Walker video suffers from a number of important cuts and Joel Grey&#x27;s much-criticised portrayal of Jack Point. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Legacy, adaptations and cultural influence==

A monument in Sullivan&#x27;s memory was erected in the Victoria Embankment Gardens (London) and is inscribed with a lyric, chosen by Gilbert, from &quot;Yeomen&quot;: &quot;Is life a boon? If so, it must befall that Death, whene&#x27;er he call, must call too soon&quot;. In 1962, 1964, 1966, 1978 and 2009, the opera was staged before large audiences in the moat of the Tower of London.

A 1957 American TV broadcast of the opera as part of the NBC &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; series starred Alfred Drake as Point, Barbara Cook as Elsie, Celeste Holm as Phoebe and Bill Hayes as Fairfax, and featured Henry Calvin as Wilfred and Marjorie Gordon as Kate, with announcer Lee Vines. It was broadcast on 10 April 1957 and was directed by George Schaefer and conducted by Franz Allers. It is 79 minutes long, including commercials, so much of the dialogue and some music is cut. Alfred Drake narrates the story. A black and white kinescope recording of the broadcast has been released on DVD.

The Australian Broadcasting Commission made a TV version in 1972 starring Alan Lander and Pamela Stephenson. A 1975 TV version by the BBC stars Valerie Masterson as Elsie, Derek Hammond-Stroud as Point, David Hillman as Fairfax, Bryan Drake as Sgt. Meryll, Richard Angas as Sir Richard and Elizabeth Bainbridge as Carruthers. It was directed by John Gorrie and conducted by David Lloyd-Jones. Another cut version was made in 1978 for British TV starring Tommy Steele as Point, Terry Jenkins as Fairfax, Anne Collins as Carruthers, Laureen Livingstone as Elsie, Della Jones as Phoebe, Paul Hudson as Meryll and Dennis Wicks as Wilfred. It was directed by Anthony Besch and conducted by David Lloyd-Jones in connection with 1978 City of London Festival.

The musical group Peter, Paul and Mary included the song, &quot;I have a song to sing, O!&quot; on one of their children&#x27;s albums, &quot;Peter, Paul and Mommy&quot; (1969). In 1973, an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; television series, &quot;Jack Point&quot;, by Colin Welland, directed by Michael Apted, concerned the tensions in an amateur theatre group during a production of &quot;Yeomen&quot;, particularly the casting of the part of Jack Point. &quot;Perish in July&quot;, a 1989 novel by Mollie Hardwick, part of her Doran Fairweather series, involves a backstage murder of the actress playing Elsie.

<doc id="148387" wikidata="Q7535038" url="?curid=148387" title="Skid row">
<text>A skid row, also called skid road, is an impoverished area, typically urban, in English-speaking North America whose inhabitants are mostly poor people &quot;&quot;. This specifically refers to people who are poor or homeless, considered disreputable, downtrodden or forgotten by society. A skid row may be anything from an impoverished urban district to a red-light district to a gathering area for people experiencing homelessness or drug addiction. In general, skid row areas are inhabited or frequented by impoverished individuals and also people who are addicted to drugs. Urban areas considered skid rows are marked by high vagrancy, dilapidated buildings, and drug dens, as well as other features of urban blight. Used figuratively, the phrase may indicate the state of a poor person&#x27;s life.

The term &quot;skid road&quot; originally referred to the path along which timber workers skidded logs. Its current sense appears to have originated in the Pacific Northwest. Areas in the United States and Canada identified by this nickname include Pioneer Square in Seattle; Old Town Chinatown in Portland, Oregon; Downtown Eastside in Vancouver; Skid Row in Los Angeles; the Tenderloin District of San Francisco; and the Bowery of Lower Manhattan. The term Poverty Flats is used for some Western US towns.

The term &quot;skid row&quot; may often be interchangeable with the term tent city. A tent city may exist on the premises of a skid row, but many tent cities are in areas not known as skid rows.

== Origins ==
The term &quot;skid road&quot; dates back to the 17th century, when it referred to a log road, used to skid or drag logs through woods and bog. The term was in common usage in the mid-19th century and came to refer not just to the corduroy roads themselves, but to logging camps and mills all along the Pacific Coast. When a logger was fired he was &quot;sent down the skid road&quot;.

The source of the term &quot;skid road&quot; as an urban district is heavily debated, and is generally identified as originating in Seattle and Yesler Way.

== United States ==
=== Albuquerque ===
International District, Albuquerque, New Mexico, specifically with some areas off Central Ave, especially intersecting Louisiana, Texas, and Rhode Island Streets, have high homelessness rates, as well as a higher than average rate of public drug usage and high property-related crime and violence. The area is colloquially known as the &quot;War Zone&quot;. Albuquerque had a rising murder rate in the early 2020s, with the murder rate surpassing 20 per 100,000 people, as well as a surge of visible homelessness especially in the ID area. In the 1990s, some years the neighborhood would account for over half the city&#x27;s homicide count, despite being 1-2% of the city&#x27;s population.

=== Anchorage ===
Fourth Street in Downtown Anchorage has a homelessness and drug abuse problem. In 1978, a descriptive analysis document compiled by a Department of Health facility in Anchorage, regarding downtown Anchorage&#x27;s social issues and vagrancy described parts of Fourth Street as &quot;Skid Row&quot;. Today, the name is not as used professionally, but still has issues of homelessness, especially affecting Native Americans and Native Alaskans. Forty-five percent of Anchorage&#x27;s homeless population is Alaskan Native, as compared to less than 15% of Anchorage&#x27;s population being of Alaskan descent. 1,100 Anchorage residents were homeless in 2019, over two percent of the city&#x27;s population. However, this figure may include those people periodically homeless at some point that year, as opposed to average counts where homeless people are counted on a given day, which usually increases the percentage.

=== Austin ===
Sixth Street in Downtown Austin has issues with homeless individuals camping (which led to a proposition passing to ban public camping in most city areas) and public crime and drug use.

=== Baltimore ===
Baltimore, Maryland has a homelessness issue in the Inner Harbor. Some housing projects and gang-plagued neighborhoods bear social issues similar to skid rows.

=== Boston ===
Mass and Cass, also known as Methadone Mile or Recovery Road, is an impoverished area/tent city located at and around the intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. It has been characterized as &quot;the epicenter of the region&#x27;s opioid addiction crisis&quot;.

Due to its concentration of service providers, the area around Mass and Cass has attracted a large number of people dealing with homelessness and drug addiction, especially after the closure of the treatment facility on Long Island. 300 homeless residents were counted in the area in a November 2021 article.

The effects on local residents and the city&#x27;s attempts to deal with the problem have generated considerable controversy. The city of Quincy has opposed reconstruction of the bridge to Long Island as the only access to the island by bridge is through that city. Housing and homeless advocates also protested Acting Mayor Kim Janey&#x27;s October 19, 2021 announcement that Boston would begin clearing out the tent city. Janey cited the lack of hygienic facilities in tents, the sexual assaults and crime in the area, and the four or five overdoses that are reversed each day in the area. Opponents say that the dismantling of the tents and other makeshift structures, forcibly if necessary, is a criminalization of homelessness and addiction.

=== Chicago ===
Traditional Skid Row areas in Chicago were centered along West Madison Street just west of the Chicago River and, to a lesser degree, North Clark Street just north of the Chicago River. Since the 1980s both of these areas have been gentrified.

=== Denver ===
Union Station, Denver, Colorado has a homelessness and vagrancy problem. Reports of public drug consumption, including that of opiates and meth, are daily or regularly reported on the public train and buses, and the district is amongst the top 3 areas of highest violent crime. In July 2020, an estimated 1,350 people were camped out within Denver city limits, and an advocacy group for homeless individuals counted 664 tents. Lincoln Park has a high concentration of tent-dwelling homeless individuals, and reports of criminal activity and drug abuse are commonplace. Although, some tent cities are well kept in the area.

===Honolulu===
Chinatown has had issues with blight of homelessness and poverty. Initially more predominately Chinese when it was established and active in the 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries, it became a red-light district after World War II era. Today, the neighborhood still experiences problems with people dealing with addiction and mental health problems, as well as homelessness and public crime.

=== Houston ===
 In the 1800s much of what was the Third Ward, the present day south side of Downtown Houston. According to some, the eastern boundary is a low rent group of houses near Texas Southern University referred to as &quot;Sugar Hill&quot;. and among musicians, the Third Ward&#x27;s boundaries are usually thought of as extending southward from the junction of Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway) and Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59 (Southwest Freeway) to the Brays Bayou, with Main Street forming the western boundary. The Third Ward was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at Rice University, referred to as &quot;the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston&quot;. Ralph Bivins of the Houston Chronicle said that Fox said that area was &quot;a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes&quot;. Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the &quot;residential character&quot; of the area to &quot;deteriorate&quot;. Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area &quot;began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s&quot; and the hotels were changed into flophouses. Passenger trains stopped going to Union Station. The City of Houston abolished the ward system in the early 1900s, but the name &quot;Third Ward&quot; was continued to be used to refer to the territory that it used to cover.

The Third Ward today, and parts of Downtown Houston area, struggle with drug issues, homelessness and poverty.

===Los Angeles===
The Los Angeles Skid Row is an area on the East side of Downtown Los Angeles, roughly bounded by Los Angeles Street on the West, Central Avenue on the East, 4th Street on the North, and 8th Street on the South. The area was originally home to many cheap, low-quality hotels, popular with itinerant laborers and new arrivals to the city owing to its proximity to the train station and central location. In an attempt to rehabilitate the area in the 1960s, most of the run-down single-room occupancy hotels were demolished. This led to major reduction in the amount of very low-cost, bare minimum housing available to the area&#x27;s extremely low-income population, contributing to the severe homelessness problem in the area. Skid Row was once located at the industrial periphery of Los Angeles&#x27; often neglected downtown area. As downtown has been revitalized since the 1990s and the adjacent Arts District area has gone from a desolate industrial wasteland to a major center for tourism, entertainment, and upscale housing development, Skid Row has become increasingly hemmed in by bustling, populated neighborhoods. This has contributed to a substantial increase in the density of homeless residents living on the streets in Skid Row, since many of the new residents and businesses in the surrounding areas do not want the encampments to spread.

Local homeless count estimates have ranged from 3,668 to 8,000. In 2011, the homeless population estimate for Los Angeles&#x27; Skid Row was 4,316. L.A.&#x27;s Skid Row is sometimes called &quot;the Nickel&quot;, referring to a section of Fifth Street.

Several of the city&#x27;s homeless and social-service providers (such as Weingart Center Association, Volunteers of America, Frontline Foundation, Midnight Mission, Union Rescue Mission and Downtown Women&#x27;s Center) are based in Skid Row. Between 2005 and 2007, several local hospitals and suburban law-enforcement agencies were accused by Los Angeles Police Department and other officials of transporting those homeless people in their care to Skid Row.

Within Skid Row, the Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD) is a performance group whose members are mostly homeless or formerly homeless people who create performances and multimedia art that highlight connections between their lived experiences and external forces that impact their lives.

Westlake and Venice Beach have had issues with street crime and homelessness, and elements of skid rows and red-light districts. As per a 2020 count, there were nearly 2,000 homeless people in Venice of its 41,000 residents in general. up from 175 in 2014. Many of them lived on Venice Beach on the sand by the shoreline, until a city-ordered sweep done in August 2021. Many people experiencing homeless still reside in inland Venice, more towards Abbott Kinney Road.

=== Minneapolis ===
The twenty-five-block area that became known as the Gateway District in downtown Minneapolis was once the city&#x27;s Skid Row. The area was a dense collection of bars, liquor stores, flop houses and rescue missions. Many on Skid Row were seasonal laborers who came from different parts of the country to work on farms or in lumber mills. During off-season months they crowded into the city, and onto Skid Row.
A documentary filmed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by John Bacich focuses on this Skid Row.

=== New York City ===
In New York City, Skid Row was a nickname given to the Bowery during much of the 20th century.

Along East 125th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan, there is a noticeable density of homelessness and drug use. There are elements of a drug and poverty-related society along with homelessness around in Lower Manhattan. 

New York City&#x27;s climate is colder during the autumn and winter, thus more people experiencing homelessness are sheltered (less than 10% of people experiencing homelessness in the city are unsheltered), and elements of blight are usually less visible than that of west coast cities. As of 2019, 5% of NYC homeless people were unsheltered, compared to the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s 67% being unsheltered.

===Oakland area===
There are some facets of skid row in nearby Oakland, California, especially on International Boulevard, where homelessness and prostitution has been problematic. There are scattered elements of skid row and tent cities in Downtown Oakland and East Oakland. People&#x27;s Park, Berkeley has struggled with drug abuse and homelessness, with social services nearby. The area was a concentration of tents in Berkeley. Although the area is benign in comparison to major cities, it has a multi-decades-long history of homeless settlements.

=== Philadelphia ===
Philadelphia once had a highly visible skid row centered on Vine Street, just west of the approaches to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. This area was essentially obliterated by highway construction starting in the 1970s.

Today, the area most often referred to as Philadelphia&#x27;s modern-day skid row is in the Kensington neighborhood, along Kensington Avenue near the intersections of Somerset Street and Allegheny Avenue. The area is known for its high rates of open-air recreational drug use, poverty, and homelessness. A long-time camp largely hidden from public view in a gulch alongside Conrail tracks, spanning an area roughly from N 2nd Street to Kensington Avenue, was cleared in 2017. In late 2018, the city cleared a series of large homeless resident camps along Kensington Avenue, Emerald Street, Tulip Street, and Frankford Avenue. The homeless resident population in the Kensington neighborhood alone is estimated to be over 700 individuals.

===Portland===

Old Town Chinatown, a mostly defunct Chinatown of Portland, Oregon, has a high prevalence of hard drug use, homelessness, poverty, and property and violent-related crimes.

As of November 2021, a surge of meth was reported to be used amongst the homeless community in Greater Portland. In the 1980s and 1990s, where the meth epidemic was at a high in Portland, 35% of the drug was locally produced, as opposed to nearly zero percent of meth used by the homeless communities as reported in 2021.

Downtown Portland suffers a homelessness issue at large, as of the late 2010s and early 2020s.

===Seattle===
The name &quot;Skid Road&quot; was in use in Seattle by the 1850s when the city&#x27;s historic Pioneer Square neighborhood began to expand from its commercial core. The district centered near the end of what is now Yesler Way, the original &quot;Skid Road&quot; named after the freshly‑cut logs that were skidded downhill toward Henry Yesler&#x27;s mill.

Henry Yesler acquired land from Doc Maynard at a small point of land at what is today near the intersection of 1st Avenue and Yesler Way. He also acquired a swath of land wide, from his property up First Hill to a box of land about in size, full of timber, spanning what is today 20th to 30th avenues. Logs would be moved down the skid road of Yesler Way to his mill. In the words of Murray Morgan, &quot;This district south of Yesler Way, this land below the Deadline, has helped fix the word on the American language. The Skid Road: the place of dead dreams.&quot; His steam-powered logging mill was built in 1853 on the point of land that looked south towards a small island (Denny&#x27;s Island, part of his land purchase from Doc Maynard) that has since been expanded with infill and is the heart of today&#x27;s Pioneer Square. The mill operated seven days a week, 24 hours per day, on the waterfront.

The Skid Road became the demarcation line between the affluent members of Seattle and the mill workers and more rowdy portion of the population. The road became Mill Street, and eventually Yesler Way, but the nickname &quot;Skid Road&quot; was permanently associated with the district at the street&#x27;s end. The street&#x27;s end near the mill attracted cookhouses and inexpensive hotels for itinerant workers, along with several establishments that served beer and liquor.

===San Diego===
East Village, near Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, and Sherman Heights, has struggled with homelessness and drug abuse.

=== San Francisco ===
The Tenderloin neighborhood is a small, dense neighborhood near downtown San Francisco. In addition to its history and diverse and artistic community, there is significant poverty, homelessness, and crime.

It is known for its immigrant populations, single-room occupancy hotels, ethnic restaurants, bars and clubs, alternative arts scene, large homeless resident population, public transit and close proximity to Union Square, the Financial District, and Civic Center. The 2000 census reported a population of 28,991 persons, with a population density of 44,408/mi2 (17,146/km2), in the Tenderloin&#x27;s 94102 Zip Code Tabulation Area, which also includes the nearby Hayes Valley neighborhood.

During the 1960s, when development interests and the Redevelopment Agency were using eminent domain to clear out a large area populated by retired men in the South of Market area, that area was termed &quot;Skid Row&quot; in the media. The city&#x27;s convention center was built after the clearing of long term low-income residents. The neighborhood continues to be a plight of drug-related use and crime and homelessness of San Francisco, along with nearby South of Market, by Market and 6th and Market and 7th Streets. Tent cities were concentrated along Market Street in San Francisco, towards downtown, but are more scattered around the city as of November 2022.

16th Street and Mission to 24th Street and Mission also have a high visible prevalence of unhoused and open-air drug use and sales.

==Canada==
===Vancouver===
The 100-block of East Hastings Street in Vancouver, British Columbia, the heart of that city&#x27;s &quot;skid road&quot; neighborhood, lies on a historical skid road. The Vancouver Skid Road was part of a complex of such roads in the dense forests surrounding the Hastings Mill and adjacent to the settlement of Granville, Burrard Inlet (Gastown).

The city began as a sawmill settlement called Granville, in the early 1870s. By at least the 1950s, &quot;Skid Road&quot; was commonly used to describe the more dilapidated areas in the city&#x27;s Downtown Eastside, which is focused on the original &quot;strip&quot; along East Hastings Street due to a concentration of single-room occupancy hotels (SROs) and associated drinking establishments in the area. The area&#x27;s seedy origins date back to the early concentration of saloons in pre-Canadian Prohibition (1915–1919) and its popularity with loggers, miners and fishermen whose work was seasonal and who spent their salaries in the area&#x27;s cheap accommodations and public houses.

Opium and heroin use became popular early on; Vancouver was for many years the main port-of-entry for the North American opium supply. During the Great Depression, the railway rights-of-way and other vacant lots in the area were thronged by the unemployed and poor, and the pattern of social decay became well-established. In the 1970s, the endemic alcohol and poverty problems in the area were exacerbated by the expansion of the drug trade, with crack cocaine becoming high-profile in the 1980s as well as a re-concentration of the prostitution trade in the area because of the relocation of hooker strolls in conjunction with city policy for Expo 86.

A portion of Vancouver&#x27;s Skid Row, Gastown, has also been gentrified; however it is in a difficult coexistence with the nearby impoverished Downtown Eastside along East Hastings Street.

The Downtown Eastside is deemed to be one of the poorest urban areas in Canada. It is wedged between popular tourist destinations such as Downtown, Chinatown and Gastown. East Hastings Street is also a major thoroughfare. These avenues of exposure make the Downtown Eastside a highly visible example of a skid row.

The Downtown Eastside (sometimes abbreviated D.T.E.S.) is also home to Insite, the first legal intravenous drug safe injection site in North America, part of a harm reduction policy aimed at helping the area&#x27;s drug addicted residents. Additional sites have been established with approval from Health Canada in 2017 and 2018 as part of the strategy for dealing with the epidemic of lethal opioid (primarily fentanyl) overdoses.

=== Montreal ===


The Centre-Sud neighborhood of Montreal, located directly east of downtown, has long been notorious for prostitution (particularly on Ontario Street and Dufresne Street) as well as poverty and drug trafficking more broadly. Also, the Place Émilie-Gamelin neighborhood suffers from homelessness and blight.

Gentrification has changed this somewhat in recent years.

== Mexico ==
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico&#x27;s &quot;romantic area&quot; by its boardwalks has issues of homelessness, vagrancy, open drug abuse, fighting, and public violence. Mexico as a country struggles with poverty and migrants to the U.S. often end up homeless or near the Mexican border awaiting arrival. Elements of skid row and shantytowns may exist along the U.S.-Mexican border with awaiting migrants. While specific &quot;skid rows&quot; are not thoroughly documented in articles, at least mainly in English, crystal meth is often shipped in from Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, Baja California, both border cities. Both cities also have issues of meth consumption as well as other drugs, and homelessness and poverty are rampant in some districts.

According to a 2018 article by KPBS Public Media (KPBS), with the BBC World Service, Tijuana has 1,800 people who are described as &quot;living on the streets&quot;. It is uncertain whether this figure includes those in homeless shelters or sleeping in vehicles. This number is less than half a percent of Tijuana&#x27;s population, and far fewer than the 9,160 homeless individuals in neighboring San Diego County, California. However, the count in Tijuana does not include thousands of people who live in makeshift homes on canyons, often without running water or electricity. The academic research institute, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, concluded in 2014 that nearly half of people experiencing homeless in Tijuana are deportees from the US, based on their surveys of a specific shelter. Violent crime in Tijuana reached unprecedented levels in 2017, with 1,780 murders in Greater Tijuana, a rate of more than 100 per 100,000 people.

== Australia ==
=== Melbourne ===
Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, Australia, has an issue involving drug abuse, homelessness, and vagrancy. The &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, in two 2016 articles about the growing homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, and disturbance issues, described the street&#x27;s southern end towards Flinders Street as Melbourne&#x27;s &#x27;skid row.&#x27;

In 2010, an Elizabeth Street housing project organization was founded, endeavoring to help homeless and needy people find housing and treatment for health and job-related issues. 131 studio apartments and 30 two-bedroom apartments were built.

In January 2017, reports of a camp of homeless people being moved from under Flinders Street station to an organized housing facility made the News.com.au headlines. The Victorian state government spent $10 million on this project, with the intent of providing 30 new permanent modular and relocatable homes on public land to be in place by the end of 2017.

During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia in March, to June 2020, the Victorian government provided $15 million to homelessness organisations to find temporary accommodation in hotels for people who were sleeping on the street. On June 13, 2020, it was announced that a further $9.8 million was spent on the project to keep them there in the short term, but also help them plan a pathway into more long-term, stable accommodation. During these three months, at least 4500 people have been put up in hotels across the state of Victoria, 1000 in the Central Business District of Melbourne alone.

<doc id="148390" wikidata="Q2776794" url="?curid=148390" title="Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra">
<text>The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is an English orchestra, founded in 1893 and originally based in Bournemouth. With a remit to serve the South and South West of England, the BSO is administratively based in the adjacent town of Poole, since 1979. The orchestra is resident at Lighthouse in Poole, with other major concert series given at Portsmouth Guildhall, the Great Hall of Exeter University and Bristol Beacon. Shorter series are also given in Bournemouth (Pavilion Theatre) and Basingstoke.

Principal conductors of the orchestra have included Sir Dan Godfrey, Rudolf Schwarz, Constantin Silvestri, Paavo Berglund, Andrew Litton, Marin Alsop, and Kirill Karabits. The current principal conductor is Mark Wigglesworth, as of the 2024–2025 season. The orchestra&#x27;s current chief executive is Dougie Scarfe.

==History==
===Origins to 1934: The Godfrey era===
The orchestra was founded as Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra in 1893 by Dan Godfrey as a group of 30 wind players and a drummer, though several of the instrumentalists – as is the current practice with military musicians – were proficient in both wind and string instruments. This flexible approach meant that the musicians could form a military band for open-air concerts (playing on Bournemouth Pier) or a more formal classical ensemble for indoor programmes. The group gave its first concert on Whit Monday 1893 at the Winter Gardens, with its first classical concert in October that year.

The band quickly expanded to become a full orchestra, gaining a reputation for championing British music. Edward Elgar and Gustav Holst (among others) conducted the orchestra in their own works. The orchestra gave the UK premieres of major works by Richard Strauss, Camille Saint-Saëns and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. On 14 December 1903, the Orchestra gave its 500th symphony concert, conducted by Godfrey; a souvenir booklet listed all the works played by the orchestra since its inception, noting any first performances. The Bournemouth Municipal Choir, founded by Godfrey in 1911, sang regularly with the orchestra.

From 1922 to 1940, an Easter Festival was an important feature in the Bournemouth calendar. In 1927, the Festival was devoted to music of British women composers. In 1934, Godfrey retired as principal conductor, having conducted over 2,000 symphony concerts.

The first recording by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra was made in 1914 and occasional records were issued during Godfrey&#x27;s tenure: Godfrey&#x27;s recordings included works such as Ferdinand Hérold&#x27;s overture to &quot;Zampa&quot;, Daniel Auber&#x27;s overtures &quot;The Bronze Horse&quot; and &quot;The Crown Diamonds&quot;, or Samuel Coleridge-Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Petite Suite de Concert&quot;, along with &quot;novelty items&quot; with titles such as &#x27;Slippery Sticks&#x27; and &#x27;Whispering Pines&#x27; by members of the orchestra and featuring them as soloists.

Godfrey remains the longest serving principal conductor of the orchestra, and his stewardship ensured that, unlike many of the seaside orchestras that functioned from the end of the 19th century up until the outbreak of World War II, the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra established an ongoing tradition of music making. Godfrey&#x27;s programmes mixed populist elements, such as variety acts and light music, with extracts from more serious pieces. Alongside these, he instituted a series of symphony concerts which introduced diverse repertoire. He cultivated connections with most of the prominent British composers of the day including Edward Elgar, Hamilton Harty, Alexander Mackenzie, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Ethel Smyth, Gustav Holst and the Australian Percy Grainger.

From the very beginning, Godfrey had a difficult relationship with the Bournemouth Borough Council who saw the orchestra as a commercial concern which needed to pay its way. As part of Bournemouth&#x27;s visitor attractions, any request for expansion of the orchestra or changes to their contracts were the subject of exhaustive debates in the Council chamber. However, in general, Godfrey was successful at balancing both high artistic standards and box-office success.

===1934–1947: Austin, Birch and wartime austerity===
Between 1929 and 1934 Stanley Wilson became a regular guest conductor. After Godfrey&#x27;s retirement, the task of sustaining the orchestra fell to Richard Austin. Radio broadcasts took place from the Pavilion and a number of celebrated composers visited during this time, including Igor Stravinsky, William Walton, Ernest John Moeran, Sergei Rachmaninov, Roger Quilter, Balfour Gardiner and Percy Grainger. At the outbreak of war, the orchestra was cut from 61 to 35, and then in 1940 to only 24 players. Austin resigned in the same year and Montague Birch helped keep the orchestra going during the war, giving many &#x27;popular&#x27; concerts.
Whilst the Municipal Orchestra struggled in a depleted state, the war years saw concerts in the town by the Wessex Philharmonic, a freelance orchestra conducted by Reginald Goodall, which included some ex-members of the BMO.

===1947–1954: Schwarz and Groves===
After the end of the war, the orchestra found a new home at the &#x27;new&#x27; Winter Gardens. In 1947, Rudolf Schwarz was appointed musical director of a re-formed orchestra of 60. He conducted the orchestra in its first concert in London since 1911, at the Royal Albert Hall in 1948, and in two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall during the Festival of Britain in 1951. Schwarz&#x27;s tenure was marked by artistic consolidation, but also financial troubles.

Charles Groves took over as musical director in 1951, but a rising annual deficit and termination of players&#x27; contracts caused a crisis, averted only by support from the Winter Gardens Society. In 1952, a plan to merge the BMO with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was avoided by an arrangement with the Arts Council for the orchestra to accompany Welsh National Opera for several weeks. The continuation of the orchestra was only secured by the formation of the Western Orchestral Society. In 1954, the orchestra changed its name to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. At the inaugural concert, Groves and Sir Thomas Beecham shared the podium.

===1954–1969: The Silvestri years===
From 1954 the BSO developed its present role of giving concerts at more venues in the southwest of England. Other work included accompanying the Bolshoi Ballet on their first British tour in 1956.

In 1957 Groves and the orchestra made commercial recordings, for Classics Club, (with a local engineer from Ronaldsons of Southbourne), of Beethoven&#x27;s 4th Symphony, Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot; and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne Suite&quot;.

In 1962, Constantin Silvestri became principal conductor and raised the standard and profile of the orchestra, with an appearance at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963, a first European tour in 1965, notable recordings and regular radio broadcasts. The orchestra gained its first international recognition during Silvestri&#x27;s tenure, such as in a joint performance with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in the Winter Gardens by the combined string sections of both orchestras, playing Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot;. His tenure was cut short by his death from cancer in 1969. His recorded legacy includes Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, and a 1966 recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; with the additional forces of the Band of HM Royal Marines.

Recent releases on BBC Legends, transferred from recordings of live concerts given at the Winter Gardens and elsewhere during Silvestri&#x27;s tenure, provide a vivid record of the orchestra&#x27;s style in this era. These include accounts of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Manfred Symphony and Elgar&#x27;s Enigma Variations.

===1969–1972: Hurst===
In addition to its roster of principal conductors, other conductors affiliated with the orchestra have included George Hurst, who served as &quot;de facto&quot; principal conductor from 1969 to 1972, between the tenures of Silvestri and Paavo Berglund, without having been formally appointed to the post. Hurst ensured continuity during that conductorial interregnum.

===1972–1979: Berglund===
Paavo Berglund&#x27;s tenure as principal conductor from 1972 to 1979 included commercial recordings such as the complete symphonies of Jean Sibelius for EMI. The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Paavo Berglund made the world premiere recording of the &quot;Kullervo&quot; by Jean Sibelius. Berglund led Sibelius Centenary Concerts with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 1965, and became the principal conductor in 1972, concluding his tenure in 1979. Berglund led the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra with distinction, significantly raising the performing standards, as can be heard from the many recordings made by it for EMI. During this period, Nordic repertoire became a staple of the orchestra.

Roger Preston, co-principal cello, who worked with Berglund on many occasions, has said:
Anyone who played with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in the largest wooden church in the world, Kerimäki Church, Finland, as part of the BSO&#x27;s 1981 tour will tell that it was a truly unforgettable experience. On this tour we played all the Sibelius&#x27; Symphonies, with Paavo on spectacular form. This particular concert featured Sibelius&#x27; Fourth Symphony plus the Violin Concerto played superbly by Ida Haendel.

I joined the BSO in 1979, as much because I had seen and heard them play under Berglund and knew that he (and they!) were quite exceptional. Many of Paavo&#x27;s comments, criticisms and demands are as fresh in my mind as though it were only yesterday.

He remains, for me one of the best, if not the best conductor that I have ever played for and am so grateful to have caught the latter days of Paavo&#x27;s extraordinarily fruitful relationship with the BSO. For any string players reading this, I particularly loved it when he used to say, &quot;violins, you play like in a telephone booth&quot;, i.e. use much more bow!&quot;.

Edward Greenfield wrote in a review of a concert by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Paavo Berglund in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1972, that the brilliantly richful strings left behind many interpretations from London. (Translation from Vesa Sirén&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Suomalaiset kapellimestarit&quot;, ).

The Finnish newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; told in their 80th year birthday interview of Paavo Berglund that his one-time assistant from Bournemouth, Simon Rattle, called him &quot;one of the last great&quot;, and uses Berglund&#x27;s bowings in his Sibelius performances. The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra always gets very suspicious when a visiting maestro wants to change Paavo&#x27;s Sibelius markings. The visiting maestro is silenced by saying that the markings are Sibelius&#x27;.

===1980–1982: Segal===
The Israeli conductor Uri Segal succeeded Berglund from 1980 to 1982. During his tenure, the BSO recorded suites from Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot; and &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot;.

===1982–2008: Russians and Americans===
Rudolf Barshai served as the BSO&#x27;s principal conductor from 1982 to 1988. His BSO recordings included the Symphony No. 8 of Dmitri Shostakovich, and a &quot;Gramophone&quot; Award-winning release of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1988.

The American conductor Andrew Litton first conducted the BSO in 1986, and subsequently became the BSO&#x27;s principal conductor from 1988 to 1994, the first American principal conductor of the orchestra. Litton subsequently was named the BSO&#x27;s Conductor Laureate. His recordings with the BSO include William Walton&#x27;s symphonies and concertos for Decca, and the complete Tchaikovsky symphonies (including the &quot;Manfred&quot; Symphony) for Virgin Classics. In February 1997 Litton&#x27;s recording of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; with the BSO, Bournemouth Symphony Chorus and soloist Bryn Terfel won a Grammy Award.

Principal guest conductors of the BSO have included Kees Bakels (1990–2000) and Richard Hickox (1992–1995).

Yakov Kreizberg was principal conductor from 1995 to 2000. Whilst he made no commercial recordings with the orchestra, he and the BSO toured the United States, including their debut at Carnegie Hall in April 1997. Kreizberg and the BSO also performed a 3-day residency at the Musikverein, Vienna in 1999.

Marin Alsop, principal conductor from September 2002 to 2008, was the BSO&#x27;s first female principal conductor and the first female principal conductor of a UK orchestra. Her time with the orchestra continued the programming of American repertoire from Litton&#x27;s tenure, which she often introduced to the audience from the podium in the style of her mentor Leonard Bernstein. She conducted all of the Mahler symphonies except the Symphony No. 8. She and the BSO recorded several CDs for Naxos, both European and American repertoire.

===The present===
In November 2007, the BSO announced the appointment Kirill Karabits as their 13th principal conductor, the first Ukrainian principal conductor of a UK orchestra. Karabits held the title of orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor-designate for the 2008–2009 season, and became principal conductor with the 2009–2010 season. With the BSO, Karabits made his first conducting appearance at The Proms in August 2009.

The BSO&#x27;s first commercial recording with Karabits (of Rodion Shchedrin&#x27;s Concertos for Orchestra Nos 4 and 5) was released on the Naxos label in April 2010. The BSO and Karabits have also recorded music of Aram Khachaturian for the Onyx label. In August 2011, the BSO extended Karabits&#x27; contract as principal conductor through the 2015–2016 season. In April 2015, the BSO announced that Karabits had signed a rolling contract as its principal conductor, to extend his tenure to a minimum date of 2018. In January 2023, the orchestra announced that Karabits is to stand down as its chief conductor at the close of the 2023–2024 season, and subsequently to take the title of conductor laureate and serve as artistic director of the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Voices from the East&quot; project.

In November 2021, the orchestra announced the appointment of Mark Wigglesworth as its next principal guest conductor, with immediate effect. Chloé van Soeterstède first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2022. In March 2024, the orchestra announced simultaneously the appointments of Wigglesworth as its next chief conductor and of van Soeterstède as its next principal guest conductor, both effective with the 2024–2025 season and with initial contracts of four years for each conductor. The Calleva Assistant Conductor for the 2024–25 season is Enyi Okpara.

== Offshoots ==
In 1968, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta was founded, with a complementary remit to tour the smaller towns of the south and west, as well as concentrating on classical repertoire. Despite artistic acclaim throughout its history, financial difficulties and funding withdrawals led to its sudden closure in November 1999. Since then, sections of the BSO occasionally tour to smaller venues in the south and west.

Kokoro is a contemporary music ensemble of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, consisting of players from the orchestra and freelance musicians (formed 1994).

== Concert programme ==
The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra currently gives around 150 concerts a year. In September 1995 the orchestra, conducted by Richard Hickox, was the first to give a complete concert cycle of the symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams.

The orchestra under Paavo Berglund made the world premiere recording of Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Kullervo&quot; in 1970. Other notable recordings include Deryck Cooke&#x27;s completion of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 10, conducted by Simon Rattle; Elgar&#x27;s &quot;In the South (Alassio)&quot; with Constantin Silvestri, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 2nd Piano Concerto with Rudolf Barshai and Peter Donohoe as soloist (with Nigel Kennedy and Steven Isserlis in the slow movement); Anthony Payne&#x27;s completion of Elgar&#x27;s 3rd Symphony with Paul Daniel, and Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; with Marin Alsop.

The orchestra recorded a complete cycle of the Tippett symphonies for Chandos, the Vaughan Williams symphonies for Naxos (with Kees Bakels for seven of the symphonies and Paul Daniel for &quot;A Sea Symphony&quot; and the 4th). The orchestra has also recorded for Naxos a complete series of the symphonies of Sir Charles Villiers Stanford.

The orchestra performs regularly in the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall and has played in other great halls of the world, such as Carnegie Hall in New York, the Musikverein in Vienna, and the Rudolfinum in Prague.

For many years until his death in 2003, Ron Goodwin gave an annual series of Christmas concerts with the orchestra around the south and west of England.

===First performances===
Premieres given by the orchestra include the following:
== Media ==
In addition to the first acoustic recordings by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra in 1914, early mass media activities included radio broadcasts from the original Winter Gardens on 2LO in the 1920s. Subsequently, the BMO gave regular concerts on the BBC, including Godfrey&#x27;s farewell concert. The Pathé archive contains short films of the orchestra conducted by Dan Godfrey and Richard Austin made at the Pavilion Theatre in 1930 and 1937.

In 1963, the nave of Winchester Cathedral was cleared for the first time in several hundred years to enable a live television broadcast of the orchestra, conducted by Constantin Silvestri, performing Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Good Friday Music&quot; from &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

In the 1970s the orchestra appeared in Southern Television&#x27;s &quot;Music in Camera&quot; series, conducted by Owain Arwel Hughes. The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra recording of Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, conducted by George Hurst, was used on the soundtrack of Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;.

The orchestra were featured in a short-lived series of programmes on the local commercial radio station 2CR. Members of the orchestra and Bournemouth Symphony Chorus recorded a jingle for the Yellow Buses, Bournemouth&#x27;s local bus company.

<text>The King&#x27;s Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard is a bodyguard of the British monarch. The oldest British military corps still in existence, it was created by King Henry VII in 1485 after the Battle of Bosworth Field. The Yeomen of the Guard are popularly known as Beefeaters, a nickname they share with the Yeomen Warders of the Tower of London.

== History ==

The kings of England always had bodyguards surrounding them. The Anglo-Saxon kings had their house guards, and the Danish kings their housecarls. By the 13th century, the Anglo-Norman kings had three groups specifically ordered to protect them: (1) the royal household sergeants-at-arms; (2) the king&#x27;s foot archers (also known as the Yeomen of the Crown); and (3) the esquires of the royal household. The actual number of archers varied over the course of the 14th-15th centuries. In 1318, a Household Ordinance (the King&#x27;s Proclamation containing the yearly budget for his royal household) specified that the number of archers should be 24. Edward III had between 16 and 22 yeomen, Richard II recruited an additional 300 archers from Cheshire, Edward IV had 24 yeomen, and Richard III had 138 yeomen.

=== Sources ===
Reconstructing the history of the Guard is difficult. An 1809 fire in St James&#x27;s Palace, the headquarters of the Guard, destroyed whatever records may have remained from the 15th-18th centuries. The earliest mentions of the Guard are in histories from the 16th century: (a) Robert Fabian&#x27;s &quot;The New Chronicles of England and France&quot; (1516); (b) Polydore Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Angelica Historia&quot; (1534); and (c) Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1547). Francis Bacon mentioned them in his &quot;History of the Reign of King Henry the Seventh&quot; (1622). A short history of the Guard was written by Samuel Pegge as part of his &quot;Curialia&quot; (1782).

A 50-page history of the Guard appeared in 1852, with Thomas Smith&#x27;s &quot;Some Account of the Royal Body-Guard entitled the ancient corps of the Yeomen of the Guard, instituted 1485. With a brief notice of the Warders of the Tower&quot;. Smith acknowledged he used Pegge&#x27;s &quot;Curialia&quot; and records of the Guard as his sources. This was followed in 1904 with Sir Reginald Hennell&#x27;s 350-page &quot;The History of the King&#x27;s Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard&quot;. Hennell was a lieutenant in the Guard at the time, who discovered that there were no records save for one old order book and miscellaneous papers. Extensive modern research has been done by Anita Hewerdine for her 1998 doctoral thesis &quot;The Yeomen of the King’s Guard 1485-1547&quot;. Results of her subsequent research are found in her 2012 book &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard and the Early Tudors: The Formation of a Royal Bodyguard&quot; (See Further Reading). Hewerdine&#x27;s thesis is referenced in this article for the Tudor period, whilst Hennell&#x27;s book is referenced for the 17th-19th centuries.

=== Battle of Bosworth Field ===
On 22 August 1485, near the small village of Stoke Golding, Henry Tudor met King Richard III in battle for the Crown of England. The War of the Roses had persisted intermittently for more than 30 years between the rival claimants of the House of York (symbolised by a white rose) and the House of Lancaster (symbolised by a red rose). In 1483, Richard, of the House of York, had deposed his young nephew, 12-year-old Edward V. Henry Tudor, of the House of Lancaster, was the favoured candidate to replace Richard.

Three armies met that day on Bosworth Field: Richard, with his supporters, John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk and Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland; Henry, with his troops under command of the veteran John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford; and the troops of Thomas, Lord Stanley. Stanley was a powerful lord in northwest England. But he was stepfather of Henry Tudor, and Richard was holding his son hostage. Stanley&#x27;s forces remained uncommitted as the battle raged. As Oxford advanced, the troops appeared to leave Henry, his bodyguards, and some French mercenaries isolated, or so it appeared to Richard. Sensing an opportunity, Richard charged toward Henry. Seeing this, Stanley made his decision, and charged to reinforce Henry. Henry&#x27;s bodyguards fought bravely to hold off Richard&#x27;s bodyguards until the arrival of Stanley&#x27;s troops. During the melee, Richard&#x27;s horse became mired in the marsh, and he was killed. Henry had won.

=== Original unit formation ===
Henry rewarded his bodyguards by formally establishing the &quot;Yeomen of the Guard of (the body of) our Lord the King&quot;. This royal act recognized their bravery and loyalty in doing their duty, and designated them as the first members of a bodyguard to protect the King (or Queen) of England forever. In their first official act on 1 October 1485, fifty members of the Yeoman of the Guard, led by John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, formally escorted Henry Tudor to his coronation ceremony. This appearance of the Guard at Henry VII&#x27;s coronation was first documented by Francis Bacon in 1622. The coronation appears to have been hastily arranged, using the regulations for Richard III&#x27;s coronation as a draft. The Guard is not mentioned in the regulations.

There are no surviving original documents ordering the establishment of the Guard. There is only a draft document from ca 1536-37 proposing the formation of what would become the Gentlemen at Arms. The proposal contains this statement for a precedent:
Hewerdine proposes that Henry VII may have copied the Scots bodyguard of the French king. In 1445, Charles VII of France had established two companies of Scots: one contained 100 men-at-arms; the second contains 104 archers designated as personal bodyguards. These Scottish archers were being recognized for their service and loyalty to the French crown. Part of the royal retinue and used for ceremonial purposes, they wore richly decorated and embroidered jackets displaying the royal badges. They were armed with swords and halberds.

The earliest documents mentioning individual Yeomen of the Guard date from September 1485 through January 1846. They are signet warrants (signed orders) from Henry to his Keeper of the Privy Seal, granting offices throughout the realm. The first is dated 16 September 1485, less than one month after the Battle of Bosworth, and about six weeks before his coronation. It appointed John Frye, yeoman of the king&#x27;s guard, to the office of Searcher at the port of Bristol. From these warrants, Hewerdine was able to identify 32 Yeomen. Of these 32 warrants, 13 mention former service overseas, and 6 indicate presence at Bosworth Field. The remaining warrants mention &quot;good and faithful service&quot;, which Hewerdine interprets as meaning either service overseas, or presence at Bosworth, or both. Service overseas refers to Henry&#x27;s exile to Brittany after the execution of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. According to sources quoted by Hewerdine, Henry had a retinue of about 500 men while in Brittany, of which 200 followed him to France. It was probably from among these 200 followers that the original Guard was formed.

Under Henry VII the Guard had only 2 officers: the Captain, and the Clerk of the Cheque. The latter position (similar to a bookkeeper) was added by Henry later in his reign.

==== Size of the Guard ====

The only accounts which provide a size of the Guard during the early years of Henry VII&#x27;s reign are Virgil, who gives a total of about 200, and Bacon. who gives a total of 50. Hewerdine has reconstructed a list of approximately 100 yeomen for the first year or two of Henry&#x27;s reign. During the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, Hewerdine has established that the size fluctuated greatly between the 1470s and about 1540. In April 1489, Henry VII took 200 yeomen to northern England, and a similarly sized contingent in 1500, when Henry visited Archduke Philip of Austria in Calais. However, for Arthur, Prince of Wales marriage with Catherine of Aragon in 1501, the Guard numbered 300. Eight years later (1509), the names of 193 Yeomen are listed in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s records for Henry VII&#x27;s funeral. However, 300 Yeomen appeared for Henry VIII&#x27;s coronation. The greatest increase in Guard size occurred in 1513, for Henry VIII&#x27;s campaign in France. Two years later, 170 Yeomen were discharged as part of an effort to reduce spending. During the 1520s, the royal household sizes and expenses were scaled back in the Eltham Ordinance. The Guard was probably reduced to 80 members at that time. Hewerdine proposes another possible reason for the inability to determine the number of Yeomen of the Guard. It appears that the Yeomen served at court for specified terms of duty. Some of the Household Ordinances indicate that some served quarterly, whilst others served daily.

=== Original duties ===

Hewerdine mentions that the primary sources appear to make little distinction between the newly instituted Yeomen of the Guard, and the older positions of Yeomen of the Chamber, and the Yeomen of the Crown, which Henry VII kept as part of his household. Based upon the names of individuals, she suggests that the Yeomen of the Crown was the group of retainers who could serve as Yeomen of the Chamber or Yeomen of the Guard as openings occurred.

The Guard&#x27;s primary function was protection. Hewerdine quotes one of Henry VII&#x27;s heralds describing the Guard as: &quot;evermore standing by the ways and passages upon a row in both the sides where the king&#x27;s highness should from chamber to chamber or from one place to another at his goodly pleasure be removed&quot;. In other words, the Guard formed a physical security shield wherever he went in the palace. (Illustrations in this section are from the reign of Henry VIII. Very little remains of palace interiors from Henry VII&#x27;s reign due to remodelling, for example, Windsor Castle, or demolition, such as Greenwich Palace, by later monarchs.)

==== In the King&#x27;s Chambers ====
Many of the daily duties performed by the yeomen who served the King are described in Yeoman. Additional duties performed included: (1) carrying torches when escorting the king to and from the royal chapel; (2) advising the Officer of the Kitchen when to prepare the King&#x27;s meals; and (3) during meals, a yeoman usher was required to circulate throughout the King&#x27;s Chambers, ensuring good service and good order.

In the evening, the &quot;All Night&quot; ritual would begin. A Yeoman Usher would assist a Gentleman Usher in collecting food and drink for the king, should he become hungry or thirsty overnight. The food and drink was given to the Squire for the Body who was on duty in the King&#x27;s Chamber that night. The roster of the night watch was also given to the Squire, who was responsible for locking the chamber doors. Next came the making of the king&#x27;s bed for the night. There were two versions of the ritual. The &quot;old order&quot; required that a yeoman would stab the straw mattress with a dagger, searching for anything that should not be there. Then the canvas and feather beds were laid over the straw mattress. The &quot;new order&quot; required that a yeoman would jump upon the canvas and feather beds, and roll around, spreading them out. After either procedure was carried out, precise instructions were followed for placing the sheets, pillows and covers on the bed.

Yeomen on night watch not serving within the King&#x27;s Chamber were required to sit outside in the Guard Chamber. Four times each night, the yeomen locked inside the King&#x27;s Chamber would patrol the king&#x27;s chamber, and the yeomen in the Guard Chamber would patrol the palace. They were alert to signs of fire, any disturbances that might wake the king, or possible attacks on the king&#x27;s person.

==== At royal events ====
There are few mentions of the Guard at royal events during Henry VII&#x27;s reign, and they are not detailed. When Prince Arthur was christened in Winchester Cathedral in 1486, five Yeomen of the Guard controlled access to the specially-constructed stage erected for the royal font. When Princess Margaret was christened in Westminster Abbey in 1489, 120 torches were held in front of the chapel by knights, squires, gentlemen, and Yeomen of the Crown. During the two-week-long celebration of the marriage of Prince Arthur to Catherine of Aragon in 1501, the Guard is mentioned several times in the herald&#x27;s record. When Prince Henry was made Prince of Wales in 1504, some Yeomen of the Guard kept vigil (&quot;watched&quot;) with him during the night before the ceremony.

At Henry VII&#x27;s funeral in May 1509, twelve chosen Yeomen of the Guard, garbed in black livery, carried the royal coffin from the west door of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral to the high altar for the lying in state. The following day the Yeomen carried their former leader to Westminster Abbey. The rest of the Guard, also in black livery, marched on foot, holding their halberds upside down (&quot;reversed&quot;). One month later, three hundred Yeomen of the Guard participated in the procession on the eve of Henry VIII&#x27;s coronation. They wore Henry VII&#x27;s livery of green and white. Most Yeomen carried bows and arrows, whilst the others carried halberds or other weapons.

There were various annual festivals and special ceremonies in which the Guard most probably participated but for which there are no records earlier than the reign of Henry VIII. The Whitsuntide feast at Windsor Castle in &quot;honour of God, St. George and the noble Order of the Garter&quot; is described in detail from May 1519. It includes the processions, church service, and the feast afterwards. Another annual feast was the Easter celebration, which can only be inferred from the royal expense accounts.

=== Changes under King Henry VIII ===

Henry VIII was ostentatious, and enjoyed impressing foreign dignitaries. Hewerdine quotes the impression made on the Venetian ambassador by his visit to Henry VIII at Richmond Palace in 1515:

* barracks moved to St James&#x27;s Palace
* issued harquebus

==== Eltham Ordinance of January 1526 ====

This Household Ordinance is the first to mention regulations for the Yeomen of the Guard. It described the need to reduce the size of the Guard from its wartime strength back down to a peacetime level. The surviving copy of the Ordinance has left a space for that number to be written init never was. Holinshed reported that the number was 84.

=== Elizabeth I and the Gunpowder Plot ===

* search of Parliament

=== During English Civil War ===

* protection of Charles I
* protection of Charles II after regicide

=== Reorganization under King Charles II ===
=== 19th century ===
In the eighteenth century some 40 Yeomen were on duty daily, and 20 at night. This stopped in 1813, and thereafter only one division was required daily until about 1837.

==Modern day==
===Membership===

From 1830 candidates must have served in either the British Army or Royal Marines. In 1934, the first Royal Air Force candidate was accepted. In 2018, the first Royal Navy Warrant Officer was appointed. Candidates (both servicemen and servicewomen) must have completed at least 22 years of service, attained at least the rank of Sergeant or Petty Officer, and been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. On appointment, the age required is between 42 and 55. All Yeomen retire at 70 years of age. The corps&#x27; size varied slightly over the times. Once, the Guard had a limit of 64 Yeomen and Officers available for appointments. As of 2022, it was made up of 73 servicemen and officers. 
===Duties===
Today, the Yeomen of the Guard have a purely ceremonial role. As a visual reminder of their origin, the Yeomen still wear the red and gold uniforms of the Tudor period. Armed with a sword (which is always sheathed) and an ornamental partisan, they escort the sovereign. The Guard is mustered on demand, about eight times each year. This includes an annual Roll Call and the Sovereign&#x27;s Inspection (which has been changed to once every 4–5 years). They are in attendance at various occasions such as at the annual Royal Maundy service, the Epiphany Service in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace, installations of Knights of the Garter, investiture of the prince of Wales, lying-in-state, the funeral of the Sovereign, as well as all investitures, and summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace. One of their most famous duties is to perform a ceremonial search of the cellars of the Palace of Westminster prior to the State Opening of Parliament, which remembers the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

==Uniform==
===Tudor livery of green and white===
There are only two contemporary records of the livery of the Yeomen of the Guard during Henry VII&#x27;s reign. The first was written by a herald, who was present for the marriage of Prince Arthur to Catherine of Aragon in November 1501. Hewerdine quotes the herald&#x27;s description:

Hewerdine interprets this written description as referring to &quot;horsemen&#x27;s coats&quot;. These were close-fitting to the upper body, and expanded below the waist into a flared skirt to cover the thighs when the rider was on horseback. 

The second record is an illuminated border from the 1527 Treaty of Amiens. This is the earliest known illustration of the Bodyguard. Two yeomen are illustrated, wearing either a striped tunic or sleeveless jacket of green and white. The neckline is a gold band, and there is a gold crowned rose on the chest. One yeoman wears scarlet hose and a gold-coloured cap, whilst the other wears white hose and a black cap. (A photograph appears on page 60 of Hewerdine&#x27;s thesis.)

When members of the Guard were performing their duties as yeomen of the chamber, they were furnished with &quot;watching clothing&quot; for their night-time watches around the king&#x27;s chamber. The color was described either as russet cloth or tawny medley. Neither color has been identified with certainty. For royal funerals, the Guard wore black.

=== Scarlet and gold livery ===

In common with other members of the King&#x27;s household, the Guard wore scarlet for Henry VIII&#x27;s coronation in 1509. Thereafter they resumed the traditional green and white livery, but periodically red was worn (most notably at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520); and in June 1526 the colour appears to have been officially changed to red. From this time the Guard began on a regular basis to wear the scarlet and gold livery that is familiar today, albeit the styling varied over the years.

Records survive from Henry VIII&#x27;s reign regarding the special care and storage of the scarlet coats. In February 1528, two Yeomen of the Guard and four women were paid 6 shillings for two days work of brushing and airing out the coats. The coats were kept in large containers known as standards. The coat standards were not stored in one of the palaces or usual wardrobe buildings. They were kept at rented locations. As Henry VIII&#x27;s court moved around, the coat standards would accompany their retinue train. In 1519, the Guard&#x27;s Clerk of the Cheque received 3 shillings 8 pence to rent two carts to move the coat standards from Greenwich Palace to Richmond Palace. The next July, the Clerk received 6 pounds 2 shillings for transportation of the coat standards from London to Calais and Guisnes and then back to London. Another 6 shillings 8 pence was spent for renting accommodations to store the coats and the Guards&#x27; accoutrements while they were in Calais for Henry VII&#x27;s meeting with Francis I of France.

===Officers&#x27; ranks and today&#x27;s uniform===

The senior officer is the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, which is filled by the current Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords. Officers ranking below the Captain are Lieutenant, Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant, Ensign or Standard Bearer, and the Exon. In common with other branches of the military, a standardised uniform for officers was not adopted until the 18th century. By the early 19th century the officers of the Bodyguard were wearing red coatees, blue trousers and a cocked hat (much as they do today). In the 20th century it is described as a scarlet cloth double-breasted coatee with gold epaulettes and dark blue collar and cuffs; the skirts turned back with white cloth. Nine buttons in each row down the front, and two on the skirts behind. The buttons have a rose, shamrock and thistle device, topped by a crown; and a rose, shamrock and thistle appear within the gold embroidery of the epaulettes, collar, cuff slashes, sword flaps and also on the skirts of the coatee. The trousers are blue, with a gold stripe, and the hat has a &#x27;General&#x27;s plume&#x27; of 11-inch white swan feathers with red feathers under. 

Aiguillettes are worn by the Captain, the Lieutenant, the Clerk of the Cheque &amp; Adjutant and the Ensign, but not by the Exon. A &#x27;gold stick&#x27; (ebony, with a gold top) is carried by the captain, and &#x27;silver sticks&#x27; by the other officers.

===Non-Commissioned Officers&#x27; ranks and insignia===
Non-commissioned officers are the two Messenger Sergeant Majors (MSM), the Divisional Sergeant Majors (DSM) heading each division, the Yeoman Bed Goers (YBG), the Yeoman Bed Hangers (YBH), and the Yeomen. 

The badges of rank are worn on the right upper arm: The MSM wear four gold chevrons point down surmounted by a gold crown. The DSM are recognisable by four white chevrons surmounted by a gold crown. All Sergeant majors are distinguished by their black batons, which they carry instead of the partisan.
=== Differences between the Yeoman of the Guard and the Yeoman Warders ===
The Yeomen of the Guard, the original &quot;Beefeaters&quot;, are often confused with the Yeomen Warders of His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, who are also known as &quot;Beefeaters&quot;, a similar but distinct body. The Yeoman Warders wear their daily &quot;undress&quot; dark blue uniform and only on ceremonial occasions wear the Yeomen of the Guard&#x27;s distinctive uniform that consists of a royal red tunic with purple facings and stripes and gold lace ornaments, red knee-breeches and red stockings, flat hat, and black shoes with red, white and blue rosettes. The gold-embroidered emblems on the back and front of the coats consist of the crowned Tudor Rose, the shamrock and the thistle, the motto &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot;, and the royal cypher of the reigning sovereign (currently CIIIR for &quot;Carolus Rex&quot;). The State Dress is sometimes worn without a white ruff, which is reserved for highly official occasions.

The item of uniform that distinguishes The Yeomen of the Guard from the Tower Warders is the red cross-belt or baldric, worn from the left shoulder. This is a relic from the time when the Guard, and not the Warders, carried the harquebus.

==Standard==
Traditionally, the corps carried a standard, in the manner of army regiments. The corps&#x27; first standard was supposedly destroyed in a fire at St James&#x27;s Palace in 1809. King George VI presented a replacement standard to the corps in 1938. This was replaced by a new standard presented by Queen Elizabeth II in 1985.

The standard is a crimson-coloured damaskin the centre is the corps&#x27; badge of a combined rose, thistle and shamrock, with the royal cypher of the reigning monarch either side, and the royal motto &quot;Dieu et mon Droit&quot; below. Either side of this device are ribbons containing two of the corps&#x27; battle honours, Tournai and Boulogne. In each corner are symbols representing the various royal houses that the corps has served:
*Top left: a crowned hawthorn bush and the letters &#x27;HR&#x27;, representing King Henry VII and the legend that the crown was discovered by the guard in a hawthorn bush following the Battle of Bosworth Field.
*Top right: a crowned thistle, representing King James I and the personal union of England and Scotland.
*Bottom left: a white horse on a green mound surmounted by the crown, representing the House of Hanover.
*Bottom right: the Round Tower of Windsor Castle crowned, representing the House of Windsor.

==Battle honours==
*Field of Stoke, 1487
*Boulogne, 1492
*Blackheath, 1497
*Tournai 1513
*Boulogne, 1544
*Boyne, 1690
*Dettingen, 1743
:&quot;Honours in bold are displayed on the corps&#x27; standard.&quot;

<doc id="148393" wikidata="Q1891331" url="?curid=148393" title="Rollins Band">
<text>Rollins Band was an American rock band formed in Van Nuys, California. The band was active from 1987 to 2006 and was led by former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins. They are best known for the songs &quot;Low Self Opinion&quot; and &quot;Liar&quot;, both of which garnered heavy airplay on MTV in the early-mid 1990s.

Critic Steve Huey describes their music as &quot;uncompromising, intense, cathartic fusions of funk, post-punk, noise, and jazz experimentalism, with Rollins shouting angry, biting self-examinations and accusations over the grind.&quot;

In 2000, Rollins Band was included on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;, ranking at No. 47.

==History==
===Precursors (1980–1986)===

Rollins was the singer for the Washington, D.C. punk rock band State of Alert from October 1980 to July 1981. Afterwards, he sang with California punk rock band Black Flag from August 1981 to August 1986. Black Flag earned little mainstream attention, but through a demanding touring schedule, came to be regarded as one of the most important punk rock bands of the 1980s.

Less than a year after Black Flag broke up, Rollins returned to music with guitarist Chris Haskett (a friend from Rollins&#x27; teen years in Washington D.C.), bass guitarist Bernie Wandel, and drummer Mick Green.

This lineup released two records: &quot;Hot Animal Machine&quot; (credited as a Rollins solo record and featuring cover art drawings by Devo leader Mark Mothersbaugh) and &quot;Drive by Shooting&quot; (credited to &quot;Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters&quot;). The music was similar to Black Flag&#x27;s, though it flirted more with heavy metal and funk.

===First edition (1987–1994)===
Soon after, Rollins formed Rollins Band with Haskett, bassist Andrew Weiss, and drummer Sim Cain (Weiss and Cain had previously played with Gone, an instrumental rock group led by guitarist and Black Flag founder Greg Ginn). Live sound engineer Theo Van Rock was usually credited as a band member.

Critics Ira Robbins and Regina Joskow described this lineup as a &quot;brilliant, strong ensemble ... the band doesn&#x27;t play punk (more a jazzy, thrashy, swing take on the many moods of Jimi Hendrix), but what they do together has the strengths of both. The group&#x27;s loud guitar rock with a strong, inventive rhythmic clock borrows only the better attributes of metal, ensuring that noise is never a substitute for purpose.&quot;

===Second edition (1994–1997)===
Rollins&#x27;s tour diaries from this era details the personal and creative tensions that led to Weiss being fired following the &quot;End of Silence&quot; tour. These diaries were published by Rollins&#x27;s 2.13.61 company as &quot;See A Grown Man Cry&quot; and &quot;Now Watch Him Die&quot;.

The band&#x27;s new bassist was jazz and funk veteran Melvin Gibbs, who&#x27;d been highly recommended by Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, a friend of the Rollins Band since the first Lollapalooza tour. Cain and Gibbs had also both played in different versions of guitarist Marc Ribot&#x27;s band. Gibbs performed on Ribot&#x27;s album &quot;Rootless Cosmopolitans&quot; (1990) and Cain on &quot;Requiem for What&#x27;s His Name&quot; (1992).

The first video from 1994&#x27;s &quot;Weight&quot;, &quot;Liar&quot;, was a huge hit on MTV, with Rollins sporting numerous costumes (including a cop and a nun). The band appeared at Woodstock &#x27;94, and Rollins was a guest-host for several MTV programs, including &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. 

This version of Rollins Band had some of the most overt jazz leanings of the band&#x27;s history: Gibbs had begun his career with Reid in the 1980s jazz fusion group of drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson, and worked with Sonny Sharrock on albums like 1987&#x27;s &quot;Seize the Rainbow&quot;. These influences, along with Rollins&#x27; obsession with the late &#x27;60s/early &#x27;70s electric/fusion era of iconic trumpeter Miles Davis, shaped this version of the band&#x27;s music. During the sessions for &quot;Weight&quot;, Rollins Band recorded with free jazz saxophonist Charles Gayle, though these sessions remained unreleased for ten years at Gayle&#x27;s request to avoid conflicts with his contractual obligations. The Gayle sessions were released in 2003 as &quot;Weighting&quot;.

In 1996, there was a legal battle with the band&#x27;s former label, Imago Records. Rollins claimed &quot;fraud, deceit, undue
influence and economic coercion&quot; on the label&#x27;s part. They signed with the then-new major label DreamWorks Records, who released 1997&#x27;s &quot;Come In and Burn&quot;. The album had a minor hit with the single &quot;Starve&quot; and the band appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to promote the album (season 22, episode 18). However, &quot;Come In and Burn&quot; was not as successful as &quot;Weight&quot; and, after touring for &quot;Burn&quot;, Rollins dissolved the group, citing creative stagnation.

===Third edition (1999–2003)===
Rollins replaced the Haskett-Gibbs-Cain lineup with the Los Angeles rock band Mother Superior, retaining the name Rollins Band, and released &quot;Get Some Go Again&quot; (2000) and &quot;Nice&quot; (2001). They also released a two-disc live album, &quot;The Only Way to Know for Sure&quot;. 

This lineup was a more straightforward hard rock group. Their first album featured &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; a cover of a Thin Lizzy song, featuring Lizzy guitarist Scott Gorham; Rollins has often expressed fondness for Thin Lizzy and its founder, Phil Lynott.

===Fourth edition (2006)===
In between other commitments (his radio show &quot;Harmony in My Head&quot;, his cable/satellite TV show &quot;The Henry Rollins Show&quot;, and his spoken word tours), Rollins also reunited the Haskett-Gibbs-Cain lineup.
In a March 2006 blog entry on henryrollins.com, Rollins admitted, &quot;Actually we have been practicing on and off for months now, slowly getting it together ... It&#x27;s been really cool being back in the practice room with these guys after all these years.&quot;

Rollins told Alan Sculley of &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; that this reunion with Haskett, Gibbs and Cain would not become long-term unless the group decided to write new songs: &quot;Let&#x27;s put it this way. I don&#x27;t want to go out and hit America again without a new record, or at least a new album&#x27;s worth of material. Otherwise the thing will lack legitimacy ... Miles Davis would never do that. And I&#x27;m not into a greatest-hits thing. I think a band, if you&#x27;re going to be around, you should be moving forward and putting in the time and working for it, getting after the art. Otherwise you&#x27;re just playing retreads. ... Imagine a tree that grows canned peaches. It&#x27;s nothing I want to do.&quot;

The band opened some concerts for X, and played on the first-season finale of &quot;The Henry Rollins Show&quot; on August 12, 2006.

===Hiatus and retirement===
In 2011 Rollins stated that he has retired from music, meaning that Rollins Band has come to an end.

Former member Jason Mackenroth died on January 3, 2016, in Nevada from prostate cancer.

==Musical style and influences==
Rollins Band&#x27;s sound has been described as alternative metal, post-hardcore, hard rock and funk metal genres. Chris Haskett has highlighted the impact of King Crimson on the original lineup&#x27;s sound, stating:&quot;There were three records in particular, at the beginning of the 70s – &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, and &quot;Red&quot;. And just the aesthetics of those records... they’re so heavy. And they have almost dark quality – they’re almost metal. (...) And those King Crimson records are very, very heavy and dark. They have an incredible musical tension. But they’re also very rich with a lot of depth. The tonalities within the intervals and the progressions – they use a lot of flatted fifths which creates a kind of dark tone. And also just a radical dynamics, if you’re listening to these records – they’re incredibly from powerful - from heavy rich chords to near silence. (...) And they also improvised a lot. A lot of King Crimson stuff is just jamming. It’s not noodling, they’re doing collective improvisation. It’s not all written out. And some of the most amazing parts of their music were just improvised. That was what we also brought into Rollins Band. There was a lot of space for improvisation. Not noodling, not a kind of wasting time. But actually making unwritten music happen. And it’s (sic) also came from Grateful Dead.&quot;Mid-career albums such as &quot;Weight&quot; also had a pronounced jazz influence.

Rollins Band were a major fixture of the early 1990s Los Angeles alternative metal scene, alongside Tool, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Rage Against the Machine and Green Jellÿ. Rollins&#x27; shout-singing style proved influential to later alternative and nu metal artists, such as Coal Chamber, Korn, Chevelle, Godsmack and System of a Down. The Rollins Band songs &quot;Tearing&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot; have been covered by Pearl Jam.

<text>The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO) is an American orchestra based in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The ASO&#x27;s main concert venue is Atlanta Symphony Hall in the Woodruff Arts Center.

==History==
Though earlier organizations bearing the same name date back as far as 1923, thanks largely to the efforts of Josephine Fields Sanders, the orchestra was officially founded in 1945 and played its first concert as the Atlanta Youth Symphony under the direction of Henry Sopkin, a Chicago music educator who remained its conductor until 1966. The organization changed to its current name in 1947 and soon began attracting well known soloists such as Isaac Stern and Glenn Gould. In 1967, with the departure of Sopkin, Robert Shaw (founder of the Robert Shaw Chorale) became the music director, and a year later the orchestra became full-time. In 1970, Shaw founded a choir, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus. In 1988, Yoel Levi became music director and principal conductor. Under him, the orchestra played &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot; composed and conducted by John Williams at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Levi became music director emeritus in 2000, and was succeeded as music director by Robert Spano. Allison Vulgamore was hired as president of the orchestra in 1993, remaining in the role until 2009. The current executive director of the ASO is Jennifer Barlament, since January 2016.

The orchestra toured Europe under Yoel Levi in 1991; and with its chorus, under Robert Shaw, in 1988. In 2006 the orchestra and its chamber chorus, under Robert Spano, served as the resident ensemble for California&#x27;s Ojai Festival. The full ASO Chorus has thrice visited Berlin, giving three performances on each occasion of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; (2003), Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Grande Messe des Morts&quot; (2008), and Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot; (2009) with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under ASO Principal Guest Conductor Donald Runnicles.

Since 2005, the orchestra had been actively planning for the construction of a new principal concert hall. In 2008, the ASO opened its new 12,000-seat Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre at Encore Park in north Fulton County in the town of Alpharetta, some 22 miles north of Atlanta, where it presents concerts of its own as well as those by various pops groups. Encore Park and the Amphitheatre are owned by the Woodruff Arts Center, the ASO&#x27;s parent organization. Including Encore Park and its activities at Atlanta Symphony Hall and Chastain Park, the ASO expects to present more than 300 performances annually. With a budget expected to increase to US$50 million with the completion of its new Amphitheatre, the ASO has become one of the six or seven largest orchestras in America, by budget size. The ASO&#x27;s budget includes not only the costs of production, along with musician and staff salaries and benefits, but also the orchestra&#x27;s very significant expenditures on education, community outreach, special events and fundraising.

Past assistant conductors of the ASO have included Joseph Young. The current associate conductor of the ASO is Jerry Hou. One noted past ASO member was Jane Little, who debuted as a double bassist in Atlanta on February. 4, 1945, at the age of 16. Said to be the longest-tenured orchestra musician in the world, Little remained a member of the ASO for the rest of her life until her death on May 15, 2016 at age 87, a few hours after collapsing during an ASO concert.

In December 2020, Nathalie Stutzmann first guest-conducted the ASO. She returned in February 2021 for an additional guest-conducting engagement, in a streamed quarantine concert. In October 2021, the ASO announced the appointment of Stutzmann as its next music director, effective with the 2022-2023 season, with an initial contract of four years. Stutzmann is the first female conductor to be named music director of the ASO.

The orchestra was featured on R.E.M.&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Out of Time&quot;, most notably on &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;. Members of the orchestra performed with the band on November 10, 1991, when R.E.M. recorded a special live performance of &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; for an MTV 10th Anniversary Special. Members of the orchestra also recorded parts on four songs on R.E.M.&#x27;s next album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;.

==Recordings==

The orchestra and chorus made their first recording, a 2-LP Christmas album entitled &quot;Nativity&quot;, for Turnabout/Vox Records in 1975, conducted by Robert Shaw. This was an album directly based on their annual Christmas concert. A slightly shortened version of the 75-minute album was issued by Vox in the 1990s on compact disc under the title &quot;Christmas with Robert Shaw&quot;.

In 1978, the ASO became the first American orchestra to make a digital recording intended for commercial release, when it played Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot; suite and excerpts from Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera, &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, for the Telarc label. The Telarc association, which resulted in 26 Grammy awards, continued until 2010, one of the longest continuous associations of an orchestra with a record label. In 2011 the orchestra began releasing recordings on its own ASO Media label. In 2004, the orchestra began a project to record for the Deutsche Grammophon label several works by composer Osvaldo Golijov.

One of the orchestra and chorus&#x27;s best-known recordings, of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony conducted by Robert Shaw, was recorded for the now defunct Pro Arte label, and is out of print, though excerpts from the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; fourth movement may be found in anthologies issued on the Reference Gold and Classical Heritage labels. Another of the ASO&#x27;s recordings now out-of-print because it was recorded for the Pro Arte label is that of Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1, with Peter Serkin as soloist and Robert Shaw conducting. It is one of the few recordings without a chorus that the orchestra made with Shaw.

==Labor disputes==
The ASO has suffered from labor disputes between management and musicians in recent years. In 2012, musicians agreed to decrease by ten weeks of pay yearly in order to help balance the ASO&#x27;s budget, which had seen a major deficit in part due to years of mismanagement and declining ticket sales. As a result, the orchestra&#x27;s status changed from a full-time, 52-week orchestra to a part-time, 42-week organization. In 2014, per the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, the orchestra&#x27;s management and principal musicians faced a 6 September 2014 deadline to reach a collective bargaining agreement or face delaying the opening of the season. This continued a rancorous history between management and players, as they attempt to extricate themselves from operating in the red, as has been the case for many years now. The local paper also indicated that their touted &quot;operating budget&quot; was unsustainable for a variety of reasons. In September 2014, after musicians refused to agree to a new contract, management locked out the players and putting the beginning of the 2014–15 season in jeopardy. The lockout ended up lasting beyond the scheduled date at which the season was supposed to start, on September 25.

<doc id="148397" wikidata="Q933993" url="?curid=148397" title="San Francisco Symphony">
<text>The San Francisco Symphony, founded in 1911, is an American orchestra based in San Francisco, California. Since 1980 the orchestra has been resident at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in the city&#x27;s Hayes Valley neighborhood. The San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra (founded in 1981) and the San Francisco Symphony Chorus (1972) are part of the organization. Michael Tilson Thomas became the orchestra&#x27;s music director in 1995, and concluded his tenure in 2020 when Esa-Pekka Salonen took over the position.

Among the orchestra&#x27;s awards and honors are an Emmy Award and 15 Grammy Awards in the past 26 years.

==History==

===The early years===

In 1909 the Musical Association (MA) was founded by a group of San Francisco citizens with the goal of establishing a professional symphony orchestra in San Francisco. Among the founding board members of the MA was composer, lawyer, and opera librettist Joseph Redding. Redding played an instrumental role in steering the MA&#x27;s board during the establishment of the San Francisco Symphony and it is largely through his recommendation that conductor-composer Henry Kimball Hadley was appointed San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s first principal conductor. Redding also selected the orchestra&#x27;s first concertmaster, the Dutch violinist Eduard Tak. The governing board of the MA continued to manage the San Francisco Symphony until 1935.

The orchestra&#x27;s first concerts were led by Hadley in 1911. There were sixty musicians in the Orchestra at the beginning of their first season. The first concert included music by Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Haydn, and Liszt. There were thirteen concerts in the 1911–1912 season, five of which were popular music.

In 1915, Alfred Hertz succeeded Hadley. Hertz helped to refine the orchestra and arranged for the Victor Talking Machine Company to record it at their new studio in Oakland in early 1925. Hertz also led the orchestra during a number of radio broadcasts, including on &quot;The Standard Hour&quot;, a weekly concert series sponsored by Standard Oil of California. The series began in 1926 when the orchestra faced bankruptcy; Standard Oil of California paid the orchestra&#x27;s debts and in return was given broadcast rights to that year&#x27;s concert series. The first broadcast aired on the NBC Pacific Network, on October 24, 1926. and the broadcasts continued for more than 30 years.

===Pierre Monteux===
After Hertz&#x27;s retirement in 1930, two conductors, Basil Cameron and Issay Dobrowen, jointly headed the orchestra. During the Great Depression, the Symphony&#x27;s existence was threatened by bankruptcy and the 1934–35 season was cancelled; the people of San Francisco passed a bond measure to provide public financing and ensure the organization&#x27;s continued existence. Pierre Monteux (1875–1964) was subsequently hired to restore the orchestra. Monteux succeeded to the point where NBC began broadcasting some of its concerts and RCA Victor offered the orchestra a new recording contract in 1941. In 1949, Monteux invited Arthur Fiedler to lead summer &quot;pops&quot; concerts in the Civic Auditorium. Fiedler also conducted the orchestra at free concerts in Sigmund Stern Grove in San Francisco and the Frost Amphitheater at Stanford University. Fiedler&#x27;s relationship with the orchestra continued until the mid-1970s.

When Monteux left the orchestra in 1952, various conductors led the orchestra, including Leopold Stokowski, Georg Solti, Erich Leinsdorf, Karl Münchinger, George Szell, Bruno Walter, Ferenc Fricsay, and William Steinberg. Stokowski made a series of RCA Victor recordings with the orchestra in 1952 and 1953.

===Enrique Jordá===
In 1954, the board hired Enrique Jordá as music director. Surviving eyewitness and newspaper accounts describe him as having youthful enthusiasm, energy, and charm. Jordá sometimes conducted so vigorously that his baton flew from his hand. As the years passed, Jordá reportedly failed to maintain discipline or provide sufficient leadership, resulting in inadequate rehearsal of the orchestra George Szell (1897–1970), the longtime music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, guest-conducted the orchestra in 1962 and was so dismayed by the lack of discipline that he publicly condemned Jordá and even chastised &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; music critic Alfred Frankenstein for commending Jordá and the orchestra. Szell&#x27;s comments, along with growing dissatisfaction among musicians and the public, led the symphony board to dismiss Jordá.

===Josef Krips===
In the fall of 1963, Josef Krips (1902–1974) became music director. He quickly became known as a benevolent autocrat, and would not tolerate sloppy playing. He soon began to refine the performance of the musicians, particularly of the standard German-Austrian repertoire. One of his innovations was an annual tradition on New Year&#x27;s Eve, &quot;A Night in Old Vienna&quot;, which was devoted to music of Johann Strauss and other Viennese masters of the nineteenth century. Similar concerts continued into the 2000s, though the format has changed in recent years. Krips would not make recordings with the orchestra, insisting they weren&#x27;t ready. He did agree to allow KKHI to broadcast some of the Friday evening concerts. He also paved the way for his successor when he invited Seiji Ozawa to guest conduct the orchestra; Ozawa impressed critics and audiences with his fiery Bernstein-like conducting, particularly in the performances of the Mussorgsky-Ravel &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, the Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony, and &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; by Hector Berlioz. Krips retired at the end of the 1969–70 season and only returned once, to guest conduct the orchestra in Stern Grove, before his death in 1974.

===Seiji Ozawa===
Seiji Ozawa guest appearances had generated interest before he became the symphony&#x27;s director in 1970. Concerts were frequently sold out. He greatly improved the quality of the orchestra&#x27;s performances and convinced Deutsche Grammophon (DG) to record the orchestra in 1972. A special concert series devoted to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, as interpreted by Hector Berlioz, Peter Tchaikovsky, and Sergei Prokofiev and Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s symphonic dances from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, inspired DG to record the same music with Ozawa. He introduced a number of innovations, including presenting partially staged versions of &quot;La vida breve&quot; by Manuel de Falla and &quot;Beatrice and Benedict&quot; by Berlioz. He had dancers on the stage for some modern ballets performed by the orchestra. For a few seasons Ozawa used local university choruses when needed, but later formed a San Francisco Symphony Chorus to ensure consistent singing. Ozawa purchased a home in San Francisco, planning to stay for many years. However, he agreed to become music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and for a time simultaneously directed both orchestras. After leaving San Francisco, Ozawa has returned twice as guest conductor.

===Edo de Waart===
Edo de Waart succeeded Ozawa in 1977. Though considered to be not as flamboyant as Ozawa, de Waart maintained the orchestra&#x27;s high standards, leading to additional recordings, including its first digital sessions. He conducted the orchestra&#x27;s first performances in the newly constructed Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in September 1980, including the nationally televised gala. At this time the regular season was extended, beginning in September and lasting until May. This was possible because San Francisco now had two major classical venues, Davies Hall and the War Memorial Opera House. Consequently, musicians could choose to play in the Symphony, or the Opera and Ballet. A large Fratelli Ruffatti concert organ featuring five manuals, 147 registers and 9235 pipes, was added to the new hall. This organ was used in the orchestra&#x27;s performance of the recording of Saint-Saëns&#x27; third symphony with Michael Murray as soloist. Philips also taped Joseph Jongen&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot; and César Franck&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie in A&quot;. A highlight of de Waart&#x27;s final season, 1984–85, was four sold-out performances of Mahler&#x27;s eighth symphony, incorporating the Symphony Chorus, the Masterworks Chorale, the San Francisco Boys Chorus, and the San Francisco Girls Chorus.

===Herbert Blomstedt===
Herbert Blomstedt became music director as of the 1985–1986 season. He had been offered the position immediately after guest conducting for two weeks in 1984, while he was music director of Staatskapelle Dresden. He emphasized precision and confidence, and worked to develop sensitivity, warmth and feeling in the orchestra&#x27;s performances. The orchestra began its annual tours of Europe and Asia under Blomstedt, and resumed syndicated weekly radio broadcasts. He recognized the continuing shortcomings of Davies Symphony Hall&#x27;s acoustics, helping push for a major renovation, completed in 1992, contributing a substantial amount of money to the cause. He has remained Conductor Laureate of the orchestra, conducting several weeks of concerts each year.

===Michael Tilson Thomas===

Michael Tilson Thomas (known colloquially as &quot;MTT&quot;) became music director in 1995, coming from the London Symphony Orchestra. Thomas had guest conducted the orchestra as far back as 1974, and already had a relationship with the musicians. Like Ozawa, Thomas ensured that the orchestra played more American music and this has been carried through to its recordings, for RCA/BMG and its own label SFS Media.

Thomas focused on Russian music, particularly Stravinsky, as well as a prominent Mahler cycle. He recruited London Symphony Orchestra leader Alexander Barantschik to become SFS concertmaster. During his leadership the Symphony achieved financial and artistic stability. Thomas is currently the longest-serving music director in the Symphony&#x27;s history.

In October 2017, the orchestra announced that Thomas was to conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of the 2019–2020 season, and subsequently to take the title of music director laureate. Thomas was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2017.

===Esa-Pekka Salonen===

Esa-Pekka Salonen guest-conducted the orchestra in 2004, 2012, and 2015. In December 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Salonen as its next music director, effective for the 2020–2021 season, with an initial contract of 5 seasons.

In March 2024, Salonen announced that he would be leaving the San Francisco Symphony when his contract expires in 2025, stating that &quot;I do not share the same goals for the future of the institution as the Board of Governors does.&quot;

==Radio broadcasts and tours==
The San Francisco Symphony was the first to feature symphonic radio broadcasts in 1926, and in 2003 the Symphony was heard in syndicated radio broadcasts on over 300 radio stations. There were regular live, stereo broadcasts for many years on KKHI in San Francisco featuring music directors Josef Krips and Seiji Ozawa, including the first live transatlantic stereo satellite broadcast in 1973, originating in Paris.

The orchestra makes regular tours of the United States, Europe and Asia. Its first tour was from March 16 – May 10, 1947, when Pierre Monteux conducted the musicians in 57 concerts in 53 American cities. Josef Krips led them on a Japanese tour in 1968, in which they gave 12 concerts in 7 cities. The May 15 – June 17, 1973, tour saw then-music director Seiji Ozawa and Niklaus Wyss conduct the orchestra in 30 concerts in 19 cities in Europe and the Soviet Union. They returned to Japan from June 4–19, 1975, with Ozawa and Wyss and played 12 concerts in 11 cities. Edo de Waart and David Ramadanoff led an American tour from October 20 – November 2, 1980, giving 10 concerts in 7 cities. There was another American tour from October 27 – November 12, 1983, again led by Edo de Waart, with 13 concerts in 11 cities.

The San Francisco Symphony has toured regularly with current music director Michael Tilson Thomas, most recently a highly successful East Coast tour in April 2016 which included performances in Carnegie Hall, The Kennedy Center, and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. In November 2016, the San Francisco Symphony, together with Michael Tilson Thomas, embarked on its fourth tour of Asia with performances in Seoul, South Korea; Tainan, Taiwan; Taipei, Taiwan; Shanghai, China; Beijing, China; Osaka, Japan; and Tokyo, Japan.

In 2006, the San Francisco Symphony launched &quot;Keeping Score – MTT on Music&quot;, a series of projects comprising audio-visual performances for DVD and broadcast on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot;, multimedia websites, and educational programs for schools.

==Guests==
Throughout its history the San Francisco Symphony has had numerous great conductors, instrumentalists and singers as guests. Many famous composers have also led the Orchestra over the years. In 1915, Saint-Saëns (1835–1921) conducted the Orchestra at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition held that year in San Francisco&#x27;s Marina District. In 1928, Maurice Ravel conducted some of his music including La Valse and Rapsodie espagnole. In 1937, George Gershwin (1898–1937) conducted a suite from his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, then was soloist in his &quot;Concerto in F&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with Pierre Monteux conducting. Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) was a regular guest conductor, appearing periodically from 1937 until 1967. Aaron Copland (1900–1990) conducted the Orchestra in 1966. Other composers who have led the Orchestra include Ernst von Dohnányi in 1927, Ottorino Respighi in 1929, Arnold Schoenberg in 1945, Darius Milhaud in 1949, Manuel Rosenthal in 1950, Leon Kirchner in 1960, Jean Martinon in 1970, and Howard Hanson. John Adams, composer-in-residence from 1979 to 1985, also frequently conducts his own works with the Orchestra.

Besides visiting composers, some legendary conductors have led the Orchestra, including Artur Rodziński, Walter Damrosch, Sir Thomas Beecham, John Barbirolli, Andre Kostelanetz, Lorin Maazel, Leonard Bernstein, Guido Cantelli, Victor de Sabata, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Erich Leinsdorf, George Szell, Charles Münch, Paul Paray, Rafael Kubelík, Daniel Barenboim, István Kertész, Karl Richter, Antal Doráti, Leonard Slatkin, Andrew Davis, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Yevgeny Svetlanov, Simon Rattle, Kurt Masur, Neeme Järvi, Kiril Kondrashin, Eugene Ormandy, Georg Solti, Alex Shkurko, Michael Kamen, Christopher Hogwood and Bruno Walter.

Some of the many soloists who have appeared with the orchestra include violinists Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, Yehudi Menuhin, Midori, Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, Joshua Bell, Gil Shaham, and Efrem Zimbalist; pianists Vladimir Horowitz, Horacio Gutierrez, Vladimir de Pachmann, Peter Serkin, Rudolf Serkin, Ruth Slenzynska, Patricia Benkman, Ozan Marsh, Yuja Wang, and André Watts; and organists Alexander Frey and Paul Jacobs.

==Concert halls==

The San Francisco Symphony gave its first performance on Friday, December 8, 1911, in the Cort Theater at 64 Ellis Street. The Symphony stayed at the Cort Theater when it was renamed the Curran Theatre in 1918 (not to be confused with the present day Curran Theater at 445 Geary Street, which wasn&#x27;t built until 1922). The Symphony then moved to the Tivoli Theater at 75 Eddy Street for the 1921–22 season, then moved to the newly constructed Curran Theater in 1922 and stayed until 1931, then back to the Tivoli Theater from 1931 to 1932. On November 11, 1932, the Symphony moved to the new War Memorial Opera House at 301 Van Ness Avenue, where most of their concerts were given until June 1980. The pops concerts were usually presented at the Civic Auditorium. The final concert in the opera house, a Beethoven program conducted by Leonard Slatkin, was in June 1980. The Orchestra now plays almost exclusively in Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall at Grove Street and Van Ness Avenue, which opened in September 1980 with a gala concert conducted by Edo de Waart, televised live on PBS and hosted by violinist/conductor Yehudi Menuhin. Davies Symphony Hall underwent extensive remodeling in the 1990s to correct a number of acoustical problems. The hall is also home to the second largest concert hall organ in North America, a Fratelli Ruffatti 5–147.

==Recordings==
The orchestra has a long history of recordings, most notably those made with Pierre Monteux for RCA Victor, Herbert Blomstedt for Decca, and Michael Tilson Thomas for RCA Victor and the Orchestra&#x27;s own label, SFS Media.

The first recording, of Auber&#x27;s overture to &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, was made on January 19, 1925. The early recordings, for the Victor Talking Machine Company, included music by Auber and Richard Wagner, conducted by Alfred Hertz. Hertz also conducted the orchestra&#x27;s first electrical recordings for Victor in mid 1925. These recordings were produced by Victor&#x27;s Oakland plant, which had opened in 1924. The 1927 recordings were made on the stage of San Francisco&#x27;s Columbia Theater, now known as the American Conservatory Theater. In 1928, the orchestra made a series of recordings at Oakland&#x27;s Scottish Rite Temple on Madison Avenue near Lake Merritt, now the Islamic Cultural Center of Northern California. One early complete set was of the ballet music from &quot;Le Cid&quot; by Jules Massenet. During the 1925–30 recordings, Hertz conducted music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Léo Delibes, Alexander Glazunov, Charles Gounod, Fritz Kreisler, Franz Liszt, Alexandre Luigini, Felix Mendelssohn, Moritz Moszkowski, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Schubert and Carl Maria von Weber. All of these recordings were issued only on 78 rpm discs and are prized by collectors, although restored versions are now available from France&#x27;s Pristine Audio.

Monteux&#x27;s recordings were made for RCA Victor in the War Memorial Opera House from 1941 to 1952, at first piping the microphone feed from San Francisco to Los Angeles and then in the later 1940s on magnetic tape; there was also a stereo session for RCA Victor with Monteux in January 1960. Monteux&#x27;s first released album with the orchestra was of the &quot;Symphony in D Minor&quot; by César Franck (the first recorded was Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;La Valse&quot;); his last was of &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; by Richard Wagner and &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot; by Richard Strauss. Some of the recordings have been re-released on LPs and compact discs, as well as internationally via the Pierre Monteux Edition from RCA. A substantial selection of Monteux&#x27;s live broadcasts on &quot;The Standard Hour&quot; have been released by the Music &amp; Arts label.

Enrique Jordá made several stereo recordings for RCA in 1957 and 1958, and an album for CRI in 1962. Jorda&#x27;s recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s second piano concerto, with pianist Alexander Brailowsky was in the catalogue for many years. The recording of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot; with pianist Arthur Rubinstein has remained available.

Commercial recordings resumed in June 1972 with Seiji Ozawa for Deutsche Grammophon in the Flint Center at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. In May 1975 Ozawa recorded Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3 in E-flat&quot; and Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Carnival Overture&quot; and &quot;Symphony No. 9 in E Minor&quot; for Philips. For Deutsche Grammophon, Ozawa and the orchestra recorded William Russo&#x27;s &quot;Three Pieces for Blues Band and Symphony Orchestra&quot; with the Siegel-Schwall Blues Band, and Bernstein&#x27;s Orchestral Dances from &quot;West Side Story&quot;. These recordings featured solo performances from hornist David Krehbiel, concertmaster Stuart Canin, trumpeter Don Reinberg, and violist Detlev Olshausen. Recordings of the SFS under the direction of Edo de Waart, including digital recordings made in Davies Symphony Hall, were released by Philips and Nonesuch. One of de Waart&#x27;s sets of digital recordings was devoted to the four piano concertos of Sergei Rachmaninoff, featuring pianist Zoltán Kocsis. A number of works by American composer John Adams were premiered and recorded by the SFS under de Waart&#x27;s leadership, and Harmonium was also released with Adams conducting.

Soon after the arrival of Herbert Blomstedt, the SFS signed contracts with the British label Decca resulting in 29 CDs released in the U.S. under the London label. Several of the recordings won international awards. Among their recording projects were the complete symphonies of Nielsen and Sibelius, choral works of Brahms, and orchestral works of Richard Strauss and Hindemith. The recordings helped to build the orchestra&#x27;s worldwide reputation as one of the best in the United States.

In 1999, the Symphony hit a new commercial high on the album &quot;S&amp;M&quot; with heavy metal band Metallica. The album reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 2.5 million units and earning platinum status five times over. The track &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; was number one on the Mainstream Rock Charts, 18 on Modern Rock Charts and 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The version of &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; featured on the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

The orchestra returned to RCA Victor when Michael Tilson Thomas became music director. Its first recording of the new contract was extended excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. There were special tributes to three American composers, Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, and George Gershwin, on the occasion of what would have been his 100th birthday. With the RCA label decision to cease from producing new classical recordings, the SFS created its own label, SFS Media, and continued producing its Mahler recording cycle, which was completed in the Fall of 2010.

Recorded live in concert and engineered at Davies Symphony Hall, the audio recordings are released on hybrid SACD and in high-quality digital formats. SFS Media has garnered eight Grammy awards, the most current for its recording of John Adams’ &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; and &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot; and seven for its recordings of MTT and the SFS performing all nine of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s symphonies, the Adagio from the unfinished Tenth Symphony, and his songs for voice, chorus and orchestra. With a slate of new recordings and releases of music by Harrison, Cowell, Varèse, Beethoven, Ives, and Copland, the Orchestra&#x27;s recordings continue to reflect the artistic identity of the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s programming.

In 2014, Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony released a live recording on the SFS Media label of the first-ever concert performances of Leonard Bernstein’s complete score for the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; featuring a Broadway cast including Cheyenne Jackson (Tony), Alexandra Silber (Maria), and the San Francisco Symphony Chorus. The two-disc set includes a 100-page booklet featuring a new interview with MTT, notes from Rita Moreno and Jamie Bernstein, as well as a West Side Story historical timeline, archival photographs, complete lyrics, and rehearsal and performance photos from the June 2013 live performances at Davies Symphony Hall. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Musical Theater Album.

In November 2014 on their SFS Media label, Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony released &quot;Masterpieces in Miniature,&quot; a collection of short orchestral works by Mahler, Debussy, Schubert, Dvořák, Sibelius, Ives, and featuring Pianist Yuja Wang in Litolff’s Scherzo from Concerto symphonique No. 4. The recording was released in conjunction with the celebration of MTT&#x27;s 20th season as music director of the SF Symphony. In May 2015, MTT and the SFS released a live recording of Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5 and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; Fantasy-Overture, followed by another release in August 2015 – a live audio recording of &quot;Absolute Jest&quot; and &quot;Grand Pianola Music&quot; by John Adams. The album contains the first-ever recording of &quot;Absolute Jest&quot;, originally commissioned by the SF Symphony and premiered in 2012 during the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;American Mavericks&quot; festival.

In November 2015, SFS Media released &quot;Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 3 &amp; Mass in C.&quot; In March 2016, it released its album of music by Mason Bates, &quot;Works for Orchestra&quot;, which includes the first recordings of the SF Symphony-commissioned &quot;The B-Sides&quot; and &quot;Liquid Interface&quot;, plus the first CD release of &quot;Alternative Energy&quot;. In October of the same year, the label released &quot;Debussy: Images, Jeux &amp; La plus que lente&quot;, which was subsequently nominated for a 2018 Grammy award in the category of Best Orchestral Performance. In 2017, SFS Media released two albums: &quot;Berg: Three Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, the label&#x27;s first digital-only album, and &quot;Schumann: Symphonies Nos. 1–4&quot;.

==Pops Orchestra==
When the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1911, its first music director, Henry Hadley, began the tradition of &quot;pops&quot; concerts, devoted to lighter classics and special arrangements of music from operettas, musicals, and popular tunes. With the completion of the Civic Auditorium in 1915, most of the &quot;pops&quot; concerts were held in that 10,000-seat auditorium. Eventually, municipal taxes helped to keep ticket prices very affordable.

Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops Orchestra was invited by music director Pierre Monteux to lead the Pops Orchestra, which Fiedler did from 1951 to 1978. Besides the regular concerts in the Civic Auditorium, Fiedler led annual performances at Sigmund Stern Grove, as well as occasional performances at Stanford University&#x27;s Frost Amphitheater and Oakland&#x27;s Paramount Theatre.

While the SF Symphony does not have a specific pops orchestra today, they present pops genre programming periodically throughout the year, particularly in the summer months, with most concerts occurring at Davies Symphony Hall. They also present an annual concert of July 4 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre.

<text>Vienna Philharmonic (VPO; ) is an orchestra that was founded in 1842 and is considered to be one of the finest in the world.

The Vienna Philharmonic is based at the Musikverein in Vienna, Austria. Its members are selected from the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera. Selection involves a lengthy process, with each musician demonstrating their capability for a minimum of three years&#x27; performance for the opera and ballet. After this probationary period, the musician may request an application for a position in the orchestra from the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s board. The Vienna Philharmonic hires no musician over 35 years of age, and has a mandatory retirement age of 65; 30 years of service are required for full pension.

==History==
===Precursors and formation===
Until the 1830s, orchestral performance in Vienna was done by &quot;ad hoc&quot; orchestras, consisting of professional and (often) amateur musicians brought together for specific performances. In 1833, Franz Lachner formed the forerunner of the Vienna Philharmonic, the – an orchestra of professional musicians from the Vienna Court Opera (&quot;Wiener Hofoper&quot;, now the Vienna State Opera); it gave four concerts, each including a Beethoven symphony. The Vienna Philharmonic itself arose nine years later, in 1842, hatched by a group who met regularly at the inn &#x27;Zum Amor&#x27;, including the poet Nikolaus Lenau, newspaper editor August Schmidt, critic Alfred Becker, violinist Karlz Holz, Count Laurecin, and composer Otto Nicolai who was also the principal conductor of a standing orchestra at a Viennese theater. Mosco Carner wrote in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; that &quot;Nicolai was the least enthusiastic about the idea, and had to be persuaded by the others; he conducted the first [concert] on 28 March 1842.&quot; The orchestra was fully independent, consisted of members of the &quot;Hofoper&quot; orchestra, and made all of its decisions by a democratic vote of its members; it had its day-to-day management handled by a democratically elected body, the administrative committee.

Nicolai and the orchestra gave only 11 concerts in the ensuing five years, and when Nicolai left Vienna in 1847, the orchestra nearly folded (&quot;New Grove&quot; notes the disruption caused by the Revolution of 1848 as a hindrance). Between 1854 and 1857, Karl Eckert – the first permanent conductor of the Vienna Court Opera (&quot;Wiener Hofoper&quot;)– led the (associated) Vienna Philharmonic in a few concerts. In 1857, Eckert was made Director of the &quot;Hofoper&quot; – the first musician to have been given the post; in 1860, he conducted four subscription concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic. Since that time,
writes Vienna Philharmonic violinist and president Clemens Hellsberg, &quot;the &#x27;Philharmonic Concerts&#x27; have been staged without interruption.&quot;

===The era of subscription conductors: 1860–1933===
In 1860, the orchestra elected Otto Dessoff to be the permanent conductor. According to Max Kalbeck, the Vienna-based music critic, newspaper editor, and biographer, the fame and excellence of the Vienna Philharmonic resulted from Dessoff&#x27;s &quot;energy and sense of purpose.&quot; Clemens Hellsberg gives specifics, writing that during the Dessoff years, the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s &quot;repertoire was consistently enlarged, important organizational principles (music archives, rules of procedure) were introduced and the orchestra moved to its third new home [in 1870], the newly built Goldener Saal in the Musikverein building in Vienna [in which it still performs], which has proved to be the ideal venue, with its acoustical characteristics influencing the orchestra&#x27;s style and sound.&quot; After fifteen years, in 1875, Dessoff was &quot;pushed out of his position in Vienna through intrigue&quot;, and he left Vienna to become conductor (&quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot;) of the Badische Staatskapelle in Karlsruhe, Germany. In Karlsruhe the next year, he fulfilled the request of his friend Johannes Brahms to conduct the first performance of his Symphony no. 1; in 1873, Brahms had conducted the premiere of his Variations on a Theme by Haydn with Dessoff&#x27;s Vienna Philharmonic.

In 1875, the orchestra chose Hans Richter to take Dessoff&#x27;s place as subscription conductor. He remained until 1898, except for the season 1882/1883, when he was in dispute with the orchestral committee (during this hiatus, Wilhelm Jahn of the Vienna Court Opera served as subscription conductor). Richter led the VPO in the world premieres of Brahms&#x27;s Second Symphony (in 1877), &quot;Tragic Overture&quot; (in 1880), and Symphony no. 3 (in 1883), the Violin Concerto of Tchaikovsky (in 1881), and in 1892 the 8th symphony of Anton Bruckner. It was Richter who in 1881 appointed Arnold Rosé as concertmaster, who was to become Gustav Mahler&#x27;s brother-in-law and was concertmaster until the Anschluss in 1938. In order to be eligible for a pension, Richter intended to remain in his position for 25 years (to 1900), and he might have done so, given that the orchestra unanimously re-elected him in May 1898. But he resigned on 22 September, citing health reasons, although biographer Christopher Fifield argues that the real reasons were that he wanted to tour, and that &quot;he was uneasy as claques in the audience formed in favour of Gustav Mahler&quot; (who was triumphing as director of the &quot;Hofoper&quot;). Richter recommended Mahler or Ferdinand Löwe to the orchestra as his replacement.

In 1898, on 24 September, the orchestra elected Gustav Mahler. (On 30 May 1899, pro-Mahler and pro-Richter factions had a &quot;heated committee meeting&quot;; matters were finally resolved in August when Richter wrote to his supporters &quot;gently refusing their offer&quot;.) Under Mahler&#x27;s baton, the Vienna Philharmonic played abroad for the first time at the 1900 Paris World Exposition. While Mahler had strong supporters in the orchestra, he faced dissension from other orchestral members (an unreconstructed pro-Richter faction plus an anti-Semitic one, according to Jens Malte Fischer), criticism of his re-touchings of Beethoven, and arguments with the orchestra and over new policies he imposed; ultimately, &quot;his working relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic continued to be fueled by resentment and broke down completely in November 1900&quot;. He resigned on 1 April 1901, citing health concerns as a pretext, like Richter, but continuing to conduct actively elsewhere (he remained director of the associated &quot;Hofoper&quot; until 1907).

In 1901, Joseph Hellmesberger, Jr. briefly took his place; he remained only until 1903.
In 1908, after an interval with no official subscription conductor, the orchestra elected Felix Weingartner to the post; he was to remain in it until 1927, and conducted at least 432 concerts with them in total, including the VPO&#x27;s first tour of South America in 1922. Weingartner&#x27;s interpretive stance was opposite to Mahler&#x27;s (Mahler employed marked tempo fluctuations in Beethoven, whereas Weingartner decried &quot;tempo rubato conductors&quot;); but like Mahler, he considered himself primarily a composer, and between 1910 and 1923 led the orchestra in at least one piece of his own music per season. He was most renowned for his Beethoven – he programmed at least two symphonies per season, and complete cycles in 1916/17 and 1926/27. It was Weingartner who led the orchestra&#x27;s first concert devoted to entirely to the music of Johann Strauss, Jr. (for the composer&#x27;s centennial), on 25 October 1925.

In 1927, when Weingartner resigned, the orchestra elected Wilhelm Furtwängler. He resigned at the end of the 1929/30 season because of increased professional demands in Berlin.

In 1930, the orchestra chose Clemens Krauss for the position. At the Salzburg Festival in the summers of 1929–33 he led the orchestra in an annual Strauss waltz concert, the forerunners of the New Year&#x27;s Day concerts he was later to institute. Krauss left in 1933 to become director of the Berlin State Opera (after Erich Kleiber resigned that position to protest Nazi rule).

===1933 through 1945===
Since 1933, the orchestra has had no single subscription conductor, but according to &quot;New Grove&quot; (vol. 19, p. 723), &quot;between 1933 and 1938, Bruno Walter and Wilhelm Furtwängler shared the Philharmonic concerts between them, and during the Nazi period Furtwängler was the permanent conductor&quot;; by contrast, the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s website history says, &quot;Furtwängler was in actuality the main conductor of the orchestra from 1933 to 1945, and again from 1947 to 1954.&quot; In support of &quot;New Grove&quot;″s assertion of Walter&#x27;s role, it might be noted that he made Vienna his home from 1933 until 1938 (after being driven from Germany by the Third Reich), was Artistic Director of the Vienna State Opera from 1936 until 1938, and conducted the Vienna Philharmonic frequently, making a number of major recordings with the orchestra (including Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; act 1 and parts of act 2, the first recordings of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; and of his Symphony No. 9, and numerous symphonic recordings) and taking the orchestra on tour to England and France in 1935. In support of the VPO website, Otto Strasser (who played in the orchestra from 1922 until 1967 and was the VPO chairman who procured Furtwängler&#x27;s wartime services) said, Furtwängler &quot;influenced us so much that we became the true &#x27;Furtwängler orchestra&#x27;.&quot;

Other conductors who worked with the orchestra in the mid-1930s before the Anschluss included Arturo Toscanini, Weingartner, Hans Knappertsbusch, Otto Klemperer, Adrian Boult, Victor de Sabata and George Szell. Walter conducted the last concert before the Anschluss, on 20 February 1938, featuring the world premiere of Egon Wellesz&#x27;s &quot;Prosperos Beschwörungen&quot; and Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 4.

After the Anschluss and during World War II the roster included Furtwängler, Krauss, Knappertsbusch, Willem Mengelberg, and Karl Böhm. The orchestra&#x27;s history during this period has been a topic of ongoing discussion and research, including a large amount commissioned by the orchestra (see below, &quot;#Period under National Socialism&quot;).

===Post-World War II era to present===
In 1946, when these conductors were undergoing denazification – successfully in the case of Furtwängler, unsuccessfully in the case of Mengelberg – the orchestra was led primarily by conductors untainted by Nazi association, including Josef Krips, Erich Leinsdorf, Volkmar Andreae, Paul Paray, and Charles Munch. An exception was Herbert von Karajan, who made his debut with the orchestra with two concerts in January, but was unable to conduct a third scheduled concert when occupying authorities required him to undergo denazification (his tribunal in Vienna was in February, 1947). After clearance, he resumed conducting in late 1947 and developed a significant association with the orchestra (more below).

In 1947, Bruno Walter reunited with the orchestra as conductor when it appeared at the first Edinburgh Festival. They performed a single work, Mahler&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;.

In the postwar era, dozens of the world&#x27;s best-known conductors have led the orchestra. Among them were not only Walter, Furtwängler, Knappertsbusch, Krauss, Szell, Klemperer, and Krips, but also John Barbirolli, Carlo Maria Giulini, Erich Kleiber, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Fritz Reiner, Georg Solti, Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Muti, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Lorin Maazel, Mariss Jansons, Daniel Barenboim, Gustavo Dudamel, Roberto Carnevale, Valery Gergiev and Franz Welser-Möst. The orchestra made their first US tour in 1956 under the batons of Carl Schuricht and André Cluytens. Three conductors were given honorific titles by the orchestra in the later 20th century: Karajan and Karl Böhm, who were made Honorary Conductors, and Leonard Bernstein, who was made an Honorary Member of the orchestra. Pierre Boulez, who had conducted the orchestra often, was made an Honorary Member in 2007. Another significant relationship was with the famously reclusive conductor Carlos Kleiber, who appeared with the orchestra first in 1974 and last in 1994, his longest association with any ensemble, even if it included only 30 appearances; Clemens Hellsberg wrote of the &quot;contrast between those dry numbers and the defining experience which each encounter with this brilliant interpreter represented.&quot;
Finally, István Kertész&#x27; gramophone recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic during the 1960s and the 1970s represent a highlight in the orchestra&#x27;s history.

On 7 May 2000, the orchestra performed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony at the site of the concentration camp at Mauthausen, Austria, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of its liberation. Simon Rattle conducted, and soloists were Ruth Ziesak, Angelika Kirchschlager, Vinson Cole, and Thomas Quasthoff; all artists and the orchestra performed without fee and without applause at the end. The symphony was preceded by recitation of the Kaddish, the prayer of mourning, by Paul Chaim Eisenberg, the Chief Rabbi of Austria, and the funeral prayer El male rachamim sung by Shmuel Barzilai, the chief cantor of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien (Viennese Israelite Community), accompanied by members of the orchestra and the Wiener Singverein; the orchestral arrangement was by Erich Schagerl, a violinist in the orchestra.

In 2005 the orchestra was named Goodwill Ambassador of the World Health Organization. In 2013, Clemens Hellsberg received the Marietta and Friedrich Torberg Medal from the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien (Viennese Israelite Community).

Each New Year&#x27;s Day since 1 January 1941, the VPO has sponsored the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concerts, dedicated to the music of the Strauss family composers, and particularly that of Johann Strauss II; the first such concert was given on 31 December 1939 by Clemens Krauss (see below, &quot;#Period under National Socialism&quot;), and led subsequent concerts on New Year&#x27;s Day from 1941 until 1945. The postwar series of concerts was inaugurated in 1946 by Josef Krips. They were led by Krauss, then by concertmaster Willi Boskovsky from 1955 to 1979, and since 1987 have been led by a variety of leading conductors invited by the orchestra.

== Critical reputation and popularity ==
In 2006, the Vienna Philharmonic was chosen as Europe&#x27;s finest orchestra in a survey of seven leading trade publications, two radio stations and a daily newspaper. In 2008, an international jury of music critics polled by the British &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine ranked it third in the world (after the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic).

Subscription ticket demand for the Vienna Philharmonic at their home, Musikverein, is currently listed on the orchestra&#x27;s website as being subject to a waiting list—six years for weekday concert subscriptions, and thirteen years for weekend subscriptions. Casual tickets however, are available in small numbers and can be bought via links from the official website, to various ticket resellers.
The orchestra has been the motive of one of the world&#x27;s most famous bullion coins: the Vienna Philharmonic coin. The coin is struck in pure gold, 999.9 fine (24 carats). It is issued every year, in four different face values, sizes and weights. It is used as an investment product, although it finishes almost always in the hands of collectors. According to the World Gold Council, this coin was the best selling gold coin in 1992, 1995 and 1996 worldwide.

In 2006 Austrian Airlines was outfitted with a livery featuring the gold coin and logo of the Wiener Philharmoniker. The long-range Airbus A340 aircraft was flown primarily between Vienna and Tokyo for approximately one year serving as promotional tool for the orchestra and the Philharmoniker, 24 karat gold coin issued by the Austrian Mint.

The orchestra has had an annual ball called the Vienna Philharmonic Ball since 1924, when Richard Strauss began his conducting association.

== Business structure ==
The Vienna Philharmonic operates under what it calls &quot;Democratic Self-Administration&quot;. Whereas many orchestras are run under a more corporate model with musicians as labor that works for the orchestra management, the ruling body of the Vienna Philharmonic organization is the full orchestra membership. Day-to-day decisions are delegated to the twelve elected members of the administrative committee.

The Vienna Philharmonic has been officially recognised as an incorporated association since 1908.

== Sound, instruments, and playing style ==
The Vienna Philharmonic was already observed to have a characteristic sound by the turn of the last century. Bruno Walter told an interviewer on Austrian Radio in 1960 that hearing the Vienna Philharmonic for the first time in 1897 was for Walter (in Hurwitz&#x27;s translation): &quot;...a life-altering impression, because it was this sound of the orchestra that I have experienced ever since – I have the feeling: this is the way an orchestra should sound; the way it should play. I had never heard the beauty, this calmness of the sound, that sort of glissando, the manner of vibrato, the string sound, the blend of woodwinds with the strings, with the brass, the balance of the brass in combination with the percussion contributing together to the overall sonority of the orchestra. For me, this impression was definitive, and now I would like to anticipate a point and tell you this: this sound, 1897, is the same today.&quot;.

The VPO&#x27;s sound has been attributed in part to the VPO&#x27;s instruments and in part to its playing styles.

Instruments: At least a part of the characteristic sound of the Vienna Philharmonic has been attributed to the use of instruments that differ from those used by other major orchestras:
* The orchestra&#x27;s standard tuning pitch is A4=443 Hz; the tuning standard for A4 is generally considered at a frequency of 440 Hz.
* The VPO uses the German-system (Öhler system) clarinet. By comparison, the Boehm-system clarinet is favored in non-German-speaking countries.
* Likewise, while the Heckel bassoon is now the norm for most orchestras around the world, in the VPO the Heckel bassoon is played almost completely without vibrato.
* The rotary-valve trumpet is used, but unlike most other Germanic orchestras the VPO prefers smaller bore rotary trumpets from makers such as Heckel and Lechner.
* Like its counterparts elsewhere in Austria, Germany and Russia, the VPO favors the F bass and B-flat contrabass rotary-valve tuba, whereas the CC piston-valve tuba is preferred in most American and some British orchestras.
* The trombone has a somewhat smaller bore, but this is also true of the trombone used in many German orchestras.
* The timpani have the Schnellar System in which the kettle pushed up as opposed to the head being pulled down. Hans Schnellar was the timpanist in the early 20th century, and personally made these drums. They also use goat skin heads as opposed to calf skin or plastic heads, and manual tuning as opposed to pedal tuning.
* The double bass retains the traditional theater-placement in a row behind the brass. The VPO uses 4- as well as 5-string double basses. The bow is held in a variation of the German bow grip, in which the index and middle fingers are held above the stick so that only they (and not the thumb) apply pressure to the string.
* The Wiener oboe is, along with the Vienna horn (see below), perhaps the most distinctive member of the VPO instrumentarium. It has a special bore, reed and fingering-system and is very different from the otherwise internationally used Conservatoire (French) oboe.
* The Vienna horn in F uses a &quot;Pumpenventil&quot;. Unlike the rotary valves used on most other orchestral horns, the Pumpenventil contributes to the liquid legato that is one of the trademarks of the Viennese school. The bore of the Vienna horn is also smaller than more modern horns—actually very close to that of the valveless natural horn. The Vienna horn has remained virtually unchanged since the mid-nineteenth century—as a result it is arguably well-suited to the Classical and Romantic repertoire at the core of the VPO&#x27;s programming.

On the other hand, at least two instruments or instrument families are like those in other orchestras. According to the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s website, &quot;the flute is largely the same as the conventional Böhm flute, which is widely used all over the world. However, it did not replace the wooden flute in Vienna until the 1920s.&quot; Also, the Viennese string sound should not be attributed to unique attributes of the instruments, according to the VPO, which writes on its website, &quot;There can be no doubt that the Viennese string instruments themselves, unlike the winds, are not of prime importance in producing the orchestra&#x27;s unique sound. With a few exceptions, the quality of the instruments of the string section is not particularly outstanding.&quot;. To be sure, the instruments are of high quality; Austria&#x27;s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank currently loans four violins made by Antonio Stradivari to the VPO.

The VPO&#x27;s instruments and their characteristic tone-colors have been the subject of extensive scientific studies by Gregor Widholm and others at the Institute of Music Acoustics (&quot;Wiener Klangstil&quot; – Viennese Tone Style) at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. The Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s website generalizes about its woodwind and brass instruments in terms of overtones: &quot;With the exception of the flute and, to some extent, the bassoon, the typical differences in tone of Viennese instruments can be described as follows: They are richer in overtones, i.e., the sound tone is brighter.&quot;

 Playing style: The orchestra in 2004 began offering a summer institute, the International Orchestra Institute Attergau for Wiener Klangstil, to instruct other musicians in the Viennese playing style.

The 1960 Walter interview indicates that the strings&#x27; vibrato (as of 1960) was audibly like that of 1897, and also quotes music critic Richard Specht in 1919 writing of &quot;something inimitable in the vibrato and the passionate virtuosity of the violins&quot; of the Vienna Philharmonic.

As for other instruments, using early recordings, the musicologist Robert Philip has documented some changes in how VPO players used vibrato during the mid-20th century, although he also notes differences between the VPO and other orchestras of the era. As was typical of the era, the pre-1945 flutes show &quot;very little vibrato&quot; in recordings &quot;until after World War II... even in the long solo in Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; the flautist [under Bruno Walter in 1936]... plays almost without vibrato&quot; except on &quot;a few long notes [with] a delicate medium-speed vibrato&quot;; but &quot;by the late 1940s the flautists... had adopted a gentle medium-speed vibrato&quot;. The oboes before the 1940s show &quot;little or no vibrato,&quot; but by the late 1940s &quot;the principal oboist had adopted a very delicate fast vibrato ... but he uses it very sparingly.&quot; (The cor anglais is, he notes, even in the late 1940s still played &quot;without any vibrato&quot;). The bassoonists &quot;show virtually no bassoon vibrato up to the 1950s&quot;.

The Vienna Philharmonic website states that today, with the flute, &quot;as with all [wind] instruments in the Viennese classics, vibrato is used very sparingly.&quot;

Philips notes that by 1931 the Vienna Philharmonic strings were reported to use uniform bowing, which was still unusual in Britain. As for portamento – sliding audibly from one note to another, a prominent effect among pre-war string players – the VPO strings&#x27; sliding in the early 1930s &quot;sounds more deliberately expressive, and less a matter of routine, than that of British orchestras. This is partly because of the firmer dynamic shaping of the melodic line, partly because of the warmer and fuller string tone.&quot; Further, he hears &quot;strong evidence of a free approach to portamento&quot; – that is, of &quot;different players shifting at different points&quot; within the same phrase (which, he shows, was standard internationally in pre-war orchestral playing). He notices a reduced use of portamento in recordings from 1931 to 1936, but in 1936 also notes that the VPO strings still make &quot;conspicuous&quot; use of portamento in Mozart, where British orchestras by this time were using less of it in Classical-era composers. Finally, he hears a &quot;trend towards greater subtlety in the use of portamento&quot; post-war, with &quot;only discreet portamento&quot; in a recording under Herbert von Karajan in 1949. One useful indication of approaches to vibrato and portamento is the body of recordings left by concertmaster Arnold Rose and his quartet. While not identical in approach to the earlier German playing of Joseph Joachim, they are notably free from the vibrato that became routine in mid 20th-century, and of an older style both in rhythm and use of slides. (E.g., Beethoven Op 131 and the 5th Brahms Hungarian Dance.)

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept female musicians to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world&#x27;s top five by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 2008, the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic, which did so in 1982.) As late as February 1996, first flutist Dieter Flury told Westdeutscher Rundfunk that accepting women would be &quot;gambling with the emotional unity () that this organism currently has&quot;. In April 1996, the orchestra&#x27;s press secretary wrote that &quot;compensating for the expected leaves of absence&quot; of maternity leave was a problem that they &quot;do not yet see how to get a grip on&quot; in ongoing consultations with the Women&#x27;s Ministry of the Austrian Republic about women in the orchestra.

In February 1997, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima told the orchestra at an awards ceremony that there was &quot;creative potential in the other half of humanity and this should be used.&quot; The orchestra, wrote &quot;The New York Times,&quot; was &quot;facing protests during a [US] tour&quot; by the National Organization for Women and International Alliance for Women in Music. Finally, &quot;after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist.&quot; According to Lelkes, who had played as an adjunct with the orchestra since 1974, the orchestra was &quot;terribly frightened by the possibility of demonstrations by American women&#x27;s rights activists. I believe that this pressure was decisive&quot;; she adds that the orchestra voted to accept her not unanimously but &quot;by a large majority&quot;, and that the vote showed generational differences, with retired members voting against her but &quot;quite a few [younger players] got together and even got organized and said this can&#x27;t go on any longer. The younger generation stood up for me...&quot;

As of 2013, the orchestra had six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra&#x27;s concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position. In January 2005, Australian conductor Simone Young became the first woman to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic. In late December 2012, the issue of gender balance remained a concern in Austria: Austrian Radio ORF noted that women still made up just 6% of the orchestra&#x27;s membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the London Symphony Orchestra, and 36% in the New York Philharmonic; it acknowledged progress but raised concerns that it was too slow. On the other hand, it quoted VPO president Clemens Hellsberg as saying that the VPO now uses completely blind auditions, simply chooses &quot;the best we get&quot;, implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions. (The Vienna Philharmonic will hire no musician over 35 years of age, and has a mandatory retirement age of 65; 30 years of service are required to receive a full pension.) As of December 2019, there were 15 female members.

There have also been claims that the orchestra has not always accepted members who are visibly members of ethnic minorities. In 1970, Otto Strasser, the former chairman of the Vienna Philharmonic, wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I hold it incorrect that today the applicants play behind a screen; an arrangement that was brought in after the Second World War in order to assure objective judgments. I continuously fought against it... because I am convinced that to the artist also belongs the person, that one must not only hear, but also see, in order to judge him in his entire personality. [...] Even a grotesque situation that played itself out after my retirement was not able to change the situation. An applicant qualified himself as the best, and as the screen was raised, there stood a Japanese before the stunned jury. He was, however, not engaged, because his face did not fit with the &quot;Pizzicato-Polka&quot; of the New Year&#x27;s Concert.&quot; In 1996, flautist Flury still expressed the view that &quot;The soul does not let itself be separated from the cultural roots that we have here in central Europe.&quot;

In 2001 a violinist who was half-Asian became a member. The full list of musicians, men and women, including those playing with the Vienna Philharmonic but who are not members of the VPO association, is accessible on the website of the Vienna Philharmonic.

===Period under National Socialism===
The Vienna Philharmonic was for decades accused of withholding or suppressing information about its connections in the mid-20th century to the Nazi Party. The first orchestral representative to discuss the issue was Clemens Hellsberg (also trained as a musicologist), when he wrote the orchestra&#x27;s official sesquicentennial history, &quot;Demokratie der Könige&quot; &quot;(Democracy of Kings)&quot;. In it he determined that at the end of World War II 47% of orchestra members belonged to the Nazi Party or affiliates (the total number is now known to be 49%, 60 for 123 in 1942), that upon the Anschluss thirteen Jewish players were fired, that six of them were murdered (the number is now known to be seven), and &quot;that the VPO once gave a concert in an SS barracks.&quot; But more remained to be investigated and made public, and access to relevant material in the orchestra&#x27;s archives was highly restricted. Hellsberg, who became the orchestra&#x27;s president in 1997, did not have full access to the archives until 2000/2001, and the historian Fritz Trümpi reports that when he began researching the orchestra&#x27;s Third Reich activities in 2003 and requested access, he &quot;was rebuffed by the management of the orchestra with a firm &#x27;no&#x27; ... the idea that external researchers could come and root around in their archive was long considered taboo.&quot; Trümpi was granted access in 2007, but other researchers reported continued exclusion, such as Bernadette Mayrhoffer in 2008; the Austrian newspaper reported in 2008 (in Sebastian Huebel&#x27;s summary) that &quot;scholars have had difficulties investigating the Vienna Philharmonic as they were not allowed access to the archives, or sources were delivered reluctantly and with timely delays.&quot;

The 2013 New Year&#x27;s Day concert evoked critical discussion of the issue in the Austrian press and from Austrian parliamentarian Harald Walser. Shortly thereafter, Hellsberg commissioned an independent panel of three historians – Trümpi, his dissertation adviser Oliver Rathkolb (a professor at the University of Vienna), and Bernadette Mayrhofer – to fully investigate the orchestra&#x27;s Third Reich activities and &quot;in the spirit of transparency&quot; (according to the orchestra&#x27;s Facebook feed) publish the results on the orchestra&#x27;s website. The panel was given unrestricted access to the archives. Rathkolb told an interviewer, &quot;We were able to find new documents in a cellar, which normally contained archived music. It was an orchestra member who directed us to it.&quot;

On 10 March 2013—a date chosen to precede 12 March, the 75th anniversary of the Third Reich&#x27;s union with Austria, the Anschluss—the panel published its findings in a set of reports posted on the orchestra&#x27;s website. Among the panel&#x27;s findings are:
* Before the Anschluss in the mid-1930s, 20% of the members of the orchestra belonged to the Nazi party. Former Vienna State Opera Secretary-General Ioan Holender notes that these members joined out of conviction, rather than for professional advancement, since party membership was illegal in Austria at the time.
* By the orchestra&#x27;s centennial in 1942, 60 of the 123 active [Vienna Philharmonic] orchestral musicians had become members of the [Nazi Party] – that is, 48.8%. Two were members of the SS. By contrast, in the other major German-speaking orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, barely 20% were party members. For further comparison, party membership in Austria as a whole was 10%.
* The thirteen Jewish members of the orchestra were expelled by the National Socialists upon the Anschluss. Six of them escaped into exile; the other seven were killed – five in concentration camps, and two while still in Vienna as a direct result of attempted deportation and persecution.
* Rathkolb writes, &quot;A total of nine orchestra members were driven into exile [including the six Jewish members noted above] ... The eleven remaining orchestra members who were married to Jewish women or stigmatized as &#x27;half-Jewish&#x27; lived under the constant threat of revocation of their &#x27;special permission.&#x27; ... It was only the intervention of Wilhelm Furtwängler and other individuals which ... with two exceptions, saved [these 11 remaining] &#x27;half-Jews&#x27; and &#x27;related&#x27; from dismissal from the Vienna State Opera Orchestra.&quot;
* Of the musicians hired to replace the 13 dismissed Jewish members, about half were Nazi Party members, Rathkolb says.
* The panel revealed in new detail how the New Year&#x27;s concerts began during the Nazi era. The first concert, given on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1939, was proposed by conductor Clemens Krauss and enthusiastically approved by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels because it served the Reich&#x27;s purposes of &quot;propaganda through entertainment.&quot; (The concert was moved to New Year&#x27;s Day for the concerts held from 1941 to 1945; it was revived in 1947 when it was conducted by Josef Krips, who had not been able to conduct during the war years because he was half-Jewish.) Further, the profits from the 1939 concert were &quot;donated entirely to the national-socialistic fund-raising campaign &#x27;Kriegswinterhilfswerk&#x27; The reports also note that Goebbels privately decided to ignore information about the partial Jewish ancestry of the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I&#x27;s grandfather was Jewish by birth) partly because &quot;it was not proven&quot; and partly because he did &quot;not want to undermine the entire German cultural heritage.&quot;
* At the war&#x27;s end in 1945, the orchestra expelled ten of its members for Nazi activity; two were re-hired in ensuing years. One of them, the trumpeter Helmut Wobisch, had joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and the SS in 1934 and served as a spy for the Gestapo during the war. He was rehired by the orchestra in 1950 and appointed executive director of the orchestra in 1953, remaining in that position until 1967.
* The panel determined that it was Wobisch who in 1966 privately gave a replacement copy of the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;ring of honor&quot; to Baldur von Schirach after the latter&#x27;s release from Spandau Prison. As a result of the panel&#x27;s reports, the Carinthian Summer Festival in Klagenfurt, Austria, cancelled its annual concert in honor of Wobisch (who was co-founder of the festival).
* The panel details how the orchestra gave &quot;a great number of honorific awards… to Nazi potentates, including Arthur Seyss-Inquart [who was sentenced to death for his crimes against humanity in 1946] and Baldur von Schirach [who was sentenced to 20 years in Spandau Prison for his].&quot; The orchestra also planned internally to give its highest award (the Nicolai Gold Medal) to Adolf Hitler in 1942, but there is no evidence that this award was ever given. (Rathkolb has told the press that Hellsberg &quot;has asked [the orchestra] to revoke the rings of honour to these people.&quot;)

At its annual meeting on 23 October 2013, the orchestra voted to revoke all the honors bestowed to Nazi officials; the members voted after hearing a presentation by Rathkolb of the panel&#x27;s findings. Clemens Helmsberg is quoted in the New York Times as saying that after Rathkolb&#x27;s presentation, the orchestra needed no further discussion before revoking the honors since &quot;it was such an obvious thing.&quot;

== Subscription conductors (1842–1933) ==
The Vienna Philharmonic has never had principal conductors. Each year they chose an artist to conduct all concerts of the respective season at Vienna&#x27;s Musikverein. These conductors were called &quot;Abonnementdirigenten&quot; (&quot;subscription conductors&quot;) as they were to conduct all the concerts included in the Philharmonic&#x27;s subscription at the Musikverein. Some of these annual hirings were renewed for many years, others lasted only for a few years. At the same time the Vienna Philharmonic also worked with other conductors, e. g. at the Salzburg Festival, for recordings or special occasions. With the widening of the Philharmonic&#x27;s activities the orchestra decided to abandon this system in 1933. From then on there were only guest conductors hired for each concert, both in Vienna and elsewhere.

<text>The Constitution of 1782 was a group of Acts passed by the Parliament of Ireland and the Parliament of Great Britain in 1782–83 which increased the legislative and judicial independence of the Kingdom of Ireland by reducing the ability of the Kingdom of Great Britain to make laws and hear court cases relating to Ireland. These changes were promoted, under the name legislative independence, by the Irish Patriot Party, a loose alliance with Henry Grattan as its leading orator. The Parliament of Ireland as it existed after 1782 is often called Grattan&#x27;s Parliament in his honour. The constitution did not create a responsible executive, as the Dublin Castle administration remained under the control of a Lord Lieutenant acting as a representative of the British government.

Under the terms of Poynings&#x27; Law of 1495, no law could be passed by the Parliament of Ireland that was not first approved by the Privy Council of England. In 1719, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the Declaratory Act which further restricted Irish legal independence by declaring that the British Parliament could directly pass laws in Ireland and that the British House of Lords was the highest court of appeal for Ireland. 

These laws gave the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the representative in Ireland of the British government, control over the agenda of the Irish Parliament and authority to restrict its ability to legislate contrary to the objectives of the British government in London.

From 1782, Grattan – the leader of the Patriot Party – led a series of legal changes which produced a period of novel legislative freedom. The main act was the Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782.

The British Rockingham Ministry had conceded the act in fear of an American-style revolt. This concession was followed by the Irish Appeals Act 1783, commonly known as the Renunciation Act. By the terms of this act, the Parliament of Great Britain renounced all right to legislate for Ireland, and declared that no appeal from the decision of any court in Ireland could be heard in any court in Great Britain.

Grattan&#x27;s Parliament also achieved greater control over the Royal Irish Army.

The new constitutional arrangements proved short-lived in consequence of the 1798 uprising by the United Irishmen. By the Acts of Union the Parliament of Ireland was abolished. The Kingdom of Ireland was absorbed into the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with effect from 1 January 1801.

<text>Henry Grattan (3 July 1746 – 4 June 1820) was an Irish politician and lawyer who campaigned for legislative freedom for the Irish Parliament in the late 18th century from Britain. He was a Member of the Irish Parliament (MP) from 1775 to 1801 and a Member of Parliament (MP) in Westminster from 1805 to 1820. He has been described as a superb orator and a romantic. With generous enthusiasm he demanded that Ireland should be granted its rightful status, that of an independent nation, though he always insisted that Ireland would remain linked to Great Britain by a common crown and by sharing a common political tradition.

Grattan opposed the Act of Union 1800 that merged the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain, but later sat as a member of the united Parliament in London.

==Early life==
Henry Grattan was born in Fishamble Street, Dublin, and baptised in the nearby church of St. John the Evangelist in 1746. A member of the Anglo-Irish elite of Protestant background, Grattan was the son of James Grattan MP, of Belcamp Park, County Dublin and Mary, youngest daughter of Thomas Marlay, Attorney-General of Ireland, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and finally Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench and his wife Anne de Laune. Grattan attended Drogheda Grammar School and then went on to become a distinguished student at Trinity College Dublin, where he began a lifelong study of classical literature, and was especially interested in the great orators of antiquity. Like his friend Henry Flood, Grattan worked on his natural eloquence and oratory skills by studying models such as Bolingbroke and Junius. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, he spent some years in London, and he visited France in 1771. He attended debates in the British House of Commons regularly, and also enjoyed visiting the celebrated Grecian Coffee House in Devereux Court, where he met Oliver Goldsmith. It was in London where he formed his lifelong friendship with Robert Day, later a judge of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench.

After studying at the Middle Temple, London and then King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin, he was called to the Irish Bar in 1772. He never seriously practised law but was drawn to politics, influenced by Flood. He entered the Irish Parliament for Charlemont in 1775, sponsored by Lord Charlemont, just as Flood had damaged his credibility by accepting office. Grattan quickly superseded Flood in the leadership of the national party, not least because his oratorical powers were unsurpassed among his contemporaries.

==In the Irish Parliament==
Catholics, who made up the majority of the Irish population, were completely excluded from public life at this time under the Penal Laws, in force in Ireland from 1691 until the early 1780s. The Presbyterians of Ulster had a lot more power as they were primarily of British ancestry, although most of the penal laws also affected them. Power was held by the King&#x27;s Viceroy and by a small element, the Anglo-Irish families loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland who owned most of the land.

The politicians of the national party now fought for the Irish Parliament, not with the intention of liberating the Catholic majority, but to set the Irish parliament free from constitutional bondage to the British Privy Council. By virtue of Poynings&#x27; Law, a statute of King Henry VII of England, all proposed Irish legislation had to be submitted to the Privy Council for its approval under the Great Seal of England before being passed by the Irish Parliament. A bill so approved might be accepted or rejected, but not amended. More recent British Acts had further emphasised the complete dependence of the Irish parliament, and the appellate jurisdiction of the Irish House of Lords had also been annulled. Moreover, the British Houses claimed and exercised the power to legislate directly for Ireland without even the nominal concurrence of the parliament in Dublin. This was the constitution which William Molyneux and Swift had denounced, which Flood had attacked, and which Grattan was to destroy, becoming leaders of the Patriot movement.

Calls for the legislative independence of Ireland at the Irish Volunteer Convention at Dungannon, County Tyrone, greatly influenced the decision of the government in 1782 to make concessions. It was through ranks of Volunteers drawn up outside the Irish Parliament in Dublin that Grattan passed on 16 April 1782, amidst unparalleled popular enthusiasm, to move a declaration of the independence of the Irish parliament. A posthumous publication of Grattan&#x27;s speeches which were revised by Grattan himself contains his speech from this day which became famous in Irish political history: &quot;I found Ireland on her knees,&quot; Grattan exclaimed, &quot;I watched over her with a paternal solicitude; I have traced her progress from injuries to arms, and from arms to liberty. Spirit of Swift, spirit of Molyneux, your genius has prevailed! Ireland is now a nation!&quot; However, the parliamentary register for that sitting contains no record of these lines meaning Grattan most likely altered the speech in later years. After a month of negotiation, the claims of Ireland were conceded. The gratitude of his countrymen to Grattan was shown by a parliamentary grant of £100,000, which had to be reduced by half before he would accept it.

Grattan then asked for the British House of Commons to reconfirm the British Government&#x27;s decision, and on 22 January 1783, the final Act was passed by parliament in London, including the text:
 In September of the same year, Grattan became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. He was expelled in 1798, but was re-admitted on 9 August 1806.

In Dublin, he was a member of Daly&#x27;s Club.

==Grattan&#x27;s Parliament==


One of the first acts of Grattan&#x27;s Parliament was to prove its loyalty to the constitution by passing a vote for the support of 20,000 sailors for the Royal Navy. Grattan was loyal to the Crown and the British connection. He was, however, anxious to achieve moderate parliamentary reform, and, unlike Flood, he favoured Catholic Emancipation. It was evident that without reform, the Irish House of Commons would not be able to make much use of its newly won legislative independence. Though now free from Westminster constitutional control, it was still subject to the influence of corruption, which the British government had wielded through the British and Irish borough owners, known as the &quot;undertakers&quot;, or more directly through the great executive offices. Grattan&#x27;s Parliament had no control over the Irish executive. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and his chief secretary continued to be appointed by the British ministers; their tenure of office depended on the vicissitudes of English, not Irish, party politics; the royal prerogative was exercised in Ireland on the advice of British ministers.

The Irish House of Commons was unrepresentative of the Irish people at a time when democracy was rare in Europe. The majority were excluded, who were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians; two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons were returned by small boroughs at the disposal of individual patrons, whose support was bought by the distribution of peerages and pensions. It was to give stability and true independence to the new constitution that Grattan pressed for reform.

Having quarrelled with Flood over simple repeal, Grattan also differed from him on the question of maintaining the Volunteer Convention. Drawing the attention of the House to &quot;the alarming measure of drilling the lowest classes of the populace&quot;, Grattan implied that reformers had a duty to protect the prerogatives of property even as they protested its abuses. Better that those who had been &quot;respectable&quot; as the armed &quot;property of the nation&quot; should retire than run the risks of an &quot;armed beggary&quot;. (Writing a generation later, Thomas MacNevin proposed that Grattan&#x27;s judgement marked &quot;the transition point&quot;, when &quot;composed of a different class of men, and ruled by politicians with very different views&quot;, the rump of the Volunteer movement entered upon &quot;a career which terminated only in the establishment of the United Irishmen&quot;).

Grattan also opposed the policy of protective duties in favour of Pitt&#x27;s commercial propositions in 1785 for establishing Free Trade between Great Britain and Ireland. This, however, had to be abandoned owing to the hostility of the British mercantile classes. Grattan supported the government for a time after 1782, and spoke and voted for the repressive legislation that followed the Whiteboy violence in 1785; but as the years passed and without Pitt&#x27;s personal favour towards parliamentary reform resulting in legislation, he gravitated towards the opposition, agitated for commutation of tithes in Ireland, and supported the Whigs on the regency question in 1788. In 1790, Grattan was elected for Dublin City, a seat he held until 1798.

In 1792–93, he succeeded in carrying the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793, conferring the franchise on Catholics; in 1794, in conjunction with William Ponsonby, he introduced a reform bill which was even milder than Flood&#x27;s bill of 1783. He was as anxious as Flood had been to retain the legislative power in the hands of men of property. Grattan had a strong conviction that while Ireland could best be governed by the Irish, democracy in Ireland would inevitably turn to plunder and anarchy. At the same time, he wished to open membership of the House of Commons to Catholic men of property, a proposal that was the corollary of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793.

The defeat of Grattan&#x27;s mild proposals helped to promote more extreme opinions, which, under growing influence from France, were now making inroads in Ireland. The Catholic question had come to the fore, and when a powerful section of the Whigs joined Pitt&#x27;s ministry in 1794, Lord Fitzwilliam, who shared Grattan&#x27;s views, was appointed Viceroy, expectations for further Catholic relief were raised. That may have been Pitt&#x27;s intention, but it is not clear how far Lord Fitzwilliam had been authorised to pledge the government. Fitzwilliam privately asked Grattan to propose a bill for Catholic emancipation, promising British government support. It appeared, however, that the Viceroy had either misunderstood or exceeded his instructions; on 19 February 1795, Fitzwilliam was recalled. In the outburst of indignation, followed by increasing disaffection which this produced in Ireland, Grattan acted with conspicuous moderation and loyalty. This won him warm acknowledgements from a member of the British cabinet.

That cabinet, however, doubtless influenced by the wishes of the King, to whom Emancipation was anathema, was now determined to firmly resist the Catholic demands, with the result that Ireland rapidly drifted towards rebellion. Grattan warned the government in a series of masterly speeches of the lawless condition to which Ireland had been driven. He could now count on no more than 40 followers in the Irish House of Commons, and his words were unheeded. In protest, he retired from parliament in May 1797, and departed from his customary moderation by attacking the government in his 24-page &quot;Letter to the Citizens of Dublin&quot;, in which he said it was now &quot;absolutely necessary to reform the state&quot; as the people no longer had confidence in Parliament.

==Rebellion and Union==
At this time antipathy towards the Anglican elite in Ireland was such that people of different faiths were ready to combine for common political objects. Thus the Presbyterians of the north, who were mainly republican in sentiment, combined with a section of the Roman Catholics to form the United Irishmen organisation, promoting revolutionary ideas imported from France; and a party prepared to welcome a French invasion soon came into existence. Thus stimulated, the increasing disaffection culminated in the 1798 rebellion. The Presbyterian-Catholic rebellion in Ulster was accompanied by outbreaks elsewhere, notably in County Wexford. Grattan was cruelly lampooned by James Gillray as a rebel leader for his liberal views and his stance against a political union with the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Almost immediately, the project of a legislative union between the British and Irish parliaments, which had been from time to time discussed since the beginning of the 18th century, was taken up in earnest by Pitt&#x27;s government. Grattan fiercely denounced the scheme.

The constitution of Grattan&#x27;s parliament offered no security, as the differences over the regency question had made evident that in matters of imperial interest the policy of the Irish parliament and that of Great Britain would be in agreement. At a moment when Britain was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with France, it was impossible for the ministry to ignore the danger, recently emphasised by the fact that the independent constitution of 1782 offered no safeguard against armed revolt. Sectarian violence during the rebellion put an end to the growing reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, and the island divided anew into two hostile factions.

It was from the Anglican established church, and particularly from the Orangemen, that the bitterest opposition to the union proceeded. The proposal found support among the Roman Catholic clergy and especially the bishops, while in no part of Ireland was it received with more favour than in the city of Cork. This attitude of the Catholics was caused by Pitt&#x27;s encouragement of the expectation that Catholic emancipation, the commutation of tithes, and the endowment of the Catholic priesthood, would accompany or quickly follow the passing of the measure.
When in 1799, the government brought forward its bill it was defeated in the Irish House of Commons. Grattan was still in retirement. His popularity had declined, and the fact that his proposals for parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation had become the watchwords of the United Irishmen had brought him the bitter hostility of the governing classes. He was dismissed from the Privy Council; his portrait was removed from the hall of Trinity College; the Merchant Guild of Dublin struck his name off their rolls. The threatened destruction of the constitution of 1782 quickly restored its author to his former place in the affections of the Irish people. The parliamentary recess had been employed by the government in securing by lavish corruption a majority in favour of their policy. On 15 January 1800, the Irish Parliament met for its last session; on the same day Grattan secured by purchase a seat for Wicklow; and at a late hour, while the debate was proceeding, he appeared to take his seat, and was cheered from the galleries. Grattan&#x27;s strength gave way when he rose to speak, and he obtained leave to address the House sitting. Nevertheless, his speech was a superb effort of oratory; for more than two hours he kept them spellbound. After prolonged debates Grattan, on 26 May, spoke finally against the committal of the bill, ending with an impassioned peroration in which he declared, &quot;I will remain anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom, faithful to her fall.&quot; These were the last words spoken by Grattan in the Irish Parliament.

The bill establishing the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities. One of Grattan&#x27;s main grounds of opposition to the union had been his dread of seeing the political leadership in Ireland pass out of the hands of the landed gentry; and he prophesied that the time would come when Ireland would send to the united parliament a hundred of the greatest rascals in the kingdom. Like Flood before him, Grattan had no leaning towards democracy; and he anticipated that by the removal of the centre of political interest from Ireland the evil of absenteeism would be intensified.

==In the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland==

For the next five years, Grattan took no active part in public affairs; it was not again until 1805, that he became a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Malton. He modestly took his seat on one of the back benches, until Fox brought him forward, exclaiming, &quot;This is no place for the Irish Demosthenes!&quot; His first speech was on the Catholic question and all agreed with the description of his speech by the &quot;Annual Register&quot; as one of the most brilliant and eloquent ever made within the walls of parliament. When Fox and William Grenville came into power in 1806 Grattan, who sat at this time for Dublin City, was offered, but refused to accept, an office in the government. In the following year, he showed the strength of his judgment and character by supporting, in spite of consequent unpopularity in Ireland, a measure for increasing the powers of the executive to deal with Irish disorder. Roman Catholic emancipation, which he continued to advocate with unflagging energy, though now advanced in age, became complicated after 1808 by the question whether a veto on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops should rest with the crown.

Grattan supported the veto, but a more radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland under the leadership of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and Grattan&#x27;s influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in Parliament after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the Whigs and supported the final struggle against Napoléon. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, and at the same time the equable quality, of Grattan&#x27;s character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but &quot;the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as it ought to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

In the following summer, after crossing from Ireland to Britain when in poor health to bring forward the Irish question once more, he became seriously ill. On his deathbed he spoke generously of Castlereagh, and with a warm eulogy of his former rival, Flood. He died at his home in Portman Square on 4 June 1820, and was buried in Westminster Abbey close to the tombs of Pitt and Fox. His statue is in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall in the Palace of Westminster.

Sydney Smith said of Grattan soon after his death: &quot;No government ever dismayed him. The world could not bribe him. He thought only of Ireland; lived for no other object; dedicated to her his beautiful fancy, his elegant wit, his manly courage, and all the splendour of his astonishing eloquence.&quot;

Grattan Bridge crossing the river Liffey between Parliament Street on the south side of Dublin and Capel Street on the north side is named in his honour. The building housing the faculty of Law and Government at Dublin City University has also been named the Henry Grattan Building in his honour.

Grattan Square Dungarvan, County Waterford. The establishment of the Dungarvan Town Commissioners in 1855 was the catalyst for the renaming of many of Dungarvan Streets. Irish Nationalists and Catholics were finally getting a say in how they were governed and they set about renaming streets to reflect their nationalist sensibilities. Despite having no connection to Dungarvan that we know of, as one of the leading constitutional nationalists of his era Henry Grattan was an obvious choice when the Town Commissioners were looking for a new name. Grattan Square was constructed between 1806 and 1826 at the instigation of the Duke of Devonshire. The architecture of the square has changed little to this day.

==Family==
Grattan&#x27;s father was James Grattan (d. 1766), a Recorder and then MP for Dublin City, who married a daughter of Thomas Marlay, Mary.

Grattan married Henrietta Fitzgerald in 1782, the daughter of Nicholas Fitzgerald of County Mayo (d. 1761), a son of Thomas FitzGerald of Turlough, County Mayo and Elizabeth Browne. Henrietta&#x27;s mother Margaret was the daughter of James Stephenson and Ann Price. Grattan&#x27;s in-laws&#x27; history gave him a sensitivity to former Irish political difficulties, as Henrietta&#x27;s Cavalier great-grandfather John Fitzgerald was transplanted from Gorteens Castle in County Kilkenny to Mayo in 1653 under the Cromwellian Settlement, and his son Thomas felt it necessary to conform to the Church of Ireland in 1717.

The Grattans had two sons and two daughters. The sons were James Grattan of Tinnehinch, MP for County Wicklow, and Henry Grattan (junior) of Moyrath, MP for Dublin City and then for County Meath. His daughter Mary Anne married first John Blachford (1771‐1832), and secondly Thomas Dalzell, 7th Earl of Carnwath, dying in 1853. Harriet (d.1865) married the Revd Wake of Courteenhall.

<doc id="148408" wikidata="Q2948400" url="?curid=148408" title="Irish House of Commons">
<text>The Irish House of Commons was the lower house of the Parliament of Ireland that existed from 1297 until the end of 1800. The upper house was the House of Lords. The membership of the House of Commons was directly elected, but on a highly restrictive franchise, similar to the unreformed House of Commons in contemporary Great Britain. Catholics were disqualified from sitting in the Irish parliament from 1691, even though they comprised the vast majority of the Irish population.

The Irish executive, known as the Dublin Castle administration, under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was not answerable to the House of Commons but to the British government. However, the Chief Secretary for Ireland was usually a member of the Irish parliament. In the Commons, business was presided over by the Speaker.

From 1 January 1801, it ceased to exist and was succeeded by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

==Franchise==
The limited franchise was exclusively male. From 1728 until 1793, Catholics were disfranchised, as well as being ineligible to sit in the Commons. Most of the population of all religions had no vote. In counties, forty-shilling freeholders were enfranchised while in most boroughs it was either only the members of self-electing corporations or a highly restricted body of freemen that were eligible to vote for the borough&#x27;s representatives. The vast majority of parliamentary boroughs were pocket boroughs, the private property of an aristocratic patron.

==Abolition==
The House of Commons was abolished under the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland into the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. The Irish House of Commons sat for the last time in Parliament House, Dublin on 2 August 1800. One hundred of its members were designated or co-opted to sit with the House of Commons of Great Britain, forming the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The patron of pocket boroughs that were disfranchised under the Act of Union was awarded £15,000 compensation for each.

==Speaker of the Commons==
The Speaker of the Irish House of Commons was the presiding officer of the House and its most senior official. The position was one of considerable power and prestige, and in the absence of a government chosen from and answerable to the Commons, he was the dominant political figure in the Parliament. The last Speaker was John Foster.

==Constituencies==

The number of boroughs invited to return members had originally been small (only 55 Boroughs existed in 1603) but was doubled by the Stuart monarchs. By the time of the Union, there were 150 constituencies, each electing two members:
* 32 county constituencies;
* 8 county borough constituencies;
* 109 borough constituencies;
* 1 university constituency (Dublin University).

Following the Act of Union, from 1801, there were 100 MPs from Ireland in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The constituencies were adapted from those in the Irish House of Commons as follows:
* 32 county constituencies, with two MPs each;
* 2 county borough constituencies, Cork City and Dublin City, both with two MPs;
* 31 county borough and borough constituencies, with one MP each;
* 1 university constituency, with one MP.

;Notes:




==Means of resignation==
Until 1793 members could not resign their seats. They could cease to be a member of the House in one of four ways:
* death,
* expulsion,
* taking Holy Orders, or
* being awarded a peerage and so a seat in the Irish House of Lords.
* Standing down at election to the House.

In 1793 a means for resignation was created, equivalent to the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead as a means of resignation from the British House of Commons. From that date, Irish members could be appointed to the Escheatorship of Munster, the Escheatorship of Leinster, the Escheatorship of Connaught or the Escheatorship of Ulster. Possession of one of these Crown offices, &quot;office of profit under the Crown&quot; with a 30-shilling salary, terminated one&#x27;s membership of the House of Commons.

==Notable members==
*Henry Grattan: leader of the Irish Patriot Party.
*Boyle Roche: The &quot;father&quot; of Irish bulls
*Hon. Arthur Wellesley: Later became Duke of Wellington, defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He represented his family borough of Trim from 1790 to 1798.
*William Conolly: Speaker from 1715 to 1729. Conolly was notable not just for his role in parliament but also for his great wealth that allowed him to build one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest Georgian houses, Castletown House.
*Nathaniel Clements: 1705–77 Government and Treasury Official, Managed extensive financial functions from 1720 to 1777 on behalf of the government, minister for finance 1740–77, extensive property owner and developer. A major influence on the architecture of Georgian Dublin and the Irish Palladian country house.
*John Philpot Curran: Orator and wit, originator of the phrase &quot;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty&quot;.

<doc id="148411" wikidata="Q212950" url="?curid=148411" title="Tallit">
<text>A tallit or &quot;taleth&quot; is a fringed garment worn as a prayer shawl by religious Jews. The tallit has special twined and knotted fringes known as &quot;tzitzit&quot; attached to its four corners. The cloth part is known as the &quot;beged&quot; (&quot;garment&quot;) and is usually made from wool or cotton, although silk is sometimes used for a tallit gadol.

The term is, to an extent, ambiguous. It can refer either to the &quot;tallit katan&quot; (&quot;small tallit&quot;) item that can be worn over or under clothing and commonly referred to as &quot;tzitzit&quot;, or to the &quot;tallit gadol&quot; (&quot;big tallit&quot;) Jewish prayer shawl worn over the outer clothes during the morning prayers (Shacharit) and worn during all prayers on Yom Kippur. The term &quot;tallit&quot; alone, usually refers to the tallit gadol.

There are different traditions regarding the age from which a tallit gadol is used, even within Orthodox Judaism. In some Sephardi communities, boys wear a tallit even before their bar mitzvah. In some communities, it is first worn from bar mitzvah (though the tallit katan is worn from pre-school age). In many Ashkenazi circles, a tallit gadol is worn only from marriage, and in some communities it may be customarily presented to a groom before marriage as a wedding present or even as part of a dowry.

== Biblical commandment ==
The Bible does not command wearing of a unique prayer shawl or tallit. Instead, it presumes that people wore a garment of some type to cover themselves and instructs the Children of Israel to attach fringes ( &quot;tzitzit&quot;) to the corners of these (Numbers 15:38), repeating the commandment in terms that they should &quot;make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself&quot; (Deuteronomy 22:12). These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots in the fringes. The exact customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are of post-biblical, rabbinic origin and, though the Talmud discusses these matters, slightly different traditions have developed in different communities. However the Bible is specific as to the purpose of these tzitzit, stating that &quot;it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God&quot;.

&quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; describes the prayer shawl as &quot;a rectangular mantle that looked like a blanket and was worn by men in ancient times&quot;. Also, it &quot;is usually white and made either of wool, cotton, or silk&quot;.

Traditionally the tallit is made of wool or linen, based on an understanding that reference to a &quot;garment&quot; in the Bible in connection with a mitzvah refers specifically to wool and linen garments. Though other materials are sometimes used, the debate has not reached a conclusion, and many, especially among the orthodox, prefer wool which is accepted by all authorities. There is also debate about mixed wool and linen tallit, since the Bible forbids klayim (shatnez)—&quot;intertying&quot; wool and linen together, with the two exceptions being garments of kohanim and tzitzit. Concerning tzitzit, chazal (the sages) permit using wool and linen strings in tandem only when genuine tekhelet (see below) is available, whereas kabbalist sources take it a step further by encouraging its practice.

According to the biblical commandment, a blue thread (&quot;petil tekhelet&quot;) is included in the tzitzit. However, for many centuries since the exile of the Jewish people from the Land of Israel, tzitzit have been worn without a techelet fringe, though in the last hundred years there has been something of a comeback.

== Pronunciation ==

In Modern Hebrew the word is pronounced , with the stress on the final syllable. In Yiddish it is , with the stress on the first syllable. The plural of &quot;tallit&quot; in Hebrew is &quot;tallitot&quot;, pronounced . The Yiddish plural is &quot;taleisim,&quot; pronounced .

== Etymology ==

Mishnaic Hebrew טלית is a backformation of אצטלית or אסטלית (also attested in Mishanic Hebrew, for instance Mishnah Yoma 7:1), borrowed from Ancient Greek στολή with epithetic -א to break up with initial consonant cluster and suffix ת- because final -&quot;ē&quot; was not tolerated in Mishnaic Hebrew. It is the vocalization טָלֵית which is reflected in the Yiddish and Ladino spoken traditions. 

The spelling of this word motivated a Semitic folk etymology in Modern Hebrew. טלית has been re-vocalized as though it were from the root &quot;ṭ-l-l&quot; () meaning &quot;cover&quot;, with the diminutive suffix -&quot;it&quot;. 

טלית referred to a &quot;cloak&quot; or &quot;sheet&quot; generally (as Greek στολή), but in Talmudic times already referred to the Jewish prayer shawl in particular.

== Idiom ==

In modern Hebrew idiom, the expression &quot;a completely blue tallit&quot; () means something which is completely perfect, and is typically used sarcastically to refer to a person who is imperfect and hypocritical. The expression stems from a rabbinic story about the biblical figure Korah who led a revolt against the leadership of Moses and Aaron. Koraḥ was said to have asked Moses a number of vexatious questions, one of which was, &quot;Does a tallit made entirely of blue yarn require tzitzit?&quot; To Moses&#x27;s affirmative answer, Koraḥ argued that the tzitzit commandment is absurd, in that if a single string of blue makes a garment acceptable () then a completely blue garment should be acceptable even without that string. Korach&#x27;s argument in this story is a metaphor for the argument justifying his rebellion. Just as he argued that a blue fringe is superfluous for an entirely blue garment, in the text of the Torah he argued that a holy leader like Moses was unnecessary for a nation which was entirely holy ().

The phrase &quot;more kosher than tzitzit&quot; is a Yiddish metaphoric expression () with similar connotations but is not necessarily used in a sarcastic sense. It can refer, in the superlative, to something that is really so perfect and flawless as to be beyond all reproach or criticism.

== Customs ==
In some Jewish communities a tallit gadol is given as a gift by a father to a son, a father-in-law to a son-in-law, or a teacher to a student. It might be purchased to mark a special occasion, such as a wedding or a bar mitzvah. Many parents purchase a tallit gadol for their sons at the age of 13, together with tefillin, though among the orthodox a male child will have been wearing a tallit katan from pre-school age. In the Reform, Reconstructionist, Renewal, and Conservative movements many women nowadays also wear a tallit gadol. While many worshipers bring their own tallit gadol to synagogue, there is usually a rack of them for the use of visitors and guests.

At Jewish wedding ceremonies, a tallit gadol is often used as a &quot;chuppah&quot; or wedding canopy. Similarly, a tallit gadol is traditionally spread out as a canopy over the children during the Torah-reading ceremony during the holiday of Simchat Torah, or in any procession with Torah scrolls, such as when parading a newly completed scroll through the streets.

The tallit gadol is traditionally draped over the shoulders, but during prayer, some cover their head with it, notably during specific parts of the service such as the Amidah and when called to the Torah for an aliyah.

In the Talmudic and post-Talmudic periods the tefillin were worn by rabbis and scholars all day, and a special tallit was worn at prayer; hence they put on the tefillin before the tallit, as appears in the order given in &quot;Seder Rabbi Amram Gaon&quot; (p. 2a) and in the Zohar. In modern practice, the opposite order is considered more &quot;correct&quot;. Based on the Talmudic principle of &quot;tadir v&#x27;she&#x27;ayno tadir, tadir kodem&quot; (: lit., frequent and infrequent, frequent first), when one performs more than one mitzva at a time, those that are performed more frequently should be performed first. While the tallit is worn daily, tefillin are not worn on &quot;Shabbat&quot; and holidays.

On the fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av, different customs prevail. Ashkenazim and some Sephardim do not wear a tallit gadol during the morning (Shacharit) service; at the afternoon service (Mincha), those who wear a tallit gadol make the blessing on fringes then. Other Sephardim (following the Kabbalah and the prevailing custom (Minhag) for Jerusalem) wear the tallit at Shacharit as usual.

The Kabbalists considered the tallit as a special garment for the service of God, intended, in connection with the tefillin, to inspire awe and reverence for God at prayer. 

The tallit gadol is worn by worshipers at the morning prayer on weekdays, &quot;Shabbat&quot;, and holy days. In addition, in many communities, it is worn by the hazzan (cantor) at every prayer while before the ark and by the reader of Torah, as well as by all other functionaries during the Torah reading.

=== History ===

The literal commandment in the Bible was not to wear a tallit but to attach tzitzit to the corners of one&#x27;s four-cornered garments every day to serve as a reminder of God commandments; this implies that such clothes were typically worn by Jews during biblical times. Such garments were large, white and rectangular and used as a garment, shawl and burial shroud. These four-cornered garments are suitable for the climate of West Asia. On hot days the garment could be draped around the body and head to provide cover from the sun or just bunched up on the shoulders for later evening use; the evenings can be dramatically cool and the garment could be draped around the neck and shoulders like a scarf to provide warmth.

Jews became at risk of losing this mitzvah when four cornered garments went out of fashion and became impractical for everyday wear. And so, a poncho-like vest undergarment was developed as a practical solution to continue following the Torah commandment. This garment is most commonly known as tzitzit, but is also referred to as arba kanfot (&quot;four corners&quot;), or tallit katan (&quot;small tallit&quot;). Jewish men wear the talit katan every day, most commonly worn under their clothing with the tzitzit knots hanging out. Some Jewish men prefer to tuck in their tzitzit to avoid drawing unwanted attention and/or for practical reasons. The tallit gadol became almost exclusively worn only for morning prayers and rarely outside.
=== Weddings ===

In many Sephardic and German Jewish communities, the groom traditionally wears a tallit gadol under the chuppah (wedding canopy); in many cases, he will wrap it around the bride as well during the ceremony. In non-German Ashkenazi communities, a more widespread custom is that the groom wears a kittel. In Hasidic and some non-Hasidic communities, an overcoat is worn over the kittel.

=== Burials ===

In the Diaspora, Jews are buried in a plain, wooden casket. The corpse is collected from the place of death (home, hospital, etc.) by the &quot;chevra kadisha&quot; (burial committee). In Ashkenazi custom, after a ritual washing of the body, the body of men is dressed in a &quot;kittel&quot; and then a &quot;tallit gadol&quot;. One of the &quot;tzitzit&quot; is then cut off. In the Land of Israel, burial is without a casket, and the &quot;kittel&quot; and &quot;tallit&quot; are the only coverings for the corpse. Women are buried in white shrouds only.

=== Additional occasions ===

In addition to the morning prayers of weekdays, Shabbat and holidays, a tallit gadol is also worn for &quot;Selichos&quot; in Ashkenazic communities by the prayer leader, even though it is still night. A tallit is also worn at night on Yom Kippur, from Kol Nidre, which begins during the daylight hours until after the evening (Ma&#x27;ariv) service.

== Types of tallitot ==

=== Tallit katan ===

The tallit katan (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew &quot;tales kotn;&quot; &quot;small tallit&quot;) is a fringed garment traditionally worn either under or over one&#x27;s clothing by Jewish males. It is a poncho-like garment with a hole for the head and special twined and knotted fringes known as tzitzit attached to its four corners. The requirements regarding the fabric and fringes of a &quot;tallit katan&quot; are the same as that of a &quot;tallit gadol&quot;. Generally, a &quot;tallit katan&quot; is made of wool or cotton.

Although Sephardic halakha generally maintains a distinct preference for a woolen garment as per the ruling of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, among Ashkenazim customs are split, with Moses Isserles ruling that all garment types are acceptable. While the &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; and Moshe Feinstein recommend wearing a woolen garment following the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;″s ruling, Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz was known to wear cotton, following the ruling of the Vilna Gaon. This was also the practice of Joseph B. Soloveitchik and that of German Jewry historically.

While all four cornered garments are required to have &quot;tzitzit&quot;, the custom of specially wearing a &quot;tallit katan&quot; is based on a verse in Numbers 15:38-39 which tells Moses to exhort the Israelites to &quot;make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments.&quot; Wearing a &quot;tallit kattan&quot; is not mandated in Biblical law, but in Rabbinic law the practice is strongly encouraged for men, and often considered obligatory or a binding custom.

The tallit katan is also known as &quot;arba kanfot&quot; (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew: &quot;arbe kanfes&quot;), literally &quot;four corners&quot;, and may be referred to simply as &quot;tzitzit&quot;.

A continuing misconception within non-Jewish circles is that the &quot;tallit katan&quot; is a sheet which is used by Orthodox Jews during sexual intercourse. It is believed that the fabric being hung from clothing lines during the 19th and 20th centuries within Jewish neighborhoods in the United States started these rumors. Not understanding its purpose, seeing the material with a hole in the middle caused non-Jews to make imaginative assumptions.

=== Tallit gadol ===
The &quot;tallit gadol&quot; (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew &quot;tallis godoil;&quot; traditionally known as &quot;tallét gedolah&quot; among Sephardim), or &quot;large&quot; &quot;tallit&quot;, is worn over one&#x27;s clothing resting on the shoulders. This is the &quot;prayer shawl&quot; that is worn during the morning services in synagogue by all male participants, and in many communities by the leader of the afternoon and evening prayers as well. 

The &quot;tallit gadol&quot; is usually woven of wool—especially among Ashkenazim. Some Spanish, Portuguese and Italian Jews use silk &quot;tallitot&quot;. The Portuguese Jewish community in The Netherlands has the tradition of decorating the corners of the Tallit. Today some tallitot are made of polyester and cotton. &quot;Tallitot&quot; may be of any colour but are usually white with black, blue or white stripes along the edge. Sizes of tallitot vary, and are a matter of custom and preference. Some are large enough to cover the whole body while others hang around the shoulders, the former being more common among Orthodox Jews, the latter among Conservative, Reform and other denominations. The neckband of the tallit, sometimes woven of silver or gold thread, is called the &quot;atarah&quot; which literally means crown but is often referred to as the collar. The &quot;tallit gadol&quot; is often kept in a dedicated pouch or cloth bag (often of velvet) which can be quite simple or ornately decorated.

The tallit gadol is typically either all white, white with black stripes, or white with blue stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties have traditionally been the most common, along with a blue-and-white variety, said to be in remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, which served as the visual inspiration for the flag of modern Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities the tendency is toward white tallitot with black stripes. The stripes on the &quot;tallit&quot; may have their origin in the clavia, purple stripes which were worn on the tunics of distinguished Romans. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes is that their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.

In many Jewish communities, the tallit is worn in the synagogue by all men and boys over bar mitzvah age (and in some communities even younger). Aside from German Jews and Oberlander Jews, men in most Ashkenazi communities (which comprise the majority of Jews in America today) start wearing the tallit after their wedding.

== Women ==

In rabbinic law, women are not required to wear a &quot;tallit&quot; or other forms of &quot;tzitzit&quot;. The vast majority of contemporary Orthodox authorities forbid the donning of a tallit by women, although Moshe Feinstein, Joseph Soloveitchik, and Eliezer Melamed approve women wearing tzitzit in private, if their motivation is &quot;for God&#x27;s sake&quot; rather than motivated by external movements such as feminism. At the gender-segregated sections of the Western Wall, women have been permitted to wear shawls worn around the neck—but harassed, expelled or arrested for wearing the more traditional garments outside the segregated men&#x27;s section.

Women in non-Orthodox (Reform, Conservative, Karaite, Reconstructionist and others) are not prohibited from wearing a &quot;tallit&quot;, and usually encouraged to do so, especially when called to the Torah or leading services from the bimah. Women in Conservative Judaism began to revive the wearing of the tallit in the 1970s, usually using colors and fabrics distinct from the traditional garment worn by men, in the spirit of (but not necessarily out of adherence to) the contemporary Orthodox rulings regarding women not wearing &quot;male-style&quot; garments. It has become common in Reform and other non-Orthodox streams for girls to receive a tallit at their bat mitzvah, although some do not subsequently wear it on a regular basis. Other women have adopted the tallit later in life, including the larger, traditional style, to connect with their communities, embody egalitarian values, or create a personalized connection to Judaism. It is rare for women to wear a tallit katan.

<doc id="148414" wikidata="Q140565" url="?curid=148414" title="Sink">
<text>A sink (also known as basin in the UK) is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes. Sinks have a tap (faucet) that supplies hot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster rinsing. They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device. Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser. Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter.

When a sink becomes clogged, a person will often resort to using a chemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the clog with a &quot;drain auger&quot; (often called a &quot;plumber&#x27;s snake&quot;).

== History ==
===United States===
The washstand was a bathroom sink made in the United States in the late 18th century. The washstands were small tables on which were placed a pitcher and a deep bowl, following the English tradition. Sometimes the table had a hole where the large bowl rested, which led to the making of dry sinks. From about 1820 to 1900, the dry sink evolved by the addition of a wooden cabinet with a trough built on the top, lined with zinc or lead. This is where the bowls or buckets for water were kept. Splashboards were sometimes added to the back wall, as well as shelves and drawers, the more elaborate designs usually placed in the kitchen.

== Materials ==
Sinks are made of many different materials. These include:

* Ceramic
* Concrete
* Copper
* Enamel over steel or cast iron
* Glass
* Granite
* Marble
* Nickel
* Plastic
* Polyester
* Porcelain
* Soapstone
* Stainless steel
* Stone
* Terrazzo
* Wood
Stainless steel is most commonly used in kitchens and commercial applications because it represents a good trade-off between cost, usability, durability, and ease of cleaning. Most stainless steel sinks are made by drawing a sheet of stainless steel over a die. Some very deep sinks are fabricated by welding. Stainless steel sinks will not be damaged by hot or cold objects and resist damage from impacts. Stainless steel sinks are widely celebrated for their durability, sleek appearance, and resistance to rust and corrosion. However, many homeowners are baffled when they spot rust stains on their stainless steel sink. One disadvantage of stainless steel is that, being made of thin metal, they tend to be noisier than most other sink materials, although better sinks apply a heavy coating of vibration-damping material to the underside of the sink.

Enamel over cast iron is a popular material for kitchen and bathroom sinks. Heavy and durable, these sinks can also be manufactured in a very wide range of shapes and colors. Like stainless steel, they are very resistant to hot or cold objects, but they can be damaged by sharp impacts and once the glass surface is breached, the underlying cast iron will often corrode, spalling off more of the glass. Aggressive cleaning will dull the surface, leading to more dirt accumulation. Enamel over steel is a similar-appearing but far less rugged and less cost-effective alternative.
Solid ceramic sinks have many of the same characteristics as enamel over cast iron, but without the risk of surface damage leading to corrosion.

Plastic sinks come in several basic forms:
* Inexpensive sinks are simply made using injection-molded thermoplastics. These are often deep, free-standing sinks used in laundry rooms. Subject to damage by hot or sharp objects, the principal virtue of these sinks is their low cost.
* High-end acrylic drop-in (lowered into the countertop) and undermount (attached from the bottom) sinks are becoming more popular, although they tend to be easily damaged by hard objects – like scouring a cast iron frying pan in the sink.
* Plastic sinks may also be made from the same materials used to form &quot;solid surface&quot; countertops. These sinks are durable, attractive, and can often be molded with an integrated countertop or joined to a separate countertop in a seamless fashion, leading to no sink-to-countertop joint or a very smooth sink-to-countertop joint that can not trap dirt or germs. These sinks are subject to damage by hot objects but damaged areas can sometimes be sanded down to expose undamaged material.

Soapstone sinks were once common, but today tend to be used only in very-high-end applications or applications that must resist caustic chemicals that would damage more-conventional sinks.

Wood sinks are from the early days of sinks, and baths were made from natural teak with no additional finishing. Teak is chosen because of its natural waterproofing properties – it has been used for hundreds of years in the marine industry for this reason. Teak also has natural antiseptic properties, which is a bonus for its use in baths and sinks.

Glass sinks: A current trend in bathroom design is the handmade glass sink (often referred to as a vessel sink), which has become fashionable for wealthy homeowners.

Stone sinks have been used for ages. Some of the more popular stones used are: marble, travertine, onyx, granite, and soap stone on high end sinks.

Glass, concrete, and terrazzo sinks are usually designed for their aesthetic appeal and can be obtained in a wide variety of unusual shapes and colors such as floral shapes. Concrete and terrazzo are occasionally also used in very-heavy-duty applications such as janitorial sinks.

==Styles==

===Top-mount sinks===
&quot;Self-rimming&quot; (&quot;top-mount&quot;) sinks sit in appropriately shaped holes roughly cut in the countertop (or substrate material) using a jigsaw or other cutter appropriate to the material at hand. They are suspended by their rim which forms a fairly close seal with the top surface of the worktop. If necessary, this seal can be enhanced by clamping the sink from below the worktop.

===Bottom-mount sinks===

&quot;Bottom-mount&quot; or &quot;under-mount&quot; sinks are installed below the countertop surface. The edge of the countertop material is exposed at the hole created for the sink (and so must be a carefully finished edge rather than a rough cut). The sink is then clamped to the bottom of the material from below. Especially for bottom-mount sinks, silicone-based sealants are usually used to assure a waterproof joint between the sink and the countertop material. Advantages of an undermount sink include superior ergonomics and a contemporary look; disadvantages include extra cost in both the sink and the counter top. Also, no matter how carefully the cut out is made, the result is either a small ledge or overhang at the interface with the sink. This can create an environment for catching dirt and allowing germs to grow.

Solid-surface plastic materials allow sinks to be made of the same plastic material as the countertop. These sinks can then easily be glued to the underside of the countertop material and the joint sanded flat, creating the usual invisible joint and completely eliminating any dirt-catching seam between the sink and the countertop. In a similar fashion, for stainless steel, a sink may be welded into the countertop; the joint is then ground to create a finished, concealed appearance.

===Butler&#x27;s sink===
A &quot;butler&#x27;s sink&quot; is a rectangular ceramic sink with a rounded rim which is set into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler&#x27;s sinks: the London sink and the Belfast sink. In 2006, both types of sinks usually were across and front-to-back, with a depth of . London sinks were originally shallower than Belfast sinks. (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that the Belfast sink was deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely the two sinks had different roles within the household. But that difference usually does not exist in the modern era, and both sinks are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London sink is that the Belfast sink is fitted with an overflow weir which prevented water from spilling over the sink&#x27;s edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.

===Farmer&#x27;s sink===

A &quot;farmer&#x27;s sink&quot; is a deep sink that has a finished front. Set onto a countertop, the finished front of the sink remains exposed. This style of sink requires very little &quot;reach-over&quot; to access the sink.

===Vessel sink===

A &quot;vessel sink&quot; is a free-standing sink, generally finished and decorated on all sides, that sits directly on the surface of the furniture on which it is mounted. These sinks have become increasingly popular with bathroom designers because of the large range of materials, styles, and finishes that can be shown to good advantage.
===Food catering sinks===
Catering sinks are often made in sizes compatible with standard size Gastronorm containers, a European standard for food containers.

==Ceramic basin construction==
Pottery is made by a blend of clays, fillers and fluxes being fused together during the firing process. There are high fire clays and glazes which are heated to over 1200 °C (2200 °F) and are extremely resistant to fading, staining, burning, scratching and acid attack. Low fire clays, fired below 1200 °C, most often used by large commercial manufacturers and third world producers, while durable, are susceptible to scratching and wear over time. The clay body is first bisqued to about 1000 °C (1900 °F). In the second firing a white or coloured glaze is applied and is melted by heat which chemically and physically fuses the glass (glaze) to the clay body during the same firing process. Due to the firing process and natural clays used, it is normal for the product to vary in size and shape, and +/− 5 mm is normal.

==Accessories==
Some public restrooms feature automatic faucets, which use a motion-sensing valve to detect the user&#x27;s hands moving beneath the tap and turn the water on. Some kitchen sinks also come equipped with a sink sprayer.

Sinks, especially those made of stainless steel, can be fitted with an integrated drainboard, allowing for the draining of washed dishes.

<doc id="148415" wikidata="Q182950" url="?curid=148415" title="Studio Ghibli">
<text>is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo. It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro from the 1988 film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (&quot;tanuki&quot;) and cats (&quot;neko&quot;). Among the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing films are &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (1997), &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001), &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), &quot;Ponyo&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; (2023). Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft&#x27;s assets.

Four of the studio&#x27;s films are among the ten highest-grossing Japanese feature films; &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is third, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide. Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and seven have received Academy Award nominations. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; won the 2024 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, and the 2024 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

==Name==
The name &quot;Ghibli&quot; was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun (also used in English), the nickname of Italy&#x27;s Saharan scouting plane Caproni Ca.309, in turn derived from the Italianization of the Libyan Arabic name for a hot desert wind ( ). The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aircraft and also for the idea that the studio would &quot;blow a new wind through the anime industry&quot;. Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as , with a hard g sound, the studio&#x27;s name is written in Japanese as .

==History==
===Tokuma Shoten era===
Founded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on &quot;The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; in 1968 and the &quot;Panda! Go, Panda!&quot; films in 1972 and 1973. Suzuki had been an editor at Tokuma Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Animage&quot; manga magazine.

The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Suzuki was part of the film&#x27;s production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join them.

The studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki&#x27;s Studio Ghibli films. In their book &quot;Anime Classics Zettai!&quot;, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as &quot;a mainstay of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s extraordinary design and production team&quot;. At one time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo.

In August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership wherein Walt Disney Studios would be the sole international distributor for Tokuma Shoten&#x27;s Studio Ghibli animated films. Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to finance 10% of the studio&#x27;s production costs. Since then, all three of the aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by Disney. On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one location.

Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine &quot;Animage&quot;, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled &quot;Ghibli Notes&quot;. Artwork from Ghibli&#x27;s films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko Himuro&#x27;s novel &quot;Umi ga Kikoeru&quot; was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into &quot;Ocean Waves&quot;, Studio Ghibli&#x27;s first animated feature-length film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.

In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.

The studio is also known for its strict &quot;no-edits&quot; policy in licensing their films abroad due to &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; being heavily edited for the film&#x27;s release in the United States as &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;.

===Independent era===
Between 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary brand of Tokuma Shoten; however, that partnership ended in April 2005, when Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten and was re-established as an independent company with relocated headquarters.

On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996 and has also aided the release of the &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; film in the United States. Suzuki still serves on the company&#x27;s board of directors.

Takahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki&#x27;s (director of &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and Hayao&#x27;s son) &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot; – an adaptation of &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;. Miyazaki announced his retirement with &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its creator, but returned with &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; in 2023, earning the director his second Academy Award.

On Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: &quot;I know I&#x27;ve said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, &#x27;Once again.&#x27; But this time I am quite serious.&quot;

In 2013, a documentary directed by Mami Sunada called was created delving into the lives of those working at Studio Ghibli and the productions of the animated films &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; and &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot;, including storyboard sketching, inking, painting, and voice actor selection for the films.

On January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime television series, &quot;Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya&quot;, an adaptation of Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s &quot;Ronia the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; for NHK. The series is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and co-produced by Studio Ghibli.

In March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired as producer and assumed the new position of general manager. Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role.

On August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a &quot;brief pause&quot; to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki&#x27;s retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company would go in the future. This led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, &quot;That was not my intention, though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not making any more features.&quot; Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015, working on the film &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot;.

The 2016 animated fantasy film &quot;The Red Turtle&quot;, directed and co-written by Dutch-British animator Michaël Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a co-production between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch.

In February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli.

On November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as president; he was replaced by Kiyofumi Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.

In May 2020, Toshio Suzuki confirmed that a new film from Gorō Miyazaki is in development at Studio Ghibli. On June 3, 2020, Studio Ghibli announced that the film would be an adaptation of the novel &quot;Earwig and the Witch&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones. The film was announced as the first full 3D CG animated Ghibli film and slated for a television premiere on NHK in late 2020. The company had a net income of , and a total asset worth by August 2021.

On November 1, 2022, the Studio Ghibli themed amusement park Ghibli Park opened.

On April 4, 2023, Koji Hoshino announced that he had stepped down as chairman, and would serve as a representative director before planning to exit Studio Ghibli completely during the company&#x27;s annual general shareholder&#x27;s meeting in June, one month prior to the release of director Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s final movie &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; on July 14. He also announced that Toshio Suzuki would be replacing Kiyofumi Nakajima as president of Studio Ghibli, assuming the role for the first time since 2008, while Nakajima would continue to serve as a director. This change of management came about amidst reports that Suzuki had allegedly been mismanaging company funds by directing them towards his girlfriend&#x27;s failed business ventures. This reportedly created tension between Suzuki and Hoshino, with the latter reportedly citing it as a long-term internal problem at the company since the couple met in 2013 and was the reason for his planned departure from the company, although a spokesperson for Studio Ghibli in a statement to &quot;Variety&quot; denied that Hoshino&#x27;s departure had anything to do with these reports. The source of the allegations came from the tabloid paper, &quot;Shūkan Josei&quot; and was not corroborated by the mainstream media in Japan.

===Nippon Television era===
In October 2023, the studio became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings, Inc.. Studio Ghibli&#x27;s leadership transitioned to Hiroyuki Fukuda, a senior executive at NTV. Toshio Suzuki became chairman and Hayao Miyazaki became Honorary Chairman. Nippon TV acquired a 42.3% stake in Studio Ghibli. The decision was driven by the advanced ages of Miyazaki and Suzuki, aged 82 and 75, respectively. The studio had considered Miyazaki&#x27;s son, Goro Miyazaki, as a successor but opted for external leadership due to concerns and Goro&#x27;s reluctance. NTV started to handle management, allowing Studio Ghibli to focus on creative endeavors. The takeover took effect on October 6.

In 2024, the studio received an honorary Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, the first film production company to receive the award.

==Distribution rights==
===Theatrical and home media rights===
====Japan====
In Japan, most of the company&#x27;s films are distributed by Toho theatrically, except for &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (which were distributed by Toei Company along with &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;) and &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot;, which was distributed by Shochiku.

For home media, a majority of Studio Ghibli releases are distributed by Walt Disney Studios Japan. Pony Canyon occasionally releases Ghibli documentaries on home media, and also distributes rental versions of Ghibli&#x27;s movies under a deal with Disney. Pony Canyon also fully distributed the standalone version of &quot;Earwig and the Witch&quot; on home media.

Before the Disney deal, Tokuma Shoten released Ghibli movies themselves through their &quot;Animage Video&quot; imprint, as well as all LaserDisc releases of the movies, as the Disney deal did not include that format.

====International====
After purchasing the global distribution rights from World Film Corporation, Manson International and Showmen, Inc. produced a 95-minute English dub of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, titled &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, which was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures on June 14, 1985, followed by a VHS release in December 1985. The voice actors and actresses were not credited, and the film was heavily edited to give it a faster pace. The film received a PG rating just like Disney&#x27;s later English dub. By removing several of the longer dialogue scenes, some of the environmentalist themes were simplified as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered to remove Nausicaä&#x27;s childhood connection to them. Most of the characters&#x27; names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The North American poster and VHS cover featured a cadre of male characters who are not in the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Overall, approximately 22 minutes was cut for North American release. &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot; also prompted Miyazaki to allow translator Toren Smith of Studio Proteus to create an official, faithful translation of the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; manga for Viz Media.

In the late 1980s, an English dub of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was produced for international Japan Airlines flights at the request of Tokuma Shoten. The &quot;Castle&quot; dub was briefly screened in the United States by Streamline Pictures. Carl Macek, the head of Streamline, was disappointed with this dub, deeming it &quot;adequate, but clumsy&quot;. Following this, Tokuma allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. In April 1993, Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the &quot;Totoro&quot; dub as a theatrical release, and the dub was later released onto VHS and eventually onto DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. In the early 1990s, an English dub of &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; was produced by Ward Sexton in Japan, again for international Japan Airlines flights. The original dubs can be seen on the 1996 Ghibli ga Ippai Laserdisc set, the initial copies for the Japanese DVD releases of &quot;Totoro&quot;, &quot;Laputa&quot; and &quot;Porco&quot;, and Fox&#x27;s VHS and DVD release of &quot;Totoro&quot;.

In 1996, Walt Disney Studios acquired worldwide distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli library, with Disney redubbing all previously dubbed films. In addition, Walt Disney Studios Japan agreed to contribute 10% of the funding for all future releases, starting with &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot;, in exchange for right of first refusal regarding international distribution. Disney continues with this practice to this day, even extending it to the works of Studio Ponoc and to co-productions like &quot;The Red Turtle&quot; in Japan. It reportedly took four years for Disney and Studio Ghibli to reach a distribution deal. Originally, the Ghibli films were meant to headline a line of videos called &quot;Animation Celebration&quot;, highlighting critically acclaimed animated films from around the world. These plans never materialized in full, but the &quot;Animation Celebration&quot; logo can be seen on Disney&#x27;s original VHS release of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. During Disney&#x27;s tenure, the studio produced the English dubs and released 15 of Ghibli&#x27;s films, plus &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, through the Walt Disney Pictures, Buena Vista Home Video, Miramax and Touchstone Pictures banners.

Disney and Ghibli have also selectively chosen not to promote and record an English-dubbed version for films and works deemed less internationally marketable, including some of Takahata&#x27;s more developmental and obscure pieces. Although the Studio has a &quot;No cuts&quot; policy in terms of international versions and dubs, this does not apply to promotional posters, etc., for which the film makers collaborate with Disney to produce cultural appropriate international versions. The Studio has not shied away from rebranding on the international stage in order to convey tweaked promotional imagery for different cultural norms. One example of these tweaks to international promotional materials can be seen between the Japanese and English versions of the movie poster for &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001). For American and other English-speaking audiences, the name of the film was changed from the Japanese version, which directly translates roughly to, &quot;The Disappearance of Chihiro and Sen&quot;, to &quot;Spirited Away&quot; to suggest more mystical, otherworldly themes, since the direct Japanese translation could be taken to mean that Chihiro/Sen disappeared due to some more dangerous reason. On the American movie poster, more pictures of spirits from the film were added to the background to further pique the viewer&#x27;s interest with more supernatural themes, creating an association between the pictures spirits and what most American people would think of as &quot;ghosts&quot;. For the Japanese poster, there are fewer spirits as the Japanese Shinto religion normalizes the existence of spirits, so less emphasis is needed to convey the importance of non-human spirits. Also, Disney enlarged the &quot;Studio Ghibli&quot; and &quot;Hayao Miyazaki&quot; labels on the poster, helping to bring greater awareness to the studio through the success of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

In 2011, GKIDS acquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the aforementioned Ghibli films, with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment retaining the home video rights. Afterwards, in 2013, GKIDS acquired the US and Canadian distribution rights to &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot;. The film, which Disney passed on to GKIDS due to dealing with potential incest, marked the first time since 1996 that Disney handed a Studio Ghibli film off to another distributor. Afterwards, GKIDS would go on to distribute the films Disney found to be too mature or unmarketable for American audiences: &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Ocean Waves&quot;, &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot; and &quot;When Marnie Was There&quot;. In July 2017, Disney relinquished its home video rights (with the exception of &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;, which remained with Disney until 2020 due to a distribution clause) to GKIDS, which handles all theatrical and home media distribution of Ghibli films in North America along with &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot;. Nevertheless, Disney still continues to handle select distribution in Japan (home media), Taiwan and China (Both under Buena Vista International brand).

GKIDS&#x27; home media releases have been handled by multiple distributors. Cinedigm distributed the home media release of &quot;Poppy Hill&quot;, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment distributed the home media releases of &quot;Kaguya&quot;, &quot;Marnie&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Waves&quot;, and Shout! Factory all subsequent releases thus far. The Ghibli films owned by GKIDS were made available for digital purchases on most major services in the United States and Canada on December 17, 2019, through Shout! Factory.

Outside Asia (including Japan) and North America since 2003, Goodfellas (a former subsidiary of Wild Bunch, formerly known as Wild Bunch International) has been Studio Ghibli&#x27;s international sales holder.

Individual rights to Ghibli&#x27;s films are held by various third parties, including Elysian Film Group and Anonymous Content (United Kingdom and Ireland), Wild Bunch (France and Belgium), Leonine (Germany), Lucky Red (Italy), Vértigo Films (Spain), Crunchyroll Store Australia (Australia and New Zealand) and Encore Films/mm2 Entertainment in Southeast Asia.

Notably, &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot; received a second dub exclusive to the United Kingdom, produced by StudioCanal UK, likely due to the film&#x27;s origins being from Mary Norton&#x27;s British novel &quot;The Borrowers&quot;.

Disney formerly held international sales rights until they were sold off to Goodfellas (then Wild Bunch) in 2003. Disney kept the French distribution rights to Ghibli&#x27;s library until September 2020, when it had expired and transitioned off to Wild Bunch. Since 2021, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment serves as the home media distributor of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s catalog via its distribution deal with Wild Bunch through the Wild Side Vidéo label.

===Streaming rights===
Prior to 2019, Studio Ghibli opted not to make its films available digitally, feeling that physical media and theatrical events like GKIDS&#x27; Studio Ghibli Fest would work more towards their goal of mindful care and curation for their films. Disney had previously lobbied for a streaming deal with Ghibli during their distribution tenure, but such attempts were never materialized. The studio heads changed their minds after hearing a quote from American actor and director Woody Allen about how there should be multiple outlets for feature films.

On October 17, 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s HBO Max (now Max) announced it had acquired exclusive streaming rights to Studio Ghibli&#x27;s catalogue in the United States as part of a deal with GKIDS; these films were available when the service launched in May 2020. On January 20, 2020, it was announced that Netflix acquired the exclusive streaming rights to this catalogue in all regions where it operates except for the United States (in which Netflix does have streaming rights to &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot;), as part of a deal with Ghibli&#x27;s international sales rights partner Wild Bunch. Seven of twenty-one films in the studio&#x27;s catalogue were released on February 1, 2020, with the others following on March 1 and April 1. Netflix then struck a separate deal with GKIDS for streaming rights in Canada which was announced on June 22, and came into effect on June 25 for most films. As of 2024, no streaming rights deals have yet been announced for Studio Ghibli&#x27;s home country of Japan, nor for markets such as China where neither Netflix nor HBO Max is available.

===&quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;===
Most of the above deals exclude &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;; unlike most of the other films, which were published by Tokuma Shoten, &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; was produced and is owned by Shinchosha, which also had published the short story it was based on, and as such, fell into different rights holdings. It was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai&quot; Collection on August 7, 1998. On July 29, 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector&#x27;s edition DVD on August 6, 2008. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the film on Blu-ray twice on July 18, 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. StudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on July 1, 2013. Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.

It was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on June 2, 1993. They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on September 1, 1998 (the same day Disney released &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; in North America) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on October 7 the same year. It was later released on a two-disc DVD set (which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film&#x27;s storyboards with the second disc containing more extensive Bonus Features) on October 8, 2002. It was released by Central Park Media one last time on December 7, 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on July 7, 2009. Following the September 1, 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV, their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on March 6, 2012. A Blu-ray edition was released on November 20, 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital, along with a digital release that same year. Netflix acquired the distribution rights to the film in 2024 and began featuring it for digital streaming outside of Japan on September 16, 2024.

==Works==

&quot;Horus&quot; and &quot;Cagliostro&quot; were the feature-length directorial debuts of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki respectively, and were produced by Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment years before the founding of Studio Ghibli.

&quot;Nausicaä&quot; was directed by Miyazaki at Topcraft, a studio which Miyazaki, Takahata and Toshio Suzuki later purchased and renamed Studio Ghibli. As a result, the film has often been rereleased and marketed as a Studio Ghibli movie.

&quot;The Red Turtle&quot; was a collaborative effort by Studio Ghibli with Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit and was branded as a Studio Ghibli release internationally. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics in North and Latin America.

For the purposes of the list below, films that appear in Studio Ghibli&#x27;s official filmography are listed. Other Studio Ghibli productions are listed here.

===Feature films===


===Television===
==Style and themes==

Studio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich watercolor and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly. All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors, and have a &quot;whimsical and joyful aesthetic&quot;. Studio Ghibli&#x27;s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene. A notable exception is &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot;, directed by Takahata, which departs from Ghibli&#x27;s typical style by employing a soft watercolor palette and storybook-like aesthetic reminiscent of Japanese folk art. This approach aimed to reflect the emotions and inner struggles of the characters and highlight the hand-drawn animation.

The films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition, environmentalism and the natural world, independent female protagonists, the cost of war, and youth.

==Music==
Much of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s music is composed by Joe Hisaishi, who has worked with Miyazaki on creating the music for his films for over 30 years. He uses storyboard images, provided by Miyazaki, to create an image album, which is then used to build out the final soundtrack for the movie. The music has elements from Baroque counterpoint, jazz, and modal music to create the unique sound that many associate with both Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli. Early on, the music in the films was known for its eclectic, synth sound, before later moving to more motivic and melody-driven music. Especially present in earlier years, the music does not directly relate to the emotions and rhythms happening on screen. Another defining feature is Hisaishi&#x27;s unique use of leitmotif, rather than a singular song being associated with one character, the motif is the theme of the film. Hisaishi began using leitmotif in Ghibli films first in &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;.

The ministry was originally established by the Dáil Constitution adopted by the First Dáil on 21 January 1919, after it issued the Declaration of Independence. This constitution provided for a cabinet consisting of a head of government, known as the Príomh Aire or President of Dáil Éireann, and four other ministers. The Irish Republic modelled itself on the parliamentary system of government and so its cabinet was appointed by and answerable to the Dáil. Under the constitution the President was elected by the Dáil, while the remaining ministers were nominated by the President and then ratified by the Dáil. The Dáil could dismiss both the cabinet as a whole and individual ministers by passing a resolution. Ministers could also be dismissed by the President.

A number of changes were made to the cabinet system after its adoption in January 1919. The number of ministers was increased in April 1919. As established in 1919, the Irish Republic had no explicit head of state; in 1921 the head of the ministry was renamed as President of the Republic. For a brief period the members of this president&#x27;s cabinet became known as &quot;secretaries of state&quot; rather than ministers. When the Fourth ministry assumed office in 1922 after the approval of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, with Arthur Griffith as its head, cabinet members were once again described as ministers and Griffith adopted the title of President of Dáil Éireann.

For much of 1922, the ministry governed in parallel with the Provisional Government, an interim administration established on 16 January 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, with Michael Collins as its Chairman and the membership of the two cabinets overlapped. On 25 August, W. T. Cosgrave was appointed as Chairman of the Provisional Government, after Collins had been killed on 22 August, and on 9 September, Cosgrave was also appointed as President of Dáil Éireann, succeeding Griffith who had died on 12 August. The ministry was then effectively the same as the Second provisional government. On 6 December 1922, when the Irish Free State came into being, both the ministry and the provisional government were superseded by the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.

<doc id="148417" wikidata="Q1134867" url="?curid=148417" title="Stored-program computer">
<text>A stored-program computer is a computer that stores program instructions in electronically, electromagnetically, or optically accessible memory. This contrasts with systems that stored the program instructions with plugboards or similar mechanisms.

The definition is often extended with the requirement that the treatment of programs and data in memory be interchangeable or uniform.

== Description ==
In principle, stored-program computers have been designed with various architectural characteristics. A computer with a von Neumann architecture stores program data and instruction data in the same memory, while a computer with a Harvard architecture has separate memories for storing program and data. However, the term &quot;stored-program computer&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for the von Neumann architecture. Jack Copeland considers that it is &quot;historically inappropriate, to refer to electronic stored-program digital computers as &#x27;von Neumann machines&#x27;&quot;. Hennessy and Patterson wrote that the early Harvard machines were regarded as &quot;reactionary by the advocates of stored-program computers&quot;.

== History ==
The concept of the stored-program computer can be traced back to the 1936 theoretical concept of a universal Turing machine. Von Neumann was aware of this paper, and he impressed it on his collaborators.

Many early computers, such as the Atanasoff–Berry computer, were not reprogrammable. They executed a single hardwired program. As there were no program instructions, no program storage was necessary. Other computers, though programmable, stored their programs on punched tape, which was physically fed into the system as needed, as was the case for the Zuse Z3 and the Harvard Mark I, or were only programmable by physical manipulation of switches and plugs, as was the case for the Colossus computer.

In 1936, Konrad Zuse anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.

In 1948, the Manchester Baby, built at University of Manchester, is generally recognized as world&#x27;s first electronic computer that ran a stored program—an event on 21 June 1948. However the Baby was not regarded as a full-fledged computer, but more a proof of concept predecessor to the Manchester Mark 1 computer, which was first put to research work in April 1949. On 6 May 1949 the EDSAC in Cambridge ran its first program, making it another electronic digital stored-program computer. It is sometimes claimed that the IBM SSEC, operational in January 1948, was the first stored-program computer; this claim is controversial, not least because of the hierarchical memory system of the SSEC, and because some aspects of its operations, like access to relays or tape drives, were determined by plugging. The first stored-program computer to be built in continental Europe was the MESM, completed in the Soviet Union in 1950.

=== The first stored-program computers ===
Several computers could be considered the first stored-program computer, depending on the criteria.
* IBM SSEC, was designed in late 1944 and became operational in January 1948 but was electromechanical
* In April 1948, modifications were completed to ENIAC to function as a stored-program computer, with the program stored by setting dials in its function tables, which could store 3,600 decimal digits for instructions. It ran its first stored program on 12 April 1948 and its first production program on 17 April This claim is disputed by some computer historians.
* ARC2, a relay machine developed by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth at Birkbeck, University of London, officially came online on 12 May 1948. It featured the first rotating drum storage device.
* Manchester Baby, a developmental, fully electronic computer that successfully ran a stored program on 21 June 1948. It was subsequently developed into the Manchester Mark 1, which ran its first program in early April 1949.
* Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator, EDSAC, which ran its first programs on 6 May 1949, and became a full-scale operational computer that served a user community beyond its developers.
* EDVAC, conceived in June 1945 in &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, but not delivered until August 1949. It began actual operation (on a limited basis) in 1951.
* BINAC, delivered to a customer on 22 August 1949. It worked at the factory but there is disagreement about whether or not it worked satisfactorily after being delivered. If it had been finished at the projected time, it would have been the first stored-program computer in the world. It was the first stored-program computer in the U.S.
* In 1951, the Ferranti Mark 1, a cleaned-up version of the Manchester Mark 1, became the first commercially available electronic digital computer.
* The Bull Gamma 3 (1952) and IBM 650 (1953) were the first mass produced commercial computers, respectively selling about 1200 and 2000 units.
* Manchester University Transistor Computer, is generally regarded as the first transistor-based stored-program computer having become operational in November 1953.

===Telecommunication===
The concept of using a stored-program computer for switching of telecommunication circuits is called stored program control (SPC). It was instrumental to the development of the first electronic switching systems by American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) in the Bell System, a development that started in earnest by c. 1954 with initial concept designs by Erna Schneider Hoover at Bell Labs. The first of such systems was installed on a trial basis in Morris, Illinois in 1960. The storage medium for the program instructions was the flying-spot store, a photographic plate read by an optical scanner that had a speed of about one microsecond access time. For temporary data, the system used a barrier-grid electrostatic storage tube.

<doc id="148418" wikidata="Q7241266" url="?curid=148418" title="President of Dáil Éireann">
<text>The president of Dáil Éireann ( ), later also president of the Irish Republic, was the leader of the revolutionary Irish Republic of 1919–1922. The office was created in the Dáil Constitution adopted by Dáil Éireann, the parliament of the Republic, at its first meeting in January 1919. This provided that the president was elected by the Dáil as head of a cabinet called the Ministry of Dáil Éireann. During this period, Ireland was deemed by Britain to be part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but the Irish Republic had made a unilateral Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919. On 6 December 1922, after the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Irish Free State was recognised by Britain as a sovereign state, and the position of the President of Dáil Éireann was replaced by that of President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State but, as a Dominion of the British Empire, the British monarch was head of state until the dominion status was rescinded in 1949.

==Title==
The Irish text of the Dáil Constitution referred to the leader of the state as the . In English this was translated as both &#x27;prime minister&#x27; and &#x27;president of the ministry&#x27;. The term &#x27;President of Dáil Éireann&#x27; was also used interchangeably with these terms, although this did not appear in the constitution. This was the title preferred by Éamon de Valera during his visit to the United States in 1920–1921. The president of Dáil Éireann was not its chairman, this was the role of a separate official: the .

The Dáil Constitution did not provide for a head of state and the titles initially used suggested an official who was head of government only. In practice, de Valera, particularly when abroad, called himself &quot;President de Valera&quot;, creating the impression that he was head of state. In August 1921, in the preparatory negotiations that would produce the Anglo-Irish Treaty, de Valera asked the Dáil to amend the constitution to upgrade his official status to that of head of state, in part to give him equality with George V in accrediting delegates to the negotiations. He also had the ministry restructured, with a number of offices downgraded from cabinet to sub-cabinet level.

He also maintained that, as the highest official in the Republic, the príomh aire was the head of state and that an amendment would merely bring the language of the constitution into harmony with this reality. It was first suggested that the constitution be amended to explicitly use the term &quot;president of the Republic&quot;. However, because of opposition to this, a more ambiguously worded amendment was adopted referring to the office-holder as &quot;the President who shall also be Prime Minister&quot;. After the adoption of this amendment, de Valera was elected as &quot;president of the Republic&quot; and continued to use the title until he resigned in January 1922. Both his two successors were both elected as &quot;presidents of Dáil Éireann&quot;.

==Functions==
The president of Dáil Éireann had authority to appoint the remaining members of the Ministry, subject to ratification by the Dáil, and ministers could be dismissed by the president at any time. The resignation of the president also resulted in the automatic dissolution of the whole Ministry. The president, and all other members of the cabinet, had to be members of the Dáil and could theoretically be removed from office, either collectively or individually, by a vote of the house.

In April 1919 a constitutional amendment was adopted providing for a form of vice presidency. The president was granted power to appoint a &#x27;president-substitute&#x27; or &#x27;deputy president&#x27; who would carry out his duties on a temporary basis if he was unable to discharge them.

==History==
When the First Dáil met in 1919, Éamon de Valera was the president of Sinn Féin and thus the natural choice for leadership. However he had been imprisoned in England so, at the second meeting of the Dáil on 22 January, Cathal Brugha was elected as the first príomh aire on a temporary basis. De Valera escaped Lincoln Prison in February and so was elected to replace Brugha at the Dáil&#x27;s third meeting on 1 April. As leader de Valera visited the United States from June 1919 to December 1920. His aim was to gain both popular and official recognition for the Republic, and to float a loan to finance Dáil Éireann and the War of Independence. By letter, de Valera requested that Arthur Griffith–then the Minister for Home Affairs– be appointed as Deputy President in his absence. De Valera resumed his position in the Dáil on 25 January 1921. By his return de Valera had won public but not official support for the Republic and had raised a loan of $6 million.

After the election of the Second Dáil in 1921, de Valera resigned on 26 August and was immediately re-elected, adopting the new style of President of the Republic. He then remained in office until January 1922 after the Dáil voted to ratify the Anglo-Irish Treaty. De Valera had opposed the Treaty, and resigned as president. He submitted his name for re-election but was rejected by the Dáil, which then elected Arthur Griffith on 10 January, who supported the treaty, under the previous style and title of President of Dáil Éireann.

On 16 January the British government, to implement the treaty, appointed a new Irish administration called the provisional government which over the course of the year from the date of the signing of the Treaty would succeed to functions of the Dublin Castle administration in preparation for the recognition of the Irish Free State. This administration operated in parallel with the Dáil administration, which the British government continued not to recognise. Therefore, throughout 1922, there were two parallel Irish administrations, which from January to August had different heads of government: Arthur Griffith as president of Dáil Éireann, and Michael Collins as chairman of the provisional government. Collins was also minister for finance in Griffith&#x27;s cabinet. This anomalous situation continued until Griffith and Collins both died suddenly in August 1922; Collins was shot by anti-Treaty irregulars while Griffith died of natural causes. W. T. Cosgrave was appointed chairman of the provisional government on 25 August and was later elected as President of Dáil Éireann on 9 September.

On 6 December, the Irish Free State was established as a sovereign state recognised as independent of the United Kingdom. The institution of both the Irish Republic and the provisional government came to an end as the new Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force. The Irish Free State had the king as head of state, with the Governor-General of the Irish Free State as the king&#x27;s representative, and the president of the executive council as head of government. On the day the Irish Free State came into operation, W.T. Cosgrave was nominated by the Dáil as the first president of the executive council and appointed by the governor-general.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in algebraic topology and polyhedral combinatorics, the Euler characteristic (or Euler number, or Euler–Poincaré characteristic) is a topological invariant, a number that describes a topological space&#x27;s shape or structure regardless of the way it is bent. It is commonly denoted by formula_1 (Greek lower-case letter chi).

The Euler characteristic was originally defined for polyhedra and used to prove various theorems about them, including the classification of the Platonic solids. It was stated for Platonic solids in 1537 in an unpublished manuscript by Francesco Maurolico. Leonhard Euler, for whom the concept is named, introduced it for convex polyhedra more generally but failed to rigorously prove that it is an invariant. In modern mathematics, the Euler characteristic arises from homology and, more abstractly, homological algebra.

== Polyhedra ==

The Euler characteristic was classically defined for the surfaces of polyhedra, according to the formula

:formula_2

where , , and are respectively the numbers of vertices (corners), edges and faces in the given polyhedron. Any convex polyhedron&#x27;s surface has Euler characteristic

:formula_3

This equation, stated by Euler in 1758,
is known as Euler&#x27;s polyhedron formula. It corresponds to the Euler characteristic of the sphere (i.e. formula_4), and applies identically to spherical polyhedra. An illustration of the formula on all Platonic polyhedra is given below.

The surfaces of nonconvex polyhedra can have various Euler characteristics:

For regular polyhedra, Arthur Cayley derived a modified form of Euler&#x27;s formula using the density , vertex figure density formula_5 and face density formula_6
:formula_7
This version holds both for convex polyhedra (where the densities are all 1) and the non-convex Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra.

Projective polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 1, like the real projective plane, while the surfaces of toroidal polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 0, like the torus.

===Plane graphs===

The Euler characteristic can be defined for connected plane graphs by the same formula_8 formula as for polyhedral surfaces, where is the number of faces in the graph, including the exterior face.

The Euler characteristic of any plane connected graph is 2. This is easily proved by induction on the number of faces determined by , starting with a tree as the base case. For trees, formula_9 and formula_10 If has components (disconnected graphs), the same argument by induction on shows that formula_11 One of the few graph theory papers of Cauchy also proves this result.

Via stereographic projection the plane maps to the 2-sphere, such that a connected graph maps to a polygonal decomposition of the sphere, which has Euler characteristic 2. This viewpoint is implicit in Cauchy&#x27;s proof of Euler&#x27;s formula given below.

===Proof of Euler&#x27;s formula===
There are many proofs of Euler&#x27;s formula. One was given by Cauchy in 1811, as follows. It applies to any convex polyhedron, and more generally to any polyhedron whose boundary is topologically equivalent to a sphere and whose faces are topologically equivalent to disks.

Remove one face of the polyhedral surface. By pulling the edges of the missing face away from each other, deform all the rest into a planar graph of points and curves, in such a way that the perimeter of the missing face is placed externally, surrounding the graph obtained, as illustrated by the first of the three graphs for the special case of the cube. (The assumption that the polyhedral surface is homeomorphic to the sphere at the beginning is what makes this possible.) After this deformation, the regular faces are generally not regular anymore. The number of vertices and edges has remained the same, but the number of faces has been reduced by 1. Therefore, proving Euler&#x27;s formula for the polyhedron reduces to proving formula_12 for this deformed, planar object.

If there is a face with more than three sides, draw a diagonal—that is, a curve through the face connecting two vertices that are not yet connected. Each new diagonal adds one edge and one face and does not change the number of vertices, so it does not change the quantity formula_13 (The assumption that all faces are disks is needed here, to show via the Jordan curve theorem that this operation increases the number of faces by one.) Continue adding edges in this manner until all of the faces are triangular.

Apply repeatedly either of the following two transformations, maintaining the invariant that the exterior boundary is always a simple cycle:
#Remove a triangle with only one edge adjacent to the exterior, as illustrated by the second graph. This decreases the number of edges and faces by one each and does not change the number of vertices, so it preserves formula_13
#Remove a triangle with two edges shared by the exterior of the network, as illustrated by the third graph. Each triangle removal removes a vertex, two edges and one face, so it preserves formula_13
These transformations eventually reduce the planar graph to a single triangle. (Without the simple-cycle invariant, removing a triangle might disconnect the remaining triangles, invalidating the rest of the argument. A valid removal order is an elementary example of a shelling.)

At this point the lone triangle has formula_16formula_17 and formula_18 so that formula_19 Since each of the two above transformation steps preserved this quantity, we have shown formula_12 for the deformed, planar object thus demonstrating formula_21 for the polyhedron. This proves the theorem.

For additional proofs, see Eppstein (2013). Multiple proofs, including their flaws and limitations, are used as examples in &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; by Lakatos (1976).

==Topological definition==
The polyhedral surfaces discussed above are, in modern language, two-dimensional finite CW-complexes. (When only triangular faces are used, they are two-dimensional finite simplicial complexes.) In general, for any finite CW-complex, the Euler characteristic can be defined as the alternating sum

:formula_22

where &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the number of cells of dimension &quot;n&quot; in the complex.

Similarly, for a simplicial complex, the Euler characteristic equals the alternating sum

:formula_22

where &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the number of &quot;n&quot;-simplexes in the complex.

===Betti number alternative===
More generally still, for any topological space, we can define the &quot;n&quot;th Betti number &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; as the rank of the &quot;n&quot;-th singular homology group. The Euler characteristic can then be defined as the alternating sum

:formula_24

This quantity is well-defined if the Betti numbers are all finite and if they are zero beyond a certain index &quot;n&quot;0. For simplicial complexes, this is not the same definition as in the previous paragraph but a homology computation shows that the two definitions will give the same value for formula_25.

==Properties==

The Euler characteristic behaves well with respect to many basic operations on topological spaces, as follows.

===Homotopy invariance===
Homology is a topological invariant, and moreover a homotopy invariant: Two topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent have isomorphic homology groups. It follows that the Euler characteristic is also a homotopy invariant.

For example, any contractible space (that is, one homotopy equivalent to a point) has trivial homology, meaning that the 0th Betti number is 1 and the others 0. Therefore, its Euler characteristic is 1. This case includes Euclidean space formula_26 of any dimension, as well as the solid unit ball in any Euclidean space — the one-dimensional interval, the two-dimensional disk, the three-dimensional ball, etc.

For another example, any convex polyhedron is homeomorphic to the three-dimensional ball, so its surface is homeomorphic (hence homotopy equivalent) to the two-dimensional sphere, which has Euler characteristic 2. This explains why the surface of a convex polyhedron has Euler characteristic 2.

===Inclusion–exclusion principle===
If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are any two topological spaces, then the Euler characteristic of their disjoint union is the sum of their Euler characteristics, since homology is additive under disjoint union:

:formula_27

More generally, if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are subspaces of a larger space &quot;X&quot;, then so are their union and intersection. In some cases, the Euler characteristic obeys a version of the inclusion–exclusion principle:

:formula_28

This is true in the following cases:

*if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are an excisive couple. In particular, if the interiors of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; inside the union still cover the union.
*if &quot;X&quot; is a locally compact space, and one uses Euler characteristics with compact supports, no assumptions on &quot;M&quot; or &quot;N&quot; are needed.
*if &quot;X&quot; is a stratified space all of whose strata are even-dimensional, the inclusion–exclusion principle holds if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are unions of strata. This applies in particular if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are subvarieties of a complex algebraic variety.

In general, the inclusion–exclusion principle is false. A counterexample is given by taking &quot;X&quot; to be the real line, &quot;M&quot; a subset consisting of one point and &quot;N&quot; the complement of &quot;M&quot;.

===Connected sum===

For two connected closed n-manifolds formula_29 one can obtain a new connected manifold formula_30 via the connected sum operation. The Euler characteristic is related by the formula 

:formula_31

===Product property===
Also, the Euler characteristic of any product space &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot; is

:formula_32

These addition and multiplication properties are also enjoyed by cardinality of sets. In this way, the Euler characteristic can be viewed as a generalisation of cardinality; see .

===Covering spaces===

Similarly, for a &quot;k&quot;-sheeted covering space formula_33 one has
:formula_34
More generally, for a ramified covering space, the Euler characteristic of the cover can be computed from the above, with a correction factor for the ramification points, which yields the Riemann–Hurwitz formula.

===Fibration property===
The product property holds much more generally, for fibrations with certain conditions.

If formula_35 is a fibration with fiber &quot;F,&quot; with the base &quot;B&quot; path-connected, and the fibration is orientable over a field &quot;K,&quot; then the Euler characteristic with coefficients in the field &quot;K&quot; satisfies the product property:
:formula_36
This includes product spaces and covering spaces as special cases,
and can be proven by the Serre spectral sequence on homology of a fibration.

For fiber bundles, this can also be understood in terms of a transfer map formula_37 – note that this is a lifting and goes &quot;the wrong way&quot; – whose composition with the projection map formula_38 is multiplication by the Euler class of the fiber:
:formula_39

==Examples==

===Surfaces===
The Euler characteristic can be calculated easily for general surfaces by finding a polygonization of the surface (that is, a description as a CW-complex) and using the above definitions.
===Soccer ball===

It is common to construct soccer balls by stitching together pentagonal and hexagonal pieces, with three pieces meeting at each vertex (see for example the Adidas Telstar). If pentagons and hexagons are used, then there are formula_40 faces, formula_41 vertices, and formula_42 edges. The Euler characteristic is thus

: formula_43

Because the sphere has Euler characteristic 2, it follows that formula_44 That is, a soccer ball constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. The number of hexagons can be any nonnegative integer except 1.
This result is applicable to fullerenes and Goldberg polyhedra.

===Arbitrary dimensions===
The  dimensional sphere has singular homology groups equal to
:formula_45

hence has Betti number 1 in dimensions 0 and , and all other Betti numbers are 0. Its Euler characteristic is then that is, either 0 if is odd, or 2 if is even.

The  dimensional real projective space is the quotient of the  sphere by the antipodal map. It follows that its Euler characteristic is exactly half that of the corresponding sphere – either 0 or 1.

The  dimensional torus is the product space of  circles. Its Euler characteristic is 0, by the product property. More generally, any compact parallelizable manifold, including any compact Lie group, has Euler characteristic 0.

The Euler characteristic of any closed odd-dimensional manifold is also 0. The case for orientable examples is a corollary of Poincaré duality. This property applies more generally to any compact stratified space all of whose strata have odd dimension. It also applies to closed odd-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, via the two-to-one orientable double cover.

== Relations to other invariants ==
The Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface can be calculated from its genus (the number of tori in a connected sum decomposition of the surface; intuitively, the number of &quot;handles&quot;) as

:formula_46

The Euler characteristic of a closed non-orientable surface can be calculated from its non-orientable genus (the number of real projective planes in a connected sum decomposition of the surface) as

:formula_47

For closed smooth manifolds, the Euler characteristic coincides with the Euler number, i.e., the Euler class of its tangent bundle evaluated on the fundamental class of a manifold. The Euler class, in turn, relates to all other characteristic classes of vector bundles.

For closed Riemannian manifolds, the Euler characteristic can also be found by integrating the curvature; see the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for the two-dimensional case and the generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem for the general case.

A discrete analog of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem is Descartes&#x27; theorem that the &quot;total defect&quot; of a polyhedron, measured in full circles, is the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron.

Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem characterizes the Euler characteristic as the &quot;unique&quot; (up to scalar multiplication) translation-invariant, finitely additive, not-necessarily-nonnegative set function defined on finite unions of compact convex sets in that is &quot;homogeneous of degree 0&quot;.

==Generalizations==
For every combinatorial cell complex, one defines the Euler characteristic as the number of 0-cells, minus the number of 1-cells, plus the number of 2-cells, etc., if this alternating sum is finite. In particular, the Euler characteristic of a finite set is simply its cardinality, and the Euler characteristic of a graph is the number of vertices minus the number of edges. (Olaf Post calls this a &quot;well-known formula&quot;.)

More generally, one can define the Euler characteristic of any chain complex to be the alternating sum of the ranks of the homology groups of the chain complex, assuming that all these ranks are finite.

A version of Euler characteristic used in algebraic geometry is as follows. For any coherent sheaf formula_48 on a proper scheme , one defines its Euler characteristic to be
:formula_49
where formula_50 is the dimension of the -th sheaf cohomology group of formula_48. In this case, the dimensions are all finite by Grothendieck&#x27;s finiteness theorem. This is an instance of the Euler characteristic of a chain complex, where the chain complex is a finite resolution of formula_52 by acyclic sheaves.

Another generalization of the concept of Euler characteristic on manifolds comes from orbifolds (see Euler characteristic of an orbifold). While every manifold has an integer Euler characteristic, an orbifold can have a fractional Euler characteristic. For example, the teardrop orbifold has Euler characteristic where is a prime number corresponding to the cone angle .

The concept of Euler characteristic of the reduced homology of a bounded finite poset is another generalization, important in combinatorics. A poset is &quot;bounded&quot; if it has smallest and largest elements; call them 0 and 1. The Euler characteristic of such a poset is defined as the integer , where is the Möbius function in that poset&#x27;s incidence algebra.

This can be further generalized by defining a rational valued Euler characteristic for certain finite categories, a notion compatible with the Euler characteristics of graphs, orbifolds and posets mentioned above. In this setting, the Euler characteristic of a finite group or monoid is , and the Euler characteristic of a finite groupoid is the sum of , where we picked one representative group for each connected component of the groupoid.

<text>The plural (sometimes abbreviated as pl., pl, or ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. The plural of a noun typically denotes a quantity greater than the default quantity represented by that noun. This default quantity is most commonly one (a form that represents this default quantity of one is said to be of &quot;singular&quot; number). Therefore, plurals most typically denote two or more of something, although they may also denote fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word &quot;boys&quot;, which corresponds to the singular &quot;boy&quot;.

Words of other types, such as verbs, adjectives and pronouns, also frequently have distinct plural forms, which are used in agreement with the number of their associated nouns.

Some languages also have a dual (denoting exactly two of something) or other systems of number categories. However, in English and many other languages, singular and plural are the only grammatical numbers, except for possible remnants of dual number in pronouns such as &quot;both&quot; and &quot;either&quot;, and in tendency for stock phrases to use &quot;two&quot; as an umbrella term for &quot;many&quot; (eg &quot;double jeopardy&quot; includes prosecuting a person three, four or a dozen times on the same charge).

==Use in systems of grammatical number ==
In many languages, there is also a dual number (used for indicating two objects). Some other grammatical numbers present in various languages include trial (for three objects) and paucal (for an imprecise but small number of objects). In languages with dual, trial, or paucal numbers, plural refers to numbers higher than those. However, numbers besides singular, plural, and (to a lesser extent) dual are extremely rare. Languages with numerical classifiers such as Chinese and Japanese lack any significant grammatical number at all, though they are likely to have plural personal pronouns.

Some languages (like Mele-Fila) distinguish between a plural and a greater plural. A greater plural refers to an abnormally large number for the object of discussion. The distinction between the paucal, the plural, and the greater plural is often relative to the type of object under discussion. For example, in discussing oranges, the paucal number might imply fewer than ten, whereas for the population of a country, it might be used for a few hundred thousand.

The Austronesian languages of Sursurunga and Lihir have extremely complex grammatical number systems, with singular, dual, paucal, greater paucal, and plural.

Traces of the dual and paucal can be found in some Slavic and Baltic languages (apart from those that preserve the dual number, such as Slovene). These are known as &quot;pseudo-dual&quot; and &quot;pseudo-paucal&quot; grammatical numbers. For example, Polish and Russian use different forms of nouns with the numerals 2, 3, or 4 (and higher numbers ending with these) than with the numerals 5, 6, etc. (genitive singular in Russian and nominative plural in Polish in the former case, genitive plural in the latter case). Also some nouns may follow different declension patterns when denoting objects which are typically referred to in pairs. For example, in Polish, the noun &quot;, among other meanings, may refer to a human or animal eye or to a drop of oil on water. The plural of &quot; in the first meaning is &quot; (even if actually referring to more than two eyes), while in the second it is &quot; (even if actually referring to exactly two drops).

Traces of dual can also be found in Modern Hebrew. Biblical Hebrew had grammatical dual via the suffix as opposed to for masculine words. Contemporary use of a true dual number in Hebrew is chiefly used in words regarding time and numbers. However, in Biblical and Modern Hebrew, the pseudo-dual as plural of &quot;eyes&quot; &quot;eye / eyes&quot; as well as &quot;hands&quot;, &quot;legs&quot; and several other words are retained. For further information, see .

Certain nouns in some languages have the unmarked form referring to multiple items, with an inflected form referring to a single item. These cases are described with the terms &quot;collective number&quot; and &quot;singulative number&quot;. Some languages may possess a massive plural and a numerative plural, the first implying a large mass and the second implying division (like the English modifer &quot;respective[ly]&quot;). For example, &quot;the [combined] waters of the Atlantic Ocean&quot; versus, &quot;the waters of [each of] the Great Lakes [respectively]&quot;.

Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann uses the term &quot;superplural&quot; to refer to massive plural. He argues that the Australian Aboriginal Barngarla language has four grammatical numbers: singular, dual, plural and &quot;superplural&quot;. For example:
*&quot;&quot; &quot;emu&quot; (singular)
*&quot;&quot; &quot;two emus&quot; (dual)
*&quot;&quot; &quot;emus&quot; (plural)
*&quot;&quot; &quot;a lot of emus&quot;, &quot;heaps of emus&quot; (superplural)

==Formation of plurals==
A given language may make plural forms of nouns by various types of inflection, including the addition of affixes, like the English &quot;-(e)s&quot; and &quot;-ies&quot; suffixes, or ablaut, as in the derivation of the plural &quot;geese&quot; from &quot;goose&quot;, or a combination of the two. Some languages may also form plurals by reduplication, but not as productively. It may be that some nouns are not marked for plural at all, like &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;series&quot; in English. In languages which also have a case system, such as Latin and Russian, nouns can have not just one plural form but several, corresponding to the various cases. The inflection might affect multiple words, not just the noun; the noun itself need not become plural as such, with other parts of the expression indicating the plurality.

In English, the most common formation of plural nouns is by adding an &quot;-s&quot; suffix to the singular noun. (For details and different cases, see English plurals.) Just like in English, noun plurals in French, Spanish, and Portuguese are also typically formed by adding an &quot;-s&quot; suffix to the lemma form, sometimes combining it with an additional vowel. (In French, however, this plural suffix is often not pronounced.) This construction is also found in German and Dutch, but only in some nouns. Suffixing is cross-linguistically the most common method of forming plurals.

In Welsh, the reference form, or default quantity, of some nouns is plural, and the singular form is formed from it, e.g., &quot;llygod&quot;, mice -&gt; &quot;llygoden&quot;, mouse; &quot;erfin&quot;, turnips -&gt; &quot;erfinen&quot;, turnip.

==Plural forms of other parts of speech==
In many languages, words other than nouns may take plural forms, these being used by way of grammatical agreement with plural nouns (or noun phrases). Such a word may in fact have a number of plural forms, to allow for simultaneous agreement within other categories such as case, person and gender, as well as marking of categories belonging to the word itself (such as tense of verbs, degree of comparison of adjectives, etc.)

Verbs often agree with their subject in number (as well as in person and sometimes gender). Examples of plural forms are the French &quot;mangeons, mangez, mangent&quot; – respectively the first-, second- and third-person plural of the present tense of the verb &quot;manger&quot;. In English a distinction is made in the third person between forms such as &quot;eats&quot; (singular) and &quot;eat&quot; (plural).

Adjectives may agree with the noun they modify; examples of plural forms are the French &quot;petits&quot; and &quot;petites&quot; (the masculine plural and feminine plural respectively of &quot;petit&quot;). The same applies to some determiners – examples are the French plural definite article &quot;les&quot;, and the English demonstratives &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot;.

It is common for pronouns, particularly personal pronouns, to have distinct plural forms. Examples in English are &quot;we&quot; (&quot;us&quot;, etc.) and &quot;they&quot; (&quot;them&quot; etc.; see English personal pronouns), and again &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot; (when used as demonstrative pronouns).

In Welsh, a number of common prepositions also inflect to agree with the number, person, and sometimes gender of the noun or pronoun they govern.

==Nouns lacking plural or singular form==
Certain nouns do not form plurals. A large class of such nouns in many languages is that of uncountable nouns, representing mass or abstract concepts such as &quot;air&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, &quot;physics&quot;. However, many nouns of this type also have countable meanings or other contexts in which a plural can be used; for example &quot;water&quot; can take a plural when it means water from a particular source (&quot;different waters make for different beers&quot;) and in expressions like &quot;by the waters of Babylon&quot;.

Certain collective nouns do not have a singular form and exist only in the plural, such as &quot;clothes&quot;.

There are also nouns found exclusively or almost exclusively in the plural, such as the English &quot;scissors&quot;. These are referred to with the term &quot;plurale tantum&quot;. Occasionally, a plural form can pull double duty as the singular form (or vice versa), as has happened with the word &quot;data&quot;.

==Usage of the plural==
The plural is used, as a rule, for quantities other than one (and other than those quantities represented by other grammatical numbers, such as dual, which a language may possess). Thus it is frequently used with numbers higher than one (&quot;two cats&quot;, &quot;101 dogs&quot;, &quot;four and a half hours&quot;) and for unspecified amounts of countable things (&quot;some men&quot;, &quot;several cakes&quot;, &quot;how many lumps?&quot;, &quot;birds have feathers&quot;). The precise rules for the use of plurals, however, depends on the language – for example Russian uses the genitive singular rather than the plural after certain numbers (see above).

Treatments differ in expressions of zero quantity: English often uses the plural in such expressions as &quot;no injuries&quot; and &quot;zero points&quot;, although &quot;no&quot; (and &quot;zero&quot; in some contexts) may also take a singular. In French, the singular form is used after &quot;zéro&quot;.

English also tends to use the plural with decimal fractions, even if less than one, as in &quot;0.3 metres&quot;, &quot;0.9 children&quot;. Common fractions less than one tend to be used with singular expressions: &quot;half (of) a loaf&quot;, &quot;two-thirds of a mile&quot;. Negative numbers are usually treated the same as the corresponding positive ones: &quot;minus one degree&quot;, &quot;minus two degrees&quot;. Again, rules on such matters differ between languages.

In some languages, including English, expressions that appear to be singular in form may be treated as plural if they are used with a plural sense, as in &quot;the government are agreed&quot;. The reverse is also possible: &quot;the United States is a powerful country&quot;. See synesis, and also .

== POS tagging ==
In part-of-speech tagging notation, tags are used to distinguish different types of plurals based on their grammatical and semantic context. Resolution varies, for example the Penn-Treebank tagset (~36 tags) has two tags: &quot;NNS - noun, plural,&quot; and &quot;NPS - Proper noun, plural&quot;, while the CLAWS 7 tagset (~149 tags) uses six: &quot;NN2 - plural common noun, NNL2 - plural locative noun, NNO2 - numeral noun, plural, NNT2 - temporal noun, plural, NNU2 - plural unit of measurement, NP2 - plural proper noun.&quot;

<text>The Michigan Terminal System (MTS) is one of the first time-sharing computer operating systems. Created in 1967 at the University of Michigan for use on IBM S/360-67, S/370 and compatible mainframe computers, it was developed and used by a consortium of eight universities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom over a period of 33 years (1967 to 1999).

==Overview==
The University of Michigan Multiprogramming Supervisor (UMMPS) was initially developed by the staff of the academic computing center at the University of Michigan for operation of the IBM S/360-67, S/370 and compatible computers. The software may be described as a multiprogramming, multiprocessing, virtual memory, time-sharing supervisor that runs multiple resident, reentrant programs. Among these programs is the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) for command interpretation, execution control, file management, and accounting. End-users interact with the computing resources through MTS using terminal, batch, and server oriented facilities.

The name MTS refers to:
*The UMMPS Job Program with which most end-users interact;
*The software system, including UMMPS, the MTS and other Job Programs, Command Language Subsystems (CLSs), public files (programs), and documentation; and
*The time-sharing service offered at a particular site, including the MTS software system, the hardware used to run MTS, the staff that supported MTS and assisted end-users, and the associated administrative policies and procedures.

MTS was used on a production basis at about 13 sites in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and possibly in Yugoslavia and at several more sites on a trial or benchmarking basis. MTS was developed and maintained by a core group of eight universities included in the MTS Consortium.

The University of Michigan announced in 1988 that &quot;Reliable MTS service will be provided as long as there are users requiring it ... MTS may be phased out after alternatives are able to meet users&#x27; computing requirements&quot;. It ceased operating MTS for end-users on June 30, 1996. By that time, most services had moved to client/server-based computing systems, typically Unix for servers and various Mac, PC, and Unix flavors for clients. The University of Michigan shut down its MTS system for the last time on May 30, 1997.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is believed to be the last site to use MTS in a production environment. RPI retired MTS in June 1999.

Today, MTS still runs using IBM S/370 emulators such as Hercules, Sim390, and FLEX-ES.

==Origins==
In the mid-1960s, the University of Michigan was providing batch processing services on IBM 7090 hardware under the control of the University of Michigan Executive System (UMES), but was interested in offering interactive services using time-sharing. At that time the work that computers could perform was limited by their small real memory capacity. When IBM introduced its System/360 family of computers in the mid-1960s, it did not provide a solution for this limitation and within IBM there were conflicting views about the importance of and need to support time-sharing.

A paper titled &quot;Program and Addressing Structure in a Time-Sharing Environment&quot; by Bruce Arden, Bernard Galler, Frank Westervelt (all associate directors at UM&#x27;s academic Computing Center), and Tom O&#x27;Brian building upon some basic ideas developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was published in January 1966. The paper outlined a virtual memory architecture using dynamic address translation (DAT) that could be used to implement time-sharing.

After a year of negotiations and design studies, IBM agreed to make a one-of-a-kind version of its S/360-65 mainframe computer with dynamic address translation (DAT) features that would support virtual memory and accommodate UM&#x27;s desire to support time-sharing. The computer was dubbed the Model S/360-65M. The &quot;M&quot; stood for Michigan. But IBM initially decided not to supply a time-sharing operating system for the machine. Meanwhile, a number of other institutions heard about the project, including General Motors, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, Princeton University, and Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon University). They were all intrigued by the time-sharing idea and expressed interest in ordering the modified IBM S/360 series machines. With this demonstrated interest IBM changed the computer&#x27;s model number to S/360-67 and made it a supported product. With requests for over 100 new model S/360-67s IBM realized there was a market for time-sharing, and agreed to develop a new time-sharing operating system called TSS/360 (TSS stood for Time-sharing System) for delivery at roughly the same time as the first model S/360-67.

While waiting for the Model 65M to arrive, UM Computing Center personnel were able to perform early time-sharing experiments using an IBM System/360 Model 50 that was funded by the ARPA CONCOMP (Conversational Use of Computers) Project. The time-sharing experiment began as a &quot;half-page of code written out on a kitchen table&quot; combined with a small multi-programming system, LLMPS from MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, which was modified and became the UM Multi-Programming Supervisor (UMMPS) which in turn ran the MTS job program. This earliest incarnation of MTS was intended as a throw-away system used to gain experience with the new IBM S/360 hardware and which would be discarded when IBM&#x27;s TSS/360 operating system became available.

Development of TSS took longer than anticipated, its delivery date was delayed, and it was not yet available when the S/360-67 (serial number 2) arrived at the Computing Center in January 1967. At this time UM had to decide whether to return the Model 67 and select another mainframe or to develop MTS as an interim system for use until TSS was ready. The decision was to continue development of MTS and the staff moved their initial development work from the Model 50 to the Model 67. TSS development was eventually canceled by IBM, then reinstated, and then canceled again. But by this time UM liked the system they had developed, it was no longer considered interim, and MTS would be used at UM and other sites for 33 years.

==MTS Consortium==
MTS was developed, maintained, and used by a consortium of eight universities in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom:

*University of Michigan (UM), 1967 to 1997, US
*University of British Columbia (UBC), 1968 to 1998, Canada
*NUMAC (University of Newcastle upon Tyne, University of Durham, and Newcastle Polytechnic), 1969 to 1992, United Kingdom
*University of Alberta (UQV), 1971 to 1994, Canada
*Wayne State University (WSU), 1971 to 1998, US
*Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), 1976 to 1999, US
*Simon Fraser University (SFU), 1977 to 1992, Canada
*University of Durham (NUMAC), 1982 to 1992, United Kingdom

Several sites ran more than one MTS system: NUMAC ran two (first at Newcastle and later at Durham), Michigan ran three in the mid-1980s (UM for Maize, UB for Blue, and HG at Human Genetics), UBC ran three or four at different times (MTS-G, MTS-L, MTS-A, and MTS-I for general, library, administration, and instruction).

Each of the MTS sites made contributions to the development of MTS, sometimes by taking the lead in the design and implementation of a new feature and at other times by refining, enhancing, and critiquing work done elsewhere. Many MTS components are the work of multiple people at multiple sites.

In the early days collaboration between the MTS sites was accomplished through a combination of face-to-face site visits, phone calls, the exchange of documents and magnetic tapes by snail mail, and informal get-togethers at SHARE or other meetings. Later, e-mail, computer conferencing using CONFER and *Forum, network file transfer, and e-mail attachments supplemented and eventually largely replaced the earlier methods.

The members of the MTS Consortium produced a series of 82 &quot;MTS Newsletters&quot; between 1971 and 1982 to help coordinate MTS development.

Starting at UBC in 1974 the MTS Consortium held annual &quot;MTS Workshops&quot; at one of the member sites. The workshops were informal, but included papers submitted in advance and &quot;Proceedings&quot; published after-the-fact that included session summaries. In the mid-1980s several &quot;Western Workshops&quot; were held with participation by a subset of the MTS sites (UBC, SFU, UQV, UM, and possibly RPI).

The annual workshops continued even after MTS development work began to taper off. Called simply the &quot;community workshop&quot;, they continued until the mid-1990s to share expertise and common experiences in providing computing services, even though MTS was no longer the primary source for computing on their campuses and some had stopped running MTS entirely.

===MTS sites===
In addition to the eight MTS Consortium sites that were involved in its development, MTS was run at a number of other sites, including:

*Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) within the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Brazil
*Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA), Brazil
*Hewlett-Packard (HP), US
*Michigan State University (MSU), US
*Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), US

A copy of MTS was also sent to the University of Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, though whether or not it was ever installed is not known.

INRIA, the French national institute for research in computer science and control in Grenoble, France ran MTS on a trial basis, as did the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, Southern Illinois University, the Naval Postgraduate School, Amdahl Corporation, ST Systems for McGill University Hospitals, Stanford University, and University of Illinois in the United States, and a few other sites.

==Hardware==

In theory MTS will run on the IBM S/360-67, any of the IBM S/370 series which include virtual memory, and their successors. MTS has been run
on the following computers in production, benchmarking, or trial configurations:
*IBM: S/360-67, S/370-148, S/370-168, 3033U, 4341, 4361, 4381, 3081D, 3081GX, 3083B, 3090–200, 3090–400, 3090–600, and ES/9000-720
*Amdahl: 470V/6, 470V/7, 470V/8, 5860, 5870, 5990
*Hitachi: NAS 9060
*Various S/370 emulators

The University of Michigan installed and ran MTS on the first IBM S/360-67 outside of IBM (serial number 2) in 1967, the second Amdahl 470V/6 (serial number 2) in 1975, the first Amdahl 5860 (serial number 1) in 1982, and the first factory shipped IBM 3090–400 in 1986. NUMAC ran MTS on the first S/360-67 in the UK and very likely the first in Europe. The University of British Columbia (UBC) took the lead in converting MTS to run on the IBM S/370 series (an IBM S/370-168) in 1974. The University of Alberta installed the first Amdahl 470V/6 in Canada (serial number P5) in 1975. By 1978 NUMAC (at University of Newcastle upon Tyne and University of Durham) had moved main MTS activity on to its IBM S/370 series (an IBM S/370-168).

MTS was designed to support up to four processors on the IBM S/360-67, although IBM only produced one (simplex and half-duplex) and two (duplex) processor configurations of the Model 67. In 1984 RPI updated MTS to support up to 32 processors in the IBM S/370-XA (Extended Addressing) hardware series, although 6 processors is likely the largest configuration actually used. MTS supports the IBM Vector Facility, available as an option on the IBM 3090 and ES/9000 systems.

In early 1967 running on the single processor IBM S/360-67 at UM without virtual memory support, MTS was typically supporting 5 simultaneous terminal sessions and one batch job. In November 1967 after virtual memory support was added, MTS running on the same IBM S/360-67 was simultaneously supporting 50 terminal sessions and up to 5 batch jobs. In August 1968 a dual processor IBM S/360-67 replaced the single processor system, supporting roughly 70 terminal and up to 8 batch jobs. By late 1991 MTS at UM was running on an IBM ES/9000-720 supporting over 600 simultaneous terminal sessions and from 3 to 8 batch jobs.

MTS can be IPL-ed under VM/370, and some MTS sites did so, but most ran MTS on native hardware without using a virtual machine.

==Features==
Some of the notable features of MTS include:

*The use of Virtual memory and Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) on the IBM S/360-67 in 1967.
*The use of multiprocessing on an IBM S/360-67 with two CPUs in 1968.
*Programs with access to (for the time) very large virtual address spaces.
*A straightforward command language that is the same for both terminal and batch jobs.
*A strong device independent input/output model that allows the same commands and programs to access terminals, disk files, printers, magnetic and paper tapes, card readers and punches, floppy disks, network hosts, and an audio response unit (ARU).
*A file system with support for &quot;line files&quot; where the line numbers and length of individual lines are stored as metadata separate from the data contents of the line, and the ability to read, insert, replace, and delete individual lines anywhere in the file without the need to read or write the entire file.
*A file editor ($EDIT) with both command line and &quot;visual&quot; interfaces and pattern matching based on SNOBOL4 patterns.
*The ability to share files in controlled ways (read, write-change, write-expand, destroy, permit).
*The ability to permit files, not just to other user IDs and projects (aka groups), but to specific commands or programs and combinations of user IDs, projects, commands and programs.
*The ability for multiple users to manage simultaneous access to files with the ability to implicitly and explicitly lock and unlock files and to detect deadlocks.

*Network host to host access from commands and programs as well as access to or from remote network printers, card readers and punches.
*An e-mail system ($MESSAGESYSTEM) that supports local and network mail with the ability to send to groups, to recall messages that haven&#x27;t already been read, to add recipients to messages after they have been sent, and to display a history of messages in an e-mail chain without the need to include the text from older messages in each new message.
*The ability to access tapes remotely, and to handle data sets that extend across multiple tapes efficiently.
*The availability of a rich collection of well-documented subroutine libraries.
*The ability for multiple users to quickly load and use a collection of common reentrant subroutines, which are available in shared virtual memory.
*The availability of compilers, assemblers, and a Symbolic Debugging System (SDS) that allow users to debug programs written in high-level languages such as FORTRAN, Pascal, PL/I, ... as well as in assembly language.
*A strong protection model that uses the virtual memory hardware and the S/360 and S/370 hardware&#x27;s supervisor and problem states and via software divides problem state execution into system (privileged or unprotected) and user (protected or unprivileged) modes. Relatively little code runs in supervisor state. For example, Device Support Routines (DSRs, aka device drivers) are not part of the supervisor and run in system mode in problem state rather than in supervisor state.
*A simulated Branch on Program Interrupt (BPI) instruction.

==System architecture==


UMMPS, the supervisor, has complete control of the hardware and manages a collection of job programs. One of the job programs is MTS, the job program with which most users interact. MTS operates as a collection of command language subsystems (CLSs). One of the CLSs allows for the execution of user programs. MTS provides a collection of system subroutines that are available to CLSs, user programs, and MTS itself. Among other things these system subroutines provide standard access to Device Support Routines (DSRs), the components that perform device dependent input/output.

==Manuals and documentation==
The lists that follow are quite University of Michigan centric. Most other MTS sites used some of this material, but they also produced their own manuals, memos, reports, and newsletters tailored to the needs of their site.

===End-user documentation===
The manual series &quot;MTS: The Michigan Terminal System&quot;, was published from 1967 through 1991, in volumes 1 through 23, which were updated and reissued irregularly. Initial releases of the volumes did not always occur in numeric order and volumes occasionally changed names when they were updated or republished. In general, the higher the number, the more specialized the volume.

The earliest versions of &quot;MTS Volume I and II&quot; had a different organization and content from the MTS volumes that followed and included some internal as well as end user documentation. The second edition from December 1967 covered:
*&quot;MTS Volume I&quot;: Introduction; Concepts and facilities; Calling conventions; Batch, Terminal, Tape, and Data Concentrator user&#x27;s guides; Description of UMMPS and MTS; Files and devices; Command language; User Programs; Subroutine and macro library descriptions; Public or library file descriptions; and Internal specifications: Dynamic loader (UMLOAD), File and Device Management (DSRI prefix and postfix), Device Support Routines (DSRs), and File routines
*&quot;MTS Volume II&quot;: Language processor descriptions: F-level assembler; FORTRAN G; IOH/360; PIL; SNOBOL4; UMIST; WATFOR; and 8ASS (PDP-8 assembler)

Various aspects of MTS at the University of Michigan were documented in a series of &quot;Computing Center Memos&quot; (CCMemos) which were published irregularly from 1967 through 1987, numbered 2 through 924, though not necessarily in chronological order. Numbers 2 through 599 are general memos about various software and hardware; the 600 series are the Consultant&#x27;s Notes series—short memos for beginning to intermediate users; the 800 series covers issues relating to the Xerox 9700 printer, text processing, and typesetting; and the 900 series covers microcomputers. There was no 700 series. In 1989 this series continued as &quot;Reference Memos&quot; with less of a focus on MTS.
A long run of newsletters targeted to end-users at the University of Michigan with the titles &quot;Computing Center News&quot;, &quot;Computing Center Newsletter&quot;, &quot;U-M Computing News&quot;, and the &quot;Information Technology Digest&quot; were published starting in 1971.

There was also introductory material presented in the &quot;User Guide&quot;, &quot;MTS User Guide&quot;, and &quot;Tutorial&quot; series, including:

*&quot;Getting connected—Introduction to Terminals and Microcomputers&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to the Computing Center&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Computing Center services&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Database Management Systems on MTS&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to FORMAT&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Magnetic Tapes&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to MTS&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to the MTS File Editor&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Programming and Debugging in MTS&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Terminals&quot;
*&quot;Introduction to Terminals and Microcomputers&quot;

===Internals documentation===
The following materials were not widely distributed, but were included in MTS Distributions:

*MTS Operators Manual
*MTS Message Manual
*MTS Volume &quot;n&quot;: Systems Edition
*MTS Volume 99: Internals Documentation

==Distribution==
The University of Michigan released MTS on magnetic tape on an irregular basis. There were full and partial distributions, where &quot;full distributions&quot; (D1.0, D2.0, ...) included all of the MTS components and &quot;partial distributions&quot; (D1.1, D1.2, D2.1, D2.2, ...) included just the components that had changed since the last full or partial distribution. Distributions 1.0 through 3.1 supported the IBM S/360 Model 67, distribution 3.2 supported both the IBM S/360-67 and the IBM S/370 architecture, and distributions D4.0 through D6.0 supported just the IBM S/370 architecture and its extensions.

MTS distributions included the updates needed to run licensed program products and other proprietary software under MTS, but not the base proprietary software itself, which had to be obtained separately from the owners. Except for IBM&#x27;s Assembler H, none of the licensed programs were required to run MTS.

The last MTS distribution was D6.0 released in April 1988. It consisted of 10,003 files on six 6250 bpi magnetic tapes. After 1988, distribution of MTS components was done in an ad hoc fashion using network file transfer.

To allow new sites to get started from scratch, two additional magnetic tapes were made available, an IPLable &quot;boot tape&quot; that contained a minimalist version of MTS plus the DASDI and DISKCOPY utilities that could be used to initialize and restore a &quot;one disk pack starter version&quot; of MTS from the second magnetic tape. In the earliest days of MTS, the standalone TSS DASDI and DUMP/RESTORE utilities rather than MTS itself were used to create the one-disk starter system.

There were also less formal &quot;redistributions&quot; where individual sites would send magnetic tapes containing new or updated work to a coordinating site. That site would copy the material to a common magnetic tape (RD1, RD2, ...), and send copies of the tape out to all of the sites. The contents of most of the redistribution tapes seem to have been lost.

Today, complete materials from the six full and the ten partial MTS distributions as well as from two redistributions created between 1968 and 1988 are available from the Bitsavers Software archive and from the University of Michigan&#x27;s Deep Blue digital archive.

Working with the D6.0 distribution materials, it is possible to create an IPLable version of MTS. A new D6.0A distribution of MTS makes this easier. D6.0A is based on the D6.0 version of MTS from 1988 with various fixes and updates to make operation under Hercules in 2012 smoother. In the future, an IPLable version of MTS will be made available based upon the version of MTS that was in use at the University of Michigan in 1996 shortly before MTS was shut down.

==Licensing==
As of December 22, 2011, the MTS Distribution materials are freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (CC BY 3.0).

In its earliest days MTS was made available for free without the need for a license to sites that were interested in running MTS and which seemed to have the knowledgeable staff required to support it.

In the mid-1980s licensing arrangements were formalized with the University of Michigan acting as agent for and granting licenses on behalf of the MTS Consortium. MTS licenses were available to academic organizations for an annual fee of $5,000, to other non-profit organizations for $10,000, and to commercial organizations for $25,000. The license restricted MTS from being used to provide commercial computing services. The licensees received a copy of the full set of MTS distribution tapes, any incremental distributions prepared during the year, written installation instructions, two copies of the current user documentation, and a very limited amount of assistance.

Only a few organizations licensed MTS. Several licensed MTS in order to run a single program such as CONFER. The fees collected were used to offset some of the common expenses of the MTS Consortium.

<text>Tatyana Marisol Ali (born January 24, 1979) is an American actress and singer best known for her role as Ashley Banks on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; from 1990 to 1996. She starred as Tyana Jones on the TV One original series &quot;Love That Girl!&quot;, and played a recurring role as Roxanne on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 2007 to 2013. In 2023, she starred in &quot;Giving Hope: The Ni&#x27;Cola Mitchell Story&quot; on Lifetime.

==Early life==
Tatyana Ali was born on January 24, 1979, in North Bellmore, New York. She is of mixed African and South Asian ancestry or Dougla, born to an Indo-Trinidadian father and an Afro-Panamanian mother.

==Career==
In 1985, six-year-old Ali began her acting career as a regular performer on the PBS children&#x27;s educational program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Her tenure included an appearance with jazz great Herbie Hancock, who demonstrated his Fairlight CMI synthesizer using a sample of Ali&#x27;s voice. She also appeared in two episodes of &quot;Star Search,&quot; one of which featured her performance of a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s and Tammi Terrell&#x27;s hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;.

She made her breakthrough in 1990 when she was cast as Ashley Banks on the NBC television sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, a role she played throughout the series&#x27; entire run, from 1990 to 1996.

Ali&#x27;s vocal talent was featured on several episodes of &quot;Fresh Prince&quot; in later seasons, prompting the show&#x27;s star Will Smith to ask her if she would seriously consider pursuing a musical career. She ultimately decided, for the time being, to continue to concentrate on her acting career. In the series&#x27; final season, however, Ali performed several songs, and she began to be cleaned for her musical debut, the culmination of which was her debut album &quot;Kiss the Sky&quot; in 1998. It was certified gold in early 1999, only months after its release, and spawned the Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins-produced hit single &quot;Daydreamin&#x27;&quot;, released July 21, 1998, which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also appeared on the UK Singles Chart. The album spawned two further UK hits, &quot;Boy You Knock Me Out&quot; featuring Will Smith — which peaked at No. 3 and is her biggest hit to date — and &quot;Everytime&quot;, which was her third top-20 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 20. She made an appearance on Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Willennium&quot; on the track &quot;Who Am I&quot; with MC Lyte. She performed the title song &quot;Sunny Valentine&quot; along with Terrence Quaites for the indie film &quot;Rockin&#x27; Meera&quot; in 2005. In early 2008, she performed on the song &quot;Yes We Can&quot;, a will.i.am project supporting Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. She also appeared in the subsequent music video, which garnered coverage on the &quot;What the Buzz&quot; segment of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Now&quot;. In January 2014, Ali released an EP titled &quot;Hello&quot;, whose first single was &quot;Wait For It&quot;, which she performed on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; on February 4, 2014.

Apart from her musical career, Ali continued to land roles in films such as &quot;The Brothers&quot;, &quot;Glory Road&quot;, and &quot;Nora&#x27;s Hair Salon&quot; (and its sequel), among others. From 2009 to 2010, she produced and starred in the BET web series &quot;Buppies&quot;. She was on recurring status on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Roxanne from 2007 to 2013. Ali starred in the TV One original series &quot;Love That Girl!&quot; as Tyana (whose name was derived from Ali&#x27;s given name). In 2013, she co-starred as Maya in the BET comedy &quot;Second Generation Wayans&quot;, alongside Craig Wayans and Damien Dante Wayans.

In 2011, Ali received the Living Legacy Award from the Caribbean Heritage Organization in Los Angeles.

In July 2016, Ali sued Warner Bros., claiming that the company stole her idea for the show &quot;The Real&quot;, after she pitched the concept in December 2012. The case was dismissed in February 2017.

==Personal life==
She dated actor Jonathan Brandis from 1995 to 2001.

Ali graduated from The Buckley School in 1997. Ali attended Harvard University, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in African-American Studies and Government in 2002. On a celebrity edition of the game show &quot;The Chase&quot;, which aired February 3, 2015, Ali stated that her major was political science.

She traveled the United States as a spokesperson for Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, and headed voter registration drives at college campuses.

In March 2016, Ali revealed that she was engaged to Vaughn Rasberry, an assistant professor of English at Stanford University, whom she had met on eHarmony, and they announced that they were expecting their first child. She and Rasberry married on July 17, 2016, in Beverly Hills, California. The couple have two sons. Rasberry has since become an associate professor and associate vice provost for graduate education at Stanford.

Ali is an honorary member of Zeta Phi Beta, she was inducted on July 27, 2024 at the sorority&#x27;s Boulé in Indianapolis, Indiana.

<text>Conrad Ferdinand Meyer (11 October 1825 – 28 November 1898) was a Swiss poet and historical novelist, a master of literary realism who is mainly remembered for stirring narrative ballads like &quot;Die Füße im Feuer&quot; (The Feet in the Fire).

==Biography==
Meyer was born in Zürich. His father, who died early, was a statesman and historian, while his mother was a highly cultured woman. Throughout his childhood two traits were observed that later characterized the man and the poet: he had a most scrupulous regard for neatness and cleanliness, and he lived and experienced more deeply in memory than in the immediate present. He suffered from bouts of mental illness, sometimes requiring hospitalization; his mother, similarly but more severely afflicted, killed herself.

Having finished the gymnasium, he took up the study of law, but history and the humanities were of greater interest to him. He went for considerable periods to Lausanne, Geneva, Paris, and Italy, where he interested himself in historical research. The two historians who influenced Meyer particularly were Louis Vulliemin at Lausanne and Jacob Burckhardt at Basel, whose book on the &quot;Culture of the Renaissance&quot; stimulated his imagination and interest. From his travels in France and Italy (1857) Meyer derived much inspiration for the settings and characters of his historical novels. In 1875, he settled at Kilchberg, above Zürich.

Meyer found his calling only late in life; for many years, being practically bilingual, he wavered between French and German. The Franco-Prussian War brought the final decision. In Meyer&#x27;s novels, a great crisis often releases latent energies and precipitates a catastrophe. In the same manner, his own life which before the war had been one of dreaming and experimenting, was stirred to the very depths by the events of 1870. Meyer identified himself with the German cause, and as a manifesto of his sympathies published the little epic &quot;Hutten&#x27;s Last Days&quot; in 1871. After that his works appeared in rapid succession. In 1880, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Zurich. He died in his home in Kilchberg on 28 November 1898, aged 73.

==Works==
His works were collected into eight volumes in 1912.

===Novels===
The periods of the Renaissance and Counter Reformation furnished the subjects for most of his novels. Most of his plots spring from the deeper conflict between freedom and fate and culminate in a dramatic crisis in which the hero, in the face of a great temptation, loses his moral freedom and is forced to fulfill the higher law of destiny.

* 1876 &quot;Jürg Jenatsch&quot; – Graubünden, Thirty Years&#x27; War, a story of Switzerland in the 17th century through the conflict between Spain-Austria and France. The hero is a Protestant minister and fanatic patriot who, in his determination to preserve the independence of his little country, does not shrink from murder and treason and in whom noble and base motives are strangely blended.
* 1891 &quot;Angela Borgia&quot; – Italian Renaissance

===Novellas===
Meyer&#x27;s main works are historical novellas:
* 1873 &quot;Das Amulett&quot; (The Amulet) – France during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre
* 1878 &quot;Der Schuss von der Kanzel&quot; (The Shot from the Pulpit) – Switzerland
* 1879 &quot;Der Heilige&quot; (The Saint) – Thomas Becket, Middle Ages, England
* 1881 &quot;Plautus im Nonnenkloster&quot; (Plautus in the Nunnery) – Renaissance, Switzerland
* 1882 &quot;Gustav Adolfs Page&quot; (Gustav Adolf&#x27;s Page) – Thirty Years&#x27; War
* 1883 &quot;Das Leiden eines Knaben&quot; (The Suffering of a Boy) - France during reign of Louis XIV
* 1884 &quot;Die Hochzeit des Mönchs&quot; (The Wedding of the Monk) – Italy, Dante himself is introduced at the court of Cangrande in Verona as narrator of the strange adventure of a monk who, after the death of his brother, is forced by his father to break his vows but who, instead of marrying the widow, falls in love with another young girl and runs blindly to his fate.
* 1885 &quot;Die Richterin&quot; (The Judge) – Carolingian time, Grisons, introduces Charlemagne and his palace school
* 1887 &quot;Die Versuchung des Pescara&quot; (The Temptation of Pescara) – Renaissance, Italy – tells of the great crisis in the life of Fernando d&#x27;Ávalos, general of Charles V and husband of Victoria Colonna

===Lyrics===
* 1867 &quot;Balladen&quot;
* 1870 &quot;Romanzen und Bilder&quot; (Romances and pictures)
* 1872 &quot;Huttens letzte Tage&quot; (Hutten&#x27;s Last Days) – a short epic poem
* 1873 &quot;Engelberg&quot;
* 1882 &quot;Gedichte&quot; (Poems)

===Legacy===

It is as a master of narrative ballads, often on historical themes, that Meyer is mostly remembered. His fiction also typically focuses on key historical moments from the Middle Ages, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.

Meyer&#x27;s lyric verse is almost entirely the product of his later years. He frequently celebrated human handiwork, especially works of art. Rome and the monumental work of Michelangelo were among decisive experiences in his life.

<text>Explorer 4 was an American satellite launched on 26 July 1958. It was instrumented by Dr. James van Allen&#x27;s group. The Department of Defense&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) had initially planned two satellites for the purposes of studying the Van Allen radiation belts and the effects of nuclear explosions upon these belts (and the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere in general), however Explorer 4 was the only such satellite launched as the other, Explorer 5, suffered launch failure.

Explorer 4 was a cylindrically shaped satellite instrumented to make the first detailed measurements of charged particles (protons and electrons) trapped in the terrestrial radiation belts.

== Juno I launch vehicle ==

The launch vehicle was a Juno I, a variant of the three-stage Jupiter-C with an added fourth propulsive stage, which in this case was the Explorer 4. The first stage was an upgraded Redstone liquid-fueled rocket. The second stage comprised a cluster of eleven Sergeant solid-fuel rocket motors and the third stage held three Sergeants. The booster was equipped to spin the fourth stage in increments, leading to a final rate of 750 rpm about its long axis.

== Instrument ==
=== Charged Particle Detector ===
The purpose of this experiment was to extend the first measurements of the trapped radiation belt discovered with Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 and to provide measurements of artificially injected electrons from the three high-altitude Argus nuclear detonations. Four separate radiation detectors were used in the experiment: a shielded directional plastic scintillation counter sensitive to electrons (E&gt;700 keV) and protons (E&gt;10 MeV), a shielded directional caesium iodide scintillation counter sensitive to electrons (E&gt;20 keV) and protons (E&gt;400 keV), an omnidirectional Anton type 302 Geiger–Müller (GM) counter sensitive to electrons (E&gt;3 MeV) and protons (E&gt;30 MeV), and a shielded omnidirectional Anton type 302 Geiger-Müller tube sensitive to electrons (E&gt;5 MeV) and protons (E&gt;40 MeV). The plastic scintillation counter and the caesium iodide (CsI) scintillation counter were each viewed by a separate Photomultiplier tube. These detectors were mounted orthogonally to the longitudinal axis of the satellite with apertures facing in opposite directions. The two GM counters were located side by side along the satellite longitudinal axis.

== Mission ==
Explorer 4 was launched on 26 July 1958 at 15:00:07 GMT from the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Center of the Atlantic Missile Range. The spacecraft was injected into an initial orbit with an inclination of 50.30° and a period of 110.20 minutes at 15:07 GMT. This was a much higher inclination and apogee than previous Explorer to allow it to sample more area at higher altitudes. Soon after orbit insertion, the spacecraft developed an end-over-end tumbling motion with a period of about 6 seconds, which affected the measurements and signal level throughout the mission.

The mission remained secret from the public for six months. The satellite telemetry was analyzed for three Operation Argus nuclear weapons tests at high altitude. Explorer 4 was in orbit and operational during the three Project Argus launches 27 August 1958 to 6 September 1958, part of the mission objective was to observe the effects of these high-altitude A-bomb detonations on the space environment.

An unexpected tumble motion of the satellite made the interpretation of the detector data very difficult. The low-power transmitter and the plastic scintillator detector failed on 3 September 1958. The two Geiger-Müller tubes and the caesium iodide crystal detectors continued to operate normally until 19 September 1958. The high-power transmitter ceased sending signals on 5 October 1958. It is believed that exhaustion of the power batteries caused these failures. The spacecraft decayed from orbit after 454 days on 23 October 1959.

<text>Coleman Alexander Young (May 24, 1918 – November 29, 1997) was an American politician who served as mayor of Detroit, Michigan from 1974 to 1994. Young was the first African-American mayor of Detroit and has been described as the &quot;single most influential person in Detroit&#x27;s modern history.&quot; 

Young had emerged from the far-left element in Detroit, but became an advocate for business interests after his election as mayor. He called an ideological truce and gained widespread support from the city&#x27;s business leaders. The new mayor energetically promoted downtown redevelopment with major projects like the Joe Louis Arena and the Renaissance Center. Facing intense manufacturing flight, Young worked to keep major plants in the city, most notably General Motors&#x27; Poletown project and Chrysler&#x27;s Jefferson North assembly. Some opponents said that he pulled money out of the neighborhoods to rehabilitate the downtown business district, but he said &quot;there were no other options.&quot;

In 1981, Young received the Spingarn Medal for achievement from the NAACP.

==Early life and education==
Young was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to William Coleman Young, a dry cleaner, and Ida Reese Jones. His family moved in 1923 to Detroit, as part of the Great Migration out of the South to industrial cities that offered more opportunity. His family later converted to Catholicism, though Young was denied entry to a Catholic high school due to his race. Young graduated from Eastern High School in 1935. He became a member of the United Auto Workers, and worked for Ford Motor Company. Later Young worked for the United States Post Office Department.

During World War II, Young served in the 477th Medium-Bomber Group (the renowned Tuskegee Airmen) of the United States Army Air Forces as a second lieutenant, bombardier, and navigator. As a lieutenant in the 477th, Young played a role in the Freeman Field Mutiny in 1945. Some 162 African-American officers were arrested for resisting segregation at a base near Seymour, Indiana.

In the 1940s, Young was labelled a fellow traveler of the Communist Party by belonging to groups whose members also belonged to the Party, and was accused of being a former member. Young&#x27;s involvement in worker-oriented organizations, including the Progressive Party, the United Auto Workers and the National Negro Labor Council, made him a target of anti-Communist investigators, including the FBI and HUAC. He protested segregation in the Army and racial discrimination in the UAW. In 1948, Young supported Progressive Party presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace.

In 1952, Young stunned observers when he appeared before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen. He made sarcastic retorts and repeatedly cited the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young&#x27;s performance made him a hero in Detroit&#x27;s growing black community. To a committee member&#x27;s statement that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Young said: &quot;I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.&quot; To the HUAC congressman from Georgia, he said: &quot;I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.&quot;

He said to another HUAC congressman: 
&quot;Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and things of that sort. That is the hysteria that has been swept up by this committee.&quot;

According to historians Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes and Ronald Radosh, Coleman Young was &quot;a secret CPUSA [Communist Party USA] member.&quot;

==Political career==
Young built his political base in Detroit on the East Side in the 1940s and 1950s, which had become a center of the African-American community. In 1960, he was elected as a delegate to help draft a new state constitution for Michigan.

In 1964, Young won election to the Michigan State Senate. His most significant legislation was a law requiring arbitration in disputes between public-sector unions and municipalities. During his senate career, he also pointed out inequities in Michigan state funding, &quot;spending $20 million on rural bus service and a fat zero for the same thing in Detroit.&quot;

==Mayoralty==

===1973 campaign===
Coleman Young decided to run for mayor of Detroit in 1973. At the forefront of his campaign, he sought to address the increasing police violence suffered by black residents in the city. By 1972, the black population in Detroit was nearly half of the population – but was patrolled disproportionately by a white police department. Specifically, Young notified Police Commissioner John Nichols that the police decoy unit, STRESS (Stop the Robberies and Enjoy Safe Streets), was a major racially charged problem of the city. Officers deployed under STRESS had been accused of killing 22 people and arresting hundreds without cause during its years of operation. In his campaign, Young quoted &quot;one of the problems is that the police run the city… STRESS is responsible for the explosive polarization that now exists; STRESS is an execution squad rather than an enforcement squad. As mayor, I will get rid of STRESS&quot;. The police responded by endorsing John Nichols, the Police Commissioner who was running for mayor against Coleman Young.

Throughout the campaign, Young had an edge over Nichols due to both a growing black population base and due to his broad political experience in local, state, and national politics. In opposition, Nichols took advantage of the white fear of black crime in the street in order to advance his campaign. Nichols represented a national trend of increased police power and brutality in post-riot cities, and therefore, in Young&#x27;s opinion, had to be defeated. While neither candidate openly spoke about race, after the fact, Young admitted that in 1973, “the race was about race”. Both mayoral candidates were conscious of the high racial tensions in the city, but both attempted to appeal to all groups.  

In November 1973, Young narrowly defeated Nichols for mayor, becoming the first black mayor of Detroit. His election represented a major turning point in both the city&#x27;s racial and political history. In his inaugural address, Mayor Young stated that “the first problem that we must face as citizens of this great city, the first fact that we must look squarely in the eye, is that this city has too long been polarized”. He stated that &quot;we can no longer afford the luxury of hatred and racial division. What is good for the black people of this city is good for the white people of this city. What is good for the rich people of this city is good for the poor people of this city. What is good for those who live in the suburbs is good for those of us who live in the central city&quot;. Winning by such a small margin in a racially polarized city, Young knew the burden he would have to shoulder as mayor.

Young served five terms as mayor of Detroit from 1974 to 1994. Young won re-election by wide margins in 1977, 1981, 1985 and 1989, to serve a total of 20 years as mayor, based largely on black votes.

=== First mayoral term: 1974–1978 ===
As mayor during his first term, Young promptly disbanded the STRESS unit, began efforts to integrate the police department and increased patrols in high crime neighborhoods utilizing a community policing approach. Young&#x27;s effect on integrating the Detroit Police Department was successful; the proportion of blacks rose to more than 50 percent in 1993 from less than 10 percent in 1974 and has remained at about that level. Both actions were credited with reducing the number of brutality complaints against the city&#x27;s police to 825 in 1982 from 2,323 in 1975.

When asked in an interview about the high and low points of his first term, Young responded that avoiding the near riot he faced after the shooting of a black teenager was a high. He stated that &quot;we found a police department, which had been guilty of excesses in the past, being professional and, even under provocation, not firing a single shot. We also found leaders, black and white who had the courage to get out there in front of angry citizens and help keep the peace&quot;. In contrast, his biggest challenge was the fact that Detroit had been in a depression for the two and a half years he had been in office. He stated that “most of [his] time has been spent putting out fires instead of going ahead with plans for the city”, something he hoped to address in his second term.

=== Second mayoral term: 1978–1982 ===
In 1978, Mayor Young won his second term as mayor and planned to execute many campaign promises unfulfilled from his first term. At the forefront of his agenda, Young wanted to ensure affirmative action initiatives in order to positively transform the racial makeup of city departments, particularly the police department. Young addressed the issue of Affirmative Action head on, and welcomed the NAACP to Detroit with the words, &quot;welcome to Detroit, the Affirmative Action City – I can’t think of any recent issue that is more important to the future of minorities and women and the whole American people than the issue of affirmative action&quot; (Young, 1978).

His efforts for affirmative action were stalled in 1981, when a budget crisis forced Detroit voters to approve an income tax hike and city officials to sell $125 million in emergency bonds. Young had to convince Detroit voters to trust his plans to save the city from bankruptcy, and he had to convince state legislature and municipal workers to accept a two-year wage freeze. In addition, Black unemployment in the city remained at 25 percent – all issues that Young attempted to tackle during his third term.

=== Third mayoral term: 1982–1986 ===
Young&#x27;s third term as mayor focused heavily on both the covert and overt forces of racism that divided the city and suburbs. Being mayor of a predominantly black city surrounded by predominantly white suburbs meant that Young dealt with an inescapable rift between the two. In 1984, Young stated that racism was &quot;at an all time high&quot; (Young, 1984). Young understood the need for suburban-city cooperation as essential for regional growth; the two needed to work with each other. Young attempted to resolve this division by attracting more jobs in the city for a stronger partnership.

From 1982 until 1983, Young served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

=== Fourth mayoral term: 1986–1990 ===

During his fourth term, Young continued to work on improving racial relations of the city and neighborhood standards. He worked on many successful projects to build more than 1,800 apartment units in the city, with “50 percent black and 50 percent white, half from within Detroit and half from outside”. He sought for these projects to promote economic and racial integration in the city.

=== Fifth mayoral term: 1990–1994 ===
During Mayor Young&#x27;s fifth and final term, the Detroit community had sharply divided opinions about his response to the death of a young Black man Malice Green after a beating by two white police officers. Green&#x27;s death on November 5, 1992, occurred only months after the Los Angeles riots of 1992, which protested the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King.

At the time, a writer for the &quot;Detroit News and Free Press&quot; said, &quot;the foundation upon which Mayor Coleman Young built his career and his administration was rocked Thursday by the beating death of a Detroit man at the hands of Detroit police officers.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Integrating the police department was one of Young&#x27;s greatest accomplishments in improving race relations in the city. He also presided over two fiscal crises.

Throughout his time as mayor, Young was an outspoken advocate for large Detroit construction projects, and his administration saw the completion of the Renaissance Center, Detroit People Mover, the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Plant, the Detroit Receiving Hospital, the Chrysler Jefferson North Assembly Plant, the Riverfront Condominiums, the Millender Center Apartments, the Harbortown retail and residential complex, 150 West Jefferson, One Detroit Center and the Fox Theater restoration, among other developments.

Detroit experienced a severe population drop during Young&#x27;s mayoralty, suffering a loss of 500,000 residents. Young attributed this 40 percent drop in population to the deterioration of neighborhoods which he promptly worked to overcome. Instead of agonizing over the issue, Young came up with ways to correct some of the imbalances between land and people. Young&#x27;s administration sought to redevelop many neighborhoods throughout Detroit in order to revitalize the city&#x27;s landscape. These construction projects often led to opposition among neighborhood activists. This opposition typically manifested itself in rigorous budget debate, rather than in serious electoral challenges against Young. Most of the time Young prevailed over this opposition, seeking jobs and economic stimulus as a way to help rebuild Detroit&#x27;s neighborhoods.

==Personal life==

Young was twice married and divorced, and had a twelve-year relationship with Joyce Finley Garrett from 1968 to 1980. He fathered a son with executive assistant director of public works Annivory Calvert and initially denied paternity until DNA tests proved that he was the child&#x27;s biological father. He served as a state senator in Michigan&#x27;s 1st Senate district and was previously a state representative in Michigan&#x27;s 4th District, the same district where Young lived as mayor and served as state senator.

Young was a Prince Hall Freemason. He died from emphysema in 1997. Upon learning of Young&#x27;s death, former President Jimmy Carter called Young &quot;one of the greatest mayors our country has known.&quot;

Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler called the former Democratic mayor &quot;a man of his word who was willing to work with anyone, regardless of party or politics, to help Detroit – the city he loved and fought for all his life.&quot;

==Assessment==

===Corruption===
Six federal investigations of his administration resulted in trials and convictions for some of his associates, including Detroit Police Chief and Deputy Chief, William L. Hart and Kenneth Weiner, but none for Young.

In 2000, a FOIA investigation showed that Young was under FBI surveillance beginning in the 1940s (because of his suspected link to communists) and continuing through the 1980s. The Detroit FBI office turned over 935 of its 1,357 pages of material, which included business records and wiretap transcripts.

In 2018, &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; columnist Bill McGraw said claims Young was corrupt were a &quot;myth&quot;:
The FBI investigated Young for decades. They confronted him in random places; asked about his politics; wiretapped his condo; wired a convicted con man who was his business associate and scrutinized the mayor’s finances. But while relatives and people around Young went to prison for corruption, Young never was indicted or charged with a crime.

===Crime===
Though there were no civil disturbances as serious as the race riots of 1863, 1943, and 1967 during Young&#x27;s terms as mayor, he has been blamed for failing to stem crime in the city. Several violent gangs controlled the region&#x27;s drug trade in the 1970s and 1980s. Major criminal gangs that were founded in Detroit and dominated the drug trade at various times included The Errol Flynns (east side), Nasty Flynns (later the NF Bangers) and Black Killers and the drug consortiums of the 1980s such as Young Boys Inc., Pony Down, Best Friends, Black Mafia Family and the Chambers Brothers.

From 1965 onward, Detroit had experienced an upwards trajectory of its homicide rate. In 1974, the year Young took office, the homicide rate in Detroit was slightly above 50 per 100,000 residents. Over the rest of the 1970s, Detroit&#x27;s homicide rate trended downward, dropping below 40 homicides per 100,000 in 1977 and 1979. However, in the 1980s the homicide rate significantly increased, reaching a peak of 63.5 in 1987. In 1994, the year Young retired from office, the homicide rate was roughly 54 per 100,000.

===Economic conditions===
Young&#x27;s administration coincided with some periods of broad social and economic challenges in the United States, including economic recession, oil shock, the decline of the U.S. automotive industry and a loss of manufacturing sector jobs in the Midwest to other parts of the U.S. and the world. White flight to the Detroit suburbs, which had begun in the 1950s and accelerated after the 1967 race riot, persisted during Young&#x27;s two decades in office, amid ongoing crime and drug problems in the inner city. Supporters of Young attributed the flight to factors such as white resistance to court ordered desegregation, deteriorating housing stock, aging industrial plants and a declining automotive industry leading to a loss of economic opportunities inside the city. Over the course of his time as mayor, Detroit lost about one-third of its population.

Economic conditions in Detroit generally trended sideways or downward over the period of Young&#x27;s political tenure, with the unemployment rate trending from approximately 9% in 1971 to approximately 11% in 1993, when Young retired. However, most economic metrics (unemployment, median income rates, and city gross domestic product) initially dropped sharply during economic recessions, reaching their lowest points in the 1980s and early 1990s, with the unemployment rate in particular peaking at approximately 20% in 1982.

Young himself explained the impact of the riots in his autobiography:

===Police department===
Young himself expressed his belief that reform of the police department stood as one of his greatest accomplishments. He implemented broad affirmative action programs that lead to racial integration, and created a network of Neighborhood City Halls and Police Mini Stations. Young used the relationship established by community policing to mobilize large civilian patrols to address the incidents of Devil&#x27;s Night arson that had come to plague the city each year. These patrols have been continued by succeeding administrations and have mobilized as many as 30,000 citizens in a single year in an effort to forestall seasonal arson.

===Overall===
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Young as the twelfth-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

<text>Operation Argus was a series of United States low-yield, high-altitude nuclear weapons tests and missile tests secretly conducted from 27 August to 9 September 1958 over the South Atlantic Ocean. The tests were performed by the Defense Nuclear Agency.

The tests were to study the Christofilos effect, which suggested it was possible to defend against Soviet nuclear missiles by exploding a small number of nuclear bombs high over the South Pacific. This would create a disk of electrons over the United States that would overload the electronics on the Soviet warheads as they descended. It was also possible to use the effect to blind Soviet radars, meaning that any Soviet missile-based ABM system would be unable to attack the US counterstrike.

The tests demonstrated that the effect did occur, but that it dissipated too rapidly to be very effective. Papers concerning the topic were published the next year, emphasizing the events as purely scientific endeavors.

==Objectives==

The tests were proposed by Nicholas Christofilos in an unpublished paper of what was then the Livermore branch of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) as a means to verify the Christofilos effect, which argued that high-altitude nuclear detonations would create a radiation belt in the extreme upper regions of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Such belts would be similar in effect to the Van Allen radiation belts. &quot;Such radiation belts were viewed as having possible tactical use in war, including degradation of radio and radar transmissions, damage or destruction of the arming and fuzing mechanisms of ICBM warheads, and endangering the crews of orbiting space vehicles that might enter the belt.&quot; Prior to Argus, Hardtack Teak had shown disruption of radio communications from a nuclear blast, though this was not due to the creation of radiation belts.

&quot;Argus&quot; was implemented rapidly after inception due to forthcoming bans on atmospheric and exoatmospheric testing in October 1958. Consequently, the tests were performed within a mere half-year of conception (whereas &quot;normal&quot; testing took one to two years). Because nuclear testing during this time was arguably a violation of the rules, the military borrowed International Geophysical Year equipment to disguise the nuclear tests.

* Two missiles, with warheads 136–227 kg to be launched within one month of each other, originating from a single site.
* The missiles were to be detonated at altitudes of , and also at . Both detonations should occur near the geomagnetic equator.
* Satellites were to be placed in equatorial (up to 30°) and polar (up to 70°) orbits, with perigees of roughly and apogees of roughly or greater. These satellites were to be used to measure electron density over time, and include a magnetometer, as well as a means for measuring ambient radio noise. Measurements were to be taken before the shots to determine a baseline, as well as during and after the events.
* Sounding rockets, launched from appropriate ground locations, were to carry the same instrumentation as the satellites, except for radio noise. Ground stations to be used to study effects on radio astronomy and radar probing as well as auroral measurements.

Originally &quot;Argus&quot; was designated &quot;Hardtack-Argus&quot;, and later &quot;Floral&quot;. For reasons of security, both names were disused in favor of the independent name &quot;Argus&quot;.

Funding was provided by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), the predecessor of the present Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Total funds allotted for the project were US$9,023,000.

==Task Force 88==
The United States Navy Task Force 88 (or TF-88), was formed 28 April 1958. TF-88 was organized solely to conduct &quot;Operation Argus&quot;. Once &quot;Argus&quot; was completed, the task force was dissolved, and its records dispersed. Some of these records have been destroyed or lost during the time period intervening. Of particular note among the missing documents were the film records (which recorded radiation levels during the &quot;Argus&quot; tests). This has proved contentious due to the greater-than-normal number of leukemia claims among TF-88 participants to the Veterans Administration. Because of this, it has been difficult to resolve to how much radiation the participants were exposed.

===USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot;===
USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot; was a United States Navy-guided missile ship responsible for missile-launching functions. It also served as a training facility for crews involved in the testing. The X-17A missiles to be used in the test were unfamiliar to those conducting the tests. Exercises including assembly and repair of dummy missiles were performed aboard &quot;Norton Sound&quot;. It also carried a 27-MHz COZI radar, which was operated by Air Force Cambridge Research Center, which was used to monitor effects of the shots. It was responsible for the launching of three low-yield nuclear warheads into the high atmosphere. Its commanding officer, Captain Arthur R. Gralla, commanded Task Force 88. Gralla would later receive the Legion of Merit for his role conducting the tests expeditiously.

===USS &quot;Albemarle&quot;===
USS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, fresh out of an , was not listed on the TF-88 order. It set out to the Atlantic Ocean, supposedly as a shakedown cruise. It, too, had a COZI radar and other instrumentation for detecting man-made ionization. This instrumentation included International Geophysical Year (IGY) radiometers, receivers, radar, and optical equipment. After the IGY
equipment was added, it sailed to the ocean around the area of the Azores to record data at the geomagnetic conjugate point of the South Atlantic test site, as the rest of task force 88 headed to the South Atlantic to perform the tests.

===USS &quot;Tarawa&quot;===
USS &quot;Tarawa&quot; served as overall command of the operation, with her commander serving as Task Group Commander. It carried an Air Force MSQ-1A radar and communication system for missile tracking. It also housed VS-32 aircraft for search and security operations as well as scientific measurement, photographic, and observer missions for each test. HS-5 was also aboard and provided intra-task-force transportation for personnel and cargo.

===USS &quot;Warrington&quot;===
USS &quot;Warrington&quot;, in conjunction with &quot;Bearss&quot;, &quot;Hammerberg&quot;, and &quot;Courtney&quot;, maintained a weather picket 463 km west of the task force, provided an airplane guard for &quot;Tarawa&quot; during flight operations, and performed standard destroyer functions (such as surface security and search and rescue). &quot;Warrington&quot; also carried equipment for launching Loki Dart sounding rockets.

===Task Group 88.3===
USS &quot;Neosho&quot; refueled task force ships during the operation. It was also outfitted with Air Force MSQ-1A radar and communication vans. &quot;Neosho&quot; also served as the flagship for TG 88.3, the Mobile Logistics Group, which consisted of &quot;Neosho&quot;, USS &quot;Salamonie&quot; (AO-26), and assigned destroyers.

USS &quot;Salamonie&quot; returned to the United States upon arrival at TF-88, and did not participate with any tests.

==Satellite tracking==
Two satellite launches were attempted in order to obtain data from these high-altitude tests. Explorer 4 was launched successfully to orbit on 26 July on Juno I missile from Cape Canaveral. The satellite had enough battery power to function for sixty days. This was long enough for the satellite to track and measure ARGUS. Explorer 5 experienced a launch failure on 24 August.

There were many tracking systems used by the task force along with these satellites along with many organizations that helped track these missiles. &quot;These included the Naval Research Laboratory, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory, the Army Map Service, the Naval Ordnance Test Station, and the Ballistic Research Laboratory along with ground tracking stations from the Aleutian Islands through the Azores from academic, industrial, and military organizations.&quot;

==Preparation==

To prepare for the launch of the ARGUS missiles, many tests and preparations were performed. As the east coast units of TF 88 were heading towards the South Atlantic, they participated with countdown, launch, and missile- tracking drills using Loki/Dart high-altitude, antiaircraft rockets launched from the USS &quot;Warrington&quot;. Fourteen of these Loki launches were conducted from 12 to 22 August. These tests were performed to test equipment and procedures, and to train personnel in specialized assignments. Some of these assignments necessary for the ARGUS missile launchings were &quot;stationing of ships, MSQ-1A radar tracking by the USS &quot;Neosho&quot; and the USS &quot;Tarawa&quot;, communications, positioning of sky-camera S2F aircraft, and area surveillance S2F aircraft.&quot;

==Tests==
About 1800 km southwest of Cape Town, South Africa, USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot; launched three modified X-17A missiles armed with 1.7 kt W-25 nuclear warheads into the upper atmosphere, where high altitude nuclear explosions occurred. Due to the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Van Allen radiation belt is closer to the Earth&#x27;s surface at that location. The (extreme) altitude of the tests was chosen so as to prevent personnel involved with the test from being exposed to any ionizing radiation. Even with the very minor threat of radiation exposure, precautions were taken to prevent radiological exposure. The task force commander and his staff had devised a series of precautionary radiation safe measures to be followed in each stage of the operation. Though the chance of exposure to radiation from these missiles was minute, the safety measures were performed as directed by the commander by the crew of Task Force 88.

Coordinated measurement programs involving satellite, rocket, aircraft, and surface stations were employed by the services as well as other government agencies and various contractors worldwide.

The Argus explosions created artificial electron belts resulting from the β-decay of fission fragments. These lasted for several weeks. Such radiation belts affect radio and radar transmissions, damage or destroy arming and fusing mechanisms of intercontinental ballistic missile warheads, and endanger crews of orbiting space vehicles. It was found after performing these tests that the explosions did in fact degrade the reception and transmission of radar signals, another proof that Christofilos was correct about the Christofilos effect.

&quot;Argus&quot; proved the validity of Christofilos&#x27; theory: the establishment of an electron shell derived from neutron and β-decay of fission products and ionization of device materials in the upper atmosphere was demonstrated. It not only provided data on military considerations, but produced a &quot;great mass&quot; of geophysical data.
The tests were first reported journalistically by Hanson Baldwin and Walter Sullivan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 19 March 1959, headlining it as the &quot;greatest scientific experiment ever conducted&quot;. This was an unauthorized publication that caused great controversy among scientists because many of them were unaware of the presence of artificial particles in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Approximately nine ships and 4,500 people participated with the operation. After the completion of testing, the task force returned to the United States via Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The tests were announced officially the next year, but the full results and documentation of the tests were not declassified until 30 April 1982.

<text>The Citroën ZX is a small family car produced by the French manufacturer Citroën between 1991 and 1998.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the ZX was Citroën&#x27;s entry in the class traditionally dominated in Europe by the Ford Escort and Vauxhall/Opel Astra, a market segment Citroën had briefly abandoned with the demise of the GSA in 1986.

The BX had tried to address the small family car market and the large family car market by being &quot;between sizes&quot; but well packaged. For 1993, the Citroën ZX chassis was also used for the Peugeot 306 which, with its attractive Peugeot 205 derived styling, was an even more successful car than its twin. The Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner were also built on the front half of the same platform, the rear coming from the 405, an arrangement shared underneath the Xsara Picasso.

It was replaced by the Xsara in September 1997, but production in Europe continued until 1998.

==China==
The ZX was the first Citroën built in China. A saloon derivative, called the Citroën Elysée, along with the China-based ZX known as the Fukang, continued to be produced for the Chinese market by the Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile, a joint venture with the Dongfeng Motor Corporation.

== Model History ==

The Citroën GS had been a ground breaking and radical new model in the small family car market on its launch in 1970, scooping the European Car of the Year award, and was facelifted in 1979 and gained a hatchback which saw it transformed into the GSA.

However, such was the success of the larger BX after its 1982 launch, that PSA decided to delay the launch of an immediate replacement for the GSA when it was finally discontinued in 1986. Development work began on a new C segment hatchback, which was originally expected to be launched as the Citroën FX at the beginning of the 1990s.

Although the Rally Raid version of the ZX debuted during 1990, the ZX was officially launched on the left hand drive continental markets on 16 March 1991, with British sales beginning in May that year, initially only with petrol engines. The diesel ZX went on sale later in 1991. The ZX was helped at the time of introduction by having reached the market a few months before the new version of the Opel/Vauxhall Astra.

The sales target was about 230,000 vehicles per year, with half of that number going outside of France.

It went on sale in New Zealand in the beginning of 1993, as a five door in 1.6 Aura or Turbodiesel trim, with the naturally aspirated diesel and Volcane GTi (1.9) models joining a few weeks later. New Zealand&#x27;s unleaded petrol was of a low octane rating, meaning that initially only uncatalyzed cars were on offer.
In January 1994, the estate of the ZX debuted, and went on sale in May, shortly thereafter followed by a mid-cycle facelift.

The first examples of the ZX had been produced in 1990, with the three door Rally Raid model being the winner of the Paris-Dakar, which started just after Christmas. The first prototypes of the ZX had actually debuted at the Baja Aragon on 20 July 1990. Drag resistance ranged from Cds 0.30 to 0.33.

The launch of the ZX marked the return of Citroën into the C sector of the car market; it had discontinued the GSA in 1986 with no immediate replacement, largely due to the success of the larger BX. However, Citroën had decided to phase out the BX between 1990 and 1993, by at first launching a smaller model, and then adding a larger model (the Xantia) to its range.

The ZX&#x27;s interior space and value received praise from critics and consumers. Of particular note was the unusual rear seat arrangement: the rear bench was mounted on a sliding platform that allowed it to be moved rearwards to increase rear legroom, or forwards to increase cargo space or to allow the seat back to be tilted backwards. Unfortunately, only the seat backs folded forward on models so fitted; lower specification models had more ultimate cargo capacity as the rear seat cushion folded up, allowing the seat back to be laid down flat. The ZX&#x27;s specifications were good for its class, with most models getting power steering, electric windows, electric sunroof, a driver&#x27;s side (and sometimes passenger&#x27;s side) airbag, and anti-lock braking system as either optional or standard equipment. It remained competitively priced though, unlike the Mark III Volkswagen Golf, which was priced at a premium when launched in August 1991.

The familiar range of PSA powertrains drove the front wheels of a seemingly conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën fully independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the estate of the Peugeot 305.

However, PSA&#x27;s chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear-wheel steering to induce compliance understeer by means of specially designed bushes in the rear suspension. At high mileages, this is prone to wear off the axle mounting bushes, which is easily fixed. The rear shock absorbers were developed and constructed in house.
It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted as far back as possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.

==Models==
At the time of its launch, the ZX range consisted of a collection of four very individual trim levels; the base model was the &quot;Reflex&quot; aimed at young people, next was the &quot;Avantage&quot; aimed at families, and then there was the luxury &quot;Aura&quot; series. The final series was the relatively sporting &quot;Volcane&quot; series, with lowered (and hard) suspension. The later &quot;Volcane&quot; TD was one of the first diesel hot hatches.

Over time, further models were introduced, including the &quot;Furio&quot;, a cheaper model with a sporting tone combined with the lesser engines, a 16-valve engined high performance derivative, and many special editions.

The ZX was initially available as a three- or five-door hatchback, while a five-door estate was added to the range in 1994. It was offered with petrol engines from 1.1 L to 2.0 L, as well as three 1.9 L diesel engines including a turbodiesel. However, the 1.1 petrol engine was never sold in Britain.


==Sales and production==
==Motorsport==
The car won the Paris-Dakar Rally four times — in 1991 with Ari Vatanen and in 1994, 1995, 1996 with Pierre Lartigue, claiming a total 59 stage wins.

It also won five FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies titles, four by Pierre Lartigue between 1993-1996 and one by Ari Vatanen in 1997.

In terms of rallycross, the ZX 16V Turbo in the hands of Kenneth Hansen (rallycross) took two FIA European Rallycross Championship titles. 1994 and 1996.

The ZX Kit Car, a front-wheel-drive naturally aspirated rally car built to the F2 rules, won the 1997 Spanish rally championship thanks to Jesús Puras.
