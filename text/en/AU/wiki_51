<text>William Frederick Cody (February 26, 1846January 10, 1917), known as Buffalo Bill, was an American soldier, bison hunter, and showman.

One of the most famous and well-known figures of the American Old West, Cody started his legend at the young age of 23. Shortly thereafter he started performing in shows that displayed cowboy themes and episodes from the frontier and Indian Wars. He founded &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; in 1883, taking his large company on tours in the United States and, beginning in 1887, in Europe.

He was born in Le Claire, Iowa Territory (now the U.S. state of Iowa), but he lived for several years in his father&#x27;s hometown in modern-day Mississauga, Ontario, before the family returned to the Midwest and settled in the Kansas Territory. Buffalo Bill started working at the age of 11, after his father&#x27;s death, and became a rider for the Pony Express at age 15. During the American Civil War, he served the Union from 1863 to the end of the war in 1865. Later he served as a civilian scout for the U.S. Army during the Indian Wars. While he was initially awarded the Medal of Honor in 1872 for his actions in the Indian Wars, he was among 910 recipients to have the award rescinded in 1917. Congress reinstated the medals for Cody and four other civilian scouts in 1989.

== Early life and education ==

Cody was born on February 26, 1846, on a farm just outside Le Claire, Iowa. His father, Isaac Cody, was born on September 5, 1811, in Toronto Township, Upper Canada, now part of Mississauga, Ontario, directly west of Toronto. Mary Ann Bonsell Laycock, Bill&#x27;s mother, was born about 1817 in Trenton, New Jersey. She moved to Cincinnati to teach school, and there she met and married Isaac. She was a descendant of Josiah Bunting, a Quaker who had settled in Pennsylvania. There is no evidence to indicate Buffalo Bill was raised as a Quaker. In 1847 the couple moved to Ontario, having their son baptized in 1847, as William Cody, at the Dixie Union Chapel in Peel County (present-day Peel Region, of which Mississauga is a part), not far from the farm of his father&#x27;s family. The chapel was built with Cody money, and the land was donated by Philip Cody of Toronto Township. They lived in Ontario for several years.

In 1853, Isaac Cody sold his land in rural Scott County, Iowa, for , and the family moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory. In the years before the Civil War, Kansas was overtaken by political and physical conflict over the slavery question. Isaac Cody was against slavery. He was invited to speak at Rively&#x27;s store, a local trading post where pro-slavery men often held meetings. His antislavery speech so angered the crowd that they threatened to kill him if he did not step down. A man jumped up and stabbed him twice with a Bowie knife. Rively, the store&#x27;s owner, rushed Cody to get treatment, but he never fully recovered from his injuries.

In Kansas, the family was frequently persecuted by pro-slavery supporters. Cody&#x27;s father spent time away from home for his safety. His enemies learned of a planned visit to his family and plotted to kill him on the way. Bill, despite his youth and being ill at the time, rode thirty miles (48km) to warn his father. Isaac Cody went to Cleveland, Ohio, to organize a group of thirty families to bring back to Kansas, to add to the antislavery population. During his return trip, he caught a respiratory infection which, compounded by the lingering effects of his stabbing and complications from kidney disease, led to his death in April 1857.

After his death, the family suffered financially. At age 11, Bill worked for the freight carrier Russel, Major, and Waddel as a &quot;boy extra&quot;. On horseback, he would ride up and down the length of a wagon train and deliver messages between the drivers and workmen. Next, he joined Johnston&#x27;s Army as an unofficial member of the scouts assigned to guide the United States Army to Utah, to put down a rumored rebellion by the Mormon population of Salt Lake City.

According to Cody&#x27;s account in &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Own Story&quot;, the Utah War was where he began his career as an &quot;Indian fighter&quot;:
At the age of 14, in 1860, Cody was caught up in the &quot;gold fever&quot;, with news of gold at Fort Colville and the Holcomb Valley Gold Rush in California. On his way to the goldfields, however, he met an agent for the Pony Express. He signed with them, and after building several stations and corrals, Cody was given a job as a rider. He worked at this until he was called home to his sick mother&#x27;s bedside.

Cody claimed to have had many jobs, including trapper, bullwhacker, &quot;Fifty-Niner&quot; in Colorado, Pony Express rider in 1860, wagonmaster, stagecoach driver, and a hotel manager, but historians have had difficulty documenting them. He may have fabricated some for publicity. Namely, it is argued that in contrast to Cody&#x27;s claims, he never rode for the Pony Express, but as a boy, he did work for its parent company, the transport firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell. In contrast to the adventurous rides, hundreds of miles long, that he recounted in the press, his real job was to carry messages on horseback from the firm&#x27;s office in Leavenworth to the telegraph station three miles away.

== Military services ==

After his mother recovered, Cody wanted to enlist as a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War but was refused because of his young age. He began working with a freight caravan that delivered supplies to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. In 1863, at age 17, he enlisted as a teamster with the rank of private in Company H, 7th Kansas Cavalry, and served until discharged in 1865.

In 1866, he reunited with his old friend Wild Bill Hickok in Junction City, Kansas, then serving as a scout. Cody enlisted as a scout himself at Fort Ellsworth and scouted between there and Fort Fletcher (later renamed and moved to Fort Hays). He was attached as a scout, variously, to Captain George Augustus Armes (Battle of the Saline River) and Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer (guide and impromptu horse race to Fort Larned). It was during this service at Fort Ellsworth that he met William Rose, with whom he would found the short-lived settlement of Rome.

In 1867, with the construction of the Kansas Pacific Railway completing through Hays City and Rome, Cody was granted a leave of absence to hunt buffalo to supply railroad construction workers with meat. This endeavor continued into 1868, which saw his hunting contest with William Comstock.

Cody returned to Army service in 1868. From his post in Fort Larned, he performed an exceptional feat of riding as a lone dispatch courier from Fort Larned to Fort Zarah (escaping brief capture), Fort Zarah to Fort Hays, Fort Hays to Fort Dodge, Fort Dodge to Fort Larned, and, finally, Fort Larned to Fort Hays, a total of 350 miles in 58 hours through hostile territory, covering the last 35 miles on foot. In response, General Philip Sheridan assigned him Chief of Scouts for the 5th Cavalry Regiment.

He was also Chief of Scouts for the Third Cavalry in later campaigns of the Plains Wars.

In January 1872, Cody was a scout for the highly publicized hunting expedition of the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia.

== Medal of Honor ==

Cody was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1872 for documented gallantry above and beyond the call of duty as an Army scout in the Indian Wars. It was revoked in 1917, along with medals of 910 other recipients dating back to the Revolutionary War, when Congress decided to create a hierarchy of medals, designating the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; as the highest military honor it could bestow. Subsequent regulations authorized the War Department to revoke prior Medal of Honor awards it considered not meeting requirements since the introduction of strict regulations promulgated under the 1917 law. Those regulations required the medal to be awarded for acts of bravery above and beyond the call of duty by officers or enlisted soldiers. The law was enacted days before Buffalo Bill died, so he never knew a law might rescind the medal awarded to him. All civilian scout medals were rescinded since they did not appear to meet the basic criterion of being officers or enlisted soldiers, which had been expressly listed in every authorizing statute ever enacted for the Medal of Honor. Cody was one of five scouts affected. Their medals were stripped shortly after Cody died in 1917.

Cody&#x27;s relatives objected, and, for over 72 years, they wrote repeatedly to the US Congress seeking reconsideration. All efforts failed, until a 1988 letter to the Senate from Cody&#x27;s grandson received by the office of senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, when a newly assigned legislative assistant (K. Yale) took up the cause in 1989. The legal brief he drafted and submitted to the Department of Defense on behalf of the relatives of Buffalo Bill argued that civilian scouts were technically officers, as their native American counterparts were nominally scouts. However, they were given the rank and pay of officersboth for retention purposes. Also, scouts were the equivalent of &quot;reconnaissance&quot; for the military and thus provided highly valued services. In addition, a practical reason was to avoid mistaking them for opponents in skirmishes. Moreover, although civilian scouts might have normally been officers because of their highly valued skills, the military drawdown and related budget cuts after the Civil War left no billets available for the civilian scouts to fill, and thus they were relegated to a highly qualified status that treated them as valuable military assets without the designation or retirement benefits of officers. Nevertheless, they were treated as high-ranking military officials and had status of officers alongside their native American brethren. The brief argued for retroactive restoration of the Medal of Honor to Buffalo Bill, and the Department of Defense required the appeal to be adjudicated by the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. After months of deliberation, the Board agreed with the persuasive legal brief and made the decision to restore the Medal of Honor, not only to Buffalo Bill but also several other civilian scouts whose medals had also been rescinded.

Long after the medal was restored, the decision was thought to be controversial for several reasons. Some people interpreted Simpson&#x27;s submission as arguing that the law had never required Cody to be a soldier. However, this was never a key element of Simpson&#x27;s brief. According to these interpretations, Simpson&#x27;s submission cited a book, &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;, to illustrate the lack of requirement to be a soldier. However, it was recognized in the legal brief that Medal of Honor recipients had to be an officer or enlisted soldier. Another problem cited by some was the authority of the Board to contravene several federal statutes because the Medal of Honor revocation had been expressly authorized by Congress, meaning that the restoration went against the law in force in 1872, the law requiring the revocation in 1916, and the modern statute enacted in 1918 that remains substantially unmodified today. However, the legal brief clearly did not suggest overturning of the law, but rather conforming the status of civilian scouts to that of other scouts similarly situated (source: copy of the actual legal brief, by the author).

Since the Board of Correction is merely a delegation of the Secretary of the Army&#x27;s authority, some suggest a separation of powers conflict, since even the president cannot contravene a clear statute and, although Cody&#x27;s case was dealt with below the cabinet level, the legal brief was written in conformance with the statutes. Modern Medal of Honor cases originating from the board, such as the recent case of Garlin Conner, required both executive action as well as a statutory waiver from Congress, which underscores the point that some cases might be in conflict with statutes.

In the Cody case, the board&#x27;s governing assistant secretary recognized that it lacked the authority to reinstate the medal directly, and so decided to return the case to the board for reconsideration. As a result, the board amended Cody&#x27;s record to make him an enlisted soldieraligning it with the legal argument that civilian scouts were the equivalent to officers or enlisted soldiersso that he would fall within the legal requirements and did the same for four other civilian guides who had also had their medals rescinded. In doing so, the board overlooked the fact that Cody was a civilian guide with far greater employment flexibility than a soldier, including the ability to resign at will. Nevertheless the Board did recognize the value that all scouts provided, whether Native American or otherwise, and how they volunteered to put themselves in harm&#x27;s way (in the case of Buffalo Bill, saving the lives of several soldiers by rushing onto an active battlefield and pulling them to safety while under fire) instead of pursuing less demanding civilian jobs.

== Nickname ==
Cody received the nickname &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; after the American Civil War, when he had a contract to supply Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with buffalo (American bison) meat. Cody is purported to have killed 4,282 buffalo in eighteen months in 1867 and 1868. Cody and another hunter, Bill Comstock, competed in an eight-hour buffalo-shooting match over the exclusive right to use the name, which Cody won by killing 68 animals to Comstock&#x27;s 48. Comstock, part Cheyenne and a noted hunter, scout, and interpreter, used a fast-shooting Henry repeating rifle, while Cody competed with a larger-caliber Springfield Model 1866, which he called Lucretia Borgia, after the notorious Italian noblewoman, the subject of a popular contemporary Gaetano Donizetti opera &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s play of the same name. Cody explained that while his formidable opponent, Comstock, chased after his buffalo, engaging from the rear of the herd and leaving a trail of killed buffalo &quot;scattered over a distance of three miles&quot;, Codylikening his strategy to a billiards player &quot;nursing&quot; his billiard balls during &quot;a big run&quot;first rode his horse to the front of the herd to target the leaders, forcing the followers to one side, eventually causing them to circle and create an easy target, and dropping them close together.

== Birth of the legend ==
In 1869, the 23-year-old Cody met Ned Buntline, who later published a story based on Cody&#x27;s adventures (largely invented by the writer) in Street and Smith&#x27;s &quot;New York Weekly&quot; and then published a highly successful novel, &quot;Buffalo Bill, King of the Bordermen&quot;, which was first serialized on the front page of the Chicago Tribune, beginning that December 15. Many other sequels followed by Buntline, Prentiss Ingraham and others from the 1870s through the early part of the twenty first century. 

Playwright Frederick G. Maeder adapted Buntline&#x27;s novel into the hit play &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; which premiered at Niblo&#x27;s Garden in 1872 with J. B. Studley in the title role. Cody attended this play while visiting New York which gave him the idea to portray himself on the stage. He later became world-famous for &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;, a touring show which traveled around the United States, Great Britain, and Continental Europe. Audiences were enthusiastic about seeing a piece of the American West. Emilio Salgari, a noted Italian writer of adventure stories, met Buffalo Bill when he came to Italy and saw his show; Salgari later featured Cody as a hero in some of his novels.

== &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; ==
In December 1872, Cody traveled to Chicago to make his stage debut with his friend Texas Jack Omohundro in &quot;The Scouts of the Prairie&quot;, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned Buntline. The effort was panned by criticsone critic compared Cody&#x27;s acting to a &quot;diffident schoolboy&quot;but the performer was a hit with the sold-out crowds.

In 1873, Cody invited &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok to join the group in a new play called &quot;Scouts of the Plains&quot;. Hickok did not enjoy acting and often hid behind scenery; in one show, he shot at the spotlight when it focused on him. He was therefore released from the group after a few months. Cody founded the &quot;Buffalo Bill Combination&quot; in 1874, in which he performed for part of the year while scouting on the prairies the rest of the year. The troupe toured for ten years. Cody&#x27;s part typically included a reenactment of an 1876 incident at Warbonnet Creek, where he claimed to have scalped a Cheyenne warrior.

In 1883, in the area of North Platte, Nebraska, Cody founded &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;, a circus-like attraction that toured annually. (Contrary to the popular misconception, the word &quot;Show&quot; was not a part of the title.) In 1886, Cody and Nate Salsbury, his theatrical manager, entered into partnership with Evelyn Booth (1860–1901), a big-game hunter and scion of the aristocratic Booth family. It was at this time Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Cowboy Band was organized. The band was directed by William Sweeney, a cornet player who served as leader of the Cowboy Band from 1883 until 1913. Sweeney handled all of the musical arrangements and wrote a majority of the music performed by the Cowboy Band.

In 1893, Cody changed the title to &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World&quot;. The show began with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups that included the US and another military, cowboys, American Indians, and performers from all over the world in their best attire. Turks, gauchos, Arabs, Mongols and Georgians displayed their distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors would see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many historical western figures participated in the show. For example, Sitting Bull appeared with a band of 20 of his soldiers.

Cody&#x27;s headline performers were well-known in their own right. Annie Oakley and her husband, Frank Butler, were sharpshooters, together with the likes of Gabriel Dumont and Lillian Smith. Performers re-enacted the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and stagecoach robberies. The show was said to end with a re-enactment of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand, in which Cody portrayed General Custer, but this is more legend than fact. The finale was typically a portrayal of an Indian attack on a settler&#x27;s cabin. Cody would ride in with an entourage of cowboys to defend a settler and his family. This finale was featured predominantly as early as 1886 but was not performed after 1907; it was used in 23 of 33 tours. Another celebrity appearing on the show was Calamity Jane, as a storyteller as of 1893. The show influenced many 20th-century portrayals of the West in cinema and literature.
With his profits, Cody purchased a 4,000-acre (16-km²) ranch near North Platte, Nebraska, in 1886. The Scout&#x27;s Rest Ranch included an eighteen-room mansion and a large barn for winter storage of the show&#x27;s livestock.

In 1887, invited by the British businessman John Robinson Whitley, Cody took the show to Great Britain in celebration of the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria, who attended a performance. It played in London and then in Birmingham and Salford, near Manchester, where it stayed for five months.

In 1889, the show toured Europe, and, in 1890, Cody met Pope Leo XIII. On March 8, 1890, a competition took place. Buffalo Bill had met some Italian &quot;butteri&quot; (a less-well-known sort of Italian equivalent of cowboys) and said his men were more skilled at roping calves and performing other similar actions. A group of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s men challenged nine &quot;butteri&quot;, led by , at Prati di Castello neighbourhood in Rome. The &quot;butteri&quot; easily won the competition. Augusto Imperiali became a local hero after the event: a street and a monument were dedicated to him in his hometown, Cisterna di Latina, and he was featured as the hero in a series of comic strips in the 1920s and 1930s.

Cody set up an independent exhibition near the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1893, which greatly contributed to his popularity in the United States. It vexed the promoters of the fair, who had rejected his request to participate.

In 1894, Edison Studios invited Buffalo Bill and his show to be filmed in an early silent film, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;.

On October 29, 1901, outside Lexington, North Carolina, a freight train crashed into one unit of the train carrying Buffalo Bill&#x27;s show from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Danville, Virginia. The freight train&#x27;s engineer had thought that the entire show train had passed, not realizing it was three units, and returned to the tracks; 110 horses, including his mounts Old Pap and Old Eagle, were killed in the crash or had to be killed later. Three young Native Americans were killed in the train accident and many others injured. Annie Oakley&#x27;s injuries were so severe that she was told she would never walk again. She did recover and continued performing later. The incident put the show out of business for a while, and this disruption may have led to its eventual demise.

In 1908, Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the &quot;Two Bills&quot; show. That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.
The Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill Film Company, based in New York City, produced a three-reel motion picture in 1912 titled &quot;The Life of Buffalo Bill&quot;. Cody himself appears in scenes that bookend the short film, a series of adventures presented in flashback as Buffalo Bill&#x27;s dreams. The film had two other directors before it was successfully completed by John B. O&#x27;Brien. The film is in the collection of the Library of Congress.

=== &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; tours of Europe ===
&quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; toured Europe eight times, the first four tours between 1887 and 1892, and the last four from 1902 to 1906.

The &quot;Wild West&quot; first went to London in 1887 as part of the American Exhibition, which coincided with the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, requested a private preview of the &quot;Wild West&quot; performance; he was impressed enough to arrange a command performance for Queen Victoria. The Queen enjoyed the show and meeting the performers, setting the stage for another command performance on June 20, 1887, for her Jubilee guests. Royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and the future King George V. These royal encounters provided &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; an endorsement and publicity that ensured its success. Also, at this time, Buffalo Bill was presented with written accolades from several of America&#x27;s high ranking generals including William T. Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan and William H. Emory testifying to his service, bravery, and character. Among the presentations was a document signed by Governor John M. Thayer of Nebraska appointing Cody as aide-de-camp on the Governor&#x27;s staff with the rank of colonel dated March 8, 1887. The rank had little official authority but the English press quickly capitalized on the new title of &quot;Colonel Cody&quot;. &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; closed its successful London run in October 1887 after more than 300 performances, with more than 2.5 million tickets sold. The tour made stops in Birmingham and Manchester before returning to the United States in May 1888 for a short summer tour.

&quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; returned to Europe in May 1889 as part of the Exposition Universelle in Paris, an event that commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille and featured the debut of the Eiffel Tower. On this tour, his portrait was painted by Europe&#x27;s leading female painter Rosa Bonheur. The tour moved to the South of France and Barcelona, Spain, then on to Italy. While in Rome, a Wild West delegation was received by Pope Leo XIII. Buffalo Bill was disappointed that the condition of the Colosseum did not allow it to be a venue; however, at Verona, the &quot;Wild West&quot; did perform in the ancient Roman amphitheater. The tour finished with stops in Austria-Hungary and Germany.
In 1891 the show toured cities in Belgium and the Netherlands before returning to Great Britain to close the season. Cody depended on several staffs to manage arrangements for touring with the large and complex show: in 1891 Major Arizona John Burke was the general manager for the Buffalo Bill Wild West Company; William Laugan , supply agent; George C. Crager, Sioux interpreter, considered leader of relations with the Indians; and John Shangren, a native interpreter. In 1891, Buffalo Bill performed in Karlsruhe, Germany, in the Südstadt Quarter. The inhabitants of Südstadt are nicknamed &quot;Indianer&quot; (German for &quot;American Indians&quot;) to this day, and the most accepted theory says that this is due to Buffalo Bill&#x27;s show. 
In October Cody brought the show to Dennistoun, Glasgow, where it ran from November 16 until February 27, 1892, in the East End Exhibition Building, and George C. Crager sold The Ghost Shirt to the Kelvingrove Museum.

The show&#x27;s 1892 tour was confined to Great Britain; it featured another command performance for Queen Victoria. The tour finished with a six-month run in London before leaving Europe for nearly a decade.

&quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; returned to Europe in December 1902 with a fourteen-week run in London, capped by a visit from King Edward VII and the future King George V. The &quot;Wild West&quot; traveled throughout Great Britain in a tour in 1902 and 1903 and a tour in 1904, performing in nearly every city large enough to support it. The 1905 tour began in April with a two-month run in Paris, after which the show traveled around France, performing mostly one-night stands, concluding in December. The final tour, in 1906, began in France on March 4 and quickly moved to Italy for two months. The show then traveled east, performing in Austro-Hungarian territories of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) and Croatia-Slavonia, before returning west to tour in Galicia (now part of Poland), then Germany, and Belgium.

The show was enormously successful in Europe, making Cody an international celebrity and an American icon. Mark Twain commented, &quot;It is often said on the other side of the water that none of the exhibitions which we send to England are purely and distinctly American. If you will take the &quot;Wild West&quot; show over there you can remove that reproach.&quot; The &quot;Wild West&quot; brought an exotic foreign world to life for its European audiences, allowing a last glimpse at the fading American frontier.

Several members of the &quot;Wild West&quot; show died of accidents or disease during these tours in Europe:
*Surrounded by the Enemy (1865–1887), of the Oglala Lakota band, died of a lung infection. His remains were buried at Brompton Cemetery in London. Red Penny, the one-year-old son of Little Chief and Good Robe, had died four months earlier and was buried in the same cemetery.
*Paul Eagle Star (1864–1891), of the Brulé Lakota band, died in Sheffield, of tetanus and complications from injuries caused when his horse fell on him, breaking his leg. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery. His remains were exhumed in March 1999 and transported to the Rosebud Indian Reservation, in South Dakota, by his grandchildren Moses and Lucy Eagle Star II. The remains were reburied in the Lakota cemetery in Rosebud two months later.
*Long Wolf (1833–1892), of the Oglala Lakota band, died of pneumonia and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. His remains were exhumed and transported to South Dakota&#x27;s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in September 1997 by his descendants, including his great-grandson, John Black Feather. The remains were reburied at Saint Ann&#x27;s Cemetery, in Denby.
*White Star Ghost Dog (1890–1892), of the Oglala Lakota band, died after a horse-riding accident and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. Her remains were exhumed and transported to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in South Dakota, in September 1997, with those of Long Wolf, and were reburied at Saint Ann&#x27;s Cemetery, in Denby.

== Life in Cody, Wyoming ==

In 1895, Cody was instrumental in the founding of the town of Cody, the seat of Park County, in northwestern Wyoming. Today the Old Trail Town museum is at the center of the community and commemorates the traditions of Western life. Cody first passed through the region in the 1870s. He was so impressed by the development possibilities from irrigation, rich soil, grand scenery, hunting, and proximity to Yellowstone Park that he returned in the mid-1890s to start a town. Streets in the town were named after his associates: Beck, Alger, Rumsey, Bleistein, and Salsbury. The town was incorporated in 1901.

In November 1902, Cody opened the Irma Hotel, named after his daughter. He envisioned a growing number of tourists coming to Cody on the recently opened Burlington rail line. He expected that they would proceed up Cody Road, along the north fork of the Shoshone River, to visit Yellowstone Park. To accommodate travelers, Cody completed the construction of the Wapiti Inn and Pahaska Tepee in 1905 along Cody Road with the assistance of the artist and rancher Abraham Archibald Anderson.

Cody established the TE Ranch, located on the south fork of the Shoshone River about thirty-five miles from Cody. When he acquired the TE property, he stocked it with cattle sent from Nebraska and South Dakota. The new herd carried the TE brand. The late 1890s were relatively prosperous years for the &quot;Wild West&quot; show, and he bought more land to add to the ranch. He eventually held about eight thousand acres ( square miles; 32 square kilometers) of private land for grazing operations and ran about a thousand head of cattle. He operated a dude ranch, pack-horse camping trips, and big-game hunting business at and from the TE Ranch. In his spacious ranch house, he entertained notable guests from Europe and America.

Cody founded the local newspaper, &quot;The Cody Enterprise&quot;, in 1899 with Col. John Peake.

Cody published his autobiography, &quot;The Life and Adventures of Buffalo Bill&quot;, in 1879. Another autobiography, &quot;The Great West That Was: &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s&quot; Life Story&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International Magazine&quot; from August 1916 to July 1917. and ghostwritten by James J. Montague. It contained several errors, in part because it was completed after Cody&#x27;s death in January 1917. It was accompanied by illustrations by N. C. Wyeth.

=== Irrigation ===
Larry McMurtry, along with historians such as R. L. Wilson, asserted that at the turn of the 20th century, Cody was the most recognizable celebrity on Earth. While Cody&#x27;s show brought an appreciation for the Western and American Indian cultures, he saw the American West change dramatically during his life. Bison herds, which had once numbered in the millions, were threatened with extinction. Railroads crossed the plains, barbed wire, and other types of fences divided the land for farmers and ranchers, and the once-threatening Indian tribes were confined to reservations. Wyoming&#x27;s coal, oil and natural gas were beginning to be exploited toward the end of his life.

The Shoshone River was dammed for hydroelectric power and irrigation. In 1897 and 1899, Cody and his associates acquired from the State of Wyoming the right to take water from the Shoshone River to irrigate about of land in the Big Horn Basin. They began developing a canal to carry water diverted from the river, but their plans did not include a water storage reservoir. Cody and his associates were unable to raise sufficient capital to complete their plan. Early in 1903, they joined with the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners in urging the federal government to step in and help with irrigation in the valley.

The Shoshone Project became one of the first federal water development projects undertaken by the newly formed Reclamation Service, later known as the Bureau of Reclamation. After Reclamation took over the project in 1903, investigating engineers recommended constructing a dam on the Shoshone River in the canyon west of Cody. Construction of the Shoshone Dam started in 1905, a year after the Shoshone Project was authorized. When it was completed in 1910, it was the tallest dam in the world. Almost three decades after its construction, the name of the dam and reservoir was changed to Buffalo Bill Dam by an act of Congress.

Cody married Louisa Frederici on March 6, 1866, just a few days after his twentieth birthday. The couple met when Cody had traveled to St. Louis under his command during the Civil War. Cody&#x27;s autobiography barely mentioned the courtship to Frederici but declared, &quot;I now adored her above any other young lady I had ever seen.&quot; Cody suggested in letters and his autobiography that Frederici had pestered him into marriage, but he was aware that it was &quot;very smart to be engaged.&quot; This rhetoric became pushed more and more in his explanations for marriage as the relationship between him and his wife began to decline.

Frederici stayed home with their children. Two of their children died young while the family was living in Rochester, New York. These two and a third child were buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester. While his wife and children remained in North Platte, Bill stayed outside the home, hunting, scouting, and building up his acting career in the &quot;Wild West&quot; show. As Cody began to travel more frequently and to places farther from home, problems over infidelity, real or imagined, began to arise. These concerns grew so great that in 1893, Frederici showed up at his hotel room in Chicago unannounced and was led to &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Cody&#x27;s suite.&quot; Cody mentions in his autobiography that he was &quot;embarrassed by the throng of beautiful ladies&quot; who surrounded him both in the cast and the audiences, and this trend continued as he became involved with more and more actresses who were not afraid to show their attraction to him in front of an audience.
Cody filed for divorce in 1904, after 38 years of marriage. His decision was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between his wife and his sisters, and friction between the children and their father. By 1891, Cody had instructed his brother-in-law to handle Frederici&#x27;s affairs and property, saying &quot;I often feel sorry for her. She is a strange woman but I don&#x27;t mind herremember she is my wifeand let it go at that. If she gets cranky, just laugh at it, she can&#x27;t help it.&quot; Cody hoped to keep the divorce quiet, to not disrupt his show or his stage persona, but Frederici had other ideas. Filing for divorce was scandalous in the early 20th century when marital unions were seen as binding for life. This furthered Cody&#x27;s determination to get Frederici to agree to a &quot;quiet legal separation,&quot; to avoid &quot;war and publicity.&quot; The court records and depositions that were kept with the court case threatened to ruin Cody&#x27;s respectability and credibility. His private life had not been open to the public before, and the application for divorce brought unwanted attention to the matter. Not only did townspeople feel the need to take sides in the divorce, but headlines rang out with information about Cody&#x27;s alleged infidelities or Frederici&#x27;s excesses.

Cody&#x27;s two main allegations against his wife were that she attempted to poison him on multiple occasions (this allegation was later proved false) and that she made living in North Platte &quot;unbearable and intolerable&quot; for Cody and his guests. The press picked up on the story immediately, creating a battle between Cody and Frederici&#x27;s teams of lawyers, both of which seemed to be the better authority on Nebraska divorce law. Divorce laws varied from state to state in the early 1900s. Desertion was the main grounds for divorce, but in some jurisdictions, such as Kansas, divorce could be granted if a spouse was &quot;intolerable.&quot; The Victorian ideal of marriage did not allow for divorce in any case, but the move westward forced a change in the expectations of husbands and wives and the ability to remain married. In Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1867 records show that there were more divorces in that year than marriages. Part of the appeal of the frontier was that &quot;a man cannot keep his wife here.&quot;

After Cody&#x27;s announcement that he was suing for divorce, Frederici began to fight back. She claimed that she had never attempted to poison him and that she wished to remain married. The trial then moved to court in February 1905. One of the witnesses who spoke to a newspaper was Mrs. John Boyer, a housekeeper in the Cody home who was married to a man who worked for the &quot;Wild West&quot; show. She claimed that Frederici acted inhospitably towards Cody&#x27;s guests and that, when Cody was not at the ranch, she would &quot;feed the men too much and talk violently about Cody and his alleged sweethearts... and that she was seen putting something into his coffee.&quot; Other witnesses mentioned Cody&#x27;s comment that to handle his wife he had to &quot;get drunk and stay drunk.&quot; The battle in court continued, with testimony from three witnesses, Mary Hoover, George Hoover, and M.E. Vroman. After the witnesses had testified, Cody changed his mind about the divorce.

Cody&#x27;s change of mind was not due to any improvement in his relationship with Frederici but rather was due to the death of their daughter, Arta Louise, in 1904 from &quot;organic trouble.&quot; With this weighing heavily on him, Cody sent a telegram to Frederici hoping to put aside &quot;personal differences&quot; for the funeral. Frederici was furious and refused any temporary reconciliation. Cody decided to continue pursuing the divorce, adding to his complaint that Frederici would not sign mortgages and that she had subjected him to &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; in blaming him for the death of Arta. When the trial proceeded a year later, in 1905, both their tempers were still hot. The final ruling was that &quot;incompatibility was not grounds for divorce,&quot; so that the couple was to stay legally married. The judge and the public sided with Frederici, the judge deciding that her husband&#x27;s alleged affairs and his sisters&#x27; meddling in his marriage had caused his unhappiness, not his wife. Cody returned to Paris to continue with the &quot;Wild West&quot; show and attempted to maintain a hospitable, but distant, relationship with his wife. The two reconciled in 1910, after which Frederici often traveled with her husband until he died in 1917.

Bill&#x27;s daughter, Irma Cody, died in Cody in 1918. She is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Cody, Wyoming.

== Death ==

Cody died on January 10, 1917. He was baptized in the Catholic Church the day before his death by Father Christopher Walsh of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. He received a full Masonic funeral. Upon the news of Cody&#x27;s death, tributes were made by King George V, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and President Woodrow Wilson. His funeral service was held at the Elks Lodge Hall in Denver. The governor of Wyoming, John B. Kendrick, a friend of Cody, led the funeral procession to the cemetery.

At the time of his death, Cody&#x27;s once-great fortune had dwindled to less than $100,000 (approximately $ in ). He left his burial arrangements with his wife. She said that he had always said he wanted to be buried on Lookout Mountain, which was corroborated by their daughter Irma, Cody&#x27;s sisters, and family friends. But other family members joined the people of Cody in saying that he should be buried in the town he founded.

On June 3, 1917, Cody was buried on Lookout Mountain, in Golden, Colorado, west of Denver, on the edge of the Rocky Mountains, overlooking the Great Plains. His burial site was selected by his sister Mary Decker. In 1948, the Cody chapter of the American Legion offered a $10,000 reward (approximately $ in ) to anyone who could steal Cody&#x27;s body and deliver it to Cody, Wyoming. In response, the Denver chapter of the American Legion mounted a guard over the grave. There are still rumors about the true burial place of Buffalo Bill Cody. Although Lookout Mountain has a gravesite behind a fence and under concrete, there are claims that Cody, Wyoming, was the beneficiary of a body swap carried out before he was buried in Colorado and that he was instead laid to rest on top of Cedar Mountain in Cody.

On June 9, 1917, his show was sold to Archer Banker of Salina, Kansas, for $105,000 (approximately $ in ).

== Philosophy ==
As a frontier scout, Cody respected Native Americans and supported their civil rights. He employed many Native Americans, as he thought his show offered them good pay with a chance to improve their lives. He described them as &quot;the former foe, present friend, the American&quot; and once said, speaking of later events than the original frontier raids, that &quot;every Indian outbreak that I have ever known has resulted from broken promises and broken treaties by the government.&quot;

Cody supported the rights of women. He said, &quot;What we want to do is give women, even more, liberty than they have. Let them do any kind of work they see fit, and if they do it as well as men, give them the same pay.&quot; Women such as Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane had legendary roles in his show, and later in life Cody continued to hire and treat women fairly. Cody said in an interview in 1898, &quot;Set that down in great big black type that Buffalo Bill favors woman suffrage… These fellows who prate about the women taking their places make me laugh… If a woman can do the same work that a man can do and do it just as well, she should have the same pay.&quot;

In his shows, the Indians were usually depicted attacking stagecoaches and wagon trains and were driven off by cowboys and soldiers. Many family members traveled with the men; Cody encouraged the wives and children of his Native American performers, as part of the show, to set up camp just as they would in their homelands. He wanted the paying public to see the human side of the &quot;fierce warriors&quot;.

Cody was known as a conservationist who spoke out against hide-hunting and advocated the establishment of a hunting season.

== Cody as a Freemason ==
Cody was active in the concordant bodies of the fraternal organization of Freemasonry having been initiated in Platte Valley Lodge No. 32, in North Platte, Nebraska, on March 5, 1870. He received his second and third degrees on April 2, 1870, and January 10, 1871, respectively. He became a Knight Templar in 1889 and received his 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in 1894.

== Legacy and honors ==

*In 1872, Cody was awarded the Medal of Honor for service as a civilian scout to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, for &quot;gallantry in action&quot; at Loupe Forke, Platte River, Nebraska. In 1917, after Congress revised the standards for the award, the U.S. Army removed from the rolls 911 medals previously awarded to civilians or for actions that would not warrant a Medal of Honor under the new higher standards. Cody&#x27;s medal was among those revoked. In 1977, Congress began reviewing numerous cases; it reinstated the medals for Cody and four other civilian scouts on June 12, 1989.
* In 1891, a bust of Cody was created by Anton Friedrich Scholl for the Nebraska Hall of Fame.
* Cody was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame in 1967.
*The Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway through the Shoshone National Forest is a National Forest Scenic Byway and Wyoming Scenic Byway named after Buffalo Bill.
* Because of his funding and planning with The Shoshone Project The Buffalo Bill Dam, The Buffalo Bill Reservoir created by the dam, and the Buffalo Bill State Park at the reservoir are all named after him.
* The Buffalo Bill Ranch State Park, also known as the Scout&#x27;s Rest Ranch in North Platte, Nebraska was designated as a Nebraska State Historical Park in 1965, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2021.
*Cody was honored by two U.S. postage stamps. One was a fifteen-cent Great Americans series stamp.
*The Buffalo Bill Center of the West was founded in Cody, Wyoming. The town is named in his honor.

*&quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians&quot; is a collaborative project of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center and the history department of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, with assistance from the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. This digital history project contains letters, official programs, newspaper reports, posters, and photographs. The project highlights the social and cultural forces that shaped how American Indians were defined, debated, contested, and controlled in this period. This project was based on the Papers of William F. Cody project of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center.
*The National Museum of American History&#x27;s Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution preserves and displays Gertrude Käsebier&#x27;s photographs of the Wild West show. Michelle Delaney has published &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Warriors: Photographs by Gertrude Käsebier&quot;.
*Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from ancestors who were Carlisle Indian School alumni and worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows. Several national projects celebrate Wild Westers and Wild Westing. Wild Westers still perform in movies, powwows, pageants, and rodeos.
*The Buffalo Bills, a National Football League team based in Buffalo, New York, were named after the entertainer. Other early football teams (such as the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference) used the nickname, solely for name recognition, as Cody had no special connection with the city of Buffalo. He did however live for a few years in nearby Rochester. Three of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s children are buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York.
*Euro Disneyland Railroad locomotive #1 is named the &quot;W. F. Cody&quot; in his honor.
*In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.
*Bubble O&#x27; Bill, an ice cream in the shape of a cowboy currently sold in Australia and previously available in the United States and United Kingdom, is named as such after Cody&#x27;s stage name.
*Movies about Cody inspired a youth subculture in the Belgian Congo in the 1950s, with young men and women dressing like him and forming neighborhood gangs. After Congolese independence, some of the &quot;Bills&quot; went on to careers in the music industry.

<text>Arthur Middleton (June 26, 1742 – January 1, 1787) was a Founding Father of the United States, signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and a representative from South Carolina in the Second Continental Congress.

==Life==
Middleton was born in Charleston, Province of South Carolina, in 1742. His parents were Henry Middleton and Mary Baker Williams, both of English descent. He was educated in Britain at Harrow School, Westminster School, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He studied law at the Middle Temple and traveled extensively in Europe where his taste in literature, music, and art was developed and refined. In 1764, Arthur and his bride Mary Izard settled at Middleton Place.

Keenly interested in Carolina, Middleton was a more radical thinker than his father. He was a leader of the American Party in Carolina and one of the boldest members of the Council of Safety and its Secret Committee. In 1776, Middleton was elected to succeed his father in the Continental Congress and subsequently was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Also in 1776, he and William Henry Drayton designed the Great Seal of South Carolina. His attitude toward Loyalists was said to be ruthless, this stood in contrast to other South Carolina patriots such as Francis Marion who led the effort to reconcile with the loyalists after the war ended.

During the American Revolutionary War, Middleton served in the defense of Charleston. After the city&#x27;s fall to the British in 1780, he was sent as a prisoner of war to St. Augustine, Florida (along with Edward Rutledge and Thomas Heyward Jr.), until exchanged in July the following year.

==Death, family and legacy==

Middleton died on January 1, 1787, at age 44 and was buried in the family tomb in the Gardens at Middleton Place. The death notice from the &quot;State Gazette of South-Carolina&quot; describes him as a &quot;tender husband and parent, humane master, steady unshaken patriot, the gentleman, and the scholar.&quot; The plantation passed to Henry, his eldest son, later governor of South Carolina, U.S. Representative and minister to Russia.

Middleton was an ancestor of actor Charles B. Middleton, who played Ming the Merciless in the Flash Gordon movies of the 1930s. Middleton&#x27;s son-in-law was Congressman Daniel Elliott Huger who was the grandfather-in-law of Confederate General Arthur Middleton Manigault. Middleton&#x27;s sister, Susannah Middleton, was the great-great-grandmother of Baldur von Schirach, onetime leader of the Hitler Youth and later governor (&quot;Gauleiter&quot; or &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;) of the Reichsgau Vienna, who was convicted of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials.
The United States Navy ship USS &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; (AP-55/APA-25) was named for him.

<doc id="152057" wikidata="Q531102" url="?curid=152057" title="Rodmell">
<text>Rodmell is a small village and civil parish in the Lewes District of East Sussex, England. It is located three miles (4.8 km) south-east of Lewes, on the Lewes to Newhaven road and six and a half miles from the City of Brighton &amp; Hove and is situated by the west banks of the River Ouse. The village is served by Southease railway station, opened in 1906. The Prime Meridian passes just to the west of the village.

The village name has been variously spelled as &quot;Ramelle&quot; or &quot;Redmelle&quot; (11th century), &quot;Redmelde&quot; (12th century), &quot;Radmelde&quot; (13th century) and &quot;Radmill&quot; (18th century). It most likely derives from Brittonic where &quot;Rhod&quot; denotes a wheel and &quot;Melin&quot; refers to a Mill, hence mill wheel. A less likely derivation is from Old English &quot;read *mylde&quot;, &quot;[place with] red soil&quot;.
Before the time of the Norman conquest the manor of Rodmell was held by King Harold II. Rodmell was a significant settlement at the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, with 153 households. Between 1091 and 1095 the church was granted to Lewes Priory by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey. The early Norman church is dedicated to St Peter. The font is believed to be Saxon, predating the building itself. More recently, Monk&#x27;s House was the home of the author Virginia Woolf for twenty-one years until her suicide in 1941.

The village is bisected by the road from Lewes to Newhaven which passes through Iford. This road also passes the neighbouring village of Southease.

The village was part of the Holmstrow hundred until the abolition of hundreds in the 19th century.

==Notable buildings and areas==

Like many of the county&#x27;s southern parishes, Rodmell, is a long thin parish. From southeast to the northwest, it runs from Saltdean over the South Downs to the Lewes Brooks and as far as the River Ouse. To the north is the Iford parish and to the south is Southease.

There are many reasons why the Downland area is special as well. The South Downs Way crosses the scarp top. West from the track, on the Down between Highdole Hill and Fore Hill, there are many surviving marks from a busy Iron Age and Roman village. It used to be called ‘Isenden’, a Tolkienesque name, which sounds like it meant ‘Ouse dean’. Unusually, the long and convoluted dry valley behind the scarp does not drain southwards to the sea, but easterly, then northerly to the Brooks and the Ouse. There are also many surviving Down pasture sites that deserve to be known better. Michael Light, a worker at South Farm, has written a book/pamphlet with a number of editions recording the birds he has seen in the parish. In 2005 he recorded turtle dove, barn owl and little owl breeding in the area. He also recorded dotterel and yellow wagtail on passage on the flooded arable fields.

===St Peter&#x27;s Church===
St Peter&#x27;s Church is the parish church and dates from the 12th century. It is a Grade I listed building and unlike many churches it has retained its original features. Consequently it is among the earliest surviving examples of Norman architecture in the country. 

===Lewes Brooks===

There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within the parish. Lewes Brooks is of biological importance and is part of the flood plain of the River Ouse. It provides a habitat for many other invertebrates such as water beetles and snails.

===Monk&#x27;s House===
Monk&#x27;s House is 16th-century weatherboarded cottage that is owned by the National Trust. It lies on the village&#x27;s eastern boundary with the Lewes Brooks. It was inhabited by members of the Bloomsbury Group, Leonard and the novelist Virginia Woolf, from 1919 until Leonard&#x27;s death in 1969.

===Northease Manor===

The historic Northease Manor is located between Rodmell and Southease. Originally a chapelry and then a private house, it has been a private school since the late 1960s. The main building dates from the 17th Century; a large thatched barn known as the &quot;Tudor Hall&quot; and the walls of an adjacent building are significantly older.

===Mill Hill===

Running west from the Village up the scarp slope is Mill Hill (). This landscape is full of impressive viewpoints. Standing on Mill Hill is almost like being on a cliff from which you can see down to Seaford Bay and across to the long shoulder of Southease Hill. Often such steep slopes have been saved from intensive farming and the agrochemicals that implies, but unfortunately Mill Hill was not spared. Only at its base and along the old drove footpath on its northern edge does the old wildlife survive intact. Now it is well managed though and the herbs and insects are returning. Along the footpath edge you can still find bastard toadflax and horseshoe vetch. At the southern end the Northease White Way cuts a substantial bostal and there are two chalk pits by its side. The Down pasture above the Whiteway () is a flowery spot in summer.

===Breaky Bottom===

Breaky Bottom is the name of a valley within the parish. It is owned by Peter Hall who created Breaky Bottom vineyard in 1974. The vineyard produces a well-known English wine and was a former gold medallist in the Wine Magazine International Wine Challenge. The slope to the southwest of the vineyard () has retained some of its old Down pasture flora. Above it on the spur is a round barrow (). To the east of farm is Access Land which continues north into the Iford parish and Whiteway Bottom.

===Highdole Hill===

You can walk to Highdole Hill () up the spine of Telscombe Tye. At the summit you have views of the sea, distant glimpses of the Weald and white cliffs and what strikes many walkers is the silence because, despite its height, the sound of roads do not reach here. 

The lost Romano-British village of Isenden sits on the hill. In the 1930s it was excavated and Roman bronze, iron, tiles, querns, pottery and two bronze coins were found. The huts of the village on the hilltop seem to have been arranged around a banked roadway, with other roadways nearby and many small fields and barrows. The findings suggested that the village was occupied shortly before the Roman invasion and abandoned in about AD 350. It is now a designated scheduled monument. Unfortunately, modern ploughing has destroyed most of these remains. The village remains are now more obvious towards Fore Hill, near the flint-walled sheepfold (). There the pasture has preserved a muddle of field lynchets and round barrows there.
===Fore Hill===

To the east of High Dole is Fore Hill. The Greenwich meridian line runs through it. On its steep northern slope () the chalk grassland is well preserved, with lots of cowslips, harebells, devil’s-bit scabious and rampion. The steepest bit to the southeast overlooks Cricketing Bottom and many traditional flowers survive including dropwort, thyme and cowslips. Marbled white and common blue butterflies enjoy the sunny slopes.

==Governance==
Rodmell Parish Council has seven councillors. Their responsibilities include footpaths, street lighting, playgrounds and minor planning applications.

The next level of government is the district council. The parish of Rodmell lies within the Kingston ward of Lewes District Council, which returns a single councillor.

East Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which Rodmell is within the Newhaven and Ouse Valley West division, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. The Liberal Democrat Carla Butler was elected in the 2013 election.

The UK Parliament constituency for Rodmell is Lewes. The Liberal Democrat Norman Baker served as the constituency MP from 1997 but the Conservative Maria Caulfield was elected in 2015. As of July 2024, Liberal Democrat James MacCleary is the MP.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, the village was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.

== Notable people ==
* The lyrical novelist Virginia Woolf lived in Monk&#x27;s House for twenty-one years until her death. She left the house for the last time on 28 March 1941, took a walk through the local fields, and drowned herself in the nearby River Ouse. Her husband Leonard Woolf continued to live there until his death in 1969. The house was bought by the University of Sussex as Virginia&#x27;s papers had been left to the university. It was acquired and restored by the National Trust.
* The composer Benjamin Frankel and his wife Anna lived at Rodmell Hill, next door to Leonard Woolf, from 1952 until 1958.
* Captain F. W. Hartman and his wife Dorothy lived at Northease Manor during the 1930s. Captain Hartman was Master of the Southdown Hunt now the Southdown and Eridge Hunt. As Master of Fox Hounds, he hosted a Hunt Ball at Northease in January 1938 which was reported in &quot;The Times&quot;. He and his wife were directors of Lendrum &amp; Hartman, sole concessionaires of imported Buick and Cadillac cars from America. They supplied King Edward VIII with a custom-built Buick in 1936, which was transported with him by warship to France on his abdication.
* The Rev. Henry Goodman, a Nonconformist preacher, who was ejected from the church after the 1660 Stuart Restoration. On 29 May 1670 he went down to Lewes to preach at the request of his friends. &quot;Great caution was used to prevent danger; but some informers slyly mixed with the audience. He preached on Eph. v. 16, &quot;Redeeming the time&quot;, whereas they fixed on the words following &quot;because the days are evil&quot;. Mr. Goodman, living at a distance, escaped the fine; but unconscionable fines were levied on many of his hearers, and they were levied still more unconscionably.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Rodmell was the venue of a local cricket match which was immortalised by A. G. Macdonell in his humorous novel &quot;England, Their England&quot;, in which it was called &quot;Fordenden, Kent&quot;.

<doc id="152058" wikidata="Q469620" url="?curid=152058" title="Beneath the Planet of the Apes">
<text>Beneath the Planet of the Apes is a 1970 American science fiction film directed by Ted Post from a screenplay by Paul Dehn, based on a story by Dehn and Mort Abrahams. The film is the sequel to &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) and the second installment in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film series. It stars James Franciscus, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, and Linda Harrison, and features Charlton Heston in a supporting role. In the film, a second spacecraft arrives on the planet ruled by apes, carrying astronaut Brent (Franciscus), who searches and finds Taylor (Heston) only to realize the apes are not their greatest threat.

&quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; was released in the United States on May 26, 1970, by 20th Century-Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1971.

==Plot==
Time-displaced astronaut Taylor and the mute Nova travel through the desert of the Forbidden Zone in search of a new life away from Ape City. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and chasms open. Confused by this, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears through it. Unable to reach him, Nova is left alone.

After being sent to search for Taylor and his crew, a second spaceship crash-lands on the Forbidden Zone. Brent, the only survivor, notes he is in the year 3955, but assumes he has travelled to another planet. After burying his fellow astronaut Skipper, he encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor&#x27;s dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City and is shocked to discover the simian civilization. The gorilla General Ursus leads a rally for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius. Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira, who treat his wound and mention their time with Taylor.

Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave that turns out to be the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway. Brent realizes he is in Earth&#x27;s post-apocalyptic future. Following a humming sound deeper into the tunnels, Brent becomes agitated and erratic and attempts to kill Nova, before stopping and backing away to another room. Entering the remains of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb.

Brent and Nova are captured and interrogated by the telepaths, who are descendants of the human survivors of a nuclear holocaust. They mutated over generations and claim to be a peaceful society, despite using mind-control and illusion on their enemies. The mutants force Brent into revealing the apes&#x27; march on the Forbidden Zone. Their attempts to repel the invaders with illusions of fire and other horrors fail, as Zaius sees through them. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their &quot;Divine Bomb&quot; as a last resort, holding a religious ritual. During the ritual, the telepaths remove their human masks to reveal disfigurements of sickly pale skin, scarring and vascular varicose disease.

Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell where he finds Taylor. One mutant, explaining that they cannot let them leave the city alive for fear of revealing it to the apes, uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight each other. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first spoken word: &quot;Taylor!&quot; This breaks the mutant&#x27;s concentration, freeing the astronauts from his control long enough for them to kill him. Taylor recognizes the bomb&#x27;s insignia &quot;&quot; as a &quot;doomsday bomb&quot;, which has a cobalt casing capable of igniting the atmosphere and incinerating the entire planet.

The apes invade the subterranean city, making their way to the cathedral; many mutants are either captured, killed, or die by suicide. After Nova is killed by a gorilla in the midst of the chaos, Taylor and Brent reach the cathedral as Mendez, the telepaths&#x27; leader, is shot dead after raising the bomb into activation position. The humans attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot in the chest while pleading to Zaius. Zaius refuses to listen and decries humanity&#x27;s violence and the ruination of all things unaware that his own apes are doing the same thing. When Brent is gunned down after killing Ursus, the mortally wounded Taylor curses Zaius, collapses and dies bringing his hand down on the bomb&#x27;s detonation switch. The bomb goes off destroying the entire planet.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Soon after &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; became a hit, a sequel started being considered by 20th Century-Fox. Screenwriter Rod Serling was consulted, but the producers wanted the script sooner than Serling, who was busy at the time, would have been able to provide it so Serling declined.
Then the producers turned to the author of the original novel, Pierre Boulle, who wrote a draft for a sequel called &quot;Planet of the Men&quot;, where protagonist George Taylor would lead an uprising of the enslaved men to take back control from the apes as the gorilla general Ursus wants to fight humans. Boulle&#x27;s script was rejected as it was felt that it lacked the &quot;visual shock and the surprise&quot; of the original. Associate producer Mort Abrahams then wrote story elements, and British writer Paul Dehn was hired to develop them into a script, tentatively called &quot;Planet of the Apes Revisited&quot;. Dehn drew on his trauma of the 1945 atomic bombings and the fear of nuclear warfare on the story. One of the elements thought up by Abrahams and Dehn was a half-human, half-ape child, but despite even going through make-up tests this was dropped due to the implication of bestiality. According to screenwriter Dehn the idea for &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; came about from the end of the first installment which suggested that New York City was buried underground.

Although Charlton Heston showed little interest in reprising his role as Taylor, studio head Richard D. Zanuck thought the actor was essential to the sequel. After some disagreement with the actor&#x27;s agents, Heston agreed to briefly appear with the provision that his character be killed and that his pay go to charity. The writers decided to have Taylor disappear at the story&#x27;s start and only return by the film&#x27;s ending, and have a new protagonist for the major part of the story. James Franciscus accepted the role of Brent as a break from his usual TV fare.

Director Franklin J. Schaffner was invited to return to the series, but declined due to a commitment to &quot;Patton&quot;. Television and film director Ted Post was approached, and while objecting to the script for &quot;not making a point at all&quot;, the producers asked what he did not like. Post then wrote a letter saying that &quot;the loss of a planet is the loss of all hope&quot;. Post tried to get the other writer of the original, Michael Wilson, but a budget cut prevented him from doing so. Post and Franciscus – who wanted to help clarify the actions of and give depth to the character of Brent – spent a week rewriting the script, leading to over fifty pages of notes suggesting story ideas to fix some of the narrative problems in Paul Dehn&#x27;s script.

Roddy McDowall could not return for his role in this sequel, because he was in Scotland directing &quot;Tam Lin&quot;. Actor David Watson portrayed Cornelius in this film with McDowall only appearing briefly in clips from the first film used during &quot;Beneath&quot;&#x27;s pre-title sequence. Along with the animated series &quot;Return to the Planet of the Apes&quot;, this film is one of only two 1970s &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; productions in which McDowall does not appear. Orson Welles was offered the role of General Ursus, but he turned it down objecting against spending all his screentime in a mask and make-up. The part ultimately went to James Gregory.

Before Zanuck was fired as studio president during production, he suggested that Post add an element suggested by Heston, the Alpha Omega doomsday bomb, to end the series. However, before the film&#x27;s release, the producers were considering ideas for another sequel.

===Filming===
Production began in February 1969. The sequel, now titled &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, had its budget reduced from $5 million to $2.5 million because Fox had suffered recently from several underperforming big-budget films, like &quot;Star!&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; Nonetheless, the studio expected the film to return Fox to profitability. Heston&#x27;s parts were filmed in just eight days. The sets of the mutants&#x27; council chamber and the temple of the bomb were redresses of the Grand Central – 42nd Street station and Harmonia Gardens sets from the film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;

===Music===
The original &quot;Apes&quot; composer, Jerry Goldsmith, was invited to write the score for the sequel, but Schaffner was using Goldsmith for &quot;Patton&quot;. Leonard Rosenman was hired to compose the score. Rosenman tried to blend Goldsmith&#x27;s distinctive score with his own style, showcased in productions such as &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. An official soundtrack LP was issued on the Amos Records label soon after the film&#x27;s debut in 1970. For the LP, Rosenman was asked to rearrange his score for a smaller orchestra, adding contemporary elements such as electric guitar and rock percussion. These re-recorded pieces were interspersed with dialogue taken from the film. The soundtrack featured some of the leading Los Angeles studio musicians of the time, including bassist Carol Kaye and Moog pioneer Paul Beaver.

A short sequence of diegetic music features in the scene set in the ruins of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, in which the telepaths are heard singing a dystopian hymn in praise of the atom bomb. For this scene, Rosenman composed a discordant setting of Cecil Frances Alexander&#x27;s 1848 Christian hymn &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;, with the lyrics altered to pay homage to the &quot;Bomb Almighty&quot;.

==Novelization==
The novelization of the film by Michael Avallone retained the original scripted ending. Brent does not kill General Ursus. Taylor confronts him and Dr. Zaius. As Taylor tries to reason with Zaius, Zaius condemns him and Ursus repeatedly shoots Taylor with his pistol; Brent&#x27;s rifle empties and the gorillas kill him. Ursus is horrified, telling Zaius that he has emptied the pistol into Taylor; he should be dead, but he still lives. Knowing he is dying, Taylor (after Zaius refuses to help him) decides to stop the violence by detonating the bomb. This he does, destroying the Earth itself.

==Comic book adaptations==
Gold Key Comics produced an adaptation of &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1970. This was the first comics publication in the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise. Later, Marvel Comics published a different version in two series (b/w magazine 1974–77, color comic book 1975-76). Malibu Comics reprinted the Marvel adaptations when they had the license in the early 1990s.

In 2015 IDW Publishing produced a mini series called &quot;Planet of the Apes - The Primate Directive&quot; where the crew of the TOS Enterprise followed a Klingon ship into the universe of &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; which the Klingons are trying to use as a way to get around the Organian Treaty by expanding their empire into another universe. Both crews of the Enterprise and Klingon ship become behind the scenes characters in the events of &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;. A tricorder with the sling-shot effect is left behind and is used by Dr. Milo to allow the spaceship he, Cornelius, and Zira are in to travel back through time.

==Release==
The film opened May 26, 1970 at Loew&#x27;s Beverly Theatre in Los Angeles and opened two days later at Loew&#x27;s State II and Loew&#x27;s Orpheum theatres in New York and a day later at the Roosevelt Theatre in Chicago. The film was a surprise runaway success and a sequel was rushed into production. The film grossed $250,000 in its opening week from 4 theaters finishing 9th at the US box office. It reached number one in its sixth week of release with a gross of $863,500. It grossed $19 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office. According to Fox records the film required $8,100,000 in theatrical rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made worldwide rentals of $13,825,000 so made a profit to the studio.

==Reception==
A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;proof, in living color, that Heston is vulnerable and that a sequel to striking science fiction can be pretty juvenile.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film as &quot;hokey and slapdash,&quot; adding, &quot;The dialog, acting and direction are substandard.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four: Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a &quot;striking, imaginative picture,&quot; adding, &quot;Director Ted Post, writers Mort Abrahams and Paul Dehn are to be congratulated for sounding so timely a toll of doom in such an entertaining context.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film was: &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; declared: 

The film holds a 37% rating at the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with an average grade of 5.1 out of 10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; offers more action than its predecessor -- unfortunately, at the expense of the social subtext that elevates the franchise&#x27;s best entries.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received an average score of 46 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot;

<doc id="152061" wikidata="Q1430712" url="?curid=152061" title="Lloyd's of London">
<text>Lloyd&#x27;s of London, generally known simply as Lloyd&#x27;s, is an insurance and reinsurance market located in London, England. Unlike most of its competitors in the industry, it is not an insurance company; rather, Lloyd&#x27;s is a corporate body governed by the Lloyd&#x27;s Act 1871 and subsequent Acts of Parliament. It operates as a partially-mutualised marketplace within which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool and spread risk. These underwriters, or &quot;members&quot;, include both corporations and private individuals, the latter being traditionally known as &quot;Names&quot;.

The business underwritten at Lloyd&#x27;s is predominantly general insurance and reinsurance, with a small amount of term life insurance. The market has its roots in marine insurance and was founded by Edward Lloyd at his coffee-house on Tower Street 1689, making it one of the oldest insurance companies in the world. Today, it has a dedicated building on Lime Street, a Grade I historic landmark. Traditionally business is transacted at each syndicate&#x27;s &quot;box&quot; in the underwriting room, with the policy document being known as a &quot;slip&quot;, but in recent years it has become increasingly common for business to be conducted remotely and electronically.

The market&#x27;s motto is &quot;Fidentia&quot;, Latin for &quot;confidence&quot;, and it is closely associated with the Latin phrase &quot;uberrima fides&quot;, or &quot;utmost good faith&quot;, representing the ideal relationship between underwriters and brokers.

Having survived multiple scandals and significant challenges through the second half of the 20th century, most notably the asbestosis losses which engulfed the market, Lloyd&#x27;s today promotes its strong financial &quot;chain of security&quot; available to promptly pay all valid claims. As of 31 December 2022 this chain consists of £72.1 billion of syndicate-level assets, £34.1bn of members&#x27; &quot;funds at Lloyd&#x27;s&quot;, and £6.1bn in a third mutual link which includes the &quot;Central Fund&quot; and which is under the control of the Council of Lloyd&#x27;s.

In 2023 there were 78 syndicates managed by 51 &quot;managing agencies&quot; that collectively wrote £52.1bn of gross premiums on risks placed by 381 registered brokers. Around half of Lloyd&#x27;s premiums are paid from North America and around one quarter from Europe. Direct insurance represents roughly two-thirds of the premiums, mostly covering property and casualty liability, while the remaining one-third is reinsurance.

==History==

===17th–19th centuries: Formation and first Lloyd&#x27;s Act===
The market began in Lloyd&#x27;s Coffee House, owned by Edward Lloyd, on Tower Street in the City of London. The first reference to it can be traced to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; in 1688. The establishment was a popular place for sailors, merchants, and ship-owners, and Lloyd catered to them with reliable shipping news. The coffee house soon became recognised as an ideal place for obtaining marine insurance. The shop evolved into a meeting place for people of all types of maritime occupations, who would make bets on which ships would make it back to port. Soon, the captains of ships that were suggested to fail to return were betting against the return of other ships. It was the start of Lloyd&#x27;s insurance. During this time, the coffee house was also frequented by mariners involved in the slave trade. Historian Eric Williams noted that &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s, like other insurance companies, insured slaves and slave ships, and was vitally interested in legal decisions as to what constituted &#x27;natural death&#x27; and &#x27;perils of the sea&#x27;&quot;. Lloyd&#x27;s obtained a monopoly on maritime insurance related to the slave trade and maintained it until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807.

Just after Christmas 1691, the small club of marine insurance underwriters relocated to No. 16 Lombard Street; a blue plaque on the site commemorates this. This arrangement carried on until 1773, long after the death of Edward Lloyd in 1713, when the participating members of the insurance arrangement formed a committee and underwriter John Julius Angerstein acquired two rooms at the Royal Exchange in Cornhill for &quot;The Society of Lloyd&#x27;s&quot;. In July 1803, the Lloyd&#x27;s Patriotic Fund was established by a group of Lloyd&#x27;s underwriters.
The Royal Exchange was destroyed by fire in 1838, forcing Lloyd&#x27;s into temporary offices at South Sea House, Threadneedle Street. The Royal Exchange was rebuilt by 1844, but many of Lloyd&#x27;s early records were lost in the blaze. The (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. xxi), the first Lloyd&#x27;s Act, was passed in Parliament which gave the business a sound legal footing. Around that time, it was unusual for a Lloyd&#x27;s syndicate to have more than five or six backers; this lack of underwriting capacity meant Lloyd&#x27;s was losing many of the larger risks to rival insurance companies. A marine underwriter named Frederick Marten is credited for first identifying this issue and creating the first &quot;large syndicate&quot;, initially of 12 capacity providers. By the 1880s Marten&#x27;s syndicate had outgrown many of the major insurance companies outside Lloyd&#x27;s.

===Early 20th century: San Francisco earthquake and first Lloyd&#x27;s building===
On 18 April 1906, a major earthquake and resulting fires destroyed over 80 per cent of the city of San Francisco. This event was to have a profound influence on building practices, risk modelling and the insurance industry.

Lloyd&#x27;s losses from the earthquake and fires were substantial, even though the writing of insurance business overseas was viewed with some wariness at the time. While some insurance companies were denying claims for fire damage under their earthquake policies or &quot;vice versa&quot;, one of Lloyd&#x27;s leading underwriters, Cuthbert Heath, famously instructed his San Francisco agent to &quot;pay all of our policy-holders in full, irrespective of the terms of their policies&quot;. The prompt and full payment of all claims helped to cement Lloyd&#x27;s reputation for reliable claim payments and as an important trading partner for US brokers and policyholders. It was estimated that around 90 per cent of the damage to the city was caused by the resultant fires and as such, since 1906 &quot;fire following earthquake&quot; has generally been a specified insured peril under most policies. Heath is also credited for introducing the now widely used &quot;excess of loss&quot; reinsurance protection for insurers following the San Francisco quake.

Heath had become an underwriting member of Lloyd&#x27;s in 1880, upon reaching the minimum age of 21, on J. S. Burrows&#x27; syndicate. Within a year he was underwriting for himself on a three-man syndicate; in 1883 he also opened a brokerage business. In 1885, he wrote the first fire reinsurance contract, reinsuring the Hand in Hand Insurance Company and marking the start of Heath&#x27;s push to diversify the market into &quot;non-marine&quot; business. He also wrote Lloyd&#x27;s first burglary insurance policy, its first &quot;all risks&quot; jewellery policy and invented &quot;jewellers&#x27; block&quot; cover. Later, during World War I he offered air-raid insurance, protecting against the risk of German strategic bombing.
The subsequent (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. lxii) set out the society&#x27;s objectives, which include the promotion of its members&#x27; interests and the collection and dissemination of information.

A year later in April 1912 Lloyd&#x27;s suffered perhaps its most famous loss: the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. It was insured for £1 million, which represented 20 per cent of the entire market&#x27;s capacity, making it the largest marine risk ever insured. The record of its sinking in the 1912 &quot;Loss Book&quot; is on display in the Lloyd&#x27;s building.

The society moved into its first owned, dedicated building in 1928. It was located at 12 Leadenhall Street and had been designed by Sir Edwin Cooper.

===1960s: Hurricane Betsy and the Cromer report===
In 1965 Lloyd&#x27;s wrote the first satellite insurance policy, covering Intelsat I in pre-launch.

Later that year, when Lloyd&#x27;s had around 6,000 members on 300 syndicates, Hurricane Betsy struck the Gulf of Mexico coastlines, costing the market over £50 million. The catastrophe halted the capital that hitherto had been pouring into Lloyd&#x27;s, and twice as many members left between 1965 and 1968 as had left over the prior eight years. It was soon realised that the membership of the Society, which had been largely made up of market participants, was too small in relation to the market&#x27;s capitalisation and the risks that it was taking on.

Lloyd&#x27;s response was to commission a secret internal inquiry in 1968, headed by Lord Cromer, a former Governor of the Bank of England. This report advocated the widening of membership to non-market participants, including non-British subjects and then women, and the reduction of the onerous capitalisation requirements (thus creating a minor investor known as a &quot;mini-Name&quot;). The report also drew attention to the danger of conflicts of interest. The liability of the individual Names was unlimited, and thus all their personal wealth and assets were at risk.

===1970s: Changes in the financial markets===

During the 1970s, a number of issues arose which were to have significant influence on the course of the Society. The first was the tax structure in the UK: for a time, capital gains were taxed at up to 40 per cent (nil on gilts); earned income was taxed in the top bracket at 83 per cent, and investment income in the top bracket at 98 per cent. Lloyd&#x27;s income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd&#x27;s, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by &quot;bond washing&quot; or &quot;gilt stripping&quot;: selling the gilt or other bond cum dividend and buying it back ex-dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and self-dealing).

Because Lloyd&#x27;s was a tax shelter as well as an insurance market, the second issue affecting it was an increase in its external membership: by the end of the 1970s, the number of passive investors dwarfed the number of underwriters working in the market. The third issue related to a series of losses as a result of scandal. During the decade a number of scandals had come to light, including the collapse of F. H. &quot;Tim&quot; Sasse&#x27;s non-marine syndicate 762, which had issued large fire insurance claims that had highlighted both the lack of regulation and the lack of legal powers of the Committee of Lloyd&#x27;s (as it was then) to manage the Society.

===Late 1970s: Sasse scandal and other issues===
The collapse of the Sasse syndicate came after it wrote a &quot;binding authority&quot; in 1975 that delegated underwriting authority to Florida-based expatriate Dennis Harrison to write property and fire risks through his Den-Har Underwriters agency, even though Den-Har was not an approved Lloyd&#x27;s coverholder (a fact noticed neither by Sasse nor Lloyd&#x27;s Non-Marine Association). Den-Har had suspected Mafia links and many of the risks written were rigged: typically dilapidated buildings in slums such as New York&#x27;s south Bronx, which soon burned down after being insured for large sums.

Once the three-year Lloyd&#x27;s accounting period passed, the 110 Names on syndicate 762 were told they faced substantial losses, from mostly fraudulent claims. Sasse&#x27;s reinsurer, the Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil (IRB), refused to pay its share of the fraudulent losses. The Names (few in number for such large losses) took legal action and ultimately paid only £6.25m of £15m of Den-Har claims under the 1976 year, leaving the Corporation of Lloyd&#x27;s to pay the remainder. The Corporation also paid the near £7m loss for 1977. Lloyd&#x27;s banned Sasse from the market for life in 1985; he died on 28 February 1987.

Sasse had also been one of 57 underwriters on other syndicates that wrote loss-making &quot;computer leasing&quot; policies in the late 1970s. These claims ultimately ran above $450m, wiping out more than half the entire market&#x27;s profit in a single year.

Problems also developed out of the Oakley Vaughan agency run by brothers Edward and Charles St George, which had written far more business than its capacity allowed in order to invest premium to take advantage of high interest rates. By writing swathes of business regardless of whether the premiums were adequate, the St Georges left their Names with serious losses. Lloyd&#x27;s had commissioned investigations into Oakley Vaughan, but investigators were denied access to the books and relied only on reassurances that the agency was profitable.

Arising simultaneously with these developments were wider issues: first, in the US, an ever-widening interpretation by the courts of insurance coverage in relation to workers&#x27; compensation for asbestosis-related claims, which created a huge hole in Lloyd&#x27;s loss-payment reserves, which was initially not recognised and then not acknowledged. Second, by the end of the decade, almost all of the market agreements, such as the Joint Hull Agreement, which were effectively cartels mandating minimum terms, had been abandoned under pressure of competition. Third, new specialised policies had arisen which had the effect of concentrating risk: these included &quot;run-off&quot; policies, under which the liability of previous underwriting years would be transferred to the current year, and &quot;time and distance&quot; policies, whereby reserves would be used to buy a guarantee of future income.

===Early 1980s: New Lloyd&#x27;s Act, Lioncover and Centrewrite===

;Fisher report
In 1980, Sir Henry Fisher was commissioned by the Council of Lloyd&#x27;s to produce the foundation for a new Lloyd&#x27;s Act. The recommendations of his report addressed the &quot;democratic deficit&quot; and the lack of regulatory muscle.

Fisher, working with Richard Southwell QC, drafted the (c. xiv) which further redefined the structure of the business and was designed to give external Names, introduced in response to the Cromer report, a say in the running of the business through a new governing Council. The main purpose of the 1982 Act was to separate the ownership of the managing agents of the underwriting syndicates from the ownership of the brokering houses (which acted as intermediaries, not as underwriters), with the objective of removing conflicts of interest.

;PCW scam and Lioncover
Immediately after the passing of the 1982 act, evidence came to light and internal disciplinary proceedings were commenced against a number of underwriters who had allegedly siphoned money from their syndicates to their own accounts. These individuals included a deputy chairman of Lloyd&#x27;s and some of its leading underwriters. Successful marine underwriter Ian Posgate, who at one point had written 20 per cent of the Lloyd&#x27;s marine market, was expelled under suspicions but later acquitted of criminal charges. His name remained tarnished and he did not return to the market, retiring to run his Oxfordshire farm until his death in 2017 aged 87. A greater debacle arose when Peter Cameron-Webb and Peter Dixon, of PCW Underwriting Agencies, allegedly defrauded their business of some $60m through rigged reinsurance transactions and fled to the United States, never to return.

The emergence of fraud at PCW was the first in a series of events that led to the resignation of Lloyd&#x27;s chairman Sir Peter Green in 1983. Lloyd&#x27;s was later forced to make a settlement with the roughly 3,000 Names on the various PCW syndicates involved and to reinsure their liabilities into a new syndicate, number 9001, in turn reinsured by a unique vehicle named Lioncover, which was set up as a Lloyd&#x27;s subsidiary insurance company. Lioncover assumed the liabilities of PCW as well as the associated WMD and Richard Beckett underwriting agencies in 1987. In 1988 it also assumed the 1967–1969 liabilities of syndicates 2 and 49. Dixon and Cameron-Webb remained at large in the US; Cameron-Webb reportedly died in 2004 in a nursing home in California and Dixon became a real estate agent in Florida; he died in 2017.

Lioncover&#x27;s PCW liabilities were reinsured as part of the Equitas arrangement in the late 1990s and transferred to National Indemnity Company in two stages in 2007 and 2009. Residual funds in Lioncover were later distributed to surviving PCW Names or donated to the Lloyd&#x27;s Charities Trust. Lioncover was voluntarily dissolved in 2014.

;Warrilow syndicate and Centrewrite
Lloyd&#x27;s also faced action from Names on C. J. Warrilow&#x27;s syndicate 553, which had chronically exceeded its underwriting capacity in the early 1980s and failed to adequately reinsure the huge quantity of risks it was taking on. The solution was to create a new company in 1990 into which these liabilities could be reinsured in order to relieve the Warrilow Names. This entity was named Centrewrite Ltd and in 1993 it assumed Warrilow&#x27;s 1985 and prior years&#x27; liabilities, separately also offering &quot;estate protection plans&quot; (EPPs) for resigned Names. Tens of thousands of Lloyd&#x27;s Names bought these reinsurance policies.

Centrewrite still exists today but has not written any EPPs since 2011 and conducts little other business; its most recent transaction was in 2013 when it assumed the 2001 liabilities of the life syndicate 1171. It also reinsured the 1997–1999 years of Crowe syndicate 1204 and the 1999–2001 years of Cotesworth syndicate 535. In 2012 the Crowe and Cotesworth liabilities (then valued at just over £17m) were novated to Riverstone (a Fairfax company) meaning minimal liabilities remain in Centrewrite today.

In 1986, the year Lloyd&#x27;s moved into a new building at 1 Lime Street (where it remains today), the British government commissioned Sir Patrick Neill to report on the standard of investor protection available at Lloyd&#x27;s. His report was produced in 1987 and made a large number of recommendations, but was never implemented in full.

===Late 1980s: Piper Alpha and the LMX spiral===
It has long been normal for one Lloyd&#x27;s syndicate to reinsure another, but when Piper Alpha, a North Sea oil rig, exploded on 6 July 1988 causing an initial $1.4bn loss, the practice had become so widespread that the underwriters in Lime Street initially had no idea how extensive their exposure was: the loss was passed around in what became known as the London market excess of loss (LMX) &quot;spiral&quot; and claim values escalated out of control.

The rig&#x27;s operator, Occidental Petroleum, bought a direct insurance policy from Lloyd&#x27;s underwriters, who then passed part of their shares of the risk on to other syndicates via reinsurance. Those reinsurers then in turn reinsured part of the risk out to other reinsurance underwriters within Lloyd&#x27;s (known as &quot;retrocessionaires&quot;), and so on. Consequently, many syndicates, especially those writing a large amount of excess of loss reinsurance, became exposed to the same claim multiple times through multiple layers in the spiral. Other catastrophes, including Hurricane Hugo and the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in 1989, also went into the spiral.

Some of the leading LMX reinsurers at the time that suffered serious spiral losses included the numerous syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency, Devonshire syndicate 216, Rose Thomson Young 255, R. J. Bromley 475, and Patrick Fagan&#x27;s already challenged Feltrim syndicates 540 and 542. Gooda Walker syndicate 298 became the first fatal casualty, with 13,500 policies being exposed to the Piper Alpha disaster alone and its 1989 account producing a 650 per cent loss on capacity; Feltrim followed with a 550 per cent loss on capacity. Roy Bromley, underwriter of syndicate 475, later committed suicide after being dismissed by his Board and reportedly becoming distressed at his operation&#x27;s mounting losses.

Not all excess of loss writers succumbed to the LMX spiral; in fact the spiral was relatively confined to a minority of such syndicates. Among the prominent reinsurers that remained profitable throughout the spiral were C. F. Palmer syndicate 314, M. H. Cockell 269/570 and D. P. Mann 435, while G. S. Christensen 958 reported only a slight loss in 1989 but healthy profits in 1990 and 1991.

===1990s: Fallout of the asbestosis affair===
====Emergence of claims====
The early to mid-1990s saw the continuation of Lloyd&#x27;s most traumatic period in its history that had begun with the explosion on Piper Alpha. Unexpectedly large legal awards in US courts for punitive damages led to substantial claims on asbestos, pollution and health hazard (APH) policies, some dating as far back as the 1940s. Many of these policies were open-peril policies, meaning that they covered any claim not specifically excluded. Other policies (called standard, or broad) only cover stated perils, such as fire.

The classic example of &quot;long-tail&quot; insurance risks is asbestosis/mesothelioma claims under employers&#x27; liability or workers&#x27; compensation policies. An employee at an industrial plant may have been exposed to asbestos in the 1960s, fallen ill 20 years later and claimed compensation from his former employer in the 1990s. The employer would report a claim to the insurance company that wrote the policy in the 1960s. However, because the insurer did not fully understand the nature of the future risk back in the 1960s, it and its reinsurers would not have properly priced or reserved for it. In the case of Lloyd&#x27;s, this resulted in the bankruptcy of thousands of individual investors who indemnified general liability policies written from the 1940s to the mid-1970s for companies with exposure to asbestosis claims. A group of Names mounted a legal case as the Names Against Lloyd&#x27;s of London, where they attempted to prove fraud among those brokers who had involved them in the underwriting syndicates.

====Reinsurance to close====
It may not be immediately clear how current members of current Lloyd&#x27;s syndicates, which accept business one year at a time, could be liable to pay historical claims. This came about as a result of the Lloyd&#x27;s accounting practice known as reinsurance to close (RITC).

A member &quot;joined&quot; a syndicate for one calendar year only, known as the &quot;annual venture&quot;. At the end of the year, the syndicate as an ongoing trading entity was effectively disbanded. However, usually the syndicate re-formed for the next calendar year with the same identifying number and more or less the same membership. Since claims can take time to be reported and then paid, the profit or loss for each syndicate took time to realise. The practice at Lloyd&#x27;s was to wait three years (that is, 36 months from the beginning of the year in which the business was written) before &quot;closing&quot; the year for accounting purposes and declaring a result.

To calculate the profit or loss, reserves were set aside for future claims payments, for claims that had already been notified but not yet paid, as well as estimated amounts for claims that had been incurred but not reported (IBNR). This estimation is difficult and can be inaccurate; in particular, long-tail liability policies tend to produce claims long after the policies are written.

The reserve for future claims liabilities was set aside in an unusual way. The syndicate bought a RITC policy to pay any future claims; the premium was equal to the amount of the reserve. This transaction allowed the year to be closed, and the syndicate&#x27;s profit or loss declared. The reinsurer was always another Lloyd&#x27;s syndicate(s), often the succeeding year of the same syndicate: the members of syndicate &#x27;1&#x27; in 1985 reinsured the future claim liabilities for members of syndicate &#x27;1&#x27; in 1984. The membership might be the same, or it might have changed.

In this manner, liability for past losses could be transferred year after year until it reached the current syndicate. A member joining a syndicate with a long history of such transactions could – and often did – pick up liability for losses on policies written decades previously. As long as the reserves had been accurately estimated, and the appropriate RITC premium paid every year, then all would have been well, but in many cases this had not been possible: no-one could have predicted the surge in APH losses. Therefore, the amounts of money transferred from earlier years by successive RITC premiums to cover these losses were grossly insufficient, and the current members had to pay the shortfall.

As a result, a great many Names whose syndicates wrote long-tail liability at Lloyd&#x27;s faced significant financial loss or ruin by the late 1980s to mid-1990s.

====Dilution of liabilities and the consequences====
It was alleged that in the early 1980s some Lloyd&#x27;s officials began a recruitment programme to enroll new Names to help capitalise Lloyd&#x27;s prior to the expected onslaught of APH claims. This allegation became known as &quot;recruit to dilute&quot;: in other words, recruit more Names to dilute the losses. When the huge extent of asbestosis losses came to light in the early 1990s, for the first time in Lloyd&#x27;s history large numbers of members either were unable to pay the claims or refused, many alleging that they were the victims of fraud, misrepresentation, and/or negligence. The opaque system of accounting at Lloyd&#x27;s made it difficult, if not impossible, for many Names to understand the extent of the liability that they personally and their syndicates had subscribed to.

Also, numerous underwriters of long-tail non-marine business, concerned at their exposures to the impending asbestosis crisis, had sought to reinsure their liabilities with other carriers. Approximately 20 syndicates, including Lloyd&#x27;s deputy chairman Murray Lawrence&#x27;s, paid millions of pounds in premiums to Richard H. M. Outhwaite, then considered a highly capable marine underwriter, to assume approximately 80 per cent of the market&#x27;s asbestos exposure on his well-supported syndicates 317/661 in 1982. In 1985, under Lloyd&#x27;s three-year accounting rule, auditors kept Outhwaite&#x27;s 1982 year open, citing concerns over asbestos and pollution liability losses. These eventually ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars. After many years of litigation, Outhwaite retired to Guernsey and died on 20 November 2021.

Another asbestosis-hit operation, Pulbrook syndicates 90/334, had taken out reinsurance in 1981 on its general liability business with Merrett syndicate 418; however, in 1990 Stephen Merrett (who by now controlled Pulbrook) won an arbitration ruling to void that arrangement due to non-disclosure of the extent of asbestos exposure, leaving the Pulbrook Names without cover for their losses of £100,000 each on average. Even earlier, in 1974, the underwriter of R. W. Sturge syndicate 210, Ralph Rokeby-Johnson, who specialised in American industrial risks, bought &quot;stop-loss&quot; reinsurance from Fireman&#x27;s Fund and Kemper Insurance in the US on Sturge&#x27;s pre-1969 exposures that were accumulating into the present. This contract developed so poorly that Fireman&#x27;s Fund later sought its own stop-loss cover for the losses assumed from Sturge. Rokeby-Johnson later prompted Lloyd&#x27;s to create a working party on asbestosis.

====Reconstruction and Renewal====
During the mid-1990s the market was forced to restructure. Under the chairmanship of Sir David Rowland and chief executive Peter Middleton, an ambitious plan entitled &quot;Reconstruction and Renewal&quot; (R&amp;R) was produced in 1995, with proposals for separating the ongoing Lloyd&#x27;s from its past losses. Liabilities for all pre-1993 business (other than life assurance) were to be compulsorily transferred (by RITC) into a special vehicle named Equitas (which would require the approval of the UK&#x27;s Department of Trade and Industry) at a cost of around $21bn. 

Many Names faced large bills, but the plan also provided for a settlement of their disputes, a tax on recent profits, and the write-off of nearly $5bn owed in the form of &quot;debt credits&quot;, skewed towards those with the worst losses. The plan was debated at length, modified, and eventually strongly supported by the Association of Lloyd&#x27;s Members (ALM) and most leaders of Names&#x27; action groups. New CEO Ron Sandler was instrumental in its implementation. Money was raised in many ways, including the sale and leaseback of the Lloyd&#x27;s building, and a tax on future business. Individual offers of settlement were accepted by 95 per cent of Names. The past liabilities on the 1992 and prior years were transferred to Equitas in September 1996, including those under Lioncover and Centrewrite.

The &quot;recruit to dilute&quot; fraud allegations were heard in an eight-month trial in 2000 in the case &quot;Sir William Jaffray &amp; Ors v. The Society of Lloyd&#x27;s&quot; and were rejected by the judge; an appeal was heard in 2002 and unanimously rejected. On each occasion the allegation that there had been a policy to recruit to dilute was dismissed and Names were urged to settle; however, at first instance the judge described the Names as &quot;the innocent victims [...] of staggering incompetence&quot; and the appeal court found that representations that Lloyd&#x27;s had a rigorous auditing system were false and strongly hinted that one of Lloyd&#x27;s main witnesses, former chairman Murray Lawrence, had lied in his testimony.

Lloyd&#x27;s then instituted some major structural changes: corporate members with limited liability were permitted to join and underwrite insurance; no new unlimited-liability Names were allowed to join (although a few hundred existing ones remained); financial requirements for underwriting were changed, to prevent excess underwriting that was not backed by liquid assets; and market oversight significantly increased. Lloyd&#x27;s rebounded and started to thrive again after the catastrophic losses arising out of the World Trade Center attack, but it faced increased competition from newly-created companies in Bermuda and other markets.

In 2006 the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary National Indemnity Company (NICO) agreed to assume all of Equitas&#x27; assets and liabilities, providing $7bn of new reinsurance cover for future claims payments in addition to the $8.7bn of existing reserves within Equitas. The transfer (in two phases between 2007 and 2009) represented &quot;finality&quot; under English law for all affected Names, who now faced &quot;no further liability whatsoever&quot; to the pre-1993 losses.

In 2020, following the George Floyd protests, Lloyd&#x27;s issued a statement, apologising &quot;for the role played by the Lloyd&#x27;s market in the 18th and 19th century slave trade – an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own&quot;.

==Structure==
Lloyd&#x27;s is a market of members, not an insurance company. As the oldest continuously active insurance marketplace in the world, Lloyd&#x27;s has retained some unusual structures and practices that differ from other insurance providers today. Originally created as a non-incorporated association of subscribing members, it was incorporated by the Lloyd&#x27;s Act 1871 and is currently governed under the Lloyd&#x27;s Acts of 1871 through to 1982.

Lloyd&#x27;s does not underwrite insurance business itself - its members do. The Society effectively acts as a market regulator, setting rules under which members operate and offering centralised administrative services to them. 

===Council of Lloyd&#x27;s===

The Lloyd&#x27;s Act 1982 defines the management structure and rules under which the market operates. Under the Act, the Council of Lloyd&#x27;s is responsible for the management and supervision of the market. It is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.

The Council normally has six working, six external and six nominated members. The appointment of nominated members, including that of the chief executive officer, is confirmed by the Governor of the Bank of England. The working and external members are elected by Lloyd&#x27;s members. The chairman and deputy chairmen are elected annually by the Council from among the working members of the Council. All members are approved by the regulating bodies.

The Council can discharge some of its functions directly by making decisions and issuing resolutions, requirements, rules and bylaws. The Council delegates most of its daily oversight roles, particularly relating to ensuring the market operates successfully, to the Franchise Board.

The Franchise Board lays down guidelines for all syndicates and operates a business planning and monitoring process to safeguard high standards of underwriting and risk management, thereby improving sustainable profitability and enhancing the financial strength of the market. The Board is chaired by the chairman of Lloyd&#x27;s and has three executive members, three non-executives connected to the market and five independent non-executives.

====Chairmen of Lloyd&#x27;s====
The following is a list of the chairmen of Lloyd&#x27;s since 1979:
====Chief executives of Lloyd&#x27;s====
The following is a list of the chief executive officers of Lloyd&#x27;s since the role was created in 1983:
===Businesses at Lloyd&#x27;s===

There are two classes of people and firms active at Lloyd&#x27;s. The first are members, or providers of capital. The second are agents, brokers, and other professionals who support the members, underwrite the risks and represent outside customers (for example, individuals and companies seeking insurance, or insurance companies seeking reinsurance).

====Members====
For most of Lloyd&#x27;s history, rich individuals known as Names backed policies written at Lloyd&#x27;s with all of their personal wealth and took on unlimited liability. Since 1994, Lloyd&#x27;s has allowed corporate members into the market, with limited liability. The asbestosis losses in the early 1990s devastated the finances of many Names: upwards of 1,500 out of 34,000 Names (4.4 per cent) were declared bankrupt. This scared away other potential Names. In 2011 individual Names provide only 11 per cent of capacity at Lloyd&#x27;s, with UK-listed and other corporate members providing 30 per cent and the remainder via the international insurance industry. 

No new Names with unlimited liability are admitted, and the importance of individual Names will continue to decline as they slowly withdraw, convert (generally into limited liability partnerships), or die. In 2014, Names with unlimited liability provided just 2 per cent of the overall capacity in Lloyd&#x27;s.

====Managing agents====
Managing agents sponsor and manage syndicates. They canvas members for commitments of capacity, create the syndicate, hire underwriters, and oversee all of the syndicate&#x27;s activities. Managing agents may run more than one syndicate, as borne out in the fact that in 2023 the 78 syndicates writing business at Lloyd&#x27;s were operated by just 51 managing agents.

====Members&#x27; agents====
Members&#x27; agents co-ordinate the members&#x27; underwriting and act as a buffer between Lloyd&#x27;s, the managing agents and the members. They were introduced in the mid-1970s and grew in number until many went bust; many of the businesses merged, and there are now only four left (Argenta, Hampden, Alpha and LMAS, which has no active Names). It is mandatory that unlimited Names write through a members&#x27; agent, and many limited liability members also choose to do so.

====Lloyd&#x27;s coverholder====
Coverholders are a major source of business for Lloyd&#x27;s. Their numbers have grown steadily in recent years and in 2021 there were 4,054, producing an increasingly meaningful share of the market&#x27;s overall premium income. The balance of Lloyd&#x27;s business is distributed around the world through a network of brokers.

Coverholders allow Lloyd&#x27;s syndicates to operate in a region or country as if they were a local insurer. This is achieved by Lloyd&#x27;s syndicates delegating their underwriting authority to coverholders. A coverholder can have restricted or full authority to underwrite specified business on behalf of a Lloyd&#x27;s syndicate. It will usually issue the insurance documentation and will often also handle claims. The document setting out the terms of the coverholder&#x27;s delegated authority is known as a binding authority.

====Lloyd&#x27;s brokers====
Outsiders, whether individuals or other insurance companies, cannot transact business directly with Lloyd&#x27;s syndicates. They must hire an approved Lloyd&#x27;s broker, who are the only customer-facing organisations at Lloyd&#x27;s. They are therefore often referred to as intermediaries. Lloyd&#x27;s brokers shop customers&#x27; risks around the syndicates, trying to obtain the best coverage and most competitive terms.

====Integrated Lloyd&#x27;s vehicles====
When corporations became admitted as Lloyd&#x27;s members, they often disliked the traditional structure. Insurance companies did not want to rely on the underwriting skills of syndicates they did not control, so they started their own. An integrated Lloyd&#x27;s vehicle (ILV) is a group of companies that combines a corporate member, a managing agent, and a syndicate under common ownership. Some ILVs allow minority contributions from other members, but most now try to operate on an exclusive basis.

===Financial security===
Lloyd&#x27;s capital structure, often referred to as the &quot;chain of security&quot;, provides financial security to policyholders and capital efficiency to members. The Corporation is responsible for setting both member and central capital levels to achieve a level of capitalisation that is robust and allows members the potential to earn superior returns.

There are three &quot;links&quot; in the chain: the funds in the first and second links are held in trust, primarily for the benefit of insureds whose policies are underwritten by the relevant member. Members underwrite for their own account and are not liable for other members&#x27; losses (i.e. liabilities are several, not joint).

The third link consists largely of the Lloyd&#x27;s Central Fund, which contains mutual assets held by the Corporation which are available, subject to Council approval as required, to meet any member&#x27;s liabilities. As well as the Central Fund, the third link contains Corporation assets, subordinated debt, and a &quot;callable layer&quot; which can be invoked should the final link require topping up.

==Financial performance==
Each Lloyd&#x27;s syndicate is responsible for determining how much money to hold in reserve for its known liabilities and its estimated unknown liabilities, and each may choose to release some of its reserves for prior-year claims if it (and its independent auditors) deems it appropriate. Conversely, reserves may need to be strengthened if prior-year loss estimates deteriorate. Overall reserve releases can improve the syndicate&#x27;s &quot;accident year&quot; combined ratio (the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio), whereas overall reserve increases can worsen the accident year combined ratio. The combined ratio after these reserve movements is known as the &quot;calendar year&quot; result.

===Historical results===
Lloyd&#x27;s worst results in its long history were in the 1989 through 1991 years, each producing overall losses of over £2bn; the late 1990s were also punctuated by repeated and significant underwriting losses. In 2001 the calendar year result was a 140 per cent combined ratio, driven largely by claims arising out of the World Trade Center attack, reserve increases for prior-year liabilities and deteriorating pricing levels. However, the market subsequently enjoyed profitability in most years except those marked by unusual levels of large natural catastrophes. For example, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season (which included Hurricane Katrina) drove the Lloyd&#x27;s overall combined ratio to 112 per cent, while the 2017 Atlantic hurricanes coupled with destructive wildfires in California caused the Lloyd&#x27;s market to report a 114 per cent combined ratio result in that year.

===Recent results===
In its most recent annual report, for 2023, Lloyd&#x27;s reported an underwriting profit of £5.91bn, plus a £4.75bn gain on investments to produce an overall pre-tax profit of £10.66bn, compared to a pre-tax loss of £769m in 2022. The 2023 calendar-year combined ratio was 84 per cent, which was Lloyd&#x27;s best result since 2007. Gross premiums written totalled £52.1bn, which was an increase from £46.7bn in 2022, without taking exchange-rate fluctuations into account. Major losses in 2023 were considerably fewer than the previous year, which was marred by Hurricane Ian.

==Types of policies==

Lloyd&#x27;s syndicates write a diverse range of policies, both direct insurance and reinsurance, covering property, casualty, marine, energy, motor, aviation and many other types of risk. Lloyd&#x27;s also has a unique niche in unusual, specialist business such as kidnap and ransom, fine art, specie, aviation, war, satellites, personal accident, bloodstock, and other insurances.

Lloyd&#x27;s is famous for writing policies to cover famous, unusual, or bizarre events. For example, Lloyd&#x27;s has insured:

;Groups
* A comedy theatre group against the risk of a member of their audience dying of laughter

;Inanimate objects
* Participating automobiles in the carpools involved in the Montgomery bus boycott 
* A grain of rice with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh engraved on it for $20,000
* The development of the new World Trade Center with workers&#x27; compensation, general liability, excess liability and speciality insurance programmes

==Miscellaneous==
The present Lloyd&#x27;s building, at 1 Lime Street, was designed by architect Richard Rogers and was completed in 1986. It stands on the site of the old Roman Forum. The 1925 building&#x27;s facade survives, appearing strangely stranded with the modern building visible through the gates on the northern side on Leadenhall Street. In 2011 it became a listed building.

In the main Underwriting Room of Lloyd&#x27;s stands the &quot;Lutine&quot; bell, salvaged in 1858, which was rung when the fate of a ship &quot;overdue&quot; at its destination port became known. If the ship was safe, the bell would be rung twice; if it had sunk, the bell would be rung once. (This had the practical purpose of immediately stopping the sale or purchase of &quot;overdue&quot; reinsurance on that vessel.) Nowadays it is only rung for ceremonial purposes, such as the visit of a distinguished guest, or for the annual Remembrance Day service and anniversaries of major world events.

Brokers and underwriters are still normally held to, and apparently prefer, a more formal style of attire than many nearby City of London banks and financial institutions.

<text>Robert Barclay (23 December 16483 October 1690) was a Scottish Quaker, one of the most eminent writers belonging to the Religious Society of Friends and a member of the Clan Barclay. He was a son of Col. David Barclay, Laird of Urie, and his wife, Lady Katherine Barclay. Although he himself never lived there, Barclay was titular governor of the East Jersey colony in North America through most of the 1680s.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Barclay was born at Gordonstoun in Moray, Scotland. His father David Barclay, first laird of Ury, had served under Gustavus Adolphus, and pursued a somewhat tortuous course through the troubles of the Civil Wars. His mother was Katherine Gordon (1620–1663), daughter of Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet of Gordonstoun.

Robert was sent to finish his education at the Scots College, Paris, of which his uncle was Rector, and made such progress in study as to gain the admiration of his teachers, specially of his uncle, who offered to make him his heir if he would remain in France, and join the Roman Catholic Church.

===Joining the Society of Friends===
In 1667, however, he followed the example of his father, and joined the recently formed Religious Society of Friends after returning to Scotland. Soon afterwards he began to write in defence of the movement, by publishing in 1670 &quot;Truth cleared of Calumnies&quot;, and a &quot;Catechism and Confession of Faith&quot; (1673). In 1670 he had married another Quaker, Christian Mollison (c.1651–1722), daughter of Gilbert Mollison of Aberdeen. They had seven children: three sons (Robert, David and John) and four daughters (Patience, Catherine, Christian and Jean).

The essential view which Barclay maintained was that all people can be illuminated by the Inward Light of Christ &quot;which is the author of the Scriptures and will lead them into all truth&quot;. His works have often been reprinted. He was an ardent theological student, a man of warm feelings and considerable mental powers, and he soon came prominently forward as the leading apologist of the new doctrine, winning his spurs in a controversy with one William Mitchell. The publication of fifteen &quot;Theses Theologiae&quot; (1676) led to a public discussion in Aberdeen, each side claiming a victory. The most prominent of the &quot;Theses&quot; was that bearing on immediate revelation, in which the superiority of the Inward Light of Christ to reason or scripture is sharply stated. He was noted as a strong supporter of George Fox in the controversies that beset Quakers in the 1670s. His greatest work, &quot;An Apology for the True Christian Divinity&quot;, was published in Latin at Amsterdam in 1676, and was an elaborate statement of the grounds for holding certain fundamental positions laid down in the &quot;Theses&quot;. It was translated by its author into English in 1678, and is claimed to be &quot;one of the most impressive theological writings of the century&quot;.

The &quot;Apology&quot;, however, failed to arrest the persecution to which the Quakers were exposed, and Barclay himself, on returning from Europe, where he travelled extensively (once with William Penn and George Fox), and had several interviews with Elisabeth, Princess Palatine, was several times thrown into prison, but soon regained his liberty, and was in the enjoyment of Court favour.

===Political influence===
In later years he had much influence with James II, who as Duke of York had given New Jersey to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. After Carteret&#x27;s death his half (East Jersey) was sold in 1682 to twelve people, eleven of whom were members of the Society of Friends. One of the eleven Quaker proprietors was William Penn, and after expanding to include a larger number of proprietors, the group elected Barclay to be the governor. He is said to have visited James with a view to making terms of accommodation with William of Orange, whose arrival was then imminent.

==Governor of East New Jersey==
Barclay was an absentee governor, never having set foot in the colony. He governed through a series of deputy governors, who oversaw day-to-day operations of Barclay&#x27;s government.

Englishman Thomas Rudyard, a London lawyer, was the first to serve as deputy under Robert Barclay, having been appointed on 16 September 1682. Rudyard was the de facto governor. It was during Rudyard&#x27;s tenure that the four counties of Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth were established.

Rudyard and Surveyor General Samuel Groom soon had a policy disagreement on the granting of land. Groom believed in adhering to the Concession and Agreement of John Lord Berkekey and Sir George Carteret, which stated that one seventh part of all land allotments was to be reserved to the Lords Proprietors. Rudyard disagreed with this policy and he and the Council appointed Philip Wells as Deputy Surveyor, thereby circumventing Groom&#x27;s authority. The Proprietors in England disapproved of Rudyard and Wells&#x27; actions, voiding all grants not surveyed by Groom. Rudyard and the Council replied that they would continue granting land as they had been doing, as the majority of Proprietors were not living in East Jersey. The Proprietors then, on 27 July 1683, appointed Gawen Lawrie Deputy Governor, replacing Rudyard. Rudyard remained in office as Secretary and Register until 1685.

Thomas Rudyard&#x27;s land dealings resurfaced when, on 28 February 1684/5, he received a grant of on Raritan Bay in Monmouth County. This resulted in Governor Barclay and the Proprietors issuing instructions to Deputy Governor Lawrie on the laying out of land. Section 7 directly addressed the questionable activity of Rudyard and Lawrie himself in their taking up of land. On 5 November 1685 Rudyard sold the land in question to his son in law, Samuel Winder, who on 17 June 1686 sold to Andrew Bowne.

During Gawen Lawrie&#x27;s tenure the Proprietors in England drafted a new constitution for East New Jersey, the Fundamental Constitutions for the Province of East New Jersey. This document, drafted in 1683, was intended to supersede the Concession and Agreement of 1665. Lawrie introduced the new constitution in Council on 12 April 1686; the Council voted &quot;that the same Did not agree with the (constitution) of these American parts--&quot;, but nonetheless sent it to the General Assembly for reading. On 16 April, in response to Lawrie&#x27;s inquiry as to the Assembly&#x27;s action on the constitution, the lower house reported &quot;That they apprehended the same Did not agree with the (constitution) of this province and that they understood that the same were noe wise bindeing Except past into a Lawe by the Generall Assembly--&quot;. With both houses concurring, the Fundamental Constitutions was defeated, and the Concession and Agreement would remain the East Jersey constitution until the surrender to The Crown in 1702.

The Proprietors in England were concerned about the Lawrie&#x27;s secretive dealings and they instructed the East New Jersey Board of Proprietors to investigate the state of affairs, including an audit of the finances. In March 1686 the Proprietors appointed Andrew Hamilton to oversee the investigation.

In September 1686 the decision was made to remove Lawrie from office, and on 5 October Lord Neill Campbell presented his commission from Gov. Barclay as deputy governor to the East New Jersey Provincial Council, who confirmed and recognized the appointment. Lawrie was then commissioned a member of the council.

Campbell, a Scotsman like Barclay, only served briefly; having urgent business in Britain, he nominated Councillor Andrew Hamilton as his replacement as Deputy Governor on 10 December 1686; the next day Lawrie was the only councillor to register a protest and vote against confirming Hamilton. Neill Campbell returned to Scotland and is not known to have returned to the New World. Lord Neill Campbell died in April 1692.

Andrew Hamilton was Barclay&#x27;s final deputy governor. Originally a merchant in Edinburgh, he was sent to East Jersey to act as an agent to recruit men to settle there.

After Sir Edmund Andros took control over the Jerseys as part of the Dominion of New England, Hamilton sailed back to England to consult with the Proprietors. On the voyage, he was captured by the French, delaying his journey to London until May 1690.

==Later life==
Robert Barclay&#x27;s later years were spent at his estate of Ury, where he died.

==Descendants==
Robert Barclay had a son, known as David Barclay of Cheapside (1682–1769), who became a wealthy merchant in the City of London. David married Priscilla Freame, daughter of the banker John Freame, and they had a son known as David Barclay of Youngsbury (1729–1809). His legacy was as one of the founders of the present-day Barclays Bank, a century ahead of its formation under that name, and in the brewing industry; he also manumitted an estate of slaves in Jamaica.

A more distant descendant is Priscilla Wakefield, née Priscilla Bell (1751–1832). She was an English Quaker, educational and feminist economics writer, and philanthropist. Her mother was Barclay&#x27;s granddaughter.

<text>Édouard Louis Joseph, Baron Merckx (born 17 June 1945), known as Eddy Merckx (, ), is a Belgian former professional road and track cyclist racer who is the most successful rider in the history of competitive cycling. His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours de France, five Giros d&#x27;Italia, and a Vuelta a España), all five Monuments, setting the hour record, three World Championships, every major one-day race other than Paris–Tours, and extensive victories on the track.

Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling. Merckx got his first bicycle at the age of three or four and competed in his first race in 1961. His first victory came at Petit-Enghien in October 1961.

After winning eighty races as an amateur racer, he turned professional on 29 April 1965 when he signed with . His first major victory came in the Milan–San Remo a year later, after switching to . After the 1967 season, Merckx moved to , and won the Giro d&#x27;Italia, his first Grand Tour victory. Four times between 1970 and 1974 Merckx completed a Grand Tour double. His final double also coincided with winning the elite men&#x27;s road race at the UCI Road World Championships to make him the first rider to accomplish cycling&#x27;s Triple Crown. Merckx broke the hour record in October 1972, extending the record by almost 800 metres.

He acquired the nickname &quot;the Cannibal&quot;, suggested by the daughter of a teammate upon being told by her father of how Merckx would not let anyone else win. Merckx achieved 525 victories over his eighteen-year career. He is one of only three riders to have won all five &#x27;Monuments&#x27; (Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia) and the only one to have won them all at least twice. Merckx was successful on the road and also on the track, as well as in the large stage races and one-day races. He is almost universally regarded as the greatest and most successful rider in the history of cycling.

Since Merckx&#x27;s retirement from the sport on 18 May 1978, he has remained active in the cycling world. He began his own bicycle brand, Eddy Merckx Cycles, in 1980 and its bicycles were used by several professional teams in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Merckx coached the Belgian national cycling team for eleven years, stopping in 1996. He helped start and organize the Tour of Qatar from its start in 2002 until its final edition in 2016. He also assisted in running the Tour of Oman, before a disagreement with the organizers led him to step away in 2017.

== Early life and amateur career ==

Edouard Louis Joseph Merckx was born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium on 17 June 1945 to Jules Merckx and Jenny Pittomvils. Merckx was the first-born of the family. In September 1946, the family moved to Sint-Pieters-Woluwe, in Brussels, Belgium in order to take over a grocery store that had been up for lease. In May 1948, Jenny gave birth to twins: a boy, Michel, and a girl, Micheline. As a child Eddy was hyperactive and was always playing outside.

Eddy was a competitive child and played several sports, including basketball, football, table tennis and boxing, the latter in which he won some local boxing tournaments. He even played lawn tennis for the local junior team. However, Merckx claimed he knew he wanted to be a cyclist at the age of four and that his first memory was a crash on his bike when he was the same age. Merckx began riding a bike at the age of three or four and would ride to school every day, beginning at age eight. Merckx would imitate his cycling idol Stan Ockers with his friends when they rode bikes together.

In summer 1961, Merckx bought his first racing license and competed in his first official race a month after he turned sixteen, coming in sixth place. He rode in twelve more races before winning his first, at Petit-Enghien, on 1 October 1961. In the winter following his first victory, he trained with former racer Félicien Vervaecke at the local velodrome. Merckx won his second victory on 11 March 1962 in a kermis race. Merckx competed in 55 races during the 1962 calendar year; as he devoted more time to cycling, his grades at school began to decline. After winning the Belgian amateur road race title, Merckx declined an offer from his school&#x27;s headmaster to have his exams postponed, and dropped out of school. He finished the season with 23 victories to his name.

Merckx won the amateur road race at the 1964 UCI Road World Championships in Sallanches, France. The following month, he came twelfth in the individual road race at the Tokyo Olympics. Merckx remained an amateur until April 1965, and finished his amateur career with eighty wins to his credit.

== Professional career ==

=== 1965–1967: Solo–Superia and Peugeot–BP–Michelin ===

====1965: First professional season====
Merckx turned professional on 29 April 1965 when he signed with Rik Van Looy&#x27;s Belgian team, . He won his first race in Vilvoorde, beating Emile Daems. On 1 August, Merckx finished second in the Belgian national championships, which qualified him for the men&#x27;s road race at the UCI Road World Championships. Raphaël Géminiani, the manager of the Bic cycling team, approached Merckx at the event and offered him 2,500 francs a month to join the team the following season. Merckx chose to sign; however, since he was a minor the contract was invalid.

After finishing the road race in 29th position, Merckx returned to Belgium and discussed his plans for the next season with his manager Jean Van Buggenhout. Van Buggenhout helped orchestrate a move that sent Merckx to the French-based Peugeot–BP–Michelin for 20,000 francs a month. Merckx elected to leave due to the way he was treated by his teammates, in particular Van Looy. Van Looy and other teammates mocked Merckx for his various habits such as his eating, or called him names. In addition, Merckx later stated that during his time with Van Looy&#x27;s team he had not been taught anything. While with , he won nine races out of the nearly 70 races he entered.

====1966: First Monument victory====

In March 1966, Merckx entered his first major stage race as a professional rider, the Paris–Nice. He took the race lead for a single stage before losing it to Jacques Anquetil and eventually coming in fourth overall. Milan–San Remo, his first participation in one of cycling&#x27;s Monuments, was the next event on the calendar for Merckx. There, he succeeded in staying with the main field as the race entered the final climb of the Poggio. He attacked on the climb and reduced the field to a group of eleven, himself included. Merckx was advised by his manager to hold off on sprinting full-out to the finish line until as late as possible. At the end of the race, three other riders approached the line with him, and Merckx beat them in the sprint. In the following weeks, he raced the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix, the most important cobbled classics; in the former he crashed and in the latter he had a punctured tire. At the 1966 UCI Road World Championships he finished twelfth in the road race after suffering a cramp in the closing kilometers. He finished the 1966 season with a total of 20 wins, including his first stage race win at the Tour of Morbihan.

====1967: Second straight Milan–San Remo and world champion====
Merckx opened the 1967 campaign with two stage victories at the Giro di Sardegna. He followed these successes by entering Paris–Nice where he won the second stage and took the race lead. Two stages later, a teammate, Tom Simpson, attacked with several other riders on a climb and was nearly 20 minutes ahead of Merckx, who remained in a group behind. Merckx attacked two days later on a climb 70 km into the stage. He was able to establish a firm advantage, but obeyed orders from his manager to wait for the chasing Simpson. Merckx won the stage, while Simpson secured his overall victory.
On 18 March, Merckx started the Milan–San Remo and was seen as a 120–1 favorite to win the race. He attacked on the Capo Berta and again on the Poggio, leaving only Gianni Motta with him. The two slowed their pace and were joined by two more riders. Merckx won the four-man sprint to the finish. His next victory came in La Flèche Wallonne after he missed out on an early break, caught up to it, and attacked from it to win the race. On 20 May, he started the Giro d&#x27;Italia, his first Grand Tour. He won the twelfth and fourteenth stages en route to finishing ninth in the general classification.

He signed with Faema on 2 September for ten years worth 400,000 Belgian francs. He chose to switch over in order to be in complete control over the team he was racing for. In addition, he would not have to pay for various expenses that came with racing such as wheels and tires. The next day, Merckx started the men&#x27;s road race at the 1967 UCI Road World Championships in Heerlen, Netherlands. The course consisted of ten laps of a circuit. Motta attacked on the first lap and was joined by Merckx and five other riders. The group thinned to five as they reached the finish line where Merckx was able to out-sprint Jan Janssen for first place. In doing so, he became the third rider to win the world road race amateur and professional titles. By winning the race he earned the right to wear the rainbow jersey as world champion.

=== 1968–1970: Faema ===

====1968: First Grand Tour victory====
Merckx&#x27;s first victory with his new team came in a stage win at the Giro di Sardegna. At Paris–Nice, he was forced to quit the race due to a knee injury he sustained during the event. He failed to win his third consecutive Milan–San Remo and missed out at the Tour of Flanders the following weekend. His next victory came at Paris–Roubaix when he bested Herman Van Springel in a race that was plagued by poor weather and several punctures to the competing riders.
At the behest of his team, Merckx raced the Giro d&#x27;Italia instead of the Tour de France. He won the race&#x27;s second stage after he attacked with one kilometer to go. The twelfth stage was marred by rainy weather and featured the climbs of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo for the stage finish. By the time Merckx had reached the penultimate climb, there was a six-man group at the front of the race with a nine-minute advantage. Merckx attacked and was able to get a sizable distance between himself and the group he left before he stopped to change his wheel in order to slow down due to orders from his team manager. Merckx got back on his bike and caught the leading breakaway and rode past it to the finish, where he won the stage and took the race lead. Merckx went on to win the race, along with the points classification and mountains classification. In the Volta a Catalunya, Merckx took the race lead from Gimondi in the race&#x27;s time trial stage and won the event as a whole. He finished the season with 32 wins in the 129 races he entered.

====1969: A victory in Paris and injury in Blois====
Merckx opened the 1969 season with victories at the Vuelta a Levante and the Paris–Nice overall, as well as stages in each of the races. On 30 March 1969 Merckx earned his first major victory of the 1969 calendar with his win at the Tour of Flanders. On a rainy day that featured strong winds, he attacked first on the Oude Kwaremont, but a puncture nullified any gains he was able to establish. He made a move on the Kapelmuur and was followed by a few riders. As the wind shifted from a crosswind to a headwind with close to seventy kilometers left to go, Merckx increased the pace and rode solo to victory. The seventeen days after the Tour of Flanders saw Merckx win nine times. He won Milan–San Remo by descending the Poggio at high speed. Merckx saw victory again in mid-April at the Liège–Bastogne–Liège when he attacked with 70 kilometers remaining.

He began the Giro d&#x27;Italia on 16 May, stating that he wished to ride less aggressively than the year before in order to save energy for the Tour de France. Merckx had won four of the race&#x27;s stages and held the race lead going into the sixteenth day of racing. However, before the start of the stage race director Vincenzo Torriani, along with a television camera and two writers, entered Merckx&#x27;s hotel room and informed him that he had failed a doping control and was disqualified from the race, in addition to being suspended for a month. On 14 June, the cycling governing body, the FICP, overturned the month long suspension and cleared him due to the &quot;benefit of the doubt.&quot;
Before starting the Tour, Merckx had spent a large amount of his time resting and training, racing only five times. Merckx won the race&#x27;s sixth stage through attacking before the leg&#x27;s final major climb, the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace, and then outlasting his competitors who were able to follow him initially. During the seventeenth stage, Merckx was riding at the head of the race with several general classification contenders on the Col du Tourmalet. Merckx shifted into a large gear, attacked, and went on to cross the summit with a 45-second advantage. Despite orders to wait for the chasing riders, Merckx increased his efforts. He rode over the Col du Soulor and Col d&#x27;Aubisque, increasing the gap to eight minutes. With close to fifty kilometers to go, Merckx began to suffer hypoglycemia and rode the rest of the stage in severe pain. At the end of the stage, Merckx told the journalists &quot;I hope I have done enough now for you to consider me a worthy winner.&quot; Merckx finished the race with six stage victories to his credit, along with the general, points, mountains, and combination classifications, and the award for most aggressive rider.

His next major race was the two-day race, Paris–Luxembourg. Merckx was down fifty-four seconds going into the second day and attacked eight kilometers from the finish, on the slopes of the Bereldange. Merckx rode solo to catch the leading rider Jacques Anquetil, whom he dropped with a kilometer remaining. Merckx won the stage and gained enough time on the race leader Gimondi to win the race.
On 9 September, Merckx participated in a three-round omnium event at the concrete velodrome in Blois where each rider was to be paced by a derny. Fernand Wambst was Merckx&#x27;s pacer for the contest. After winning the first intermediate sprint of the first round, Wambst chose to slow their pace and move to the back of the race despite Merckx wanting to stay out in front for fear of an accident. Wambst wanted to pass everyone to provide a show for the crowd. The duo then increased their pace and began to pass each of the other contestants; however, as they passed the riders in first position, the leading derny lost control and crashed into the wall. Wambst chose to avoid the derny by going below it, but the leader&#x27;s derny came back down and collided with Wambst, while Merckx&#x27;s pedal caught one of the dernies. The two riders landed head first onto the track.

Wambst died of a fractured skull as he was being transported to a hospital. Merckx remained unconscious for 45 minutes and awoke in the operating room. He sustained a concussion, whiplash, trapped nerves in his back, a displaced pelvis, and several other cuts and bruises. He remained at the hospital for a week before returning to Belgium. He spent six weeks in bed before beginning to race again in October. Merckx later stated that he &quot;was never the same again&quot; after the crash. He would constantly adjust the height of his seat during races to help ease the pain.

====1970: A Giro–Tour double====
Merckx entered the 1970 campaign nursing a case of mild tendonitis in his knee. His first major victory came in Paris–Nice where he won the general classification, along with three stages. On 1 April, Merckx won the Gent–Wevelgem, followed by the Tour of Belgium – where he braved a snowy stage and followed the day up with a victory in the final time trial to secure the title – and Paris–Roubaix. In Paris–Roubaix, Merckx was battling a cold as the race began in heavy rain. He attacked thirty-one kilometers from the finish and went on to win by five minutes and twenty-one seconds, the largest margin of victory in the history of the race. The next weekend, Merckx attempted to race for teammate Joseph Bruyère in La Flèche Wallonne; however, Bruyère was unable to keep pace with the leading riders, leaving Merckx to take the victory.
After the scandal at the previous year&#x27;s Giro d&#x27;Italia, Merckx was unwilling to return to the race in 1970. His entry to the race was contingent upon all doping controls being sent to a lab in Rome to be tested, rather than being tested at the finish like the year before. He started the race and won the second stage, but four days later showed signs of weakness with his knee as he was dropped twice while in the mountains. However the next day, Merckx attacked on the final climb into the city of Brentonico to win the stage and take the lead. He won the stage nine individual time trial by almost two minutes over the second-place finisher, expanding his lead significantly. Merckx did not win another stage, but expanded his lead a little more before the race&#x27;s conclusion.

Before beginning the Tour, Merckx won the men&#x27;s road race at the Belgian National Road Race Championships. Merckx won the Tour&#x27;s opening prologue to take the race&#x27;s first race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey. After losing the lead following the second stage, he won the sixth stage after forming a breakaway with Lucien Van Impe and regained the lead. After expanding his lead in the stage nine individual time trial, Merckx won the race&#x27;s first true mountain stage, stage 10, and expanded his lead to five minutes in the general classification. Merckx won three of the five stages contested within the next four days, including a summit finish to Mont Ventoux, where upon finishing he was given oxygen. Merckx won two more stages, both individual time trials, and won the Tour by over twelve minutes. He finished the Tour with eight stage victories and won the mountains and combination classifications. The eight stage wins equaled the previous record for stage wins in a single Tour de France. Merckx also became the third to accomplish the feat of winning the Giro and Tour in the same calendar year.

=== 1971–1976: Molteni ===

====1971: A third consecutive Tour and second world championship====

Faema folded at the end of the 1970 season causing Merckx and several of his teammates to move to another Italian team, Molteni. The first major victory for Merckx came in the Giro di Sardegna, which he secured after attacking on his own and riding solo through the rain to win the race&#x27;s final stage. He followed that with his third consecutive Paris–Nice victory, a race he led from start to finish. In the Milan–San Remo, Merckx worked with his teammates in a seven-man breakaway to set up a final attack on the Poggio. Merckx&#x27;s attack succeeded and he won his fourth edition of the race. Six days later, he won the Omloop Het Volk.

After winning the Tour of Belgium again, Merckx headed into the major spring classics. During the Tour of Flanders, Merckx&#x27;s rivals worked against him to prevent him from winning. A week later, he suffered five flat tires during the Paris–Roubaix. The Liège–Bastogne–Liège was held in cold and rain conditions. After attacking ninety kilometers from the finish, Merckx caught the leaders on the road and passed them. He rode solo until around three kilometers to go when Georges Pintens caught him. Merckx and Pintens rode to the finish together, where Merckx won the two-man sprint. Instead of racing the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Merckx elected to enter two shorter stages races in France, the Grand Prix du Midi Libre and the Critérium du Dauphiné, both of which he won.

The Tour de France began with a team time trial that Merckx&#x27;s team won, giving him the lead. The next day&#x27;s racing was split into three parts. Merckx lost the lead after stage 1b, but regained it after stage 1c due to a time bonus that he earned from winning an intermediate sprint. During the second stage, a major break with the major race contenders, including Merckx, formed with over a hundred kilometers to go. The group finished nine minutes ahead of the peloton as Merckx came around Roger De Vlaeminck during the sprint to win the day. After a week of racing, Merckx held a lead of around a minute over the main contenders. The eighth stage saw a mountain top finish to Puy-de-Dôme. Bernard Thévenet attacked on the lower slopes and Merckx was unable to counter. Joop Zoetemelk and Luis Ocaña went with Thévenet and wound up gaining fifteen seconds on Merckx.
On the descent of the Col du Cucheron during the race&#x27;s ninth leg, Merckx&#x27;s tire punctured, prompting Ocaña to attack with Zoetemelk, Thévenet, and Gösta Pettersson. The group of four finished a minute and a half ahead of Merckx, giving Zoetemelk the lead. The following day Merckx lost eight minutes to Ocaña after a poor showing due to stomach pains and indigestion. At the start of the eleventh stage, Merckx, three teammates, and a couple of others formed a breakaway. Merckx&#x27;s group finished two minutes in front of the peloton that was led by Ocaña&#x27;s Bic team. After winning the ensuing time trial, Merckx took back eleven more seconds on Ocaña. The race entered the Pyrenees with the first stage, into Luchon, being plagued by heavy thunderstorms that severely handicapped vision. On the descent of the Col de Menté, Merckx crashed on a left bend. Ocaña, who was trailing, crashed into the same bend and Zoetemelk collided with him. Merckx fell again on the descent and took the race lead as Ocaña was forced to retire from the race due to injuries from the crash. Merckx declined to wear the yellow jersey the following day out of respect for Ocaña. He won two more stages and the general, points, and combination classifications when the race finished in Paris.

Seven weeks following the Tour, Merckx entered the men&#x27;s road race at the UCI Road World Championships that were held in Mendrisio, Switzerland. The route for the day was rather hilly and consisted of several circuits. Merckx was a part of a five-man breakaway as the race reached five laps to go. After attacking on the second to last stage, Merckx and Gimondi reached the finish, where Merckx won the race by four bike lengths. This earned him his second rainbow jersey. He closed out the 1971 calendar with his first victory in the Giro di Lombardia. This victory meant that Merckx had won all of cycling&#x27;s Monuments. Merckx made the winning move when he attacked on the descent of the Intelvi Pass. During the off-season, Merckx had his displaced pelvis tended to by a doctor.

====1972: Breaking the hour record alongside a Giro–Tour double====

Due to his non-participation in track racing over the winter, Merckx entered the 1972 campaign in poorer form than in previous years. In the Paris–Nice, Merckx broke a vertebra in a crash that occurred as the peloton was in the midst of a bunch sprint. Against the advice of a physician, he started the next day being barely able to ride out of the saddle, leading Ocaña to attack him several times throughout the stage. In the race&#x27;s fifth leg, Merckx sprinted away from Ocaña with 150 meters to go to win the day. Merckx lost the race lead in the final stage to Raymond Poulidor and finished in second place overall. Two days removed from Paris–Nice, Merckx was victorious for the fifth time at the Milan–San Remo after he established a gap on the descent of the Poggio.

In Paris–Roubaix, he crashed again, further aggravating the injury he sustained from Paris–Nice. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège by making a solo move forty-six kilometers from the finish. Three days later, in La Flèche Wallonne, Merckx was a part of a six-man leading group as the race neared its conclusion. Merckx won the uphill sprint to the finish despite his derailleur shifting him to the wrong gear, forcing him to ride in a larger gear than anticipated. He became the third rider to win La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège in the same weekend. Despite a monetary offer from race organizers for Merckx to participate in the Vuelta a España, he chose to take part in the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Merckx lost over two and a half minutes to Spanish climber José Manuel Fuente after the Giro&#x27;s fourth stage that contained a summit finish to Blockhaus. In the seventh stage, Fuente had attacked on the first climb of the day, the Valico di Monte Scuro. However, Fuente cracked near the top of the climb, allowing for Merckx and Pettersson to catch and pass him. Merckx gained over four minutes on Fuente and became the new race leader. He expanded his lead by two minutes through the stage 12a and 12b time trials, winning the former. Fuente got Merckx on his own as the two climbed together during the fourteenth stage. He and teammate Francisco Galdós attacked, leaving Merckx behind. Merckx eventually reconnected with the two on the final climb of the stage. He proceeded to attack and went on to win the stage by forty-seven seconds. He lost two minutes to Fuente due to stomach trouble during the seventeenth leg that finished atop the Stelvio Pass, but went on to win one more stage en route to his third victory at the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Merckx entered the Tour de France in July where a battle between him and Ocaña was expected by many. He took the opening prologue and expanded his advantage over all the other general classification contenders, except Ocaña, by at least three minutes. Going into the Pyrenees, Merckx led Ocaña by fifty-one seconds. The general classification favorites were riding together as the race hit the Col d&#x27;Aubisque in the seventh leg. Ocaña punctured on the climb, allowing for the other riders to attack. Ocaña chased after the group but crashed into a wall on the descent and went on to lose almost two minutes to Merckx. Merckx was criticized for attacking while Ocaña had a flat, but Merckx responded that the year before Ocaña had done the same thing while the race was in the Alps. Merckx won the following stage, regaining the lead which he had lost after the fourth leg. During the next two major mountain stages, one to Mont Ventoux and the other to Orcières, he merely followed Ocaña&#x27;s wheel. He won three more stages before crossing the finish line in Paris as the race&#x27;s winner, thus completing his second Giro-Tour double in the process.
After initially planning to attempt to break the hour record in August, Merckx decided to make the attempt in October after taking a ten-day hiatus from criterium racing to heal and prepare. The attempt took place on 25 October in Mexico City, Mexico at the outdoor track Agustin Melgar. Mexico was chosen due to the higher altitude as this led to less air resistance. He arrived in Mexico on the 21st to prepare for his attempt, but two days were lost due to rain. His attempt started at 8:46 am local time and saw him finish the first ten kilometers twenty-eight seconds faster than the record pace. However, Merckx started off too fast and began to fade as the attempt wore on. He eventually was able to recover and posted a distance of , breaking the world record. After finishing he was carried off and was quoted saying the pain was &quot;very, very, very significant.&quot;

====1973: A Giro–Vuelta double====
An illness prevented Merckx from taking part in the Milan–San Remo at the start of the 1973 calendar. During a span of nineteen days, Merckx won four classics including Omloop Het Volk, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and Paris–Roubaix. He decided to race the Vuelta a España and the Giro d&#x27;Italia, instead of racing the Tour de France. He won the opening prologue of the Vuelta to take an early lead. Despite Ocaña&#x27;s best efforts, Merckx won a total of six stages on his way to his only Vuelta a España title. In addition to the general classification, Merckx won the race&#x27;s points classification and combination classifications.

Four days after the conclusion of the Vuelta, Merckx lined up to start the Giro d&#x27;Italia. He won the opening two-man time trial with Roger Swerts and the next day&#x27;s leg as well. Merckx&#x27;s primary competitor, Fuente, lost a significant amount of time during the second stage. He won the eighth stage which featured a summit finish to Monte Carpegna despite Fuente attacking several times on the ascent. Fuente tried attacking throughout the rest of the race, but was only able to make time gains on the race&#x27;s penultimate stage. Merckx won the race after leading from start to finish, a feat only previously accomplished by Alfredo Binda and Costante Girardengo. He also became the first rider to win the Giro and Vuelta in the same calendar year.
The UCI Road World Championships were held in Barcelona, Spain in 1973 and contested on the Montjuich circuit. During the road race, Merckx attacked with around one hundred kilometers left. His move was marked by Freddy Maertens, Gimondi, and Ocaña. Merckx attacked on the final lap, but was reeled in by the three riders. It came down to a sprint between the four, of which Merckx came in last and Gimondi in first. Following the road race, Merckx won his first Paris–Brussels and Grand Prix des Nations. He won both legs of À travers Lausanne, as well as the Giro di Lombardia, but a doping positive disqualified him. He closed the season with over fifty victories to his credit.

====1974: Completion of cycling&#x27;s Triple Crown====
The 1974 season saw Merckx fail to win a spring classic for the first time in his career, in part due to him suffering from various illnesses during the early months. Pneumonia forced him to quit racing for a month and forced him to enter the Giro d&#x27;Italia in poor form. He lost time early in the race to Fuente, who took the race&#x27;s first mountainous stage. Merckx gained time on Fuente in the race&#x27;s only time trial. Merckx attacked from two hundred kilometers out two days later in a stage that was plagued by horrendous weather. Fuente lost ten minutes to Merckx, who became the race leader. The twentieth stage had a summit finish to Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Fuente and Gianbattista Baronchelli attacked on the climb, while Merckx was unable to match their accelerations. He finished the stage only to see his lead shrink to twelve seconds over Baronchelli. He held on to that lead until the race&#x27;s conclusion, winning his fifth Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Three days following his victory at the Giro, Merckx started the Tour de Suisse. He won the race&#x27;s prologue and rode conservatively for the rest of the race. He took the final leg, an individual time trial, to seal his overall victory. After finishing the race, Merckx had a sebaceous cyst removed on 22 June. Five days following the surgery, he was scheduled to begin the Tour de France. The wound was still slightly open when he began the Grand Tour and it bled throughout the race.

At the Tour, Merckx won the race&#x27;s prologue, giving him the first race leader&#x27;s &quot;maillot jaune&quot; (), which he lost the next day to teammate Joseph Bruyère. He won the seventh stage of the race, and regained the lead, through attacking in the closing kilometers and holding off the chasing peloton. He put five minutes into Poulidor, his main rival, after dropping him on the Col du Galibier. The next day, on the slopes of Mont Ventoux, Merckx rode to limit his losses after suffering several attacks from other general classification riders, including Poulidor, Vicente López Carril and Gonzalo Aja. He expanded his lead through several stage victories afterward, including one where he attacked with ten kilometers to go in a flat stage and held off the peloton to reach the finish in Orléans almost a minute and a half before the chasing group. Merckx finished the Tour with eight stage wins and his fifth Tour de France victory, equaling the record of Anquetil.
Going into the men&#x27;s road race at the UCI Road World Championships, Merckx anchored a squad that included Van Springel, Maertens, and De Vlaeminck. The route featured twenty-one laps of a circuit that contained two climbs. Merckx and Poulidor attacked with around seven kilometers to go, after catching the leading breakaway. The two rode to the finish together where Merckx won the sprint to the line, establishing a two-second gap between himself and Poulidor. By winning the road race, Merckx became the first rider to win the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning the Tour de France, Giro d&#x27;Italia, and men&#x27;s road race at the World Championships in one calendar year. It was also his third world title, becoming the third rider to ever be world champion three times, after Binda and Rik Van Steenbergen.

====1975: Second place at the Tour====
With victories at Milan–San Remo and Amstel Gold Race, Merckx opened the 1975 season in good form, also winning the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme. In the Catalan Week, Merckx lost his super domestique Bruyère, who had helped Merckx to victory in years past many times, to a broken leg. Two days following the Catalan Week, Merckx participated in the Tour of Flanders. He launched an attack with eighty kilometers to go, with only Frans Verbeeck being able to match his acceleration. Verbeeck was dropped as the race reached five kilometers remaining, allowing Merckx to take his third Tour of Flanders victory. In Paris–Roubaix, Merckx suffered a flat tire with around eighty kilometers left when a part of a leading group of four. After chasing for three kilometers, he caught the three other riders and the group rode into the finish together; De Vlaeminck won the day. Merckx won his fifth Liège–Bastogne–Liège by attacking several times in the closing portions of the race.

Merckx&#x27;s attitude while racing had changed: riders expected him to chase down attacks, which angered him. Notably, in the Tour de Romandie he was riding with race leader Zoetemelk as an attack occurred. Merckx refused to chase the break down, and the two lost fourteen minutes. Merckx contracted a cold and, later, tonsilitis while racing in the spring campaign. This caused him to be in poor form, forcing him to not participate in the Giro d&#x27;Italia. He then rode in the Dauphiné Libéré and was not on par with Thevenet, who won the race. At the Tour de Suisse, De Vlaeminck won the race as a whole, while Merckx finished second.
He placed second in the Tour de France&#x27;s prologue. The following morning&#x27;s split stage saw Merckx put time on Thevenet by attacking with Francesco Moser, Van Impe, and Zoetemelk. In day&#x27;s second leg, Merckx gained time on Zoetemelk. He won the stage six individual time trial and gaining more time on Thevenet and Zoetemelk. He won the next time trial into Auch as well. During the race&#x27;s eleventh stage, Merckx sent his team to set the pace early on in the stage. Reaching the final climb of the day, Merckx was on his own as his team had been used to set the pace throughout the day. On the day&#x27;s final climb to Pla d&#x27;Adet, he matched an acceleration by Zoetemelk. Thevenet then launched an attack, to which Merckx could not follow and saw him lose over two minutes. After the stage Merckx switched decided to mark Thevenet for the rest of the race and make an attack on the Puy-de-Dôme.

While climbing the Puy-de-Dôme, Thevenet and Van Impe attacked. Merckx followed at his own pace and kept the two riders within a hundred meters. With about 150 m remaining, Merckx was prepared to sprint to the line, but was punched in the back by a spectator, Nello Breton. He crossed the line thirty-four seconds behind Thevenet and proceeded to vomit after catching his breath. The punch left him with a large bruise. During the rest day he was found to have an inflamed liver for which he was prescribed blood thinners.

The stage following the rest day featured five climbs, Merckx felt a pain on the third climb in the area of the punch and had a teammate get him an analgesic. Thevenet attacked several times on the climb of the Col des Champs, all of which Merckx countered. Merckx retaliated by speeding away on the descent. On the start of the next climb, Merckx had his Molteni teammates set the pace and he distanced himself from his competitors before the start of the final climb. However, as Merckx began the final climb he cracked. Thevenet caught and passed him with four kilometers left. Gimondi, Van Impe, and Zoetemelk passed Merckx, who finished fifth and one minute and twenty-six seconds down. The following day, Merckx caught up with the leading breakaway and wanted to push ahead, but the riders chose not to participate in the pace making, leading Merckx to sit up and get caught. He lost two more minutes to Thevenet, who attacked on the Col d&#x27;Izoard. He crashed in the next leg, breaking a cheekbone, and gained some time on Thevenet before the finish in Paris. He finished in second place, the first time he had lost a Tour in his six starts.

====1976: A record seventh Milan–San Remo====
He opened his 1976 season with his record seventh victory in Milan–San Remo. He followed with a victory in the Catalan Week, but suffered a crash in the final stage when a spectator&#x27;s bag caught his handlebars, injuring his elbow. This injury plagued his performance throughout the spring classic season. He entered the Giro d&#x27;Italia but failed to win a stage for the first time in his career. He finished the race in eighth overall while battling a saddle boil throughout the race. Following the Giro&#x27;s conclusion Merckx announced that he and his team Molteni would not take part in the Tour de France. He took part in the men&#x27;s road race at the UCI Road World Championships and finished in fifth position. He ended his season in October after racing for most of August. He failed to win the Super Prestige Pernod International, a competition where riders were awarded points for their placements in certain professional races, for the first time since 1968. In the first two months of his off-season, Merckx spent the majority of his time lying down. Molteni ended their sponsorship at the end of the season.

=== 1977–1978: Fiat France and C&amp;A ===
Fiat France became the new sponsor for Merckx&#x27;s team and Raphaël Géminiani the new manager. He got his season&#x27;s first victories in the Grand Prix d&#x27;Aix and Tour Méditerranéen. Merckx agreed to ride a light spring season in order to save himself for a chance at a sixth Tour victory. He took one stage at the Paris–Nice but had to withdraw from the race&#x27;s final stage due to sinusitis. In the spring classics, Merckx did not win any races, with his best finish being a sixth place in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Before the Tour, Merckx raced both the Dauphiné Libéré and Tour de Suisse, winning one stage of the latter.

He admitted his poor form and anxiety about aggravating previous injuries going into the Tour de France. He held on to second place overall for two weeks. As the race entered the Alps, Merckx began to lose more time; he lost thirteen minutes on the stage to Alpe d&#x27;Huez alone. On the stage into Saint-Étienne, Merckx attacked and gained enough time to move into sixth overall; he finished the Tour in the same position. In the time following the Tour, Merckx raced twenty-two races in a span of forty days before coming in thirty-third at the UCI Road World Championships men&#x27;s road race. Merckx earned his final victory on the road on 17 September in a kermis race. In late December, Fiat France chose to end their sponsorship of Merckx in favor of building a more French centered squad.

In January, the department store C&amp;A announced that they would sponsor a new team for Merckx after their owner met Merckx at a football game. His plan for the season was to race one last Tour de France and then ride several smaller races for appearances. He raced a total of five races in the 1978 calendar. His last victory was in a track event, an omnium in Zürich, on 10 February 1978 with Patrick Sercu. His first road race came in the Grand Prix de Montauroux on 19 February. Merckx came to the front of the race and put in a large effort before swinging off and quitting the race. His best finish came in the Tour de Haut, where he managed fifth. He dropped out of Omloop Het Volk due to colitis and completed his final race on 19 March, a kermis in Kemzeke. Following the race, Merckx went on a vacation to go skiing. He returned from travel to train more, but by this point the team sponsor knew he was going to quit. Merckx announced his retirement from the sport on 18 May. He stated that the doctors advised him against racing.

== Retirement ==
Following his exit from racing, Merckx opened up Eddy Merckx Cycles on 28 March 1980 in Brussels. The initial workers that were hired for the factory were trained by Ugo De Rosa, a notable bike maker, before starting. The company almost went bankrupt at one point and was also caught up in a tax repayment controversy. Merckx would spend time giving input on the models as they were being produced. Despite the financial problems the brand became highly regarded and successful, being used by several top-level cycling teams in the 1980s and 1990s. Merckx stepped down as CEO in 2008 and sold most of his shares, but continued to test the bikes that were created and had some input. Cycling journalist Sam Dansie believes that Eddy Merckx Cycles has maintained a presence as an elite bicycle due to its adoption of new methods over time. As of January 2015, the business is still based in Belgium and distributes to over twenty-five countries.

Merckx managed the Belgian national team world championships for eleven years, between 1986 and 1996. He acted as the race director for the Tour of Flanders for a brief period of time. He temporarily sponsored a youth developmental team with CGER Bank, a team that featured his son Axel. He helped organize the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx, which started out as an invitation only individual time trial event, later becoming a two-man time trial event. The event folded after 2004 due to riders&#x27; lack of interest.

He played a pivotal role in getting the Tour of Qatar started in 2002. In 2001 Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the former Emir of Qatar, reached out to Merckx and told him of his interest in starting a bicycle race to show off his country. Merckx then contacted then Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) president Hein Verbruggen, who checked out Qatar&#x27;s roads. Following a successful inspection, Merckx contacted the Amaury Sport Organisation about working with him planning the race; they agreed in 2001. Merckx officially co-owned the race with Dirk De Pauw and helped organize it until the race was cancelled before the 2017 edition due to financial reasons. In addition, Merckx also helped Qatar secure the right to host the 2016 UCI Road World Championships, as well as designing the race route for the road race. Merckx briefly co-owned and helped start the Tour of Oman in 2010. In 2015, Merckx said later that although he was not racing, he knew would still be involved with the sport &quot;as a bike builder, first in the factory and now as an ambassador.&quot; In November 2017, it was announced that Merckx and his partner Dirk De Pauw split with Tour of Oman organizer ASO following an undisclosed dispute.

== Personal life ==

Merckx officially began dating Claudine Acou in April 1965. Acou was a 21-year-old teacher and daughter of the trainer of the national amateur team. Merckx asked her father for permission to marry her between track races. On 5 December 1967 Merckx married Acou after four years of courtship. She would often handle the press for her husband, who was shy. Acou gave birth to their first child, Sabrina, on 14 February 1970. Merckx skipped a team training camp to be with his wife for Sabrina&#x27;s birth. Acou later gave birth to a son, Axel, who also became a professional cyclist. Merckx was brought up speaking Flemish, but was taught French in school.

In 1996 Albert II of Belgium, King of the Belgians, gave him the title of baron. In Italy, Merckx was given the title of &quot;Cavaliere&quot;. In 2011, he was named Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;honneur by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris, having been named &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the order in January 1975. Merckx has become an ambassador for the Damien The Leper Society, a foundation named after a Catholic priest, which battles leprosy and other diseases in developing countries. He was blessed by Pope John Paul II in Brussels in the 1990s. Merckx is an art lover and stated that his favorite artist is René Magritte, a surrealist. Salvador Dalí is another of his favorites.

Before starting the third stage of the 1968 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Merckx was found to have a heart condition. A cardiologist, Giancarlo Lavezzaro, found that Merckx had non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that has killed several young athletes. In 2013, Merckx was given a pacemaker to help correct a heart rhythm issue. The surgery was performed in Genk on the 21st of March of that year as a preventative measure. Merckx stated that he never had any heart issues while racing, despite the fact that several men in his family died young of heart-related problems. In May 2004, he had an esophagus operation to cure stomachaches that had plagued him since he was young. In August, he reported that he lost nearly 30 kg after the procedure. On 13 October 2019, Merckx was hospitalised after a cycling accident, having suffered a haemorrhage and falling unconscious for a while. He was released a week later.

In December 2024, Merckx crashed while on a group bike ride and fractured his hip. He will undergo surgery at the same hospital as Remco Evenepoel did the previous week. As a result of the accident, Merckx required a full hip replacement.

== Career achievements ==

== Legacy ==

Merckx has been regarded by many as the greatest and most successful cyclist of all time. He rode well in the Grand Tours and in the one-day classics. He was a very good time trialist and climber. In addition, Merckx showed great ability to race on the track. He was known for racing style that consisted of attacking constantly, which came to be known as &quot;la course en tête&quot; (&quot;the race in the lead&quot;) for which the documentary on Merckx, &quot;La Course en Tête&quot; (which also has the double meaning of &#x27;the race in your head&#x27;) was named. Attacking for Merckx was the best form of defence. He would spend a day in a breakaway and then make another significant attack the following day. Despite his constant attacking, he would occasionally ride in a defensive mindset, particularly when racing the Giro and facing Fuente. Merckx entered over 1,800 races during his career and won a total of 525. Due to his dominance in the sport some cycling historians refer to the period in which he raced as the &quot;Merckx Era.&quot; During his professional career, he won 445 of the 1585 races he entered. Between the years of 1967 and 1977 Merckx raced between 111 and 151 races each season. In 1971, he raced 120 times and won 54 of the events, the most races any cyclist has won in a season. Merckx admits that he was the best of his generation, but insists it&#x27;s not practical to compare across generations. Given the specialization of a cyclist&#x27;s role in the modern peloton, Merckx&#x27;s number of road race victories will most likely never be surpassed in the future.

Merckx is one of the three riders to win all five &#x27;Monuments of Cycling&#x27; (i.e., Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia), the other two being Rik Van Looy and Roger De Vlaeminck. He finished his career with nineteen victories across the monuments, more than any other rider and eight more than the rider with the second most. He won twenty-eight classic races, with Paris–Tours being the only race he did not win. The closest he came to victory in the race was sixth in the 1973 race. A lesser Belgian rider, Noël van Tyghem, won Paris–Tours in 1972 and said: &quot;Between us, I and Eddy Merckx have won every classic that can be won. I won Paris–Tours, Merckx won all the rest.&quot;
While racing, he became the third rider to win all three Grand Tours in his career, a feat that has since been accomplished by more riders. He holds the record for most Grand Tour victories with 11, along with the record for most stage wins across all three Grand Tours with 64. He has completed the most Giro-Tour doubles in history with three. He was the first rider to win cycling&#x27;s Triple Crown which has only been accomplished two other times, by Stephen Roche in 1987 and Tadej Pogačar in 2024. He is the only rider to win the general, points and mountains classifications at the Giro d&#x27;Italia, in 1968, and at the Tour de France, in 1969. Since then, the general, points and mountains classifications have been won at the Vuelta a España by Tony Rominger in 1993 and by Laurent Jalabert in 1995. He shares the record for most victories at both the Giro d&#x27;Italia and Tour de France, with five wins at each. In those races he also holds the records for days spent in the race leader&#x27;s jersey at 78 and 96 respectively. For his career successes in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Merckx became the first rider inducted into the race&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2012. When being inducted, Merckx was given the modern-day trophy with the winners engraved until 1974, the last year he won the race. At the Tour, he sits just behind Mark Cavendish for the record of the most stage wins in a career, Merckx&#x27;s thirty-four to Cavendish&#x27;s thirty-five. The &quot;Grand Départ&quot; for the 2019 Tour de France was held in Brussels, Belgium to honor Merckx&#x27;s first Tour de France win in 1969.

He was given the nickname &quot;The Cannibal&quot; by the daughter of Christian Raymond, a teammate of Merckx&#x27;s. Raymond had commented on Merckx not allowing anyone else to win, to which his daughter referred to Merckx as a cannibal. Raymond liked the nickname and then mentioned it to the press. In Italy, he was known as &quot;il mostro&quot; (&quot;the Monster&quot;).

Dutch cyclist Joop Zoetemelk said &quot;First there was Merckx, and then another classification began behind him.&quot; Cycling journalist and commentator Phil Liggett wrote that if Merckx started a race, many riders acknowledged that they likely would be competing for second place. Ted Costantino wrote that Merckx was undoubtedly the number one cyclist of all time, whereas in other sports there are debates that go on about who is actually the greatest of all time. Gianni Motta told of how Merckx would ride without a racing cape when it was snowing or raining in order to go faster than other riders. Even after his retirement, many subsequent stars still feel overshadowed by his fame and race results. Merckx befriended Fiorenzo Magni when he began racing for an Italian team. He was criticized by opposing riders for his relentless pursuit of victory that prevented even lesser known riders from collecting a few victories. When told that he won too much, Merckx stated that &quot;The day when I start a race without intending to win it, I won&#x27;t be able to look at myself in the mirror.&quot;

===== World hour record =====
== Doping ==

Merckx was leading the 1969 Giro d&#x27;Italia after the sixteenth stage in Savona. After the stage, he went to the mobile lab that travelled with the race and conducted drug tests. His first test was positive for fencamfamine, an amphetamine, and a second test was also positive. The results of the test were announced to the press before Merckx and his team were informed. The positive test meant Merckx was to be suspended for a month. Race director Vincenzo Torriani delayed the start of the seventeenth stage in an attempt to persuade the president of the Italian Cycling Federation to allow Merckx to begin the stage. However, the president was not in his office and Torriani was forced to start the stage, disqualifying Merckx in the process. In the following days, the UCI removed the suspension.

From the start, Merckx claimed his innocence saying that &quot;I am a clean rider, I do not need to take anything to win.&quot; He had previously tested negative eight times during the race. The majority of the international press believed in his innocence, stating that with his lead, it was illogical that he would use banned substances on an easy stage, with a doping test certain to follow if he was still the leader. He argued that his samples had been mishandled. After the incident, several conspiracy theories emerged, including that the urine that tested positive was not Merckx&#x27;s, and that he had been given a water bottle with the stimulant in it⁠ostensibly all moves to give Italian Felice Gimondi a better chance at victory.

On 8 November 1973, it was announced that Merckx had tested positive for norephedrine after winning the Giro di Lombardia a month earlier. Upon learning of the first test being positive in later October, he had a counter-analysis performed which was also positive. The drug was present in a cough medicine that the Molteni doctor, Dr. Cavalli, prescribed to him. Merckx was disqualified from the race and the victory was awarded to second-place finisher Gimondi. In addition, Merckx was given a month&#x27;s suspension and fined 150,000 lira. He admitted his fault in taking the medicine but said that the name norephedrine was not on the bottle of cough syrup he used. Norephedrine was later removed from the WADA-list of banned substances.

On 8 May 1977, Merckx, along with several other riders, tested positive for the stimulant pemoline at La Flèche Wallonne. The group of riders was charged by the Belgian cycling federation, and were each given a 24,000 pesetas fine and a one-month suspension. Initially, Merckx announced his intention to appeal the penalty, saying he only took substances that were not on the banned list. His eighth-place finish in the race was voided. Years later, Merckx said he did take a banned substance, citing that he was wrong to have trusted a doctor.

Due to Merckx&#x27;s positive tests during his career, he was one of several riders asked by the event organizers to stay away from the 2007 UCI Road World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. The organizers stated that had to be role models&quot;, while Merckx wrote them off, claiming they were crazy.

<text>William Barclay (1546–1608) was a Scottish jurist.

==Life==

Barclay was born in Aberdeenshire in 1546. Educated at the University of Aberdeen, he went to France by 1572, and studied law at the University of Bourges, where he took his doctor&#x27;s degree. Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, appointed him professor of civil law in the newly founded university of Pont-à-Mousson, and also made him Counsellor of State and master of requests. Here, he was colleague to the French jurist Pierre Grégoire, with whom he entered into a dispute with the Jesuit faction in the university. In 1603 he was obliged to leave France, having incurred the enmity of the Jesuits, through his opposition to their proposal to admit his son John a member of their society.

Arriving in England, Barclay was offered considerable preferment by James VI on condition of becoming a member of the Church of England. This offer he refused, and he returned to France in 1604, when he was appointed professor of civil law in the university of Angers. He died at Angers in 1608.

==Works==

William Barclay’s principal work was &quot;De Regno et Regali Potestate&quot; (1600), a strenuous defence of the rights of kings, in which he refutes the doctrines of those he terms monarchomachs: George Buchanan, &quot;Junius Brutus&quot; (Hubert Languet or Philippe de Mornay) and Jean Boucher, a leading member of the French Catholic League; he also wrote &quot;De potestate papae: an &amp; quatenus in reges &amp; principes seculares jus &amp; imperium habeat&quot; (published in 1609, after his death), in opposition to the usurpation of temporal powers by the pope, which called forth the celebrated reply of Cardinal Bellarmine; also commentaries on some of the titles of the &quot;Pandects&quot;.

<doc id="152080" wikidata="Q4376871" url="?curid=152080" title="Praise-God Barebone">
<text>Praise-God Barebone (sometimes spelled Barbon) () was an English leather-seller, preacher, and Fifth Monarchist. He is best known for giving his name to the Barebone&#x27;s Parliament of the English Commonwealth of 1653.

==Early life==
Little is known of Barebone&#x27;s early life. Writing in 2001, Nicholas Tyacke speculated that he may have been the son of John Barebone, rector of Charwelton in Northamptonshire, by his marriage to Mary Roper of Daventry, and that he may have had an older brother called Fear-God (a minor poet) but this possibility lacks supporting evidence because the Charwelton parish register for that period has been lost.

The first that is known about him is that he became a freeman of the Leathersellers&#x27; Company in January 1623, having served an eight- or nine-year apprenticeship. He was elected a warden of the yeomanry of the leather-sellers in 1630, and a liveryman in 1634. In 1630 he married his wife Sarah, with whom he later had at least one son, Nicholas Barbon, an economist known as the father of fire insurance.

There is some confusion over the use of the hortatory name &#x27;Unless-Jesus-Christ-Had-Died-For-Thee-Thou-Hadst-Been-Damned&#x27; in the Barebone family. One source claims this was Praise-God&#x27;s baptismal name; others claim this was his brother&#x27;s name; and more modern sources claim a variant on this name was given to his son Nicholas.

==Religion==
By 1632, Barebone had joined the semi-separatist congregation founded in 1616 by Henry Jacob, later to be led by John Lothropp and then, from 1637, by Henry Jessey. By December 1641 he had begun preaching to audiences at his premises at the Lock and Key, at the lower end of Fleet Street near Fetter Lane. On 19 December of that year, his sermon against bishops and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; attracted hostile attention from apprentices, who smashed the premises&#x27; windows.

Some of Barebone&#x27;s congregation were taken to the Bridewell prison, others to the Counters, and still others made their escape over the roof-tops, while the crowd was left to destroy his shop-sign.

The following month more than fifty people, including many members or former members of Jessey&#x27;s church, were rebaptised by immersion, in London. Barebone strongly disagreed with these advocates of believers&#x27; baptism, and within a few weeks he issued &quot;A Discourse Tending to Prove the Baptism ... to be the Ordinance of Jesus Christ&quot;. The claim that Barebone himself was an Anabaptist is likely to derive from post-Restoration critics. A second work, &quot;A Reply to the Frivolous and Impertinent Answer of RB&quot;, was published in the spring of 1643. In the next few years Barebone was involved in conflicts with those who controlled the vestry of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and with Francis Kemp, the lawyer who acted for them. Barebone later joined the sect known as the Fifth Monarchists, known for their millenarianism.

==Appointment to the Nominated Assembly==
In July 1653 Barebone was appointed to sit as a representative of the City of London in the Nominated Assembly, a body set up after the expulsion of the Rump Parliament by Oliver Cromwell. The Assembly, whose members were chosen by Cromwell and the Army Council instead of being elected, soon became known as Barebone&#x27;s Parliament to its many critics, Barebone proving a likely target due to his name and his apparently humble origins.

Barebone, who was never chosen to sit in the Assembly&#x27;s Council of State, was an active member. He sat on a committee on tithes set up on 19 July 1653, and he was also one of the first members of the committee established on 19 August to consider law reform. In late July he was tasked with placating large numbers of women who were demonstrating at Westminster in support of John Lilburne.

==Later career==
Barebone was elected to the Common Council of the City of London for the year 1657 and re-elected until 1660. After the restoration of the Rump Parliament, he was nominated to the London militia committee under the Act of 7 July 1659. In 1660, Barebone endeavoured to prevent the Restoration of the English monarchy. He published Marchamont Needham&#x27;s book &quot;News from Brussels in a Letter from a Near Attendant on His Majesty&#x27;s Person...&quot;, which related unfavourable anecdotes about the prospective king of England, Charles II. Along with other &quot;well-affected citizens&quot; in London, he also presented an address to the Rump Parliament in February 1660 urging that they &quot;use all possible Endeavours to prevent the Commonwealth&#x27;s Adversaries in this their most dangerous Stratagem&quot; and subsequently received the thanks of the House.

When the same Parliament had its secluded members of 1648 readmitted, paving the way for the Restoration, celebratory bonfires were lit in London by young apprentices, and Barebone &quot;had but little thanks of the boyes, for they broke all his glass windows that belonged to the front of his house&quot;. In July 1660, following the Restoration, a royalist tract called &quot;The Picture of the Good Old Cause Drawn to the Life&quot; reprinted a petition he had made in February calling for Members of Parliament to deny rule by Charles II or any other single person.

As a result of these views, he was arrested on 25 November 1661 and charged with treason alongside James Harrington and Samuel Moyer. He was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was freed on 27 July 1662 after a petition from his wife pleading his illness. In 1666, his premises were one of the most westerly buildings to be engulfed in the Great Fire of London.
Barebone died at the end of 1679 and was buried on 5 January 1680 in the parish of St Andrew Holborn.

==Works==
*&quot;A Discourse tending to prove ... Baptism ... to be the ordinance of Jesus Christ. As also that the Baptism of Infants is warentable&quot;. 1642. The preface indicates Barebone&#x27;s religious tolerance.
*&quot;A Reply to the Frivolous and Impertinent answer of R.B. and E.B. to the Discourse of P.B.&quot;. 1643. 
*&quot;Good Things to Come&quot;. 1675. In this Barebone looked forward to the imminent arrival of Jesus Christ: &quot;his kingdom and reign shall be outward, and visible on earth... when he shall come the second time, in power and great glory&quot; (p. 10).

==Family==
His eldest son was the economist Nicholas Barbon.

<text>Royal Prussia (; or , ) or Polish Prussia (Polish: ; German: ) became a province of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, which was annexed following the imposed Second Peace of Toruń (1466) from territory in Pomerelia and western Prussia which had been part of the State of the Teutonic Order. Royal Prussia retained its autonomy, governing itself and maintaining its own laws, customs, rights and German language for the Germans (mainly in urban areas) and Polish language for the Polish (mainly in rural areas).

In 1569, Royal Prussia was fully integrated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and its autonomy was largely abolished. As a result, the Royal Prussian parliament was incorporated into the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1772 and 1793, after the first and second partition of Poland, the former territory of Royal Prussia was recovered by the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently re-organized into the province of West Prussia. This occurred at the time of the First Partition of Poland, with other parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth being annexed by the Russian Empire and Habsburg Austria.

==Geography==

The area consisted of the following territories: 
*Pomerelia

In contrast, southern remainder of Pomesania and Pogesania, including Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), Deutsch Eylau (Iława), Riesenburg (Prabuty), Rosenberg (Susz), Bischofswerder (Biskupiec), Saalfeld (Zełwałd, later Zalewo), Freystadt (Kisielice), Mohrungen (Morąg), Preußisch Holland (Pasłęk) and Liebstadt (Libsztat, later Miłakowo), formed Upper Prussia (German: , Polish: ) constituting the westernmost part of the Prussian territory left to the Teutonic Knights, known as Teutonic or Monastic Prussia with Königsberg as its capital, later secularized in 1525 to become Ducal Prussia ruled by the Protestant dukes of the Hohenzollern dynasty. From 1618 this area was ruled in personal union with the Electorate of Brandenburg as Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1657 the Treaty of Wehlau granted full independence to the Duchy of Prussia, allowing its later elevation to Kingdom in Prussia.

==History==
=== Prussian Confederation ===
The independent Duchy of Pomerelia is mentioned in 1227. It was, however, invaded by Poland by 1282, but retained some autonomy. During the rule of Władysław I the Elbow-high of Poland, the Margraviate of Brandenburg challenged his rule over the territory in 1308, leading Władysław to request assistance from the Teutonic Knights, who ousted the Brandenburgers, but then seized Pomerelia for themselves and incorporated it into the Teutonic Order state in 1309 (Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Treaty of Soldin (Myślibórz)). The papal court in 1320 and 1333 ruled in favour of Poland, however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the region. At the beginning of the 15th century, the lands held by the Teutonic Knights were inhabited as a whole by a mixed population; it is estimated that there were about 200 000 Germans in the state altogether, followed by 140 000 native Prussians located in the Prussia proper (east of Vistula), as well about 140 000 Poles in Pomerelia and Masuria.

The burden of taxation and the arbitrary way of governing caused resistance among the people of Prussia. The burghers of the great Prussian cities began to organize themselves. The first organized body was the Lizard League founded by the Chelmno Land nobility in 1397. After being defeated at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the Teutonic Knights&#x27;s prestige declined, most towns and castles, as well as three Prussian bishops, swore loyalty to the Polish king. Although the Order soon regained control over most of its territory, by the 1411 Peace of Thorn they were forced to pay large compensation of 100,000 kop groszy for the return of prisoners, which became a financial burden on the citizenry. Facing the opposition the komtur of Danzig ordered to execute the city&#x27;s mayor Konrad Letzkau along with two councillors and five Chełmno nobles without a trial.

In order to protect their rights nobles and burghers created for the first time a joint assembly in 1412. Subsequent peace treaties (1422 and 1435) with Poland gave the Order&#x27;s subjects the right to throw off its sovereignty if it violated them. In 1440, as the tax burden rose, the nobles and various cities established the Prussian Confederation at Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) in resistance of the Order&#x27;s domestic and financial policies. Confederation formed a self-governing bicameral institution, representing nobles and burghers of the province, which took decisions unanimously. Many further nobles and cities and towns soon joined the organization.
The Confederation was led by the citizens of Danzig, Elbing, and Thorn. The gentry from Chełmno Land and Pomerelia participated as well. After the monastic knights complained to the Emperor and Council of Basel, the Prussian parliament had to dissolve itself in 1449, but immediately resumed its clandestine activities. In turn, in February 1454, the Confederation sent a delegation, under Jan Bażyński, to King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland, to ask him for support against the Teutonic Order&#x27;s rule and for incorporation of their homeland into the Kingdom of Poland. In this treaty, Prussian delegates declared the Polish king the only true sovereign of their lands, justified by the historical fact that the king of Poland had earlier ruled them. After lengthy negotiation, on 6 March 1454, the Royal Chancellery issued the &quot;Incorporation Act&quot; by which king Kazimierz Jagiellończyk accepted inhabitants of the Prussian lands as subjects, incorporated Prussia to the Polish kingdom and granted them a large autonomy. 
The Prussian estates received confirmation of their rights and privileges, were exempted from paying the &quot;&quot;, received the &quot;ius indigenatus&quot;, the right to decide on Prussian affairs at their own estate assemblies and a guarantee of the freedom of trade. Thorn, Elbing, Königsberg and Danzig (Danzig law) were to retain the right to mint coins during the war, although with the image of the Polish king.

=== Thirteen Years&#x27; War ===
After the Prussian Confederation pledged allegiance to Casimir on 6 March 1454, the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (&quot;War of the Cities&quot;) began. King Casimir IV Jagiellon appointed Bażyński as the first war-time governor of Royal Prussia. On 28 May 1454, the king took an oath of allegiance from the citizens of Chełmno Land, including Toruń (Thorn) in Toruń, and in June a similar oath from the citizens of Elbląg (Elbing) and Królewiec (Königsberg) was taken.

The war also included major cities from the eastern part of the Order&#x27;s lands, such as Kneiphof, later a part of Königsberg. Though the Knights were victorious at the Battle of Chojnice in 1454, they were not able to finance more knights in order to reconquer the castles occupied by the insurgents. Thirteen years of attrition warfare ended in October 1466 with the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), which provided for the Order&#x27;s cession to the Polish Crown of its rights over Pomerelia, and the western half of Prussia, including the districts of Elbląg and Malbork (Marienburg).

===Incorporation into the Polish Crown===

According to the 1454 treaty signed by King Casimir IV, Royal Prussia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland and their elites enjoyed the same rights and privileges as the elites of the Polish kingdom. At the same time Royal Prussia was granted a considerable degree of autonomy. Already instituted law codes were retained, only Prussians could be appointed on public offices (&quot;ius indigenatus&quot;), borders of the province had to remain intact and all decisions regarding Prussia had to be consulted with the Prussian council. Thorn and Danzig retained the right to mint coins.

The Polish model of political and administrative organisation was introduced into the province. Royal Prussia was divided in 1454 into four voivodeships: Pomeranian, Chełmno,
Elbląg (since 1467 Malbork) and Królewiec (Königsberg), which ceased to exist after the Second Peace of Thorn. Voivodeships were divided subsequently into powiats.

By the decision of the Polish Sejm in 1467 the main governing body of Royal Prussia was the Prussian council (), which emerged from the secret council of the Prussian Confederation. Three voivodes, three castellans (of Chełmno, Elbing and Danzig), three chamberlains () and two delegates from each of the main cities: Thorn, Danzig and Elbing were part of the council. Later bishops of Warmia (1479) and Chełmno (1482) were admitted into a council, which ultimately consisted of 17 members. Since the council wasn&#x27;t able to impose taxes without the consent of the commons, the gathering of all estates shortly emerged, at first known as &quot;Ständetage&quot; and later as &quot;Landtag&quot;. In years 1512-1526 it developed into a bicameral Prussian parliament.

At first, the bishop of Warmia claimed that his principality was independent and subordinate only to the Pope. After a short war — the so-called &quot;priests&#x27; war&quot; — the matter was settled in the king&#x27;s favour; in 1479 Warmia was formally incorporated into Poland. The bishop&#x27;s subjects were given the right to appeal to the king, to whom they swore allegiance. The Bishop of Warmia became, &quot;ex officio&quot;, a member of the Prussian council. From 1508 the bishop headed the council. The bishopric of Warmia was a suffragan of the archbishopric of Riga until 1566; after that date it was subordinated directly to the Pope. It was not part of archdiocese of Gniezno.

The Prussian states stood for deep particularism. They were reluctant to participate in the institutions of the kingdom. The members of the council refused to participate in the meetings of the royal council and sent only token delegations to the royal elections in 1492, 1501 and 1506. During the war the king exercised his authority over the province through the position of governor, which was first held by Jan Bażyński, and after his death in 1459 by his brother Stibor. As the governor was elected by the estates and only approved by the king, Casimir abolished this office and appointed Stibor as voivode of Malbork. In 1472, the king introduced in Prussia the office of , who was solely dependent on the king. Son of Stibor Nicholaus was appointed voivode of Malbork and administrator of Prussia. In 1485 Nicholaus resigned his office and led the Prussian opposition against the violation of Prussian privileges, above all the &quot;ius indigenatus&quot;. In response, King Casimir strengthened the position of the Malbork starosta, to whom he always appointed a non-Prussian. In 1485 it was a magnate from Lesser Poland, Zbigniew Tęczyński.
The situation changed in 1498 when Frederick of Saxony was elected Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and started a hostile politics against Poland in an attempt to reclaim lost territories in Royal Prussia. As a result, the newly elected bishop of Warmia, Lucas Watzenrode, and Nicholaus von Baysen began to take part in meetings of the royal council. During 1509 Sejm Watzenrode took part in a Senate meeting as the first representative of the Prussian council. Ambroży Pampowski, starosta of Malbork between 1504 and 1510, also bore the title &quot;Haupt des Landes&quot;, and although he was non-Prussian, he was accepted as such by the Prussian council. A monument of the reapprochement between Prussia and the rest of the kingdom was the Statute of Prussia, promulgated in 1506, in which many Polish legal solutions were introduced into the Prussian legal system. An important achievement was the establishment of a central Prussian treasury. In 1511, a supreme tribunal was established for the Prussian courts, excluding the courts of Danzig, which denied the right of appeal to the Prussian court and decided cases internally. It sometimes resorted to royal and parliamentary courts. Closer ties with the rest of the kingdom found support primarily among the ordinary nobility, for whom the Polish political and legal solutions were more favourable. In particular, the inheritance rules applied under Kulm law, which guaranteed inheritance also in the female line, resulted in the fragmentation of estates.

In years 1519-1521 Albrecht von Hohenzollern lost the Order&#x27;s last war against Poland. As a result Order&#x27;s state was secularised and became a fief of the Polish crown, held by Albrecht and his direct heirs as &quot;dukes in Prussia&quot;. Albrecht ruled as a Lutheran ruler. Lutheranism also spread in Royal Prussia, especially in the big cities. Albrecht decreed that Luther&#x27;s Catechism was to be translated into the Old Prussian language, Polish, and Lithuanian, so that the creed could unite the people of both the Duchy of Prussia and Royal Prussia. Cultural unity between the two parts of Prussian was threatened by the Polish strive to unite Royal Prussia with Poland proper. The Polish king attempted to stop spread of Protestantism, but it was declared the ruling religion in Danzig, Elbing and Thorn (Gdańsk, Elbląg, Toruń) after 1526 (of course, part of the population remained Catholic in these cities). 
During the war, the Polish General Assembly descended to Toruń in 1519 and to Bydgoszcz in 1520. Some Prussian nobles attended it. In 1522 the Prussian nobility gathered in the &quot;Landtag&quot; demanded the introduction of the Polish model of inheritance and land ownership, excluding the burghers. They also demanded the right to send one deputy from each province to the Polish Sejm. In 1526 the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot;, headed by the king, established sejmiks, local assemblies of noblemen, who elected deputies to the Prussian parliament, where they sat together with representatives of 27 smaller towns. The Prussian council formed the upper house – the senate – of this assembly. In 1529 a monetary union was established between Royal Prussia and Ducal Prussia and the rest of the kingdom. From 1537 summons to the Sejm were continuously sent to the Prussian sejmiks. The Prussian nobility appeared permanently at the Sejm as observers. In 1548, after the death of King Sigismund the Old, for the first time, a delegation of both Prussian chambers went to the Sejm as deputies and senators.

===Integration into the Kingdom of Poland===

In 1569, as a result of the Union of Lublin, which created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Royal Prussia was integrated fully into the Kingdom of Poland, and its parliament reduced to the status of a provincial assembly, also other separate Prussian institutions were dissolved. Before the conclusion of the Union of Lublin, the Polish chancellor openly admitted that this act breached law by violation of the privileges granted in 1454.

The former territory was subsequently governed as Pomeranian Voivodeship, Chełmno Voivodeship, Malbork Voivodeship, and Prince-Bishopric of Warmia.

===Partitions===
At the same time as the 1772 and 1793 (first and second partition of Poland), the former lands of Royal Prussia were annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, the successor state of the Teutonic Order.

===Governors===
* 1454–1459: Jan Bażyński, war-time governor
* 1459–1480: Stibor von Baysen
* 1480: Niklas von Baysen, who was only elected; he refused to swear allegiance to the king. He was also Voivode of Malbork.
In 1510, after several attempts to install another governor, the office was abolished.

<text>Dexys (known as Dexys Midnight Runners from 1978 to 2011) are an English pop rock band from Birmingham, with soul influences, who achieved major commercial success in the early to mid- 1980s. They are best known in the UK for their songs &quot;Geno&quot; and &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, both of which reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and achieved six other top-20 singles. &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and, with extensive airplay on MTV, they are associated with the Second British Invasion.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dexys went through numerous personnel changes over the course of three albums and 13 singles, with only singer/songwriter/co-founder Kevin Rowland remaining in the band through all of the transitions and only Rowland and &quot;Big&quot; Jim Paterson (trombone) appearing on all the albums. By 1985, the band consisted only of Rowland and long-standing members Helen O&#x27;Hara (violin) and Billy Adams (guitar). The band broke up in 1987, with Rowland becoming a solo artist. After two failed restart attempts, Dexys was reformed by Rowland in 2003 with new members, as well as a few returning members from the band&#x27;s original lineup (known as Dexys Mark I). Dexys released their fourth album in 2012 and a fifth followed in 2016.

==History==

===Dexys Mark I: 1978–1980===
==== Foundation and first single ====
Dexys Midnight Runners were founded in 1978 in Birmingham, England, by Kevin Rowland (vocals, guitar, at the time using the pseudonym Carlo Rolan) and Kevin &quot;Al&quot; Archer (vocals, guitar). Both had been in the short-lived punk band the Killjoys. Rowland had previously written a Northern soul-style song that the two of them sang, &quot;Tell Me When My Light Turns Green&quot;, which became the first Dexys &quot;song&quot;. The band&#x27;s name was derived from Dexedrine, a brand of dextroamphetamine used as a recreational drug among Northern soul fans to give them energy to dance all night. While recruiting members for the new band, Rowland noted that &quot;Anyone joining Dexys had to give up their job and rehearse all day long ... We had nothing to lose and felt that what we were doing was everything.&quot; &quot;Big&quot; Jim Paterson (trombone), Geoff &quot;JB&quot; Blythe (saxophone, previously of Geno Washington&#x27;s Ram Jam Band), Steve &quot;Babyface&quot; Spooner (alto saxophone), Pete Saunders (keyboard), Pete Williams (bass) and John Jay (drums) formed the first lineup of the band, which began playing live at the end of 1978.

By the middle of 1979, Bobby &quot;Jnr&quot; Ward had replaced Jay on drums. Clash manager Bernard Rhodes then signed them and sent them into the studio to record a Rowland-penned single, &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, which Rhodes renamed &quot;Dance Stance&quot;. In response to Rhodes&#x27; criticism of Rowland&#x27;s singing style, Rowland developed a &quot;more emotional&quot; sound influenced by General Norman Johnson of the Holland–Dozier–Holland band Chairmen of the Board and the theatricality of Bryan Ferry.

After a series of dates opening for the Specials, who wore suits on stage, Rowland decided that his band needed its own distinct look. Borrowing from an outfit that Paterson had worn to rehearsals, Dexys subsequently dressed in donkey jackets or leather coats and woolly hats, a look described as &quot;straight out of De Niro&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;&quot;. In January 1980, Rowland said of the band&#x27;s sound and look, &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to become part of anyone else&#x27;s movement. We&#x27;d rather be our own movement&quot;. Image became very important to the group: Rowland said, &quot;We wanted to be a group that looked like something ... a formed group, a project, not just random.&quot;

&quot;Dance Stance&quot;, which Rhodes produced, was released on Oddball Records, which Rhodes owned, and which was distributed by EMI. Although it was named &quot;single of the week&quot; by &quot;Sounds&quot;, it stalled at number 40 in the British charts, which EMI and Rowland believed was due to Rhodes&#x27; poor production. Rowland said, &quot;We learned that early on, that the wrong producer can totally screw your record up.&quot; As a result, Dexys fired Rhodes and signed with EMI, and EMI immediately put Pete Wingfield in charge of their production. Saunders and Ward left the band, replaced by Andy Leek (keyboards) and Andy &quot;Stoker&quot; Growcott (drums).

====&quot;Searching for the Young Soul Rebels&quot; and first band split====
Building on the unexpected success of &quot;Dance Stance&quot; (aka &quot;Burn It Down&quot;), Dexys&#x27; next single, &quot;Geno&quot; – about Geno Washington – became a British Number One in 1980. It featured the band&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Feelings&quot; imprint on the single, which became a trademark of the band&#x27;s records on EMI. Rowland wrote about Washington as he had seen one of his performances aged 11 with his brother. The success of the song prompted Washington to make a return to live performance, but it also prompted the departure of Leek, who said he didn&#x27;t want to be famous. Pete Saunders returned to the band temporarily, replacing Leek, to record their debut album.

Dexys&#x27; debut LP, &quot;Searching for the Young Soul Rebels&quot;, which featured &quot;Geno&quot;, was released in July 1980. The label of the album also included the band&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Feelings&quot; imprint, and the album&#x27;s sleeve featured a photograph of a Belfast Catholic boy carrying his belongings after moving from his home during the Troubles; the Irish-descended Rowland explained that &quot;I wanted a picture of unrest. It could have been from anywhere but I was secretly glad that it was from Ireland.&quot; Of the album&#x27;s title, Rowland said &quot;I don&#x27;t know ... I just liked the sound of it, really.&quot; Of the songs on the album, only two (&quot;Geno&quot; and &quot;There, There, My Dear&quot;) were written by Rowland (lyrics) and Archer (music) together; producer Pete Wingfield hadn&#x27;t liked Rowland&#x27;s lyrics on their third co-composition (&quot;Keep It&quot;) and had instead turned those lyrics into a separate song (&quot;Love Part One&quot;); Blythe wrote new lyrics for the version of &quot;Keep It&quot; on the album. The same month, Rowland imposed a press embargo on the band; instead, Dexys would take out ads in the music papers explaining the band&#x27;s position on various issues. This was a response to some less than complimentary opinions from some music press writers; for example, the &quot;NME&#x27;s&quot; Mark Cordery accused the band of &quot;emotional fascism&quot; and described their music as a perversion of soul music with &quot;no tenderness, no sex, no wit, no laughter&quot;.

After the album, Saunders was replaced by Mick Talbot (ex-The Merton Parkas) on keyboards. &quot;There, There, My Dear&quot; became the band&#x27;s second top-10 single. However, after a couple of months of touring, Rowland insisted on writing new lyrics to Archer&#x27;s music for &quot;Keep It&quot; for release as the band&#x27;s next single, despite EMI&#x27;s objections. The single, called &quot;Keep It Part Two (Inferiority Part One)&quot;, was a failure, and five of the band members then quit, angered over continual personality problems with Rowland, as well as Rowland&#x27;s policy of not speaking to the music press. Archer and Paterson both remained with Rowland at first, but then Archer also decided to leave, which reduced Dexys to just Rowland and Paterson, whom Rowland referred to as &quot;the Celtic soul brothers&quot; (in reference to Paterson&#x27;s Scottish background and Rowland&#x27;s Irish background).

Archer (and Leek) eventually formed The Blue Ox Babes, while the other departing members—Blythe, Spooner, Williams, &quot;Stoker&quot;, and Talbot—formed The Bureau, which Wingfield continued to produce.

===Dexys Mark II: 1981–1982===
====&quot;The Projected Passion Revue&quot;====
Rowland and Paterson first chose to write several new songs, so that Dexys could move forward from the split. They then brought in an old friend of theirs, Kevin &quot;Billy&quot; Adams (guitar/banjo), along with Seb Shelton (drums, formerly of Secret Affair), Mickey Billingham (keyboard), Brian Maurice Brummitt (who dropped his last name for his stage name &quot;Brian Maurice&quot;, alto saxophone), Paul Speare (tenor saxophone) and Steve Wynne (bass). This new lineup also adopted a new look that included hooded tops, boxing boots, and pony tails. Along with the new image, Rowland brought in a fitness regime, which included working out together and running as a group, Rowland commenting &quot;The togetherness of running along together just gets ... that fighting spirit going&quot;. The group would also take part in group exercise sessions before performances, and drinking before shows was strictly forbidden.

By the time the new band&#x27;s first single &quot;Plan B&quot;, produced by Alan Shacklock instead of Wingfield, was released in March 1981, the band&#x27;s management had discovered that EMI had failed to pick up a mandatory contract option, so Dexys were technically no longer under contract. They asked, without success, that EMI not release the single; without promotion, the single flopped. Later in March 1981, an ad appeared in which Rowland stated that the previous members of the band had &quot;hatched a plot to throw Kevin out and still carry on under the same name&quot;. It also cited Rowland&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;they might learn new instruments&quot; as a reason for their displeasure. The ad announced that Dexys had been working on a new live venture, &quot;The Midnight Runners Projected Passion Revue&quot;.

In April, Dexys prevailed to win their release from EMI, although without the financial support of a label, they were unable to mount the spring tour that had planned and had to settle for playing only five dates, including one recorded by BBC Radio 1. In June they signed to Mercury Records, where Dexys remained until their 1987 breakup. Dexys&#x27; first single for Mercury, &quot;Show Me&quot;, produced by Tony Visconti, was released in July 1981 and reached No. 16 in the UK. The label switch was followed by a session for Richard Skinner&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show in which the band previewed tracks that would be reworked later on &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot;. Wynne was sacked by the group at this point, to be replaced by Mick Gallick (whom Rowland gave the stage name &quot;Giorgio Kilkenny&quot;) on bass. Music journalist Paolo Hewitt commented about this version of Dexys: &quot;Dexys wouldn&#x27;t make a record unless they thought it was great. And they wouldn&#x27;t play a gig unless they thought they were gonna be great.&quot;

Around this time, Archer played Rowland demos of Archer&#x27;s new group, The Blue Ox Babes, which featured, in Rowland&#x27;s words, &quot;a Tamla-style beat with violins&quot;. The violins had been played by a Birmingham School of Music classical violin student named Helen Bevington. Rowland&#x27;s first idea was to get the horn players to also play strings, as he had discussed in the March interview (with Speare on viola, which he already played, and string novices Paterson and Maurice on cello), and the horn players (with session musician support) contributed strings to the third single with the new lineup, &quot;Liars A to E&quot;, produced by Neil Kernon, which was released in October 1981. In November, the group played a three-night stand at The Old Vic in London, with the horn section again doubling on strings. The Old Vic shows attracted unexpectedly rave reviews in the press, although these concerts were not recorded. Rowland said of these shows, &quot;Those three nights at the Old Vic were all I wanted to say in &#x27;81.&quot;

Dexys&#x27; 1981 recordings, including all three singles (both A-sides and B-sides) as well as the tracks from the two BBC Radio 1 appearances, were released by Dexys on CD in 2007 as &quot;The Projected Passion Revue&quot;.

====&quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot;, stardom, and turnover====

As Dexys prepared to record their first album for Mercury, Rowland decided that he needed more proficient string players to achieve the sound he envisioned. He sent Speare to invite Bevington to join Dexys, which she agreed to do, and Rowland gave her the Irish-sounding stage name of Helen O&#x27;Hara. Rowland also asked her to recruit two other violinists; she brought fellow students Steve Shaw and Roger Huckle, whom Rowland renamed as Steve Brennan and Roger MacDuff, and Rowland named the violin section &quot;The Emerald Express&quot;. However, the need to rearrange all the songs for both strings and horns left the brass section of Paterson and Maurice (and to a lesser extent Speare) feeling that their role in the band had diminished. Thus, just prior to the recording sessions, Paterson and Maurice quit. Rowland was able to persuade them to remain in Dexys long enough to record the next album . Shortly thereafter, Speare also joined their planned departure.

This fractured line-up recorded &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; in early 1982 with producers Rowland, Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. The album featured a hybrid of soul and Celtic folk, similar to Archer&#x27;s new direction. All of the post-breakup singles and the &quot;Projected Passion Revue&quot; material were re-arranged and re-recorded with the new lineup. The new sound was accompanied by the band&#x27;s third new look, with the band attired in dungarees, scarves, leather waistcoats, and what was described as &quot;a generally scruffy right-off-the-farm look&quot;, or &quot;a raggle-taggle mixture of gypsy, rural Irish and Steinbeck Okie&quot;. Rowland jokingly said of the new image: &quot;These are my best clothes. Again it just feels right for the music. Everybody else is dressing up sort of straight-laced and pretty down-to-earth and we come in wearing these and it&#x27;s like, y&#x27;know here we are, a bit of hoedowning is even possible&quot;.

The first single, &quot;The Celtic Soul Brothers&quot; (cowritten by Rowland and Paterson with Mickey Billingham), which was released before the album, only reached number 45 on the UK charts. After the failure of this single, O&#x27;Hara said that the band believed that they immediately needed a hit single to survive. To help create momentum, the band performed a live BBC Radio 1 concert in Newcastle on 6 June 1982, which was the last appearance of the horn section of Paterson, Maurice, and Speare with Dexys.

Released right after the live appearance, Dexys&#x27; follow-up single, &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; (cowritten by Rowland and Paterson with Billy Adams), became that much-needed hit – a Number One hit in the UK, which also became Dexys&#x27; first single released in the United States (and second in North America, after &quot;Seven Days Too Long&quot;, which was only released in Canada) – where it peaked at #1 in April 1983 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The third UK single from the album, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot;, also reached the top 5 in the UK singles chart. The band sang this song on the UK comedy &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. When the band performed this single on the BBC TV music show &quot;Top of the Pops,&quot; instead of a picture of Jackie Wilson, the American soul singer, the band performed in front of a photo of Jocky Wilson, the Scottish darts player.

The horn section became known as the TKO Horns and continued working with &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; producers Langer and Winstanley, just as The Bureau and The Blue Ox Babes had continued working with Pete Wingfield. To replace them, Dexys added saxophonist Nick Gatfield and used various session musicians, including Kevin Gilson (saxophone) and Mark Walters and Spike Edney (trombone). Soon thereafter, Billingham also left the band but continued to appear with Dexys on a session basis until the end of the year, when he joined General Public.

===Dexys Mark III: 1982–1987===
====Touring and more turnover====
With Paterson and Billingham&#x27;s departures, the core of Dexys became Rowland, Adams, and O&#x27;Hara. In September, touring behind the hit album, Dexys embarked on &quot;The Bridge&quot; tour. On 10 October 1982, the Dexys performance at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London was recorded by Steve Barron and then released on videodisk and videocassette (and later DVD) as an edited 9-song set also entitled &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

Rowland, Adams and O&#x27;Hara jointly wrote the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get This Straight (From the Start)&quot; (with O&#x27;Hara also contributing piano on the recording along with Billingham). At the start of 1983, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Noble replaced Billingham on keyboards and Kilkenny was replaced by John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards on bass. Dexys finally toured the U.S. in 1983, and continued to tour through that summer. However, the major success of &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; became a problem for Rowland, who said in 1999 that &quot;I was fairly comfortable being the outsider knocking on the door [but] once the door opened and I stepped inside, I was completely lost&quot; and that he went into &quot;complete self-destruct mode&quot;. Rowland and O&#x27;Hara also began a personal relationship during the U.S. tour; in Rowland&#x27;s words, he was &quot;obsessed with her but not enjoying the band&quot;.

====&quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot; and break-up====
Although Dexys began preparing material for a new album in late 1983, once the touring stopped, the band was reduced to a nucleus of Rowland, Adams, O&#x27;Hara and Gatfield. Rowland wanted to explore different songwriting, and Dexys Midnight Runners began recording more &quot;introspective, mournful&quot; music. Recording and mixing the new album took almost two years and spread across Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S; at various times, Tom Dowd, Jimmy Miller, and John Porter were attached as producers. Some seasoned performers, ex-Dexys members, and session musicians made up the rest of the band, including Vincent Crane (ex-Atomic Rooster) on piano, Julian Littman on mandolin, Tim Dancy (who had been Al Green&#x27;s drummer) on drums, Tommy Evans on steel guitar, and former Dexys members &quot;Big&quot; Jim Paterson on trombone, Robert Noble on organ and synthesizer, and John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards on bass. Near the end of these sessions, Rowland and O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s personal relationship broke up, although they continued to work together.

In September 1985, Dexys released their first new album in three years, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;. Production was originally credited to Alan Winstanley and Rowland, although reissues also credit Adams and O&#x27;Hara. The four remaining members were pictured on the album cover in the band&#x27;s fourth look, an Ivy League, Brooks Brothers look, wearing ties and pin-striped suits (except for O&#x27;Hara, who wore a grey women&#x27;s business suit), and with neatly combed hair. Rowland described Dexys&#x27; new look as &quot;so clean and simple; it&#x27;s a much more adult approach now&quot;.

In an interview with HitQuarters Gatfield later described the recording process as &quot;very long and painful&quot;, and he left the group after a short tour of France and the UK. The album&#x27;s most controversial feature was its use of conversational dialogue in the songs; Rowland said, &quot;The idea of a conversation in a song is interesting to me.&quot; Commenting on this, O&#x27;Hara said that &quot;we had to keep going ahead with what we believed&quot; despite the length of time that the production took. Most contemporaneous reviewers strongly disliked this latest incarnation of Dexys, comparing the new look to &quot;double glazing salesmen&quot; and condemning the album as &quot;a mess&quot; and &quot;truly awful&quot;. Only a few reviewers were supportive; for example, writing in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Colin Irwin described it as &quot;quite the most challenging, absorbing, moving, uplifting and ultimately triumphant album of the year&quot;.

Rowland at first refused to issue any singles from the album, comparing Dexys to bands like Led Zeppelin that never released singles. By the time a 3-minute edit of the 12-minute &quot;This Is What She&#x27;s Like&quot; was released, it was too late to save the album from commercial failure, and the &quot;Coming to Town&quot; tour that followed the album was played before &quot;half-empty theaters&quot;. Rowland said, &quot;I felt that we couldn&#x27;t do anything better than [&quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;]. It took so much out of me, but the record company threw the towel in. I think they wanted to teach me a lesson.&quot; In the aftermath, Rowland started to have issues with drug abuse. However, Dexys returned to the U.K. charts in late 1986 with the single &quot;Because Of You&quot;, again written by and featuring the nucleus of Rowland, O&#x27;Hara and Adams (and which was used as the theme tune to a British sitcom, &quot;Brush Strokes&quot;). Dexys disbanded in early 1987.

===Rowland solo and failed Dexys reunions: 1987–2002===
Rowland became a solo singer with the release of 1988&#x27;s poorly received album, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Rowland suffered from financial problems, drug addiction and depression. Rowland said: &quot;I&#x27;d been too confident, too arrogant. I thought everyone would hear our new music and go: &#x27;Wow.&#x27;&quot; When he went to sign on for a jobseeker&#x27;s allowance, another unemployed person recognised him and sang &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;.

Dexys returned to the charts that year with the greatest-hits TV compilation &quot;The Very Best of Dexys Midnight Runners&quot;, which featured a number of songs that had never been released on CD, reached #12 on the charts, and was certified &quot;Gold&quot;. Consequently, Rowland &quot;spent most of my time in rehab&quot; in 1993 and 1994. As part of that, Rowland made plans to reform Dexys together with Big Jim Paterson and Billy Adams, although these plans resulted in little more than a solitary TV performance in 1993. Rowland then went on the dole; as he put it in 1999, &quot;Insanity is no fun, mate. People try to romanticize the idea of the suffering artist. At my lowest ebbs there was no romance to it at all.&quot;

After more treatment, Rowland returned once more as a solo performer and signed to Creation Records, although, in his words, &quot;every other record label advised [Creation] against it because I was trouble.&quot; In 1997, he released his first project on Creation: a remastered and reprocessed version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot; with extensive liner notes, revised credits and titles, and two extra songs, which helped contribute to a significant reversal of opinion with regard to the album, which was now increasingly being re-evaluated and recognized as an unfairly overlooked masterwork. Following this, in 1999 Rowland released a new solo album of interpretations of &quot;classic&quot; songs called &quot;My Beauty&quot;, which received virtually no publicity or radio airplay and sold poorly but attracted attention for Rowland&#x27;s cross-dressing cover attire. Rowland limited his pre-release publicity for the album to one interview, and he &quot;auditioned&quot; potential interviewers before selecting Jon Wilde. However, the negative reaction to &quot;My Beauty&quot; and the demise of Creation Records shortly after its release meant that Rowland&#x27;s planned follow-up album, which would have featured Dexys performing new material, was never made. The failure caused Rowland more problems; in his own words from 2003, &quot;Four years ago, I was nuts.&quot; Later, in March 2010, Rowland said that signing to Creation was &quot;definitely a mistake&quot;.

===Dexys Mark IV: 2003–present===
====Dexys reformed====
While recording two new songs, &quot;Manhood&quot; and &quot;My Life in England&quot; (both credited to Rowland, Paterson, and David Ditchfield) for a forthcoming Dexys greatest hits album, Rowland recruited Welsh classical violist (and studio musician) Lucy J. Morgan to play on the sessions along with original Dexys members Pete Williams as co-vocalist and &quot;MD&quot; Mick Talbot on keyboards, plus Paul Taylor on trombone and Neil Hubbard on guitar. Following the sessions, Rowland offered Morgan a permanent place in the group, and she accepted. With her addition, Rowland announced the reformation of Dexys in April 2003; he told Williams that his goal for the reformed band was to be true to the memory of Dexys but to &quot;take it somewhere else&quot;. The Dexys greatest hits album containing the new songs, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make This Precious: The Best of Dexys Midnight Runners&quot;, was released on EMI in September 2003, followed by a successful tour &#x27;to stop the burning&#x27; in October and November. The new songs on the album were touted as new singles, with Dexys even performing &quot;Manhood&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. However, despite promotional single releases for each by EMI and airplay on national radio, neither was officially released as a commercial single. Instead, a live performance by this 2003 version of Dexys was released on DVD, entitled &quot;It Was Like This – Live&quot; (although some versions were packaged with a misleading picture of Rowland from the 1980s on the cover). &quot;It Was Like This – Live&quot; was reissued in 2012 on CD and DVD as &quot;At the Royal Court, Liverpool&quot;. It was released digitally in 2019, featuring songs from the first three albums plus &quot;Because Of You&quot;, new song &quot;Manhood&quot; and the band&#x27;s version of The Commodores&#x27; &quot;Nightshift&quot;. 

In 2004, another Rowland-supervised reissue of the now-out-of-print &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, was issued on EMI with different remixing and remastering, an additional track (&quot;Kevin Rowland&#x27;s 13th Time&quot;), and a different cover photograph showing the core trio (Rowland, Adams and O&#x27;Hara) walking in a park wearing &quot;preppy&quot; attire (instead of the previous business attire). In the liner notes, Rowland said that, after the remastering and track changes, the album &quot;now sounds to me as it was intended to sound.&quot;

During a June 2005 interview on BBC Radio 2, Kevin Rowland announced that Dexys were &quot;back in the studio&quot; and seeking a record deal for a new album. A new track, &quot;It&#x27;s OK Johanna&quot;, appeared on the band&#x27;s MySpace site in 2007, and in January 2008, Rowland told &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine further details about the album, saying in part: &quot;I&#x27;m in the process of demo-ing the songs ... I don&#x27;t know when it will be ready or who will play on the record. I want to get everything 100 percent right, and know that it&#x27;s the best I can do and every note is there for a reason ... The only way I can be satisfied is to make the record I&#x27;m hearing in my head on my own terms.&quot; As Rowland repeatedly stated, &quot;Dexys are not a revival band. They are going forward, not backward.&quot;

====&quot;One Day I&#x27;m Going to Soar&quot; and subsequent touring====
In 2011, with the band&#x27;s name officially shortened to &quot;Dexys&quot;, work on new material started again with Rowland, Pete Williams, Mick Talbot, Neil Hubbard, and Lucy Morgan, who had all been in Dexys since the 2003 reformation, plus Big Jim Paterson and new female vocalist Madeleine Hyland. Hyland was discovered at the last minute prior to recording, after what Rowland described as &quot;about four years&quot; of searching. Rowland stated that some of the songs Dexys were recording dated back &quot;15 or 20 years.&quot; Dexys then announced that they would be embarking on another tour.

In February 2012, Rowland officially announced the imminent release of a fourth studio album for Dexys. The band also released a preview of &quot;Now&quot;, the album&#x27;s first track. The album, entitled &quot;One Day I&#x27;m Going to Soar&quot;, was released by BMG on 4 June 2012. All but one song were co-written by Rowland and Talbot, usually with other co-writers such as Paterson or Glen Matlock; the album continued in the same style as &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot; (featuring spoken sections in the songs), which led the album to be described as &quot;a concept album with an unreliable narrator&quot;.

The first single from the album was &quot;She Got a Wiggle&quot;, released 28 May 2012. They performed the song on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; in May 2012. The group toured in September 2012 in the UK, performing their new album. Talbot left the group following this tour.

In 2013, the band announced that they would play nine shows in London&#x27;s West End at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, St Martins Lane between 15 and 27 April. These shows would become the basis for a documentary on the group entitled &quot;Nowhere Is Home&quot;, directed by Kieran Evans and Paul Kelly. &quot;Nowhere Is Home&quot; was issued in both triple-CD and double-DVD formats in October 2014 on Dexys&#x27; own label, Absolute Dexys. Dexys played more live dates in 2014; however, as Hyland was not available for several shows during the summer, Siobhan Fahey replaced her in the Dexys lineup. (Fahey&#x27;s sister, actress Máire Fahey, had portrayed &quot;Eileen&quot; in the music video and picture sleeve for &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; in 1982.)

====&quot;Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul&quot;====
On St. Patrick&#x27;s Day (Thursday, 17 March) 2016, Dexys announced the release of their fifth studio album, &quot;Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul&quot;, which was subsequently released on 100%/Warner Music on 3 June 2016. The album features interpretations of Irish folk standards plus songs written by contemporary musicians. The pre-release videos included on Dexys&#x27; Facebook page featured three band members: Rowland, Lucy Morgan, and Sean Read, whom Rowland described as the &quot;nucleus&quot; of the current version of Dexys. The album also includes guest violinist Helen O&#x27;Hara, recording with the band for the first time in 30 years. Rowland said that the idea for the album dated back to 1984–85, at which time the album would have been called &quot;Irish&quot; and featured only traditional Irish songs as interpreted by Dexys. O&#x27;Hara, in fact, had released such an album in 1998, entitled &quot;A Night in Ireland&quot;, which includes three of the same songs. According to Rowland, &quot;the brief [has] expanded from solely consisting of Irish songs, to songs I&#x27;ve always loved and wanted to record&quot;, such as &quot;You Wear It Well&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, and &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;.

Dexys made its only two live appearances of 2016 to support this release: one at a private reception at the Embassy of Ireland in London on 6 June and one at Rough Trade East in London on 3 June. They also performed two songs on the ITV program &quot;Weekend&quot; on 11 June. For these three performances, O&#x27;Hara temporarily rejoined Dexys in place of Morgan, who was unavailable.

The album entered the UK Official Albums Chart Top 100 at number 10 and remained there for one week.

====&quot;Too-Rye-Ay As It Could Have Sounded&quot; and cancelled 2022 tour====

In September 2021, Dexys announced both an upcoming 40th-anniversary remix of &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot;, to be done by Rowland, O&#x27;Hara, and longtime Dexys engineer Pete Schwier and tentatively entitled &quot;Too-Rye-Ay As It Could Have Sounded&quot;, and a September/October 2022 tour to support the reissue. The publicity photo for the tour, which would have played the album in its entirety along with other Dexys material, shows, from left to right, Read, Rowland, O&#x27;Hara, and Paterson. Rowland stated, &quot;There is no way on earth I would be doing this tour or even promoting a normal 40th anniversary re-issue, if it wasn&#x27;t for the opportunity to remix it and present it how it could have sounded. This is like a new album for me.&quot; The &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; 40th anniversary tour was cancelled in March 2022 after Rowland was injured in a motorcycle accident and needed time to recover from this and other health issues. Although the tour would not move forward, the band promised material from the &quot;Too-Rye-Ay As It Could Have Sounded&quot; project would be performed the next time they tour.

====&quot;The Feminine Divine&quot;====

In December 2022, 100% Records announced via Twitter that they had signed Dexys and that the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Feminine Divine&quot;, was scheduled for release in 2023. The band lineup for &quot;The Feminine Divine&quot; is Rowland, Paterson, Sean Read and Michael Timothy.

The album was preceded by the singles and videos &quot;I&#x27;m Going To Get Free&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;My Submission&quot;. The album received 4-star reviews in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, &quot;Record Collector&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; amongst others, and entered the UK Official Albums Chart at number 6.

The song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Kevin (Manhood 2023)&quot; is a re-recorded version of the song &quot;Manhood&quot; which was released before on the 2003 compilation album &quot;Let&#x27;s Make This Precious: The Best of Dexys Midnight Runners&quot; and on the live album &quot;At The Royal Court 2003&quot;. 

Dexys toured &quot;The Feminine Divine Live!&quot; across the UK and Ireland in September 2023. The show was divided into two halves with the first part featuring &quot;The Feminine Divine&quot; album performed in its entirety in the order the tracks appear on the album. The second half saw Dexys play many of the songs that appeared on the &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; album: &quot;Soon&quot;, &quot;Plan B&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Show You&quot;, &quot;All In All (This One Last Wild Waltz)&quot;, &quot;Until I Believe In My Soul&quot;, &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m In Heaven When You Smile)&quot;. Other songs performed in the second part of the show were &quot;Geno&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;, and &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;. The band line up for these live shows was Kevin Rowland (vocals), Mike Timothy (keyboards) Sean Read (keyboards, saxophone), Claudia Chopek (violin), Alistair Whyte (trombone) and Tim Weller (drums). Dexys toured Europe in October. 

On 30 July, the band announced its first 14-date US tour in 40 years, to take place in October and November 2023. The tour was cancelled at the start of October 2023.

On 20 April 2024, Record Store Day UK, Dexys released a special vinyl release of the song &quot;Dance With Me&quot;, remixed by Manchester art-pop band Dutch Uncles.

On 22 March 2024 the band announced the release of 2CD/3LP live album &quot;The Feminine Devine + Dexys Classics: Live!&quot;, featuring a full performance of &quot;The Feminine Divine&quot;, as well as Dexys classics including &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, &quot;Geno&quot;, &quot;Jackie Wilson Said&quot;, &quot;Plan B&quot; and many more. It was released on 24 May, accompanied by the announcement of a series of UK festival shows, including an appearance at Glastonbury. The setlist for the 2024 Festival Tour featured songs from each of the band&#x27;s albums. The shows opened with &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; from 2016&#x27;s &quot;Let The Record Show&quot; and closed with &quot;This Is What She&#x27;s Like&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; reviewed the Glastonbury show positively, saying &quot;A slimmed down Dexys win out thanks to a magnificent turn from their leader.&quot;

<text>Deryck Bower Guyler (29 April 1914 – 7 October 1999) was an English actor, best remembered for appearances in sitcoms such as &quot;Please Sir!&quot; and &quot;Sykes&quot;.

==Early life==
Guyler was born in Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula, Cheshire, the son of Samuel Phipps Guyler, a jeweller, and Elsie Evelyn, née Bower. In his childhood, a next-door neighbour was Irené Eastwood, who would also go on to have a career in show business when she changed her name to Anne Ziegler - the 1921 census shows the Eastwood family at 111 Hartington Rd, Liverpool and the Guylers at 113. He attended Liverpool College and originally planned a career in the Church of England, having studied theology for a year. In the 1930s, he joined the Liverpool Repertory Theatre and performed in numerous productions. During the Second World War, he was called up and joined the RAF Police but was later invalided from service, whereupon he joined Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) and then, in 1942, the BBC&#x27;s Drama and Repertory company.

==Career==
From 1946, Guyler became a regular on the immensely popular radio series, &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; (&quot;ITMA&quot;), a series built around comedian Tommy Handley. Guyler claimed that his character &#x27;Frisby Dike&#x27; (named after a Liverpool department store bombed in the Blitz) was the first time the real Liverpudlian accent was heard on the radio. He took part in a Royal Command Performance of &quot;ITMA&quot; for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in December 1947. Guyler remained with the show until Handley died in 1949 when the series ended.

After &quot;ITMA&quot;, Guyler worked in roles from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; to classical parts, including with John Gielgud in &quot;King Lear&quot;. He was known for his often amusing asides in rehearsals. For a &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; documentary about life in the coal mines, which Guyler was narrating, the producer had visited a mine and recorded most-realistic sound effects. As these were banging, crashing and thumping sounds he was heard to mutter: &quot;Sounds like a Peter Brook production&quot;.

In the 1950s, he played the time-traveller (also known as &quot;the voice&quot;) in the British sci-fi radio series &quot;Journey into Space&quot;. In the same period, he was on the radio series &quot;Just Fancy&quot; for 9 years which starred Eric Barker. Guyler took on the role in the title character of a Scotland Yard detective in the Light Programme series &quot;Inspector Scott Investigates&quot;, created by John P. Wynn, that ran from 1957 to 1963. During the half-hour programme a crime was committed; Scott and his sidekick, Det. Sgt. Bingham (Brian Hayes, brother of Patricia Hayes) interviewed two or three suspects; then, while music played, there was a short intermission for listeners to guess &#x27;whodunit&#x27; before the final revelation. In Henry Reed&#x27;s series of radio dramas about Herbert Reeve&#x27;s inquiries into the life of Richard Shewin, Guyler played General Gland, soldier-scholar, campanologist and author of war memoirs, including in &quot;Not a Drum was Heard&quot;. During the 1960s and 1970s, he starred in the satirical radio programme about life in the British civil service &quot;The Men from the Ministry&quot; with Richard Murdoch. He was in the series for 11 years. Guyler played the pompous, self-important Number One in the General Assistance Department, with Murdoch as his diffident but equally incompetent Number Two.

He appeared as the Police Sergeant in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) and as the art professor in the Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; (1965).

Guyler holds a unique place in theatrical history, having &#x27;acted&#x27; in every performance of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; since the opening night on 6 October 1952 in Nottingham, via a recorded news bulletin which is still being used during performances of the play at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, London.

==Television==
One of Guyler&#x27;s first television appearances was as the manager of a TV repair shop in &quot;Three Live Wires&quot; in 1961, followed closely by his television success as one of Michael Bentine&#x27;s sidekicks in the surreal BBC show &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot; (1961), but he gained greater recognition on the small screen in his association with comedian and writer Eric Sykes. He played the part of Constable (&#x27;Corky&#x27;) Turnbull in &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; (1960–65) which was later revived as &quot;Sykes&quot; (1972–79). In 1975, he appeared in the ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot;, based on the Charles Penrose song and his character from the series.

In between the two series with Eric Sykes, Guyler was also a regular in the sitcom &quot;Please Sir!&quot; (1968–72), playing the cantankerous school caretaker Norman Potter. Claiming to be an ex-Desert Rat, Potter would often complain to John Alderton, who played the part of schoolteacher Mr Hedges, about class &#x27;5C&#x27; and their &quot;dreadful behaviour&quot;.

Other television appearances include those in &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (1963), a comedy series starring Jimmy Clitheroe, and the short-lived political comedy &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;. He also played a tremorous surgeon in the film &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;. During the 1980s, he contributed the voice-over to an animated skeleton in UK adverts for Scotch Video Tapes. He was the narrator of the BBC documentary about Fred Dibnah - &quot;Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack&quot;

Guyler had been a devotee of washboard playing since his school days and appeared in many television light entertainment shows performing his washboard novelty act. He also played washboard on an episode of &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;. In 1990, he played the washboard on three tracks of an album by long-time fan Shakin&#x27; Stevens.

==Personal life==
In 1941, Guyler married Margaret Mary McConnell (a.k.a. &quot;Paddy Lennox&quot;), from the three-sister variety harmony act the Lennox Sisters, and they had two sons, Peter and Christopher. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1945.

Guyler&#x27;s passion was collecting jazz records and as of 1986, he had about 1,600 78rpm records, collecting records up to about the year 1947. In addition, he was a well known wargamer, and a founding member of the Society of Ancients, a group of wargamers specialising in the classical era. Very active in the society in its early years, being elected its first president in 1966, Guyler was later made an honorary life president of the society.

A long-time resident of Norbury, South London, he retired to Ashgrove, Queensland, Australia, in 1993, to be near his younger son Chris, daughter-in-law Judy and his three grandchildren.

He died on 7 October 1999 and his funeral service was held at St. Mark&#x27;s Catholic Church, Inala, Queensland, on 13 October. In 1995, Danny Baker and the BBC had made a 10-minute tribute to Guyler, which was used as a part of the eulogy delivered by his son Chris.

<text>Wakefield is a cathedral city in West Yorkshire, England located on the River Calder. The city had a population of 109,766 in the 2021 census, up from 99,251 in the 2011 census. The city is the administrative centre of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Wakefield, which had a population of , the  most populous district in England. It is part of the West Yorkshire Built-up Area and the Yorkshire and The Humber region.

In 1888, it gained city status due to its cathedral. The city has a town hall and is home to the county hall, which was the former administrative centre of the city&#x27;s county borough and metropolitan borough as well as county town for the West Riding of Yorkshire.

The Battle of Wakefield took place in the Wars of the Roses, and the city was a Royalist stronghold in the Civil War. Wakefield became an important market town and centre for wool, exploiting its position on the navigable River Calder to become an inland port. In the 18th century, Wakefield traded in corn, coal and textiles.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Wakefield&quot; may derive from &#x27;Waca&#x27;s field&#x27; – the open land belonging to someone named &#x27;Waca&#x27; – or could have evolved from the Old English word &quot;wacu&quot;, meaning &#x27;a watch or wake&#x27;, and &quot;feld&quot;, an open field in which a wake or festival was held. In the Domesday Book of 1086, it was written &quot;Wachefeld&quot; and also as &quot;Wachefelt&quot;.

===Early history===
Flint and stone tools and later bronze and iron implements have been found at Lee Moor and Lupset in the Wakefield area showing evidence of human activity since prehistoric times. This part of Yorkshire was home to the Brigantes until the Roman occupation in AD 43. A Roman road from Pontefract passing Streethouse, Heath Common, Ossett Street Side, through Kirklees and on to Manchester crossed the River Calder by a ford at Wakefield near the site of Wakefield Bridge. A large group of coin moulds, the Lingwell Gate coin moulds, representing Romano-British coin forgery were found at Lingwell Gate between 1697 and 1879. Wakefield was probably occupied again, this time by the Angles, in the 5th or 6th century, and after AD 876 the area was controlled by the Vikings who founded twelve hamlets or &quot;thorpes&quot; around Wakefield. They divided the area into wapentakes and Wakefield was part of the Wapentake of Agbrigg. The settlement grew near a crossing place on the River Calder around three roads, Westgate, Northgate and Kirkgate. The &quot;gate&quot; suffix derives from Old Norse &#x27; meaning road and kirk, from &#x27; indicates there was a church.

Before 1066 the manor of Wakefield belonged to Edward the Confessor and it passed to William the Conqueror after the Battle of Hastings. After the Conquest Wakefield was a victim of the Harrying of the North in 1069 when William the Conqueror took revenge on the local population for resistance to Norman rule. The settlement was recorded as &quot;Wachfeld&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and covered a much greater area than present day Wakefield, much of which was described as &quot;waste&quot;. The manor was granted by the crown to William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey whose descendants, the Earls Warenne, inherited it after his death in 1088. The construction of Sandal Castle began early in the 12th century. A second castle, Wakefield Castle, was built at Lawe Hill on the north side of the Calder but was abandoned. Wakefield and its environs formed the caput of an extensive baronial holding by the Warennes that extended to Cheshire and Lancashire. The Warennes, and their feudal sublords, held the area until the 14th century, when it passed to their heirs.
Norman tenants holding land in the region included the Lyvet family at Lupset.

The Domesday Book recorded two churches, one in Wakefield and one in Sandal Magna. The Saxon church in Wakefield was rebuilt in about 1100 in stone in the Norman style and was continually enlarged until 1315 when the central tower collapsed. By 1420 the church was again rebuilt and was extended between 1458 and 1475.

In 1203 William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey received a grant for a market in the town. In 1204 King John granted the rights for a fair at the feast of All Saints, 1 November, and in 1258 Henry III granted the right for fair on the feast of Saint John the Baptist, 24 June. The market was close to the Bull Ring and the church. The townsfolk of Wakefield amused themselves in games and sports, the chief sport in the 14th century was archery and the butts in Wakefield were at the Ings, near the river. Wakefield was dubbed the &quot;Merrie City&quot; in the Middle Ages.
During the Wars of the Roses, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed on 30 December 1460 in the Battle of Wakefield near Sandal Castle. In medieval times Wakefield became an inland port on the Calder and centre for the woollen and tanning trades. In 1538 John Leland described Wakefield as, &quot;a very quick market-towne and meately large; well served of flesch and fisch, both from the se and by rivers, whereof divers be thereabout at hande, so that al vitaile is very gode chepe there. A right honest man shal fare well for two pens a meale&quot;. As preparation for the impending invasion by the Spanish Armada in April 1588, 400 men from the wapentake of Morley and Agbrigg were summoned to Bruntcliffe near Morley with their weapons. Men from Kirkgate, Westgate, Northgate and Sandal were amongst them and all returned by August.

At the time of the Civil War, Wakefield was a Royalist stronghold. An attack led by Sir Thomas Fairfax on 20 May 1643 captured the town for the Parliamentarians. Over 1500 troops were taken prisoner along with the Royalist commander, Lieutenant-General Goring.

In 1699 an Act of Parliament was passed creating the Aire and Calder Navigation which provided the town with access to the North Sea. The first Registry of Deeds in the country opened in 1704 and in 1765 Wakefield&#x27;s cattle market was established and became the one of largest in the north of England. The town was a centre for cloth dealing, with its own piece hall, the Tammy Hall, built in 1766. In the late 1700s Georgian town houses and St John&#x27;s Church were built to the north of the town centre.

===Industrial Revolution===

At the start of the 19th century Wakefield was a wealthy market town and inland port trading in wool and grain. The Aire and Calder and Calder and Hebble Navigations and the Barnsley Canal were instrumental in the development of Wakefield as an important market for grain and more was sold here than at any other market in the north. Large warehouses were built on the river banks to store grain from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire to supply the fast-growing population in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Great quantities of barley were grown in the neighbourhood and in 1885 more malt was made in Wakefield &quot;than in any district of equal extent in the kingdom&quot;. The market developed in the streets around the Bull Ring, and the cattle market between George Street and Ings Road grew to be one of the biggest in the country. Road transport using turnpiked roads was important. Regular mail coaches departed to Leeds, London, Manchester, York and Sheffield and the &#x27;Strafford Arms&#x27; was an important coaching inn. The railways arrived in Wakefield in 1840 when Kirkgate station was built on the Manchester and Leeds Railway.

When cloth dealing declined, wool spinning mills using steam power were built by the river. There was a glass works in Calder Vale Road, several breweries including Melbourne&#x27;s and Beverley&#x27;s Eagle Breweries, engineering works with strong links to the mining industry, soapworks and brickyards in Eastmoor, giving the town a diverse economy. Boats and sloops were built at yards on the Calder. On the outskirts of the town, coal had been dug since the 15th century and 300 men were employed in the town&#x27;s coal pits in 1831. During the 19th century more mines were sunk so that there were 46 small mines in Wakefield and the surrounding area by 1869. The National Coal Board eventually became Wakefield&#x27;s largest employer with Manor Colliery on Cross Lane and Park Hill colliery at Eastmoor surviving until 1982. Wakefield was also the site of the founding of the Miners&#x27; Association of Great Britain and Ireland, the country&#x27;s first national trade union for miners, in 1842.

During the 19th century Wakefield became the administrative centre for the West Riding, when many familiar buildings were constructed. The first civic building in Wood Street, Wakefield Court House, was built in 1810. The West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum was built at Stanley Royd, just outside the town on Aberford Road in 1816. During the 19th century, the Wakefield Asylum played a central role in the development of British psychiatry, with Henry Maudsley and James Crichton-Browne amongst its medical staff. Most of it is now demolished. The old House of Correction of 1595 was rebuilt as Wakefield Prison in 1847. Wakefield Union workhouse was built on Park Lodge Lane, Eastmoor in 1853 and Clayton Hospital was built in 1854 after a donation from Alderman Thomas Clayton. Wakefield Mechanics&#x27; Institute containing an Assembly Room, public library and newsroom supported by subscription was built in Wood Street in 1820–1821 in the Classical style with Ionic details. Wakefield Literary Society ran there from 1827 until the 20th century and its Geological Society left artefacts to Wakefield Museum.

Up to 1837 Wakefield relied on wells and springs for its water supply; water from the River Calder was polluted, and various water supply schemes were unsuccessful until reservoirs on the Rishworth Moors and a service reservoir at Ardsley were built providing clean water from 1888.
By 1885 the streets of the town were paved and flagged and lit with gas supplied by a company incorporated in 1822. Between 1870 and 1885 they made improvements on the north side of town around St John&#x27;s Church now a conservation area.

===20th century===
On 2 June 1906, Andrew Carnegie opened a new Wakefield Library on Drury Lane which had been built with a grant of £8,000 from the Carnegie Trust.

There are seven ex-council estates in Wakefield which the council started to build after the First World War, the oldest is Portobello, the largest is Lupset and the rest are Flanshaw, Plumpton, Peacock, Eastmoor and Kettlethorpe. Homes not bought by occupants under the Right to Buy scheme were transferred to a registered social landlord, Wakefield and District Housing (WDH) in 2005. The outlying villages of Sandal Magna, Belle Vue and Agbrigg have become suburbs of Wakefield.

The glass and textile industries closed in the 1970s and 1980s, and coal faced competition from alternative sources and demand decreased. The coal mines around Wakefield were amongst the first in Yorkshire to close under the government of Margaret Thatcher, which altered the national energy policy from a reliance on British coal and opposed the political power of the NUM. Between 1979 and 1983, the pits at Lofthouse, Manor, Newmarket, Newmillerdam, Parkhill and Walton all closed. As the Wakefield pits closed, the Selby Coalfield was being opened, many colliers in Wakefield accepted offers to transfer to the new pits which were built to facilitate commuting.

An April 2021 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; discussed nearby Heath (or Heath Common), the &quot;village of the [200 year old] mansions&quot;, located &quot;around the edge of the green&quot;. These housed the wealthy merchants and business owners. The local newspaper published specifics about one of the mansions in March 2021: Dower House was built ; it was constructed for John Smyth by John Carr, of Yorkshire stone, and &quot;retains many original features&quot;. It was intended to house widows. The Dower House is a Grade II*listed property; it was modified in the early 1800s.

The nearby Heath Hall, Heath, West Yorkshire, formerly known as Eshald House, was also built for the wealthy wool trader, John Smyth. The Hall was modified by John Carr between 1754 and 1780 for the original owner&#x27;s nephew (also known as John Smyth). The Hall is a Grade I listed building.

==Governance==

Wakefield was anciently a market and parish town in the Agbrigg division of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a parliamentary borough with one Member of Parliament after the Reform Act 1832. In 1836 the Wakefield Poor Law Union was formed following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 with an elected board of guardians. The town was incorporated as a municipal borough with elected councillors in 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

Wakefield was the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of regional government in Yorkshire for two centuries and became the county headquarters of the West Riding County Council created by the Local Government Act 1888. After Wakefield was elevated to a diocese in 1888, Wakefield council sought city status which was granted the same year. Wakefield became a county borough in 1913. In 1974, under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972, the county borough became defunct as it merged with surrounding local authorities to become the City of Wakefield district.

Today the city is the headquarters of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and West Yorkshire Police. Since 1987, the district council has been based in County Hall.

Wakefield is covered by four electoral wards (Wakefield East, Wakefield North, Wakefield South and Wakefield West) of the Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. Each ward elects three councillors to the 63-member metropolitan district council, Wakefield&#x27;s local authority. In 2015 all the councillors elected for Wakefield East, North and West were members of the Labour Party and the councillors for Wakefield South represent the Conservative Party.

The parliamentary seat of Wakefield had been held by the Labour Party continuously from 1932 until the 2019 general election, when the Conservative Party&#x27;s Imran Ahmad Khan defeated the incumbent Mary Creagh. The Conservative Party expelled Khan from the party on 11 April 2022, following a conviction of sexual assault. He announced three days after his conviction that he would be resigning as an MP, and left his post on 3 May, triggering the 2022 Wakefield by-election, which was held on 23 June and won by Labour&#x27;s Simon Lightwood.

The Wakefield South ward covering Sandal, Kettlethorpe, Agbrigg and Belle Vue, is in the Hemsworth constituency, represented by the Labour party&#x27;s Jon Trickett since 1996. He was re-elected in May 2010, and returned in 2015 with 51.3% of the vote. The seat has been held by the Labour Party since its creation in 1918.

==Geography==

Wakefield is south-east of Leeds and south-west of York on the eastern edge of the Pennines in the lower Calder Valley. The city centre is sited on a low hill on the north bank of the River Calder close to a crossing place where it is spanned by the 14th-century, nine-arched, stone Chantry Bridge and a reinforced concrete bridge built in 1929–1930. It is at the junction of major north–south routes to Sheffield, Leeds and Doncaster and west–east routes to Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Pontefract.

Wakefield is within the area of the Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire &amp; Yorkshire coalfield and lies on the middle coal measures and sandstones laid down in the Carboniferous period.

Wakefield includes the former outlying villages of Alverthorpe, Thornes, Sandal, Portobello, Belle Vue, Agbrigg, Lupset, Kettlethorpe and Flanshaw. In the 2011 Census, Newton Hill, Outwood, Stanley and Wrenthorpe were counted as parts of Wakefield, having been classified separately in the 2001 Census.
===Neighbouring towns and places===
==Demography==
In 2001 the Wakefield subdivision of the West Yorkshire Urban Area had a population of 76,886 comprising 37,477 males and 39,409 females.
Also at the time of the 2001 UK census, the City of Wakefield had a total population of 315,172 of whom 161,962 were female and 153,210 were male. Of the 132,212 households in Wakefield, 39.56% were married couples living together, 28.32% were one-person households, 9.38% were cohabiting couples and 9.71% were lone parents. The figures for lone-parent households were slightly above the national average of 9.5%, and the percentage of married couples was above the national average of 36.5%; the proportion of one-person households was below the national average of 30.1%.

The population density was . Of those aged 16–74 in Wakefield, 39.14% had no academic qualifications, much higher than 28.9% in all of England. Of Wakefield&#x27;s residents, 2.53% were born outside the United Kingdom, significantly lower than the national average of 9.2%. The largest minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.41% of the population.

The number of theft-from-a-vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 7.9 and 3.9 compared to the English national average of 6.3 and 2.3 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 0.9, in line with the national average. The national average of violence against another person was 16.7 compared to the Wakefield average of 15. The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 2008–09 financial year.

===Population change===
Wakefield had a population of 76,886 in 2001. At the 2011 Census, the population was given as 99,251. However, these two estimates are not directly comparable, as the 2001 Census did not classify the old Stanley Urban District as part of Wakefield whereas the 2011 Census classified all settlements in this area except Bottom Boat (a small village built for Newmarket Colliery workers) as parts of Wakefield.
==Economy==
The economy of Wakefield declined in the last quarter of the 20th century as the coal mines and traditional manufacturing industries closed, contributing to high rates of unemployment. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015, 14.35% of the district&#x27;s lower super-output areas were in the most deprived 10% of England.

Employment grew by 12% between 1998 and 2003 as the economy recovered and enjoyed growth as the economic base of the district was diversified. Growth has been supported by inward investment from European and United Kingdom government funding which has impacted on the regeneration of the area. Manufacturing remains an important employment sector although the decline is projected to continue whilst distribution and the service industries are now among the main employers.

At the 2001 census, there were 33,521 people in employment who were resident within Wakefield. Of these, 20.74% worked in the wholesale and retail trade, including repair of motor vehicles; 14.42% worked within manufacturing industry; 11% worked within the health and social work sector and 6.49% were employed in the transport, storage and communication industries. Wakefield is a member of the Leeds City Region Partnership, a sub-regional economic development partnership covering an area of the historic county of Yorkshire.

===Regeneration===

Regeneration projects in Wakefield included the Trinity Walk retail development to the north east of the city centre, including a department store, a supermarket and shop units. Work began in autumn 2007 but was halted in 2009, restarted in 2010 and opened in 2011. The central square at the Bull Ring has been redesigned with a water feature and the Ridings Shopping Centre refurbished. Wakefield Westgate Station goods yard and land on Westgate and Balne Lane have been developed to create retail, residential and commercial space including new offices, a multi-storey carpark serving the station, and a hotel.

A new market hall opened in 2008, but closed in 2018. In 2023, conversion began of it into Wakefield Exchange, an events space.

Developments by the river and canal, the &quot;Wakefield Waterfront&quot;, include the refurbishment of the Grade II listed Navigation Warehouse and office, retail, restaurant and cafe units. The development includes the art gallery, The Hepworth Wakefield named in honour of local sculptor, Barbara Hepworth which opened in May 2011. The gallery has ten internal spaces, exhibiting many examples of Hepworth&#x27;s work. The gallery added about £10 million to the local economy by attracting 500,000 visitors in its first year. Flats and offices were built at Chantry Waters, on an island between the river and canal.

==Landmarks==

The most prominent landmark in Wakefield is Wakefield Cathedral, which at has the tallest spire in Yorkshire. Other landmarks in the Civic Quarter on Wood Street include the Grade II*Neoclassical Crown Court of 1810, Wakefield Town Hall designed by T.E. Collcutt and opened in 1880, and the County Hall of 1898 built in a Queen Anne Style which are Grade I listed. St John&#x27;s Church and Square, St John&#x27;s North and South Parade are part of residential development dating from the Georgian period.

The old Wakefield Bridge with its Chantry Chapel, Sandal Castle, and Lawe Hill in Clarence Park are ancient monuments. Another prominent structure is the 95-arch railway viaduct, constructed of 800,000,000 bricks in the 1860s on the Doncaster to Leeds railway line. At its northern end is a bridge with an span over Westgate and at its southern end a iron bridge crossing the River Calder.

The Ridings Centre, opened in 1983, was a UK first and served as a template for many shopping centres throughout the UK.

Clayton Hospital, a substantial Victorian edifice completed in 1880, closed in 2012 and has since been demolished.
==Transport==
Wakefield has good access to the motorway system, with the intersection of the M1 and M62 motorways, junctions 42/29, lying to the north west, whilst the M1 to the west is accessed at junctions 39, 40 and 41. The A1(M) is to the east of the district. Wakefield is crossed by the A61, A638, and A642 roads and is the starting point of the A636 and A650 roads.

The council is working with West Yorkshire Metro, the other four West Yorkshire district councils and transport operators to provide an integrated transport system for the district through the implementation of the West Yorkshire Local Transport Plan.
A network of local buses, coordinated by West Yorkshire Metro and departing from Wakefield bus station in the town centre, serves Wakefield and district. Buses are operated by Arriva Yorkshire, Watersons Coaches, Poppletons, Team Pennine, Stagecoach Yorkshire and National Express.

Wakefield Westgate station opened in 1867 on the Doncaster to Leeds line. It has connections to the
East Coast Main Line, trains to Leeds, Doncaster, and stations towards London King&#x27;s Cross. CrossCountry trains go to Newcastle, Edinburgh, Birmingham and the South West. East Midlands Railway also run a limited service via Sheffield, Derby and Leicester to London St Pancras. Wakefield Westgate is on the Wakefield Line of the West Yorkshire Metro network. The line was electrified in 1989. Wakefield is served by inter-city express trains from both its railway stations. London can be reached in less than two hours.

Wakefield Kirkgate railway station was opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1840. Wakefield Kirkgate is unstaffed and operated by Northern who operate trains to Barnsley, Meadowhall Interchange, Sheffield, Normanton, Pontefract, Knottingley, Leeds, Castleford and Nottingham. The station serves the Hallam Line, Huddersfield Line and the Pontefract Line of the MetroTrain network. Grand Central operating between London King&#x27;s Cross and Bradford Interchange stop at Kirkgate. In 2009 CCTV was installed at the station, but it had acquired a reputation for being one of the country&#x27;s worst stations. It has, however, undergone extensive renovation (2014–).

The nearest airport is Leeds Bradford Airport, to the north of the city at Yeadon.

The Aire and Calder Navigation is from Leeds to Goole, and from Wakefield to Castleford, and was created by Act of Parliament in 1699. It was opened to Leeds in 1704 and to Wakefield in 1706, enabling craft carrying 100 tons to reach Wakefield from the Humber. It is still used by a small amount of commercial traffic and leisure craft.
The Calder and Hebble Navigation was created by Act of Parliament in 1758 with the intention of making the Calder navigable to Sowerby Bridge. The route was originally surveyed by John Smeaton, remains open and is used by leisure craft. The Barnsley Canal, a broad canal with 20 locks, opened in 1799 connecting Barnsley to the Aire and Calder Navigation at Wakefield and was abandoned in 1953.

Other schools with sixth forms include: QEGS, Wakefield Girls High School, and Cathedral High School, which is now a Performing Arts College for ages 11 to 18.

==Religion==
Wakefield&#x27;s oldest church is All Saints, now Wakefield Cathedral, a 14th-century parish church built on the site of earlier Saxon and Norman churches, restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century, and raised to cathedral status in 1888. The first Bishop of Wakefield was William Walsham How.

In May 2011 The Hepworth Wakefield gallery opened on the south bank of the River Calder near Wakefield Bridge, displaying work by local artists Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore and other British and international artists. The gallery is thought to be the largest purpose-built gallery to open in the United Kingdom since 1968.

Wakefield&#x27;s three adjoining parks have a history dating back to 1893 when Clarence Park opened on land near Lawe Hill. The adjacent Holmefield Estate was acquired in 1919, followed by Thornes House in 1924, becoming Holmefield Park and Thornes Park respectively. The three parks form Wakefield Park to the south west of the city. Clarence Park Music Festival is held annually in Clarence Park, promoting local bands.

==Sport==

Wakefield Trinity is a Rugby League club currently playing in the Super League following promotion from the Championship in 2024. The club, founded in 1873, was one of the initial founders of the Northern Union after the split from the Rugby Football Union in 1895. The club plays at Belle Vue stadium. Several local teams play in different leagues of the British Amateur Rugby League Association, BARLA.
They include Wakefield City, Westgate Wolves, Crigglestone All Blacks, Kettlethorpe and Eastmoor Dragons.

Rugby Union Football is played at Sandal RUFC and was played by Wakefield RFC at College Grove from 1901 to 2004 when the club ceased to play.

Wakefield briefly had a football team in the city itself when Emley F.C. moved to play at Belle Vue, the ground of Wakefield Trinity, hoping to progress further up the football pyramid. However, fortunes soon declined with supporters abandoning the club and they moved out of Belle Vue, first to College Grove and then briefly to share with Ossett Town, ultimately, Wakefield FC folded in June 2014 with crowds in the low double figures by then. AFC Emley was founded to restore the club&#x27;s original links with the village of Emley. the fans who followed the old club soon went back to following the new (continuation of the old club) in Emley who have gone from strength to strength. 

In 2019 a new club Wakefield A.F.C. was formed by a consortium including former professional player Chris Turner and played in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire County Senior Football League, in 2021 the club was bought by VO2 capital. Playing at Barnsley and Featherstone, the club had not played in the City which bears their name until moving to share the rugby ground with Wakefield Trinity in 2023, however, this arrangement only lasted 1 season before Wakefield moved back out of the city and back to Featherstone leaving the city of Wakefield without a senior football club yet again and therefore remains the largest settlement in the UK without its own football club.

Wakefield Hockey Club and Slazenger Hockey Club (based in Horbury) are field hockey clubs that compete in the Men&#x27;s England Hockey League, the North Hockey League and the Yorkshire &amp; North East Hockey League.

<doc id="152101" wikidata="Q1301336" url="?curid=152101" title="Mirfield">
<text>Mirfield () is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is on the A644 road between Brighouse and Dewsbury. At the 2011 census it had a population of 19,563. Mirfield forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

==Governance==

From 1894 to 1974, Mirfield was an urban district in the West Riding of Yorkshire until it was merged into the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees. In 1988 a parish council was formed, one of five in Kirklees, the others being:- Denby Dale, Meltham, Kirkburton and Holme Valley. As a parish council an additional tax precept to the Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council tax is levied on the town&#x27;s residents. It is made up of 16 councillors who serve for a fixed four-year term, and represent wards within the parish. The members elect a town mayor, who serves for a fixed one-year term. Mirfield Town Hall now serves as a worship hall for the Salvation Army.

===Local elections===
In addition to the town council Mirfield is represented by three councillors on Kirklees Metropolitan Council, and the local Mirfield Area Committee.

In May 2005, Mirfield became the first Fairtrade Town in Kirklees and only the fourth in West Yorkshire.

==Culture==
The Mirfield Show is an annual agricultural event held on the third Sunday in August at Mirfield showground. It is organised and run by the Mirfield Agricultural Society (MAS) as a non-profit making event for the families of Mirfield and district.

Local residents introduced the Mirfield Food &amp; Craft Fayre in April 2012, scheduled to be run the last Saturday of each month and &quot;help raise the profile of Mirfield, be a benefit to local traders, businesses, organisations and charities, and add more destination events to the Yorkshire calendar&quot;.

==Education==

There are two secondary schools in Mirfield: Mirfield Free Grammar and Sixth Form and Castle Hall Academy.

Primary schools include Battyeford CE Primary School, Crossley Fields, Old Bank, Hopton Primary School and Crowlees Junior and Infant School, all of which were assessed by Ofsted as &#x27;Grade 1 – Outstanding&#x27; in the March 2007 inspection.

The College of the Resurrection in Mirfield is a Church of England theological college, associated with the Community of the Resurrection religious community. There Rowan Williams, later Archbishop of Canterbury, lectured from 1975 for two years and Archbishop Trevor Huddleston spent his last days.

==Landmarks==
The 13th-century St Mary&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1826 but proved too small for the growing population and was regarded as too minor for the growing district. A new church, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, was built a few yards to the northwest, on the site of Castle Hall, a mansion then home to the families of Mirfields (sometimes spelled Mirfin), Hetons and Beaumonts. At Scott&#x27;s suggestion, the tower of the earlier church, which includes some medieval work, was retained.

St Mary&#x27;s was the boyhood church of Sir Patrick Stewart, of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame.

==Navigation==
During the 18th century, a canal was constructed through the town linking the River Calder with other rivers in the area. The canal is part of the Calder and Hebble Navigation. Its construction resulted in many industries in Mirfield, such as the textiles and boat yards. The canal is still in use for recreational users with duck-feeding being especially popular.

Mirfield is the base of the Safe Anchor Trust, a charity founded in 1995 to provide canal boat trips for vulnerable and special needs people. In 2012, Princess Anne commissioned a new boat for the Trust.
==The Brontës==
Roe Head school, Mirfield, was a boarding school on the road from Leeds to Huddersfield where Charlotte Brontë went as a pupil on 17 January 1831, followed by her sisters Emily and Anne. Charlotte was happy there and later returned to teach.

In April 1839 Anne returned to the town as governess to four children of the Ingham family of Blake Hall. Her unhappy experiences there were used in her first novel &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;.

<doc id="152102" wikidata="Q2342234" url="?curid=152102" title="Mytholmroyd">
<text>Mytholmroyd ( ) is a large village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Hebden Royd, in the Calderdale district, in West Yorkshire, England, east of Hebden Bridge. It lies in the Upper Calder Valley, east of Burnley and west of Halifax. The village, which has a population of approximately 4,000, is in the Luddendenfoot Ward of Calderdale Council. 

The village holds regular markets. Mytholmroyd has business parks and a high street in the centre with many independent shops. It now is a designated conservation area, with more than 21 listed buildings in the village.

==Toponym==
Mytholmroyd was recorded in the 13th century as &quot;Mithomrode&quot; and in the 17th century as &quot;Mitholmroide&quot;. The name means &#x27;a clearing for settlement, where two rivers meet&#x27;, likely derived from the Old English &quot;(ġe)mȳthum&quot; (inflected form of &quot;(ġe)mȳthe&quot;, &quot;river mouth&quot;), plus &quot;rodu&quot; (&quot;field&quot; or &quot;clearing&quot;). The &quot;L&quot; was probably inserted out of confusion with the common place-name element &quot;holm&quot;, Old Norse for a small island or eyot.

==Governance==
Mytholmroyd was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Halifax. On 31 December 1894 Mytholmroyd became a civil parish in its own right being formed from Wadsworth, Sowerby, Erringden and Midgeley, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Hebden Bridge. In 1931 the parish had a population of 4468.

The village is part of the Luddendenfoot ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale. It has had a Labour-majority council as of May 2019 - All 3 councillors in the ward represent the Labour Party - Jane Scullion, leader of the Council, Scott Patient and Katie Kimber who has just retained the seat from the departing Roisin Cavanagh. It is part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire.

At a district level, Mytholmroyd Urban District Council was set up in 1894. In 1937 it merged with Hebden Bridge Urban District Council to become Hebden Royd Urban District Council. At a county level Mytholmroyd was administered by the West Riding County Council. Both of these were abolished as part of the reforms introduced in the Local Government Act 1972. They were replaced with West Yorkshire Combined Authority and Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council. The Hebden Royd Town Council area forms a civil parish. West Yorkshire County Council was abolished in 1986, leaving Mytholmroyd represented at borough and town council level. The current mayor of Hebden Royd – Val Stevens (Labour, former deputy leader of Manchester City Council) – lives in the village.

==History==
A Bronze Age urnfield exists on the moor top, north of Mytholmroyd. It is a burial ground with cremation urns, dating between the 16th and 11th centuries BC of national importance. Evidence of pre-historic farming is apparent because they cleared the upland forests for cattle grazing and created the peat moorlands. Most of the Celtic Iron Age settlements were concentrated on the hillside terraces which avoided the wooded and poorly drained valley floors. Most of the older listed buildings are located on the hillsides away from the valley. A Roman coin hoard has been found to the south of Mytholmroyd. Erringden and Midgeley Moors border the village.

===Cragg Vale Coiners===
During the late 18th century, the valley to the south, known as Cragg Vale, was home to a gang of counterfeiters known as the Cragg Vale Coiners. The gang&#x27;s leader, David Hartley, or King David as he was known, was found guilty of the 1769 murder of excise official William Dighton and was hanged at the York Tyburn on 28 April 1770. Two other gang members were also executed for their part in the murder. Recently local resident and writer Benjamin Myers wrote a novel charting their story, &quot;The Gallows Pole&quot; which went on to win the Walter Scott prize for historical fiction in 2018. This publication is now being adapted into a BBC television series.

===Historic buildings and structures===

====Canalside Mill====
Built in 1851 as Canal Wharf Mill, it was home to local company Walkley Clogs, and converted into a well known tourist attraction with cafes, shops and an open clog factory on the ground floor. It was destroyed by fire in the 1990s; consequently the top floor was demolished and re-opened under ownership of a property development company. It subsequently closed in 2002 and has since been boarded up. Numerous planning applications to continue its former use or convert it into luxury apartments have been passed but never undertaken. On 1 August 2019 it was once again destroyed by fire, this time so badly that it has now been demolished. A planning application for the site development has yet to be accepted.

====St. Michael&#x27;s Church====
The parish church was built in 1847 in Early English style. It was badly damaged in the 2015 floods but has since re-opened. The Sunday school in front of the church was reduced to one storey and is now used as a community hall and meeting spaces available for hire. In 2009 a new car park with monument in the form of an iron spike with a stone seating surround has been constructed park and is now used for village events including the Mytholmroyd Christmas Market organised by Royd Regen (the local development board) and the town council.

====County Bridge====
There has been a river crossing point since 1329 in the centre of the village, at the site of the current &#x27;County Bridge&#x27;. A bridge is recorded in this location under the name &quot;Elphaborough Bridge&quot;, after the name of Elphaborough Hall on the further side of Cragg Brook. Records of a grant issued to the local township for the purchase of timber stated it was for &quot;repairs to Mitholmroide Bridge&quot;, in 1638. Similar records show that the current stone bridge was erected in 1684 by Timothy Wadsworth, at a cost of £50. The current bridge was constructed in two parts (and now consists of four extensions). The original packhorse style bridge in 1638, and on the upstream side, the bridge was widened and two extra arches on the south end were added to ease the gradient, although the two new arches were considerably smaller, the bridge now consists of four arches in total. In the 19th century, with shops being constructed on the north end riverbank, and a new premises being built for the Mytholmroyd Co-Operative Society right up to the water&#x27;s edge on the south bank, two of the bridge&#x27;s arches are mostly hidden. However, the premises were built with a large opening underneath the buildings, allowing floodwater to still pass through the two hidden arches underground. Mytholmroyd Bridge was eventually taken over by West Riding County Council, which gives the historic bridge its present name of &quot;County Bridge&quot;.

====Railway station and viaduct====
A prominent viaduct lies above the southern end of Mytholmroyd town centre. It was erected in 1840 by George Stephenson and is still in use as part of the modern day Calder Valley Line. In the 1850s, Mytholmroyd railway station was built, consisting of two platforms built on the Mytholmroyd Viaduct, and a three-storey ticket office, waiting hall and entrance stairwell, leading unto the viaduct. This later closed and the platforms were built a matter of yards up the track on land, and is now accessed by open staircases and long access ramps up the steep banking, where flowers and displays are maintained by the Mytholmroyd Station Partnership. The 19th century listed, 3 floor station building has recently been fully restored back to its former glory both inside and out and is awaiting tenants. In December 2019, the project was awarded the Railway Heritage Trust Conservation Award at the 2019 National Railway Heritage Awards. It was recognised for showcasing a real passion for restoration work and an ability to understand the objectives of the original railway builders and architects. A new, near 200 space station car park is underway at the old loading yard comprising 10 E-car parking spaces, secure cycle lockers and car share facilities. The West Yorkshire Combined Authority are working with the Mytholmroyd Station Partnership to landscape the car park with bee-friendly planters and information boards.

====Dusty Miller Inn====
This late 18th century pub replaced an earlier inn on the opposite side of the road, where Bridge End cottages now stand. The earlier building was home to the Cragg Vale Coiners in 1769. The current Grade II-listed inn comprises a hotel, bar and restaurant. The premises were severely damaged in the 2012 and 2015 flooding, causing the business to close for repairs. The bar re-opened in April 2016 and was awarded the &quot;pub of the season award&quot; for summer 2016 by the local CAMRA branch. the hotel and restaurant are yet to re-open.

==Flooding==
The village is currently (2017/18) under development with the Environment Agency&#x27;s 35 Million pound Mytholmroyd Flood Alleviation Scheme. This includes raising the height of flood walls on the banks of the River Calder and Cragg Brook, as well as demolishing homes and businesses on the Calder&#x27;s banks to widen the river. The village&#x27;s post office has been relocated to flood-proof premises, with other buildings being stabilised and strengthened. Caldene Bridge, upstream from County Bridge, is being demolished and relocated as well as the bridge at Greenhill Industrial Estate.

===1837===
A disastrous flood occurred in 1837; few details are known about it, although it is known that the river reached the height of the canal, built on the hillside, and ultimately overflowed it.

===1946===
In the worst flooding to ever affect the village, many properties suffered flood water up to the second storey, and the village remained underwater for almost 12 hours. Two shops on Burnley Road collapsed into the river, shops just doors down from the buildings that collapsed in the 2015 flood. By 8 am, flood waters reached up to 7 feet.

===1954===
On Saturday, 21 August 1954, almost 8 years since the devastating 1946 flood, a flash flood devastated the village once again; the river rose by more than 6 ft in less than two hours, with flood water entering properties at over 2 ft every 15 minutes. The Dusty Miller Inn had almost 4 ft of water in its bar area. Flood alleviation works in the 1960s uncovered that County Bridge was standing on foundations untouched since the wooden bridge 17th century, so as part of the works the bridge&#x27;s foundations were quickly filled with concrete.

===2012===
A flash flood occurred in July 2012, when a downpour lasting just 90 minutes devastated the village. This was a repeat of another flash flood of June, in the same year, where more than 50 mm of rain fell causing the River Calder to burst its banks. More than 5,000 properties were severely damaged in the Upper Calder Valley; many businesses lost insurance and consequently many never recovered.

===2015===
Mytholmroyd was severely affected by the Boxing Day floods in 2015, when the River Calder and the canal both rose to cover the valley floor, and consequently the town centre of Mytholmroyd. It was the highest ever recorded river level. Hundreds of homes and businesses were devastated, with some buildings still empty in 2017. The row of shops north of County Bridge partially collapsed into the river, and £10 million was earmarked for future protection of the village. The whole row of shops which partially collapsed have been fully demolished, along with homes along the riverbank at Calder Grove. By 2018, Russell Dean Furnishers had their furniture showroom above ground level and the Co-op Food built a replacement store.

===2020===
On 9 February 2020, Storm Ciara caused a month-and-a-half&#x27;s worth of rain to fall on Mytholmroyd within 24 hours. This caused widespread flooding. The EA Flood alleviation scheme was not yet complete so householders and businesses were once again affected.

==Education==
Mytholmroyd is the home of Calder High School, the largest Comprehensive School in the Upper Calder Valley. It is also home to Scout Road Academy and Burnley Road Academy - where a young Ted Hughes attended. In 2016, plans were announced by Calderdale Council to re-locate Cragg Vale School into Calder High School&#x27;s sixth form. This is now completed and the new &quot;Calder Primary&quot; is in its 3rd year.

==Culture==
Mytholmroyd Community Centre hosts the annual Dock Pudding Championships, in April. In 2007 Robbie Coltrane entered the competition and was awarded second place.

Award winning authors Benjamin Myers and Adele Stripe both lived Here, writing award winning books like &quot;The Gallows Pole&quot;, &quot;Under the Rock&quot;, &quot;Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile&quot;.

Married comedians Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont, during an interview in the &quot;Halifax Courier&quot; headlined &quot;Mytholmroyd&#x27;s Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont tell us about their brand new sitcom&quot;, talked about their TV show &quot;Meet the Richardsons&quot;, which includes fellow comedians and their Hebden Bridge neighbours, and spoke about including a Dock Pudding competition.

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party (2015-2020), visited Mytholmroyd Community Centre twice. Once in May 2018 and also in November 2019 as part of local and national elections. On both occasions he spoke to a packed room of invited Labour Party members.

The Scout Rock on the south side of the valley in Mytholmroyd features heavily in Ted Hughes&#x27; autobiography, &quot;The Rock&quot;. Hughes was born in the village, before moving to Mexborough, but latterly owned a property in Mytholmroyd in his adulthood. Hughes claimed that Scout Rock cast its mood over the village. Local writer Ben Myers also used Scout Rock as a backdrop for his non-fiction book &quot;Under the Rock&quot; released in 2018 which charts his time here after moving to the Calder Valley from London.

Mytholmroyd has four breweries: The Nightjar Brewing Co, Little Valley Brewery, Equinox Kombucha and Vocation. The breweries supply locally and nationally and two have bars in Hebden Bridge. Barbarys, which opened in 2019, is a small craft bar by the Caldene bridge, and is named after an old haunt of the Cragg Vale Coiners which was sited 50 yards away.

===Literature===

Mytholmroyd is the primary setting in the post apocalyptic Rampart Trilogy series by British writer M. R. Carey. In these books, where many names are lost to time, it is called the village of Mythen Rood.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The village is served by Mytholmroyd railway station, located on New Road, Northern operate a two per-hour service between Leeds and Manchester. However, more frequent services from Hebden Bridge are often used by Mytholmroyd residents, with direct services to Blackpool, Manchester, York, Leeds, Burnley, Rochdale and more. The Calder Valley Line railway was completed in 1841 but there was no station at Mytholmroyd which shows how few people lived here in 1840.

===Road===
The village has two bus stops in the village centre—recently equipped with departure screens and new shelters. Local bus services are shared between TLC Travel (operating the 597, 900 and 901) and First West Yorkshire (operating the 590 and 592), which serve the village. Cycling is very popular in the area since recent investment including the resurfacing of the Rochdale Canal and Route 66 Cycleway and Le Tour de France passing through the village. The Tour de Yorkshire passed through the village in 2018, and Cragg Vale, also in Mytholmroyd, has the longest continuous climb in England.

<text>Heptonstall is a small village and civil parish within the Calderdale borough of West Yorkshire, England, historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The population of Heptonstall, including the hamlets of Colden and Slack, is 1,448, increasing to 1,470 at the 2011 Census. The town of Hebden Bridge lies directly to the south-east. Although Heptonstall is part of Hebden Bridge as a post town, it is not within the Hebden Royd town boundaries.

The village is on the route of the Calderdale Way, a circular walk around the hills and valleys of Calderdale.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Heptonstall&#x27; is first recorded as &quot;Heptonstall&quot; in the 1274 Wakefield Court Rolls, and in 1316 in the &quot;Feudal Aids&quot;. The name means &quot;the stall or stable in Hebden&quot;. The name &#x27;Hebden&#x27; means &quot;rose-hip dene or valley&quot;.

Heptonstall initially formed part of the manor of Halifax-cum-Heptonstall, itself subinfeudatory to the manor of Wakefield, and so does not explicitly appear in early taxation records, such as those for the 1379 Poll Tax. In 1626 the manor was spun-off and sold and was extinguished in the late 19th century.

Heptonstall was the site of a battle during the early part of the English Civil War in 1643.

Historically a centre for hand-loom weaving, Heptonstall&#x27;s cottages and terraced houses are characterised by large first-floor windows to maximise the light for weaving.

The older churchyard claims &quot;King&quot; David Hartley amongst notable graves there. Hartley was founder of the Cragg Coiners and lived as a rogue in the Calderdale area until he was hanged at Knavesmire (Tyburn) near York in 1770.

The foundation stone of its octagonal Methodist chapel, the oldest still in continued use, was laid following the visit of John Wesley in 1764.

In the mid-1980s the paving on a road through Heptonstall was removed, revealing the original stone setts. Although there was a plan to remove the setts, local protests convinced the council to restore them. At the same time the existing concrete street lights were replaced with late 19th-century cast-iron gas-style electric lamps. Both developments acted as a traffic calming measure.

==Community==

A small local-history museum is based in what was once the village grammar school.

A local park is used for sport and includes a playground for children. Adjacent to Heptonstall lie the National Trust woodlands of Hardcastle Crags with walking paths and a restored 19th-century mill. Half a mile out of the village is Lumb Bank, the second of the Arvon Foundation&#x27;s residential centres for writers.

Each year on Good Friday there are performances of the Heptonstall version of the traditional Pace Egg play. These are held in Weavers&#x27; Square next to the old graveyard. Heptonstall Festival, a free, day-long music festival, is usually held in early July also in Weaver&#x27;s Square. It usually begins with a fell race.

The village is a day-trip destination for tourists and walkers, especially in the summer months. The two public houses are the Cross and the White Lion. There is a small post office – the original post office, on Smithwell Lane, is now a residential property. A cafe/delicatessen is situated in Towngate.

The village&#x27;s oldest house is Stag Cottage (c.1580), which is within a small courtyard called Stag Fold. At the back of the cottage, on the level of a public car park, is a doorway to a dungeon, once used as a lock-up. Nearby there is a pinfold, built to hold livestock, but now a picnic area.
===Parish church===

Heptonstall&#x27;s original church was dedicated to St Thomas Becket. It was founded c.1260, and was altered and added to over several centuries. The church was damaged by a gale in 1847, and is now only a shell. A new church, St Thomas the Apostle, was built in the same churchyard. This suffered a lightning strike in 1875.

The church is used for the annual Pennine Spring Music Festival, held every Spring Bank Holiday week. This includes workshops, masterclasses and performances. The old church ruin is occasionally used for open-air services.

The tower of the new church contains eight bells, cast in 1912 by John Taylor &amp; Co. These were removed to a bell foundry for refurbishment on 31 August 2012 and were returned, with new bearings, in October 2012.

The American poet Sylvia Plath, who was married to Poet Laureate Ted Hughes from nearby Mytholmroyd, is buried in the graveyard extension, to the south-west of St Thomas Becket&#x27;s churchyard. Plath&#x27;s headstone has been several times vandalised by removing Hughes&#x27;s surname from the memorial.

Another poet buried here is the American expatriate Asa Benveniste, a co-founder in London of the publisher Trigram Press. In the 1980s Benveniste and his partner Agnetha Falk ran a second-hand bookshop in Hebden Bridge. His gravestone reads: &quot;Foolish Enough to Have Been a Poet&quot;.

===Methodist chapel===

John Wesley laid the foundation stone of the octagonal chapel situated off Northgate, which was completed in 1764 – he recommended the shape to avoid conflict with the established church. Local people attended the parish church and Methodist preaching. The chapel also provided teaching in reading and writing for the poor. The chapel was originally built as a symmetrical octagon but by 1802, with the Society including 337 members and 1,002 scholars, one end of the chapel was pulled down and the side walls were extended to provide extra space.

==Media==
Heptonstall Methodist Chapel featured in the BBC Four 2010 series &quot;Churches: How to Read Them&quot;, in which Richard Taylor named it as one of his ten favourite churches, saying: &quot;If buildings have an aura, this one radiated friendship.&quot;

The ruin of St Thomas a Becket church featured as a location in the 1993 BBC Television drama series Mr. Wroe&#x27;s Virgins directed by Danny Boyle.

The village was the main location used in the BBC Three situation comedy &quot;The Gemma Factor&quot;, with the local tearoom being used for a major part of the show. It was aired in spring 2010.

Heptonstall was a major location in &quot;The Rochdale Pioneers&quot;, a film produced by the Co-operative British Youth Film Academy, telling the story of the birth of the Co-operative movement, and screened in November 2012.

Heptonstall is also featured in the 2010 short film &quot;Trailing Dirt&quot;, directed by Richard Cousins and written by Alison Flack.

The 2014 BBC drama &quot;Happy Valley&quot; was partly filmed in Heptonstall, and featured Sylvia Plath&#x27;s grave.

The BBC drama &quot;The Gallows Pole&quot; was partly filmed in Heptonstall, an adaptation of a book by Benjamin Myers. It told the story of the Cragg Vale Coiners, who clipped coins. This involved clipping the edges off coins and melting them down to make new coins out of the scraps. It happened on such a large scale, it threatened to devalue the currency. The grave of &quot;King&quot; David Hartley can be seen in the churchyard of St Thomas&#x27; Church, Heptonstall.

<text>In computer science, interprocess communication (IPC) is the sharing of data between running processes in a computer system. Mechanisms for IPC may be provided by an operating system. Applications which use IPC are often categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests. Many applications are both clients and servers, as commonly seen in distributed computing.

IPC is very important to the design process for microkernels and nanokernels, which reduce the number of functionalities provided by the kernel. Those functionalities are then obtained by communicating with servers via IPC, leading to a large increase in communication when compared to a regular monolithic kernel. IPC interfaces generally encompass variable analytic framework structures. These processes ensure compatibility between the multi-vector protocols upon which IPC models rely.

An IPC mechanism is either synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronization primitives may be used to have synchronous behavior with an asynchronous IPC mechanism.

== Disadvantages ==
Merging data from two processes can often incur significantly higher costs compared to processing the same data on a single thread, potentially by two or more orders of magnitude due to overheads such as inter-process communication and synchronization. 

== Approaches ==
Different approaches to IPC have been tailored to different software requirements, such as performance, modularity, and system circumstances such as network bandwidth and latency.

== Applications ==
=== Remote procedure call interfaces ===
* Java&#x27;s Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
* ONC RPC
* XML-RPC or SOAP
* JSON-RPC
* Message Bus (Mbus) (specified in RFC 3259) (not to be confused with M-Bus)
* .NET Remoting
*gRPC

=== Platform communication stack ===
The following are messaging, and information systems that utilize IPC mechanisms but don&#x27;t implement IPC themselves:
* KDE&#x27;s Desktop Communications Protocol (DCOP) deprecated by D-Bus
* D-Bus
* OpenWrt uses ubus micro bus architecture
* MCAPI Multicore Communications API
* SIMPL The Synchronous Interprocess Messaging Project for Linux (SIMPL)
* 9P (Plan 9 Filesystem Protocol)
* Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
* Thrift
* ZeroC&#x27;s Internet Communications Engine (ICE)
* ØMQ
* Enduro/X Middleware
* YAMI4
* Enlightenment_(software) E16 uses eesh as an IPC
=== Operating system communication stack ===
The following are platform or programming language-specific APIs:

* Apple Computer&#x27;s Apple events, previously known as Interapplication Communications (IAC)
* ARexx ports
* Enea&#x27;s LINX for Linux (open source) and various DSP and general-purpose processors under OSE
* The Mach kernel&#x27;s Mach Ports
* Microsoft&#x27;s ActiveX, Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft Transaction Server (COM+), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), anonymous pipes, named pipes, Local Procedure Call, MailSlots, Message loop, MSRPC, .NET Remoting, and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
* Novell&#x27;s SPX
* POSIX mmap, message queues, semaphores, and shared memory
* RISC OS&#x27;s messages
* Solaris Doors
* System V&#x27;s message queues, semaphores, and shared memory
* Linux Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC)
* OpenBinder Open binder
* QNX&#x27;s PPS (Persistent Publish/Subscribe) service
=== Distributed object models ===
The following are platform or programming language specific-APIs that use IPC, but do not themselves implement it:

* Libt2n for C++ under Linux only, handles complex objects and exceptions
* PHP&#x27;s sessions
* Distributed Ruby
* Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
* Electron&#x27;s asynchronous IPC, shares JSON objects between a main and a renderer process

* Berkeley sockets
* Computer network programming
* Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP paradigm)
* Data Distribution Service
* Database-as-IPC
* Protected procedure call

<text>Hebden Bridge is a market town in the Calderdale district of West Yorkshire, England. It is in the Upper Calder Valley, west of Halifax and 14 miles (21 km) north-east of Rochdale, at the confluence of the River Calder and the Hebden Water. The town is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Hebden Royd.

In 2015, the Calder ward, covering Hebden Bridge, Old Town, and part of Todmorden, had a population of 12,167. The town had a population of 4,500.

==History==

The original settlement was the hilltop village of Heptonstall. Hebden Bridge (&quot;Heptenbryge&quot;) started as a settlement where the Halifax to Burnley packhorse route dropped into the valley and crossed the River Hebden where the old bridge (from which it gets its name) stands. The name Hebden comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Heopa Denu&quot;, &#x27;Bramble (or possibly Wild Rose) Valley&#x27;.

Steep hills with fast-flowing streams and access to major wool markets meant that Hebden Bridge was ideal for water-powered weaving mills and the town developed during the 19th and 20th centuries; it is said that at one time Hebden was known as &quot;Trouser Town&quot; because of the large amount of clothing manufacturing. Watercolour artist Thomas Frederick Worrall, who lived in nearby Pecket Well, depicted the mills in around 1900. Drainage of the marshland, which covered much of the Upper Calder Valley before the Industrial Revolution, enabled construction of the road which runs through the valley. Before it was built, travel was only possible via the ancient packhorse route which ran along the hilltop, dropping into the valleys wherever necessary. The wool trade was served by the Rochdale Canal (running from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester) and the Manchester &amp; Leeds Railway (later the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway) (running from Leeds to Manchester and Burnley).

Hebden Bridge also grew to include a Picture House (seating 500), which remains open to present day, and offices for Hebden Bridge Urban District Council. Hebden Bridge has no swimming pool, although for some years there was a small training pool for children in the adult education centre on Pitt Street. Hebden Bridge had its own cooperative society but, during the 1960s, it was defrauded and went bankrupt. The old Co-op building became a hotel and was later converted into flats. The Co-op returned in the 1980s with a supermarket on Market Street, on the site of an old mill.

During the Second World War Hebden Bridge was designated a &quot;reception area&quot; and took in evacuees from industrial cities.

During the 1970s and 1980s the town saw an influx of artists, writers, photographers, musicians, alternative practitioners, teachers, Green and New Age activists and more recently, wealthier &#x27;yuppie&#x27; types . This in turn saw a boom in tourism to the area. During the 1990s Hebden Bridge became a commuter town, because of its proximity to major towns and cities both sides of the Pennines and its excellent rail links to Manchester, Bradford and Leeds.

On 6 July 2003, Hebden Bridge was granted Fairtrade Zone status. On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France, from York to Sheffield, passed through the town.

==Governance==

Hebden Bridge was a chapelry in the parish of Halifax. On 31 December 1894 Hebden Bridge became a civil parish formed from Wadsworth, Heptonstall, Erringden and Stansfield. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Hebden Bridge. In 1931 the parish had a population of 6312.

Hebden Bridge Urban District was established in 1894. In 1937, the council merged with Mytholmroyd Urban District to become Hebden Royd Urban District. Hebden Bridge Urban District was administered as part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. These were abolished in the reforms introduced in the Local Government Act 1972. They were replaced by West Yorkshire, the metropolitan borough of Calderdale and Hebden Royd Town Parish. The town council is a parish council. Recently, it has attracted praise for its commitment to eco-friendly policies, following the example of Modbury in effectively banning all plastic shopping bags, thus becoming the largest community in Europe to do so. The ban is not legally enforceable, but rather a voluntary agreement between local shop owners and the community at large.

Hebden Bridge Town Hall and adjoining fire station is a Grade II listed building, built in 1898. The building was transferred from Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council to Hebden Bridge Community Association on a 40-year lease (now extended to 125 years) on 1 April 2010, along with funds for basic maintenance work. Substantial volunteer time was put into renovation works and fundraising to secure the building&#x27;s future. The £3.7 million raised was used to create a small enterprise centre and new community facilities on land adjacent. More than 450 local people signed up as &quot;Friends of the Town Hall&quot; and became able to vote for the trustees.

==Geography==
Hebden Bridge lies close to the Pennine Way and Hardcastle Crags and is popular for outdoor pursuits such as walking, climbing and cycling. It lies on the Rochdale Canal – a through route across the Pennines.
The town is on the route of the Calderdale Way, a circular walk of about around the hills and valleys of Calderdale, and it is connected with the Pennine Way through the &quot;Hebden Bridge Loop&quot;.

===Flooding===
The town&#x27;s location in the valley causes problems with flooding particularly between Hebden Water and the cinema on New Road, Brearley Fields in Mytholmroyd, and further up the valley at Callis Bridge by the sewage works and the old Aquaspersions factory. Flooding at Callis Bridge is so frequent that the level of the River Calder has been lowered and special perforated kerbstones fitted so that water can drain back into the river. Brearley on a flood plain contains the playing fields for Calder High School and local football, rugby league and cricket teams. Hebden Bridge suffered two devastating floods in the summer of 2012, and again on Boxing Day 2015; Todmorden, Mytholmroyd, Sowerby Bridge and York were also affected, with houses, pubs, shops and community centres suffering damage to property. The extent of the Hebden Bridge flooding was shown in drone videos of the flooded areas, the most severe flooding occurring in Hebden Bridge town centre.

==Demography==

Hebden Bridge is a popular place to live. However, space is limited due to the steep valleys and lack of flat land. In the past, this led to &quot;upstairs-downstairs&quot; houses known as &quot;over and under dwellings&quot; (cf the back-to-back houses in nearby industrial cities). These were houses built in terraces with 4–5 storeys. The upper storeys face uphill while the lower ones face downhill with their back wall against the hillside. The bottom 2 storeys would be one house while the upper 2–3 storeys would be another. This also led to unusual legal arrangements such as the &quot;flying freehold&quot;, where the shared floor/ceiling is wholly owned by the underdwelling.

Population changes in the 1990s led to a demand for more houses. This has proved to be extremely controversial for a number of reasons. The limited availability of houses has meant that prices have risen sharply (for example, a house valued at £54,000 in 1998 was valued at nearly £150,000 in 2004). Demand for new houses is also a contentious issue as many of the sites for proposed development are areas such as fields or woodland that some local residents feel should be left as they are.

Hebden Bridge has attracted artists, and has developed a small New Age community. In the 1980s and 1990s, a prominent lesbian intentional community grew up in nearby Todmorden, and subsequently Hebden Bridge, &quot;promot[ing] forms of queer intimacy outside of the nuclear family unit&quot;, with &quot;a close-knit community of care&quot; and mutual support, sharing childcare and community events, such as a &quot;famous Todmorden Women’s Disco&quot; held monthly. The nature of that community has changed with evolving queer politics, away from lesbian feminism and towards &quot;homonormative assimilation&quot;. Hebden Bridge had the highest number of lesbians per head in the UK.

In April 2005, Hebden Bridge was named the fourth quirkiest place in the world by &quot;High Life&quot; (the British Airways flight magazine) and was described as &quot;modern and stylish in an unconventional and stylish way&quot;.

The town was documented in the 2009 film &quot;Shed Your Tears And Walk Away&quot;, which made controversial claims about the levels of drug and alcohol abuse in the town, and consequent deaths among young people.

==Economy==

, the weekly market has moved to Lees Yard adjoining the pedestrian centre of St George Square, and the market days have been increased from two and a half to four full weekly market days: Thursdays to Sundays.

Walkley&#x27;s Clog Mill is one of the country&#x27;s leading clog manufacturers. It moved from its original home at Falling Royd to a site on Midgley Road in Mytholmroyd.

Acre Mill was an asbestos factory in the hilltop settlement of Old Town, owned by Cape Insulation Ltd. It was opened in 1939 to meet the demand for gas mask filters made from blue asbestos during the Second World War, and diversified into the production of other asbestos products, including rope, pipe lagging and textile, after the war. In 1970, the company closed the mill and moved to Westmorland. The mill was the subject of a 1971 &quot;World in Action&quot; investigation entitled &quot;The Dust at Acre Mill&quot; which revealed how the factory broke the law regarding asbestos-dust control between 1940 and 1970. By 1979, 12% of a total of 2,200 former employees had asbestos-related disease. The mill was demolished in 1979. Cape Insulation also operated a second factory at Hangingroyd Mill.

Hebden Bridge has built a reputation for &quot;great little shops&quot; and has an unusually high density of independent shops for a UK town of its size with more than 20 cafes and tea rooms, and about 20 pubs, micro pubs and restaurants. In a national survey by the New Economics Foundation in 2010 Hebden Bridge was ranked sixth on a diversity scale and was praised for its independent shops and unique shopping experience. The Fox and Goose, West Yorkshire&#x27;s first Co-Operative pub, is owned by 262 residents of Hebden Bridge. It was established in March 2014.

In February 2016, Hebden Bridge won as the &quot;Best Small Outdoor Market&quot; in the Great British Market Awards run by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA). In December 2016, Hebden Bridge won the &quot;Great British High Street Award&quot; in the &quot;Small Market Town&quot; category, after most shops, cafes and businesses had bounced back better and more flood resilient than before the Boxing Day floods 2015; Hebden Bridge also won a second award as the People&#x27;s Choice.
==Culture==

Hebden Bridge is known as &quot;the lesbian capital of the UK&quot;.

The Stubbing Wharf is an 18th-century inn located alongside the Rochdale Canal, in which the poet Ted Hughes set his poem &quot;Stubbing Wharfe&quot;. Hughes was born in neighbouring Mytholmroyd, and his former home Lumb Bank on the outskirts of Hebden Bridge is run as a creative writing centre by the Arvon Trust.

The video for the Talk Talk song &quot;My Foolish Friend&quot; was filmed in and around Hebden Bridge in 1983. The band The Dream Academy filmed the first video for their hit single &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot; in Hebden Bridge in 1984. The singer Haddaway also filmed a music video in the town in 1995 for his single &quot;Lover Be Thy Name&quot;.

The BBC One crime drama series &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, written by Huddersfield-born Sally Wainwright, broadcast in 2014-2023, was filmed and set in and around the town. Its ironic title refers to the drug users and providers in the area. Local landmarks, such as the graveyard at St Thomas the Apostle Church, the canal and the landscapes provided a backdrop to the narrative. The show received critical acclaim and was expected to lead to a noticeable increase in local tourism. A second series was filmed in 2015 and broadcast during 2016.

In 2020, Steve Coogan&#x27;s &quot;From the Oasthouse&quot; podcast featured his character Alan Partridge stating that his daughter Denise lived in Hebden Bridge, which Partridge says explains her reluctance to have children.

===Music===
The Trades Club is a nationally recognised music venue and socialist members&#x27; club. In the 1980s and 90s, the club became a renowned World Music destination for touring bands from Africa and elsewhere, including Thomas Mapfumo, Ali Farka Touré, and John Chibadura. Heavenly Recordings have a close association with the Trades Club and celebrated their 25th birthday with &#x27;A Heavenly Weekend In Hebden&#x27;, a four-day festival at the Trades Club, featuring performances from many of the artists on their roster and film screenings from Heavenly Films. The event was given its own catalogue number: HVN300.

Until 2014, the town hosted the Hebden Bridge Blues Festival during the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. Established in 2011, the festival was voted the Best British Blues Festival in the 2012 and 2013 British Blues Awards.

The indie band Bogshed were formed in Hebden Bridge in 1984, originally as the &#x27;Amazing Roy North Penis Band&#x27;.

In 2017, the Hebden Bridge Community Association received The Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service, the MBE for voluntary groups.

<text>The Scalable Coherent Interface or Scalable Coherent Interconnect (SCI), is a high-speed interconnect standard for shared memory multiprocessing and message passing. The goal was to scale well, provide system-wide memory coherence and a simple interface; i.e. a standard to replace existing buses in multiprocessor systems with one with no inherent scalability and performance limitations.

The IEEE Std 1596-1992, IEEE Standard for Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) was approved by the IEEE standards board on March 19, 1992. It saw some use during the 1990s, but never became widely used and has been replaced by other systems from the early 2000s.

==History==
Soon after the Fastbus (IEEE 960) follow-on Futurebus (IEEE 896) project in 1987, some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s.
In response, a &quot;Superbus&quot; study group was formed in November 1987.
Another working group of the standards association of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in July 1988.
It was essentially a subset of Futurebus features that could be easily implemented at high speed, along with minor additions to make it easier to connect to other systems, such as VMEbus. Most of the developers had their background from high-speed computer buses. Representatives from companies in the computer industry and research community included Amdahl, Apple Computer, BB&amp;N, Hewlett-Packard, CERN, Dolphin Server Technology, Cray Research, Sequent, AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment Corporation, McDonnell Douglas, National Semiconductor, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Tektronix, Texas Instruments, Unisys, University of Oslo, University of Wisconsin.

The original intent was a single standard for all buses in the computer.
The working group soon came up with the idea of using point-to-point communication in the form of insertion rings. This avoided the lumped capacitance, limited physical length/speed of light problems and stub reflections in addition to allowing parallel transactions. The use of insertion rings is credited to Manolis Katevenis who suggested it at one of the early meetings of the working group. The working group for developing the standard was led by David B. Gustavson (chair) and David V. James (Vice Chair).

David V. James was a major contributor for writing the specifications including the executable C-code. Stein Gjessing’s group at the University of Oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and Dolphin Server Technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic.
Different versions and derivatives of SCI were implemented by companies like Dolphin Interconnect Solutions, Convex, Data General AViiON (using cache controller and link controller chips from Dolphin), Sequent and Cray Research. Dolphin Interconnect Solutions implemented a PCI and PCI-Express connected derivative of SCI that provides non-coherent shared memory access. This implementation was used by Sun Microsystems for its high-end clusters, Thales Group and several others including volume applications for message passing within HPC clustering and medical imaging. 
SCI was often used to implement non-uniform memory access architectures.
It was also used by Sequent Computer Systems as the processor memory bus in their NUMA-Q systems. Numascale developed a derivative to connect with coherent HyperTransport.

==The standard==
The standard defined two interface levels: 
*The physical level that deals with electrical signals, connectors, mechanical and thermal conditions 
*The logical level that describes the address space, data transfer protocols, cache coherence mechanisms, synchronization primitives, control and status registers, and initialization and error recovery facilities. 

This structure allowed new developments in physical interface technology to be easily adapted without any redesign on the logical level.

Scalability for large systems is achieved through a distributed directory-based cache coherence model. (The other popular models for cache coherency are based on system-wide eavesdropping (snooping) of memory transactions – a scheme which is not very scalable.) In SCI each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line.

SCI defines a 64-bit flat address space (16 exabytes) where 16 bits are used for identifying a node (65,536 nodes) and 48 bits for address within the node (256 terabytes). A node can contain many processors and/or memory. The SCI standard defines a packet switched network.

===Topologies===
SCI can be used to build systems with different types of switching topologies from centralized to fully distributed switching:

*With a central switch, each node is connected to the switch with a ringlet (in this case a two-node ring). 
*In distributed switching systems, each node can be connected to a ring of arbitrary length and either all or some of the nodes can be connected to two or more rings. 

The most common way to describe these multi-dimensional topologies is k-ary n-cubes (or tori). The SCI standard specification mentions several such topologies as examples.

The 2-D torus is a combination of rings in two dimensions. Switching between the two dimensions requires a small switching capability in the node. This can be expanded to three or more dimensions. The concept of folding rings can also be applied to the Torus topologies to avoid any long connection segments.

===Transactions===
SCI sends information in packets. Each packet consists of an unbroken sequence of 16-bit symbols. The symbol is accompanied by a flag bit. A transition of the flag bit from 0 to 1 indicates the start of a packet. A transition from 1 to 0 occurs 1 (for echoes) or 4 symbols before the packet end. A packet contains a header with address command and status information, payload (from 0 through optional lengths of data) and a CRC check symbol. The first symbol in the packet header contains the destination node address. If the address is not within the domain handled by the receiving node, the packet is passed to the output through the bypass FIFO. In the other case, the packet is fed to a receive queue and may be transferred to a ring in another dimension. All packets are marked when they pass the scrubber (a node is established as scrubber when the ring is initialized). Packets without a valid destination address will be removed when passing the scrubber for the second time to avoid filling the ring with packets that would otherwise circulate indefinitely.

===Cache coherence===
Cache coherence ensures data consistency in multiprocessor systems. The simplest form applied in earlier systems was based on clearing the cache contents between context switches and disabling the cache for data that were shared between two or more processors. These methods were feasible when the performance difference between the cache and memory were less than one order of magnitude. Modern processors with caches that are more than two orders of magnitude faster than main memory would not perform anywhere near optimal without more sophisticated methods for data consistency. Bus based systems use eavesdropping (snooping) methods since buses are inherently broadcast. Modern systems with point-to point links use broadcast methods with snoop filter options to improve performance. Since broadcast and eavesdropping are inherently non-scalable, these are not used in SCI.

Instead, SCI uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line. Each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory (same line length as the cache line). The memory tag holds a pointer to the head of the linked list and a state code for the line (three states – home, fresh, gone). Associated with each node is also a cache for holding remote data with a directory containing forward and backward pointers to nodes in the linked list sharing the cache line. The tag for the cache has seven states (invalid, only fresh, head fresh, only dirty, head dirty, mid valid, tail valid).

The distributed directory is scalable. The overhead for the directory based cache coherence is a constant percentage of the node’s memory and cache. This percentage is in the order of 4% for the memory and 7% for the cache.

==Legacy==
SCI is a standard for connecting the different resources within a multiprocessor computer system, and it is not as widely known to the public as for example the Ethernet family for connecting different systems. Different system vendors implemented different variants of SCI for their internal system infrastructure. These different implementations interface to very intricate mechanisms in processors and memory systems and each vendor has to preserve some degrees of compatibility for both hardware and software.

Gustavson led a group called the Scalable Coherent Interface and Serial Express Users, Developers, and Manufacturers Association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996. A series of workshops were held through 1999.
After the first 1992 edition, follow-on projects defined shared data formats in 1993, a version using low-voltage differential signaling in 1996, and a memory interface known as Ramlink later in 1996.
In January 1998, the SLDRAM corporation was formed to hold patents on an attempt to define a new memory interface that was related to another working group called SerialExpress or Local Area Memory Port.
However, by early 1999 the new memory standard was abandoned.

In 1999 a series of papers was published as a book on SCI.
An updated specification was published in July 2000 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 13961.

<text>Newmillerdam is a village and suburb of Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, England. The name refers to the lake and country park adjacent to the village. The park is a local nature reserve.

Formerly known as Thurstonhaigh, the village is currently named from the construction of a grain mill powered by water from the dammed lake, and thus it is called the new mill on the dam. The mill still stands, although it is non-operational and privately owned. The mill was originally owned and operated by the Pashley family, who lived in the village until the 1980s. The Pashleys owned many local businesses during the centuries, which included blacksmiths, coal mines and a furniture making business. These furniture makers were also general carpenters and installed one of the first public toilets in the yard of The Three Houses Public House in 1852.

The Pashley family were Methodists and were provided money to build two chapels in the village. The chapels are situated on School Hill and Barnsley Road. The Pashley reference is noted by the dedication stones to William M Pashley. The family also funded and built Newmillerdam School, which is located on School Hill. However, the landowning gentry of the time, the Pilkington family, took most of the credit and introduced the Miss Pilkington Scripture Prize as an annual award in the school. One of the last pupils to receive this prize before the school was closed and sold by the local council was a Pashley family member, Sharon Mulheir (now Smith). She is the great-great-great-great-granddaughter of the school&#x27;s founder, William Pashley.
Chevet Hall was a mansion that stood on the site of an older hall to the east of Newmillerdam and was built in 1529 by the Neviles. The hall was demolished as a result of mining subsidence in the 1960s, despite a massive outcry from locals. In 1765, the hall and estate was acquired by the Pilkingtons; in 1820, they built the boathouse on the lake on their private grounds. The Pilkingtons built lodges around their private estate to deter poachers; some of them survived. It was opened to the public after Wakefield Council bought the estate in 1954. The boathouse is a Grade II listed building.

There was a Newmillerdam Colliery, close to the small village of Hall Green; it closed in 1981. As with many Wakefield collieries, the closure was agreed with the NUM on the basis that the workers could transfer to the new Selby Coalfield.

Seckar Woods nature reserve, located near the more affluent village of Woolley, is an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest).

<text>In mathematics, the term linear function refers to two distinct but related notions:
* In calculus and related areas, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line, that is, a polynomial function of degree zero or one. For distinguishing such a linear function from the other concept, the term &quot;affine function&quot; is often used.
* In linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and functional analysis, a linear function is a linear map.

== As a polynomial function ==

In calculus, analytic geometry and related areas, a linear function is a polynomial of degree one or less, including the zero polynomial (the latter not being considered to have degree zero).

When the function is of only one variable, it is of the form
:formula_1
where and are constants, often real numbers. The graph of such a function of one variable is a nonvertical line. is frequently referred to as the slope of the line, and as the intercept.

If &quot;a &gt; 0&quot; then the gradient is positive and the graph slopes upwards.

If &quot;a &lt; 0&quot; then the gradient is negative and the graph slopes downwards.

For a function formula_2 of any finite number of variables, the general formula is
:formula_3
and the graph is a hyperplane of dimension .

A constant function is also considered linear in this context, as it is a polynomial of degree zero or is the zero polynomial. Its graph, when there is only one variable, is a horizontal line.

In this context, a function that is also a linear map (the other meaning) may be referred to as a homogeneous linear function or a linear form. In the context of linear algebra, the polynomial functions of degree 0 or 1 are the scalar-valued affine maps.

== As a linear map ==

In linear algebra, a linear function is a map &quot;f&quot; between two vector spaces such that
:formula_4
:formula_5
Here denotes a constant belonging to some field of scalars (for example, the real numbers) and and are elements of a vector space, which might be itself.

In other terms the linear function preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Some authors use &quot;linear function&quot; only for linear maps that take values in the scalar field; these are more commonly called linear forms.

The &quot;linear functions&quot; of calculus qualify as &quot;linear maps&quot; when (and only when) , or, equivalently, when the constant equals zero in the one-degree polynomial above. Geometrically, the graph of the function must pass through the origin.

<text>Nostell is an estate about 4 miles ESE of Wakefield the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. It is in the civil parish of Huntwick with Foulby and Nostell which had a population of 90 in 2001, and 164 at the 2011 census (including Wintersett). 

The Nostell Estate was centred on Nostell Priory, an 18th-century Palladian historic house, on the site of an Augustinian priory which received its charter in 1121. The house has interiors by Robert Adam and furniture by Thomas Chippendale. The house was owned by the Winn family and is now in the care of the National Trust. Wragby Church is at the entrance to the grounds of Nostell Priory.

Coal mining on the Nostell Estate began in the 9th century and continued until 1987. Nostell Colliery was known locally as &#x27;the family pit&#x27; due to the welfare schemes introduced by the Winn family far in advance of similar schemes before nationalisation. In 1880, terraced houses nicknamed &quot;Cribbin&#x27;s Lump&quot; were built close to the colliery. They were renamed &quot;New Crofton&quot; by Lord St Oswald but the nickname remained until the houses were demolished in the 1980s. Nostell Colliery closed in 1987.

Nostell Cricket Club was established pre-1897 opposite the priory entrance.

In the 1870–1872 &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot;, &quot;Foulby, Nostell and Huntwick&quot; was described as an extra-parochial tract within Pontefract parish, with a population of 145 people in 27 houses.

<doc id="152114" wikidata="Q4332480" url="?curid=152114" title="Oakworth">
<text>Oakworth is a village in the civil parish of Keighley, in the Bradford district, in West Yorkshire, England, near Keighley, by the River Worth. The name &quot;Oakworth&quot; indicates that the village was first established in a heavily wooded area.

Oakworth railway station is on the route of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway and was a location in the 1968 TV series and 1970 film &quot;The Railway Children&quot;.

==History==
On folio 301v of the Domesday Book of 1086, Oakworth is called &quot;Acurde&quot; which translated into an Oak clearing. It was taxed on c120 acres (c50 hectares) of arable ploughland shared by the Vikings Vilts and Gamel Bern. Vilts also owned Newsholme and Utley; and Gamel Bern was of the family of noblemen that held the most land in Northern England. However, later, on folio 327r, the Domesday Book states of Oakworth lands that &quot;Gamal Bern had them; Gilbert Tison has them&quot; for in the Harrying of the North all lands were taken from Anglo-Scandinavians and given to Norman Lords.

Oakworth was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Keighley, in 1894 Oakworth became an urban district, on 31 December 1894 Oakworth became a civil parish, being formed from the part of the parish of Keighley in Oakworth Urban District, on 1 April 1938 the district was abolished and merged with the Municipal Borough of Keighley. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Keighley. In 1931 the parish had a population of 3530.

== Landmarks ==

Holden Park in Oakworth occupies the grounds of an historic house owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an inventor who is said to have invented the lucifer match and revolutionised the process of wool carding. After Holden&#x27;s death in 1897, his house, called Oakworth House, and its contents were sold at auction, and the house was all but destroyed by fire in 1907. All that remains of the original building is the portico.

== Education ==
Oakworth Primary School is situated in the grounds of Sir Isaac Holden&#x27;s estate, along with Holden Park. The school playground has sloping sides because it was once a lake in the ornamental gardens in front of Oakworth House. The school is attended by children aged between 3 - 11. It has gone through many changes since it was first built. Its original name was &#x27;Oakworth First School&#x27;, which taught children up to the age of 9, when children would then progress to middle school. This system changed in 2000, so that Oakworth Primary School expanded to cover years 5 and 6.

<text>Ossett is a market town in the Wakefield district, in the county of West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated between Dewsbury, Horbury and Wakefield. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 21,861. Ossett forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Ossett&quot; derives from the Old English and is thought to be either &quot;the fold of a man named Osla&quot; or &quot; a fold frequented by blackbirds&quot;.
Ossett is sometimes misspelled as &quot;Osset&quot;. In Ellis&#x27; &quot;On Early English Pronunciation&quot;, one of the founding works of British linguistics, the incorrect spelling is used. The British Library has an online dialect study that uses the spelling. One new alternative theory is that it is the place where King Osbehrt died after receiving fatal wounds when fighting the Great Heathen Army of the Vikings at York on 21 March 867. An exceedingly rare clustering of high status Anglian graves, one bearing the Anglian royal symbol of the dragon and the name Osbehrt, was found in the churchyard at Thornhill Parish Church directly across the valley from – and within sight of – Ossett.

===Origins===
Ossett appears in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Osleset&quot; in the Manor of Wakefield. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; was compiled for William the Conqueror in 1086. &quot;Osleset&quot; was recorded as three and a half carucates which is the land needed to be ploughed by three teams of eight oxen. Woodland pasture measured &quot;half a league long as much broad&quot; (roughly six furlongs by six furlongs). Four villeins and three bordars lived in Osleset.

===Industrial Revolution===
Coal-mining was, up to the late 1960s, Ossett&#x27;s second industry in terms of people employed and the first in terms of males employed. Coal has been mined since the 14th century and there were a large number of pits in Ossett during the 19th century. The pits included Old Roundwood, opened in 1851 mining the Gawthorpe seam. The Haigh Moor seam opened in 1860 and the Silkstone seam opened in 1893. Pildacre pit shut due to flooding in 1875 but remained as a source of water for Ossett. Westfield shut in the early 1900s. The Chidswell riot in 1893 was caused by striking miners trying to reach Westfield to stop other miners working. Another pit down Healey Road was also the scene of tension between police and striking miners. Low Laithes pit shut in 1926, however the seams later flooded and were responsible for the Lofthouse Colliery disaster in 1973. Greatfield shut in the 1950s, Old Roundwood shut in 1966 and Shaw Cross, on the Ossett/Dewsbury border near the current Dewsbury Rugby League stadium, closed in 1968.
Author and local resident Stan Barstow said that Ossett and Horbury were the &quot;border country&quot; where the north-west of the coalfield merged with the south-east of the wool towns. Local historian John Goodchild said, &quot;The place was essentially one of small mines and small mills&quot;. The town was once a thriving centre of the &quot;shoddy&quot; industry; recycling woollen garments. Whilst some mill towns employed mostly females in its textile sector, Ossett&#x27;s mills always had roughly equal numbers of men and women. The town&#x27;s mills were generally small, but they had a reputation as high-quality producers. Whitehead&#x27;s Mill used to have a carnival float that said &quot;We Export to the World&quot; at the Gawthorpe May Pole parade.

During the 1970s, Woodhead Manufacturing employed 1,500 people on this site in its two premises fronting Church Street and Kingsway. The shock absorber business was the last part of the site operations to close in the early 1990s. The site is now a housing estate and Woodhead&#x27;s exists in name only and is run from an industrial estate in Leeds. 
There is however, a large old &#x27;mill type&#x27; building situated on Church Street, which, prior to its refurbishment, had shown Woodhead signage in large blue lettering on the buildings&#x27; facade. 
The building was for many years left in a very derelict and dangerous state, largely due to vandalism. Arson in particular inflicted significant damage, leaving the buildings&#x27; roof black and charred. 
Building work was attempted many times until the building was eventually renovated and converted into flats in 2016.
The yard and building has a large stone wall and locked iron gates to the front, which edges right up to the pavement on Church Street, and high metal fencing to the rear, which edges up to a grassed area next to the large housing estate. 
The housing estate situated at the rear, is fairly large and has a selection of mixed style and sized modern houses and four-storey flats, occupied by singletons, couples and families.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War, Ossett was accidentally bombed on 16 September 1940. Ten High Explosive bombs were dropped. No one was killed, save for a number of chickens and several properties were damaged. Later in the war a V-1&#x27;s engine was reportedly heard to cut out, and came down at Grange Moor, to the west of the town.

===Spa===
Ossett was, for a brief period in the 19th century, a spa town, having been founded by a local stonemason who was inspired by Harrogate and Cheltenham. The waters were popular with those seeking relief from certain skin diseases in the early 19th century, but it remained a small spa during this period. In the 1870s, a plan to transform Ossett into a &quot;second Harrogate&quot; ended in failure, and the spa closed as a result. The south-east of the town is still known as &quot;Ossett Spa&quot;.

==Governance==

Ossett cum Gawthorpe was a township in the ancient parish of Dewsbury; it became a civil parish in 1866, and was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Ossett in 1890. Under the Local Government Act 1972, it became an unparished area in the City of Wakefield. In an earlier draft of the Act, Ossett was to be part of the Kirklees district on the grounds that the area was originally part of the parish of Dewsbury; after an appeal by the Ossett Labour Party, it was decided Ossett would be part of the Wakefield district.

Ossett has changed its parliamentary constituency several times. Since the 2024 election, Ossett has been part of the Ossett and Denby Dale constituency, which is currently represented in Parliament by Jade Botterill of the Labour Party. Between 2010 and 2024, it was part of the Wakefield constituency; the MPs during this period were Mary Creagh, Imran Ahmad Khan and Simon Lightwood. 

In 1983, the town transferred from the Dewsbury seat to the Normanton constituency. When Ossett was part of the Dewsbury constituency, the MP was David Ginsburg, one of the Labour MPs who defected to the Social Democratic Party. On transferring to the Normanton constituency, the MP for many years was Bill O&#x27;Brien until he entered the House of Lords and was succeeded by Ed Balls.

Most of the town is in the Ossett ward on the local council, but the south-eastern part of the town is in the Horbury and South Ossett ward. The &quot;Ossett&quot; ward is extremely marginal, and has been won in the 21st century by Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and UKIP candidates at different times. As of 3 September 2024, the ward is represented by one Conservative councillor and two Labour councillors, whereas Horbury and South Ossett is represented by three Labour councillors.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Ossett experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom.

==Demography==
At the 2021 Census, the population was 21,861. Ossett&#x27;s convenient proximity to the M1 motorway has led the old industrial town to become more affluent in recent years, attracting both industry and resident commuters to Leeds. This leaves Ossett with higher priced housing compared to nearby areas.

==Economy==
There are four operational textile mills in the town: Ings Mill, on Dale Street, deals in recycled textiles; Burmatex Ltd, based at Victoria Mills on the Green produce carpet tiles; Edward Clay &amp; Son Ltd, Wesley Street manufactures felts for the mattress making and horticultural industries and Wilson Briggs &amp; Son by the River Calder off Healey Road deals with textile mill waste and remnant processing. Other have been converted into units, some of the most prominent being Royd&#x27;s Mill on the Leeds Road roundabout and the large congregation of mills in the Healey area. Some mills remain derelict.

Ossett is home to two real ale breweries. Ossett Brewery, located in Healey and Bob&#x27;s Brewing Company, formerly the Red Lion Brewery.

==Landmarks==

Trinity Church was consecrated in 1865 and its spire which rises to 226 feet is a landmark that can be seen for miles around.
A red phone booth in Ossett town centre, opposite the Kingsway roundabout, is a grade II listed building.
Ossett Town Hall celebrated its centenary in June 2008. Gawthorpe, an area of north Ossett, is known for its landmark water tower.

==Transport==
The Romans constructed a road from Halifax to Wakefield, this road became a turnpike road in 1741, its route is roughly similar to the modern day Dewsbury Road. Streetside Post Office is a reminder of the Roman origins of the road. The M1 motorway between Junctions 40 and 42 to the east of Ossett was opened in April 1967. The stretch from junction 38 to 40 was opened in October 1968. The Highways Agency have plans to widen the M1 to 4 lanes between Chesterfield and Leeds. In 2005 a bus station was opened in the town built by West Yorkshire Metro replacing an earlier bus station constructed in the 1970s.

The railways arrived in Ossett in 1862 when the Bradford, Wakefield &amp; Leeds Railway company opened a branch line to Flushdyke. The line was extended to Ossett in 1864 and then onto Dewsbury and Batley.
Ossett railway station, located roughly where Southdale Gardens now is, was opened in 1889 by the Great Northern Railway. The line ran underneath Station Road and the bump in the road today is the only reminder of the bridge that used to exist there until its removal in the 1980s. The railway station closed in 1964. The town was close to four other railway stations: Chickenley Heath closed in 1911, Earlsheaton in 1953, Flushdyke closed in 1941 and Horbury &amp; Ossett in 1970. It is now the largest town in Yorkshire and one of the largest towns in Britain without a railway station. Railway sidings and yards are still to be found at the old Horbury &amp; Ossett railway station site and Healey Mills Marshalling Yard where Queen Elizabeth II spent a night aboard the Royal Train during her 1977 Silver Jubilee tour.

In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies proposed Ossett, as one of seven English towns with a strong business case for the location of a new railway station. It is likely that an unstaffed station would be erected at Healey Mills.

Ossett bus station is situated in the town centre next to Prospect Road (B6128) and Ossett Town&#x27;s football ground. The bus station is managed and owned by West Yorkshire Metro, and was rebuilt in 2005; it has six stands and a real-time information board. The main operator at the bus station is Arriva Yorkshire. Buses run around the town and regularly to Wakefield and Dewsbury, and less frequently to Batley.

==Education==
Until the late 1960s, Ossett had its own Grammar School. Founded in 1735 it grew out of the activity of the National Society for Promoting Education of the Poor, and its local committee formed in 1727. When sufficient funds had been raised, a small classroom was erected on waste land facing the chapel-of-ease in Ossett. The area given to the school increased throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and the education it offered was initially largely linked with the church. In 1904, the old Grammar School had to move from the centre of Ossett, to make way for the construction of the new Town Hall. Temporary location was found in the Central Baptist schoolroom in old Church Street. Changes agreed included a decision that the School should have mixed-sex classes, the first of its kind in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1905/6 Ossett Corporation purchased Park House, built in 1867, off Storrs Hill for £2,500. This house, with its three acres of land became the new Ossett Grammar School in September 1906, with 95 pupils and a staff of 8. For the next 63 years the school underwent substantial building expansions, and growth in numbers. Enrolment was via success in the 11+ examination, and many pupils were educated to university entrance level. It ceased to be a grammar school in 1969. Ossett now has nine primary schools; Gawthorpe Community Academy, Ossett Flushdyke School, Towngate Primary Academy; Ossett Holy Trinity C of E Primary School, St Ignatius Catholic Primary School, Ossett South Parade Primary, South Ossett Infant Academy, Ossett Southdale C of E Junior School and Dimplewell Infants School and Nursery. Ossett has one mainstream secondary school, Ossett Academy &amp; Sixth Form College, on the site of the previous Ossett Grammar School, and also has The Grange School, which is an independent special school and Highfield School which caters for children aged 11 to 16 who have learning difficulties, using the buildings of the old North Ossett High School which closed in 1997.

==Religion==
There are seven churches in the town, each with their own particular identities and initiatives. Many of the leaders of these churches meet regularly to collaborate and support each other. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the town had a reputation as a centre of religious Nonconformism. Although Nonconformist churches were common all over West Yorkshire, Ossett was a particular hotbed. In 1890, seventeen different churches were recorded in Ossett, excluding &quot;spiritualist churches&quot;. Trinity Church is one of the two Anglican churches in the town. The other is Christ Church, South Ossett. St Mary&#x27;s Church on Dewsbury Road closed in 2002, and its parish was divided between Dewsbury (Chickenley) and Ossett and Gawthorpe (Gawthorpe).

St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church was built in 1878. The Salvation Army is the only church in Gawthorpe. The Salvation Army building also acts as a community centre providing dinners for senior citizens &amp; two parent &amp; toddler groups. There is also a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses on Ventnor Way, and a spiritualist church in the town centre. The King&#x27;s Way church on Ventnor Way is a Methodist and United Reformed church.

==Sport==
Ossett Rugby are based at Ossett Cricket and Athletic Club and play at Southdale playing fields with two men&#x27;s and one senior ladies team. Recently the club have offered Junior rugby with mini rugby for ages 2 and up, mixed age grades at under 9&#x27;s and under 12&#x27;s plus girls only teams to extend the rugby offering in the town to all ages.

Ossett Trinity, the local rugby league club, resigned from the Rugby League Conference in 2006. Ossett Cricket Club also play at Dimplewells. The Heavy Woollen District has its own cricket association and its own cricket team. Residents of Ossett are eligible to play for the Heavy Woollen District team.

Ossett hosted two semi-professional football teams, both played in the Northern Premier League Division One North: Ossett Town played at Ingfield, and neighbours Ossett Albion played at Queen&#x27;s Terrace, more commonly known as Dimplewells. In February 2018, the two clubs announced an agreement to merge under the name Ossett United. For the remainder of the 2017–18 season, a season ticket at either club is valid for matches at either Ossett Albion or Ossett Town.

There was an Ossett Football Club in the 1890s, they played in the original West Yorkshire League, but the oldest current club in Ossett is Ossett Common Rovers, formed in 1910 and currently playing in the modern West Yorkshire League. Other clubs in Ossett include Ossett Wanderers, Ossett United and Ossett Panthers. Little Bull F.C., Ossett Two Brewers and AFC Two Brewers play in the Wakefield &amp; District League.

The Yorkshire and the Humber branch of the Disability Sports Federation has its headquarters on the Longlands Industrial Estate in the town.

* The town is mentioned in the song &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot; by The KLF.
* Ossett was defined as &quot;wheeare the&#x27; black-leead t&#x27;tram lines&quot; in both &quot;A Yorkshireman&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; by Peter Wright and &quot;The Yorkshire Dictionary&quot; by Arnold Kellett, although neither book gives any explanation for this. One interpretation is that it was mocking the town&#x27;s heavy pollution when it was industrialised. Another is that Ossett people were seen as fussy and pedantic.
* From Austin Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Talkin&#x27; Yorkshire&quot; (page 48):
: &quot;In moments of extreme anger Ossett fish-puddlers have been known to resent &quot;thou&quot; and reply &quot;Don&#x27;t thee thou me thee thou thissen and see how tha likes thee thouing&quot; but this is rare.&quot;
*Ossett is the home of Wakefield Orchestral Wind (WOW), an orchestral wind band with a varied repertoire including popular film music, show music, big band, classical and their conductor&#x27;s own arrangements. The band plays regularly at local events, such as Ossett Gala, Horbury Show and Camphill Pennine Community Summer Fair.
*Software house Team17 was previously based there, and their most famous game – &quot;Worms&quot; – contained a Hell level with a sign saying, &quot;Welcome to Ossett&quot;. In the sequel Worms 2, there is the cheat code &#x27;OSSETT&#x27;, which enables the levels from the first game.
* Ossett is defined in the &quot;Meaning of liff&quot; as &quot;a frilly spare-toilet-roll-cosy&quot;

==Notable people==

* The astronomer Cyril Jackson (1903–1988), who moved to South Africa, was born in Ossett, and honoured the town when he named the asteroid 1244 Deira; the citation he submitted to the IAU boils down to &quot;Ancient name of Ossett, Yorkshire&quot;. This is something of an exaggeration, as the ancient Celtic Kingdom of Deira actually encompassed (at its height) most of Yorkshire.
* Benjamin Ingham (1712–1772), founder of the Inghamite Methodists was born in Ossett. He was educated at Batley Grammar School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1735 and accompanied John and Charles Wesley as a missionary to the colony of Georgia in the USA. In 1737, after his return to Ossett, Ingham started to establish the Inghamite Methodists after being banned in 1739 from preaching in churches. By 1755 there were over eighty Inghamite congregations, mainly in Yorkshire and Lancashire. A vestige of Ingham&#x27;s Church still survives in the Lancashire/Yorkshire border area.
* Eli Marsden Wilson, (1877–1965) was a successful Ossett-born artist who had seventeen pictures exhibited at the Royal Academy. After studying at Wakefield College of Art, he moved to the Royal College of Art in London where he became a pupil of Sir Frank Short. The first picture Wilson exhibited at the R.A. in 1905 was an etching of Ossett Market as it was in Victorian times. There is a copy of &quot;Ossett Market&quot; by E. M. Wilson on display in Wakefield Art Gallery.
* Thomas Cussons (chemist) first established the Cussons personal care brand in Ossett. The initials of Thomas&#x27; eldest son John W. Cussons (1867–1922) can still be found on the wall of the original building, until recently the Yorkshire Bank on Station Road. Thomas&#x27;s youngest son Alex T. Cussons (1875–1951), who was apprenticed in Ossett, went on to manufacture the famous Cussons Imperial Leather soap.
* Michael Taylor, born c.1944, who became notable in 1974 as a result of an Ossett murder case.
* Sir Edward Luckhoo, Governor General of Guyana, lived in Ossett in retirement, and is buried in the town.

<doc id="152118" wikidata="Q2090507" url="?curid=152118" title="Oxenhope">
<text>Oxenhope is a village and civil parish near Keighley in the metropolitan borough of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The population was 2,476 at the time of the 2001 census which had increased to 2,626 at the 2011 Census. Oxenhope railway station is the terminus for the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway heritage railway.

==History==
Oxenhope&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;hop&quot; which means valley head, so Oxenhope literally means &quot;Oxen Valley Head&quot;. The industrialisation of the village came about through the cloth and wool trade and by 1850, Oxenhope was host to over 20 mills.

Leeming Reservoir was constructed between 1872 and 1873 to supply the many mills in the area. Its construction necessitated the closure and demolition of at least two mills and their associated houses.

The modern village of Oxenhope encompasses what were originally the separate settlements of Uppertown, Lowertown, Leeming and Horkinstone. The historic hamlets of Marsh and Shaw are also included in the village. The area became known as Oxenhope when the Railway Company named the station serving the area opened the line from Keighley in 1867. Until then, the name Oxenhope referred to a small settlement between the hamlet of Marsh and Haworth.

The street pattern of Oxenhope was much altered when the railway arrived. It had originally been intended that the railway would terminate at Haworth; however the owners of Lowertown Mill in Oxenhope persuaded the railway company to extend the line. It was found impracticable to take the railway as far as Lowertown because of the gradients that would have been required. As a compromise, the railway built a road from its station to Lowertown, appropriately named Station Road. The bridge by which this road crosses Leeming Water is of the same construction as many of the railway&#x27;s bridges.

==Culture==
The village hosts a number of annual events including a village show, a beer festival (organised by Keighley and Worth Valley Railway) and a music festival at a village pub.

Each summer the village holds an annual Straw Race. The race was inaugurated in 1976 and since then has raised £300,000 for charity from its participants via sponsorship. Competitors are required to carry a bale of straw between five public houses in the Oxenhope area (including the Waggon and Horses, The Bay Horse and The Lamb) and drink a beer in each pub. The last stretch to the Dog &amp; Gun Pub is uphill, past Leeming Reservoir. Many of the competitors wear fancy dress.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the village. The subsequent Tour de Yorkshire cycling event has also passed through the village in 2015, 2017 and 2018.

==Transport==
===Road===
The A6033 is the main road through the village. It leaves the A629 at Cross Roads and stays quite high up on the east side of the valley, bypassing the village of Haworth and eventually descending into Oxenhope, before going south-east over Oxenhope Moor to Hebden Bridge.

===Bus===
Transdev bus services operate to Oxenhope and beyond on an hourly basis from Keighley via Haworth. Some routes travel via Oxenhope Moor to Hebden Bridge.

In 1920 five people died when a charabanc on its way to a knur and spell match in Colne overturned near St Mary&#x27;s Church. This became known as the Oxenhope Charabanc Disaster.

===Rail===
Oxenhope is the terminus of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. This route was closed by British Rail in 1962; then reopened by a group of volunteers 1968. Trains are often steam hauled and run as a heritage rather than a commuter railway.

== Religious sites ==
There are two Methodist churches in Oxenhope; one in the village and one in Marsh hamlet north-west of Oxenhope. Both of these churches are in the Airedale Methodist Circuit. There used to be a Baptist church on Moorside Lane (Hawksbridge Baptist Church) but its congregation dwindled and in 2012 it was put up for sale. The buildings were sold and were featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Restoration Man&quot; TV show in early 2016.

The Church of England 19th-century parish church of St Mary the Virgin is on Hebden Bridge Road and has some interesting glass by the William Morris company. The church was founded by the Reverend Joseph Brett Grant at the behest of the Reverend Patrick Brontë. The Rev Grant was tireless in collecting money to fund the building of the church and Charlotte Brontë records that he wore out 80 pairs of shoes in his quest to do so. The foundation stones of the church were laid down in 1849.

==Notable people==
* John Hollingworth, actor and playwright, was raised in Oxenhope.

== Filmography ==
Oxenhope was used as setting for the film &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (starring Jenny Agutter). The Waterbury&#x27;s house was set at Bents Farm, south of Haworth.

The station was also used in the TV mini series The Great Train Robbery (starring Luke Evans) in 2013.

<doc id="152119" wikidata="Q658902" url="?curid=152119" title="Otley">
<text>Otley is a market town and civil parish at a bridging point on the River Wharfe, in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the population was 13,668 at the 2011 census. It is in two parts: south of the river is the historic town of Otley and to the north is Newall, which was formerly a separate township. The town is in lower Wharfedale on the A660 road which connects it to Leeds.

The town is in the Otley and Yeadon ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Otley&#x27;s name is derived from Otto, Otho, Othe, or Otta, a Saxon personal name and &quot;leah&quot;, a woodland clearing in Old English. It was recorded as &quot;Ottanlege&quot; in 972 and &quot;Otelai&quot; or &quot;Othelia&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name Chevin has close parallels to the early Brythonic Welsh term &quot;Cefn&quot; meaning ridge and may be a survival of the ancient Cumbric language.

===Early history===
There are pre-historic settlement finds alongside both sides of the River Wharfe and it is believed the valley has been settled at this site since the Bronze Age. There are Bronze Age carvings on rocks situated on top of The Chevin: one such example is the Knotties Stone. West Yorkshire Geology Trust has reference to Otley Chevin and Caley Crags having a rich history of human settlement stretching back into Palaeolithic times. Flint tools, Bronze Age rock carvings and Iron Age earthworks have been found. In medieval times the forest park was used as common pasture land, as a source of wood and sandstones for buildings and walls.

===Saxon and Medieval=== 
The majority of the early development of the town dates from Saxon times and was part of an extensive manor granted by King Æthelstan to the see of York. The Archbishops of York had a residence and were lords of the manor. Their palace was located on the site occupied by the Manor House. Otley is close to Leeds and may have formed part of the kingdom of Elmet. Remains of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace were found during the construction of St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School.

As in other areas of the north, the Norman Conquest largely laid waste this area. The Saxon church was replaced by a Norman one, but this contains much Saxon sculpture. Thus in the 11th and 12th century Otley would have been a loose congregation of buildings around the two focal points of the manor house by the bridge and the church. An important reason for the town&#x27;s location was a water supply, the Calhead Beck (now covered over) which ran down from Otley Chevin over Whitley Croft, a little East of the church and then to the river near the bridge.

The town grew in the first half of the 13th century when the archbishops laid out burgage (freehold) plots to attract merchants and tradespeople. The burgage plots were on Boroughgate, Walkergate and Kirkgate. This began to create the layout of today, based on a triangle of these plots forming the streets. Bondgate was for the workers: bondsmen and tenants. A leper hospital was founded on the road to Harewood beyond Cross Green.

As well as farming and use of woodland, important local activities were quarrying stone, and the manufacture of potash from bracken, used to make a soap which therefore supported a community carrying out fulling, the cleansing and finishing of woollen cloth on Watergate. The Chevin provided stone for building (and millstones) as well as bracken, wood and common grazing, while the river provided reeds for thatching houses.

===Industrial Revolution===

The woollen industry developed as a cottage industry but during the Industrial Revolution and the mechanisation of the textile industry, mills were built using water then steam power. A cotton mill and weaving shed for calicoes were built by the river in the late 18th century. Later woolcombing and worsted spinning were introduced. By the mid 19th century 500 inhabitants were employed in two worsted-mills, a paper-mill, and other mills. A tannery was established in the 19th century. At this time the opening of the new Leeds Road and Bradford Road greatly increased access for trade. Many houses were built from the middle of the 19th century onwards, including the first row of terraces by the newly formed Otley Building Society from 1847. Otley railway station opened in 1865 connecting goods and people to Leeds, with a connection to Bradford in 1875. At its peak it had 50 trains a day, but it was closed in 1965 under the Beeching cuts. Kirkgate was the first street to be paved in 1866, followed by sewers in 1869.
The Wharfedale Printing Machine was developed in Otley by William Dawson and David Payne. An early example can be seen in Otley Museum. By 1900 the printing machinery trade, with over 2,000 people employed in seven machine shops, was Otley&#x27;s most important industry.

===20th century onwards===
During the First World War, Farnley Camp at Otley housed the Northern Command Gas and Grenade School, which taught military personnel about explosives.

After the First World War there was a general shortage of housing in Britain, and much of it was crowded slums. Otley Council prepared one of the first subsidized housing schemes, commencing with relatively open land in Newall on the North of the river in 1920. The 1920s also saw the beginnings of the conversion of properties to a sewer drainage system, and electric lighting instead of gas on the streets.

Further estates followed and by 1955 there were more than 1,000 council houses. Private housing was also expanded during this time, but was greatly reduced in the Second World War. House building revived in the 1960s to 1980s, but industry declined, with many factories closing, including the printing machine works in 1981.

Wharfemeadows park provided leisure space for residents and the River Wharfe a place to swim with public open air swimming baths opening on the site in 1924. By the 1960s the outdoor pool was a popular leisure destination and was in use until 1993 when a fault with the pumping system precipitated its closure. In February 2016, in response to a Leeds City Council invitation for ‘Expressions of Interest&#x27; for the site of &#x27;the former Otley Lido&#x27;, a group of local residents launched an ongoing campaign to regenerate the site as a modern open air swimming pool and community centre.

=== Otley Museum ===
Until 2010 Otley Museum was based in the Civic Centre when it was displaced by major redevelopment of the building. In January 2010, its collections, reflecting the town&#x27;s story from prehistory to the present day, were packed for storage while new premises were sought. A proposal by the Town Council to develop a National Printing Museum based on the printers&#x27; engineers collection was criticised by trustees on the basis that printing was just one aspect of the town&#x27;s history and that demand for such a museum had not been demonstrated. In 2024, while still without a permanent physical home, the museum publicised its new website which will serve as a showcase for photographs of some of the approximately 1900 artefacts that have been curated by volunteers. Visitors can view items from the collection by prior arrangement at its temporary location at Otley Cycle Club.

==Governance==

Historically Otley was a market-town and the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish in the wapentakes of Skyrack and Claro in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The various chapelries and townships in the ancient parish became separate civil parishes in 1866. The local authority was the lord of the manor until 1864 when Otley Board was formed and many public buildings date from then on. From 1894 Otley formed an Urban District, and in 1897 and 1903 expanded north of the River Wharfe to include Newall. Since local government reorganisation in 1974 Otley has been a civil parish in the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds, in the county of West Yorkshire. The parish council has exercised its option to declare itself a town council. The town council and the Otley Museum were both based at Otley Civic Centre until the building closed in 2010.

Otley lies in the Leeds North West constituency of the UK Parliament and is represented by MP Katie White of the Labour Party. It is part of the Otley &amp; Yeadon ward on Leeds City Council and is represented by three Liberal Democrat Councillors Ryk Downes, Colin Campbell &amp; Sandy Lay. It is twinned with the French town of Montereau-Fault-Yonne, south of Paris.

Otley and Wharfedale ward has a population of 24,000, and Otley itself has a population of 14,348, according to the Census 2001.

==Geography==
Otley lies south-west of York, north-west of Leeds, north-east of Bradford, and from London. The town lies in lower Wharfedale, at a bridging point over the River Wharfe where there is a seven-arched medieval bridge, and is surrounded by arable farmland. The historic town developed on the south bank of the Wharfe, but in the 20th century Otley expanded north of the river, to include new developments at Newall and the Weston Estate.

The south side of the valley is dominated by a gritstone escarpment overlooking Otley called the Chevin and to the north is Newall Carr. In 1944, Major Le G.G.W. Horton Fawkes of Farnley Hall donated of land on the Chevin to the people of Otley. This has been expanded to and constitutes &quot;Chevin Forest Park&quot;. It was from a quarry on the Chevin that the foundation stones for the Houses of Parliament were hewn.

To the east and west of Otley are flooded gravel pits, where sand and gravel have been extracted in the 20th century. The gravel pits to the east at Knotford Nook are a noted birdwatching site. Those to the west are devoted to angling and sailing.

To the west are the villages of Burley-in-Wharfedale and Menston. To the east is Pool-in-Wharfedale. To the south is the towns of Guiseley, and Yeadon.

==Transport==
Roman roads bypassed Otley, South of the Chevin and North of Timble, so most of roads in the area were little better than tracks until the 18th century when efforts were made to facilitate trade. By 1820 there was a regular post coach to Leeds on 4 days a week and 9 carriers delivering as far as Manchester. In 1840 and 1841 new roads to Leeds and Bradford were opened. From 1900 the first motor vehicles appeared in Otley, and in 1912 a motor haulage business started with a vehicle with interchangeable bodies so that it could work as either as lorry or charabanc. By 1930 there were bus companies operating and in 1939 Otley bus station opened. Trolleybuses operated by Leeds Corporation Tramways arrived in 1915, but ceased in 1928.

The Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway opened Otley railway station in 1865 and closed in March 1965; the town bypass follows the part of the line of the old railway. The trackbed between Burley in Wharfedale, Otley and Pool is to become a cycleway, footpath and equestrian route known as the Wharfedale Greenway, with possible extensions onward to Ilkley alongside the extant railway. Planning permission for the first phase of the greenway was granted in July 2020.

The main roads through the town are the A660 to the south east, which connects Otley to Bramhope, Adel and Leeds city centre, and the A65 to the west, which goes to Ilkley and Skipton. The A6038 heads to Guiseley, Shipley and Bradford, connecting with the A65. To Harrogate, the A659 heads east to the A658, which is the main Bradford–Harrogate road.

Otley bus station is run by West Yorkshire Metro and services are operated by First West Yorkshire, Harrogate Bus Company, Keighley Bus Company, and Connexionsbuses. There are local services connecting the town and outlying areas.

==Notable features==
===Otley Bridge and riverside===

Otley Bridge is a 7 span stone bridge and Scheduled Ancient Monument, dating from 1228, which was rebuilt after the flood of 1673 and widened in 1776. In 1957 a concrete cantilevered footwalk was added to separate pedestrians from road traffic. On the north side eastwards, 2 miles of the riverbank is Wharfemeadows Park with extensive gardens on land donated to the town in 1924 by the Fawkes family. It originally had an open-air swimming pool. Opposite on the south side is the much smaller Tittybottle Park, originally designated Manor Park in 1909 but it acquired its popular (and now official) name for its popularity with mothers and nannies. On the south side westward, is Manor Garth Park, formerly part of the land of the manor house. About east of the bridge is Gallows Hill, where the medieval gallows stood. Low-lying land by this was formerly a sewage works, but was bought by the Town Council in the 1980s and developed into Gallows Hill nature reserve.

===Market Place===
While markets have been held from at least 1227 it has only been in the current Market Place from about 1800. It contains the Buttercross (covered area for farm produce, now used for occasional charity events, otherwise rest and shelter for visitors) and the Jubilee Clock, which was erected in 1888 at a cost of £175. It has two plaques, one in memory to two locals killed in the Transvaal War and one expressing the gratitude of Belgian refugees who came to Otley during the First World War. Many of the buildings around are listed.

==Education==

A grammar school was founded by Royal Charter issued to Thomas Cave in 1607 by King James VI and I, who named it &quot;The Grammar School of Prince Henry&quot;. The single storey building was pulled down and rebuilt in the Elizabethan style with two storeys in 1840. It closed in 1878 and was used as a court-house, and in recent times has been commercial premises, then a public house until closure in 2020. In 1918 the foundation was re-established in temporary premises and in 1925 Prince Henry&#x27;s Grammar School, Otley, in Farnley Lane opened.

Otley has a number of primary schools.

==Religion==
Otley&#x27;s first church was built in the early 7th century, made of wood, but was burnt down. The Parish Church (All Saints) originates from Saxon times and contains the remains of two early Anglo-Saxon crosses, one of which has been reproduced for the town&#x27;s war memorial. The present building is based on a Norman church from the 12th century but little of the original remains, except the north doorway. Substantial changes were made in the 13th, 14th and 18th century, with the Tower Clock dating from 1793. This church was the centre of an ancient ecclesiastical parish which comprised the chapelries of Baildon, Bramhope, Burley in Wharfedale, Denton, and Farnley, and the townships of Esholt, Hawksworth, Lindley, Menston, Newall with Clifton, Pool-in-Wharfedale, and Little Timble.

The graveyard contains the &quot;Navvies&#x27; Monument&quot;, a replica of the entrance to Bramhope Tunnel, a monument to those killed during its construction. Inside the church is the tomb of the grandparents of Thomas Fairfax who commanded Parliament&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644.

The Bridge Church was originally the Salem Chapel, built in 1826, being for many years the Congregational Church but having its present name from 1972 with the formation of the United Reformed Church. The church also operated a church hall in Newall Carr Road, some from the church, until the hall was declared redundant.

Our Lady and All Saints Roman Catholic Church was opened in 1851. 

What is now Beech Hill Church started life in 1916 as &#x27;Bethel Gospel Mission&#x27; and moved to its current location on Westgate in 2021.

Methodist preacher John Wesley was a frequent visitor to the town in the 18th century. Allegedly his horse died in the town and is buried in the grounds of the parish church. Its grave is marked by an unusual stone, also known locally as the &quot;Donkey Stone&quot;. His &quot;Journal&quot; for 1761 reads, &quot;6 July Monday; In the evening I preached at Otley and afterwards talked with many of the Society. There is reason to believe that ten or twelve of these are filled with the love of God.&quot; Wesley Street is named after him. A chapel was established on Walkergate in about 1800, replaced by a larger one on Westgate in 1857: a third Chapel (now Trinity Methodist Church) was built on Boroughate in 1876.

A Primitive Methodist Chapel opened on New Market in 1835, and became the Salvation Army Citadel which closed in 2019. A Primitive Church on Station Road opened in 1874 and closed in 1965 (it is now residences). Another Primitive Church on Craven Street opened in 1901 and closed in the early 1950s. It is now the headquarters of 2nd Otley Scouts, and is known as the Chevin Community Centre.

An 1890 Quaker meeting house on Cross Green is now a Gospel Hall.

Other Christian groups meet in members&#x27; homes or rented rooms.

==Culture and community==

Otley has a diverse range of cultural organisations. It has five active Morris dance sides, the Wharfedale Wayzgoose (Border), The Buttercross Belles (Ladies Northwest), Flash Company (Border, Molly, Appalachian &amp; Clog), Hellz Bellz (Contemporary) and Kitchen Taps (Appalachian Step).

Drama groups include the Otley Community Players, Otley Youth Theatre (OY), and a thriving arts centre in the former courthouse. There is a poetry society, which meets monthly in the Black Horse Hotel. The town has a Brass Band who perform at many events in the town. It is not a regular contesting band, but won first prize in the unregistered section at their first contest at Hardraw Scar in September 2007 and again in 2008. Since then they have competed in the 1st to 3rd section winning Second prize and Best March in 2014.

Otley hosts the annual Otley Folk Festival in September, a Victorian Fayre in December, a carnival in June, and, in May, what is reputed to be the oldest one day agricultural show in the country. This celebrated its bicentenary in 2009. There is a beer festival, organised by the church, in November.
Otley has four Scout troops, Otley Parish, Otley Bridge, 2nd Otley, and Otley Methodist Scouts. An Army Cadet Force detachment is also located in the town.

In January 2013 &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper featured an article in its Weekend section entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s move to Otley, West Yorkshire&quot;.

===Hostelries===
The Black Horse Hotel (original demolished, current from 1901 and the Royal White Horse Hotel (the former Barclays Bank (closed 2019), in Manor Square) were the original posting houses and many of the others were coaching inns. By 1900 there were over 30 inns, and Otley was said to have &quot;a pub on every corner&quot;. This reputation has continued into recent years with BBC Radio 4&#x27;s statistics programme &quot;More or Less&quot; concluding that it had the greatest number per head of population.

Today there are 20 pubs in the town although the &quot;Roebuck&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Spite&quot;), the &quot;Chevin&quot; and the &quot;Royalty&quot; are on the outskirts, with the &quot;Roebuck&quot; located in North Yorkshire. Some of the oldest buildings have been demolished or replaced, but the Red Lion on Kirkgate dates from 1745, the Bowling Green from 1757 (originally a courthouse), the Rose &amp; Crown (originally cottages) 1731. The Old Grammar School was (as of 2017) the Stew and Oyster pub, this closed in January 2020. The Old Cock on Crossgate (despite its name) has only recently become a pub, but inhabits former cottages from 1757. These are all Grade II listed buildings.

The &quot;Black Bull&quot; in the Market Place, was allegedly drunk dry by Cromwell&#x27;s troops on the night before the battle of Marston Moor during the English Civil War and has a 15th-century well in the beer garden.

<text>Pontefract is a historic market town in the City of Wakefield, a metropolitan district in West Yorkshire, England. It lies to the east of Wakefield and south of Castleford. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is one of the towns in the City of Wakefield district and had a population of 30,881 at the 2011 Census. 

Pontefract&#x27;s motto is , Latin for &quot;After the death of the father, support the son&quot;, a reference to the town&#x27;s Royalist sympathies in the English Civil War. Small villages and settlements in the immediate area include Stapleton.

==Etymology==

At the end of the 11th century, the modern township of Pontefract consisted of two distinct localities, Tanshelf and Kirkby. The 11th-century historian Orderic Vitalis recorded that, in 1069, William the Conqueror travelled across Yorkshire to put down an uprising which had sacked York. 

Upon his journey to the city, he discovered that a crossing of the River Aire near what is modern-day Pontefract had been blockaded by local Anglo-Scandinavian insurgents, who had broken the bridge and held the opposite bank in force. Such a crossing point would have been important to the town, providing access between Pontefract and other settlements to the north and east, such as York. Historians believe that it is this historical event which gives the township of Pontefract its modern name. The name &quot;Pontefract&quot; originates from the Latin for &quot;broken bridge&quot;, formed of the elements &quot;pons&quot; (bridge) and &quot;fractus&quot; (broken). Pontefract was not recorded in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, but it was noted as Pontefracto in 1090, four years after the Domesday survey.

==History==
===Neolithic===
In 2007, an extension of Ferrybridge Henge – a Neolithic henge – was discovered near Pontefract during a survey in preparation for the construction of a row of houses. Once the survey was complete, construction continued.

===Roman===
The modern town is situated near an old Roman road (now the A639), described as the &quot;Roman Ridge&quot;. This is believed to form part of an alternative route from Doncaster to York via Castleford and Tadcaster, as a diversion of the major Roman road Ermine Street, which may have been used to avoid having to cross the River Humber near North Ferriby during rough weather conditions over the Humber.

===Anglo-Scandinavian history===
The period of Yorkshire&#x27;s history between the demise of the Viking king, Eric Bloodaxe, in 954 and the arrival of the Normans in 1068 is known as the Anglo-Scandinavian age. The modern township of Pontefract consisted of two Anglo-Scandinavian settlements, Tanshelf and Kirkby. In Yorkshire, place-name locations often contain the distinctive Danish &#x27;-by&#x27; i.e. Kirkby and today, the major streets in Pontefract are designated by the Danish word &#x27;gate&#x27; e.g. Bailygate.

The Anglo-Scandinavian township, Tanshelf, recorded as &quot;Tateshale&quot;, &quot;Tateshalla&quot;, &quot;Tateshalle&quot; or &quot;Tatessella&quot; in the &#x27;Domesday Book&#x27; is today occupied by the town of Pontefract. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; made a reference to Tanshelf in 947 when King Eadred of England met with the ruling council of Northumbria to accept its submission. King Eadred did not enjoy Northumbria&#x27;s support for long, and a year later the kingdom voted Eric Bloodaxe King of York.

When the Domesday survey was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086, Tanshelf was a sizeable settlement. It had a priest, 60 petty burgesses, 16 cottagers, 16 villagers and 8 smallholders, amounting to 101 people. The size of the population might have been four or five times larger as the only people listed were landholders. Tanshelf had a church, a fishery and three mills. Archaeologists discovered the remains of a church on The Booths, off North Baileygate, below the castle. The oldest grave dates from around 690. The church may have been similar to the church at Ledsham. The area of the town market place was the meeting place of the Osgoldcross wapentake. In the Anglo-Saxon period part of the modern town was known by the Anglo-Scandinavian name as Kirkby.

===Medieval===
After the Norman conquest in 1066 almost all of Yorkshire came under the ownership of followers of William the Conqueror, one of whom was Ilbert de Lacy who became the owner of Tateshale (Tanshelf) where he built a castle.
Pontefract Castle began as a wooden motte and bailey castle before 1086 and was later rebuilt in stone. The de Lacys lived there for more than two centuries and were holders of the castle and the Honour of Pontefract from 1067 until the death of Alice de Lacy in 1348.

King Richard II was murdered at the castle in 1400. Little is known of the nature of his demise; Shakespeare may have &quot;adjusted&quot; the facts for his own purposes. At least three theories attempt to explain his death: either he was starved to death by his keepers, he starved himself to death or he was murdered by Sir Piers (Peter) Exton on 14 February 1399 or 1400.

===Early modern history===
In Elizabethan times the castle and the town were both referred to as &quot;Pomfret&quot;. William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; mentions the castle:
Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack&#x27;d to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

Pontefract suffered throughout the English Civil War. In 1648–49 the castle was laid siege by Oliver Cromwell, who said it was &quot;... one of the strongest inland garrisons in the kingdom.&quot; Three sieges by the Parliamentarians left the town &quot;impoverished and depopulated&quot;. In March 1649, after the third siege, Pontefract inhabitants, fearing a fourth, petitioned Parliament for the castle to be slighted. The castle was a magnet for trouble, and demolition began in April 1649. The castle ruins are publicly accessible.
Pontefract Priory, a Cluniac priory founded in 1090 by Robert de Lacy dedicated to St John the Evangelist was dissolved by royal authority in 1539. The priory maintained the Chartularies of St John, a collection of historic documents later discovered among family papers by Thomas Levett, the High Sheriff of Rutland, a native of Yorkshire, who gave them to Roger Dodsworth, an antiquary. They were published by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society.

==Governance==

For local government purposes, the town lies in the City of Wakefield and is administered by Wakefield Council. It is divided into two electoral wards, Pontefract North and Pontefract South. Pontefract South was represented by two Labour councillors and one Conservative councillor and North ward represented by three Labour councillors in 2022. 

From 1978 to 1997, ex-miner and former NUM branch leader Geoff Lofthouse (18 December 1925 – 1 November 2012) was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Pontefract and Castleford constituency. During this time, he became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. When the general election of 1997 was called, he stood down. He was made a peer on 11 June 1997.

Yvette Cooper was elected as the MP for the Pontefract and Castleford constituency at the 1997 general election. In her maiden speech to the House of Commons, Cooper said:&quot;It is true that my constituency is plagued by unemployment, but I represent hard-working people who are proud of their strong communities and who have fought hard across generations to defend them. They are proud of their socialist traditions, and have fought for a better future for their children and their grandchildren. In the Middle Ages, that early egalitarian, the real Robin Hood, lived, so we maintain, in the Vale of Wentbridge to the south of Pontefract. It was a great base from which to hassle the travelling fat cats on the Great North Road.&quot; She held a number of positions in the Labour governments up to 2010 and Shadow Cabinet roles (most notably Shadow Home Secretary) after the election of that year, but returned to the back benches after the Labour leadership election of 2015. Pontefract and Castleford was merged with the Normanton constituency in a boundary change before the 2010 general election.

The seat, which had a history of mining and industry, has returned Labour MPs at general elections. Yvette Cooper polled 59.5% of the vote in the 2017 general election and 48.1% of the vote in the 2019 general election.

==Economy==

Pontefract has been a market town since the Middle Ages; market days are Wednesday and Saturday, with a small market on Fridays. The covered market is open all week except Sundays. It is said by some that Pontefract once held a record for being the town with the highest number of pubs per square mile in the UK, but this is likely an urban legend, and the title is held by another town.

The town has a liquorice-sweet industry; further, the famous Pontefract cakes are produced, though the liquorice plant is no longer grown there. The town&#x27;s two liquorice factories are owned by Haribo and Valeo Confectionery (formerly Tangerine). A Liquorice festival is held annually. Poet laureate Sir John Betjeman wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Licorice Fields at Pontefract&quot;. In 2012, local farmer Robert Copley announced that he would be re-introducing a liquorice crop to Pontefract.

Close by is the site of the former coal-fired Ferrybridge power station, although the local coal mines largely closed in the 1990s, which contributed to high unemployment in the local area. The final colliery, Prince of Wales Colliery, closed in August 2002. It has since been redeveloped into a large housing estate named after the colliery.

==Amenities and services==
The secondary schools in the town are Carleton High School in Carleton and the King&#x27;s School on Mill Hill Lane, both for pupils aged 11–16. A sixth-form college, New College, Pontefract, is located on Park Lane.

The old Pontefract General Infirmary on Southgate (pictured) was a general hospital; it is the place at which serial killer Harold Shipman began to murder his elderly patients. Beneath this building is an old hermitage, open to the public on certain days. Pontefract Museum, from which the hermitage schedule can be obtained, is in the town centre, housed in the former Carnegie library.

A new hospital was built on Friarwood Lane and opened in July 2010, with the new name of Pontefract Hospital; there is now a modern hospital building. Near to the hospital is Friarwood Valley Gardens, a rose garden, a sensory garden, a pinhole camera (formerly an aviary and earlier a Georgian gambling den) and an avenue of cherry trees.

The local police force is West Yorkshire Police, with the town&#x27;s neighbourhood policing team situated at the new fire station on Stumpcross Lane. The original police station in Sessions House Yard has been demolished since the divisional headquarters for the Wakefield District opened in Normanton and the neighbouring magistrates&#x27; court has moved to Leeds, following the closure of the Wakefield and Pontefract courts.

Fire cover is provided by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, with one pump (sometimes two) based at Pontefract Fire Station. Formerly located on Stuart Road in the town centre, the station has moved to a new site at Stumpcross Lane, by the A645 at the town&#x27;s eastern edge. The new fire station provides cover for Knottingley; that town&#x27;s fire station having been closed as part of the merging of fire cover for Pontefract and Knottingley.

Ambulance cover is provided by Yorkshire Ambulance service, whose depot is situated in neighbouring town, Castleford.

The Territorial Army, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps all have a presence within the town and are based at the historic Barracks building on Wakefield Road. It now houses a Rifles Regiment Recruitment team.

==Media, arts and entertainment==

The local newspaper is the &quot;Pontefract and Castleford Express&quot;. 

Novelist Jack Vance, in the &quot;Demon Princes&quot; cycle has named the capital of Aloysius, the main planet in the Vega system, after Pontefract. The hero of the series, Kirth Gersen, has his residence there.

Pontefract made local and national newspapers in April 2020, with a range of art which lay tribute to the key workers and NHS during the coronavirus outbreak. The art was painted by a local mural artist, Rachel List.

==Sport==
The town is home to many sports including rugby, football and squash. Prominent squash players Lee Beachill and James Willstrop both train at Pontefract Squash Club. Notable institutions are horse racing at Pontefract Racecourse and Featherstone Rovers, the area&#x27;s professional rugby league club.

Pontefract Racecourse is the longest continuous horse racing circuit in Europe at . It stages flat racing between the end of March and the end of October. A new sports centre is located at Pontefract Park which opened on 12 April 2021, which replaces the old swimming pool located on Stuart Road. Two-time European Masters Champion weightlifter Martyn Riley is from Pontefract.

Pontefract has its own non-league football club, Pontefract Collieries F.C., which was founded in 1958 and plays adjacent to the former Prince of Wales Colliery off Beechnut Lane. The team, known locally as &quot;Ponte Colls&quot; play in the Northern Premier League Division One North West (correct as of the 2021–22 season). Pontefract is also home to the Pontefract Knights rugby league football club.

Pontefract RUFC is based at Moor Lane, Carleton. It runs three senior sides as well as a number of junior and girls teams. Rugby Union has been played in the town since the 19th century when Pontefract won the Yorkshire Cup.

Pontefract used to boast two cricket clubs, Lakeside CC (based in Pontefract Park) and Pontefract CC (adjacent to Pontefract Collieries FC), but by 2002 neither of these clubs were still in existence, leaving the town without its own club despite giving its name to the Pontefract and District Cricket League. Nowadays cricketers must travel to clubs in neighbouring towns and villages, with the closest being Hundhill Hall Cricket Club based in the nearby village East Hardwick.

<doc id="152123" wikidata="Q8313107" url="?curid=152123" title="River Avon, Strathspey">
<text>The River Avon (pronounced “A&#x27;an” /ɑːn/) is a river in the Strathspey area of the Scottish Highlands, and a tributary of the River Spey. It drains the north-eastern area of the Cairngorm Mountains and is largely contained within the Cairngorms National Park

The source of the River Avon is conventionally said to be Loch A&#x27;an situated between Cairn Gorm and Ben Macdui (Gaelic: &quot;Beinn MacDhuibh&quot;). Loch A&#x27;an itself collects headwaters from a number of burns on these two mountains. From there the river then continues east down Glen Avon to the north of Ben Avon, for 10 miles before turning north towards the village of Tomintoul and Strath Avon.

There is a River Avon Fishing Association that promotes tourism in nearby towns and fishing along the river.

== Tributaries ==
Over the first few miles flowing east through the Forest of Glenavon the Avon gathers to itself numerous small burns, the most notable of which are the Burn of Loin and the Builg Burn originating at Loch Builg. The latter flows down Glen Builg to enter the Avon on its right bank just downstream of the Linn of Avon.

A mile to the southwest of Tomintoul, the Water of Ailnack enters from the confines of a precipitous gorge - the higher reaches of this watercourse are known as the Water of Caiplich. Downstream of Tomintoul, the Conglass Water originating at the Lecht, enters from the east and the Burn of Lochy enters from Glen Lochy to the west. Above Bridge of Brown, the Lochy is fed in turn by the Burn of Brown. The lowermost tributary of the Avon is the River Livet which enters from Glenlivet on the right bank at Drumin just as the Avon leaves the national park.

== Etymology ==

Some authorities state that, in common with various other examples of Avon, the river takes its name from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;abhainn&quot; meaning &#x27;river&#x27; or &#x27;stream&#x27;. The word, in common with the Welsh &quot;afon&quot;, is thought to originate from an early Indo-European root &quot;ab&quot; or &quot;aub&quot;. Watson (1926) however, is of the view that the derivation is from the &quot;early British &quot;Abone&quot; not Gaelic &quot;abhainn&quot;&quot;, the former being the precursor of both Pictish and Gaelic. Whatever the exact derivation, all agree that the name has the tautological meaning of &#x27;river river&#x27;.

<text>The Avon is a river largely in the Falkirk council area of Scotland.

==Course==
It originates, near some wind turbines, at what modern maps call Avonhead Cottage south of Upperton just west of Longriggend. Older maps show it near Avonhead just west of &quot;Avonhead Rows&quot; and north of &quot;Avonhead Coal Pit No 9&quot;. Some maps show a stream coming from Fannyside Lochs in North Lanarkshire, some 3 miles (5 km) east of Cumbernauld, but that is not the Avon&#x27;s source even if some water drains in a rivulet from there. The west of Fannyside Loch is the source of the Glencryan Burn which ends up in the River Carron via the Red Burn and the Bonny Water. Herd&#x27;s Hill, the source of the Luggie Water which ends up in the River Clyde via the River Kelvin is close by. The first tributary of the Avon is the Shiellhill Burn on the south of Greengairs very close to the source of the Cameron Burn, which itself is a tributary of the Luggie Water.

The Avon picks up the Shiellhill Burn close to Upperton, north of the sewage works and west of Easter Glentore Farm. The Avon crosses Fannyside Road at the Bog Bridge near Toddle Knowe. Within about a kilometre of this point are streams whose waters make it to Linlithgow, Larbert and Kirkintilloch on their way to their destinations. The next tributary is the Garbethill Burn near Jawhills followed by the Rashiehill Burn. The next tributary, near Slamannan, is the Culloch Burn which also starts in Longriggend but takes a more easterly course initially. The Culloch Burn flows anticlockwise round Slamannan and joins the Avon just to the north. After Avonbridge the Lin Mill Burn just after the start of the River Avon Heritage Trail. The next two tributaries are the Logie Water, near Westfield, and the Brunton Burn.

After Muiravonside Country Park, the other end of the River Avon Heritage Trail, the Bowhouse Burn confluence occurs just before the Avon Aqueduct. This is the tallest aqueduct in Scotland. The Avon Aqueduct—Scotland&#x27;s longest navigable aqueduct—carries the Union Canal above the river.

The Avon flows under the aqueduct and later under both Linlithgow Bridge and the M9 motorway. The river broadens before it joins the Firth of Forth just east of the Grangemouth Refinery. This is not far down from where the Grange Burn and the River Carron meet the Firth.

The Avon flows through the Avon Gorge and forms the boundary between Falkirk and West Lothian council areas. It is 19 miles (31 km) in length.

==Etymology==
Like other rivers of this name throughout Britain, the name Avon simply means &#x27;river&#x27;, derived from Scottish Gaelic &quot;abhainn&quot;, or British (i.e. Old Welsh) &quot;afon&quot;.

<text>Avon Water, also known locally as the River Avon, is a river in Scotland, and a tributary of the River Clyde.

==Course==
The Avon Water rises in the hills on the boundary between East Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire, close to the head of the Irvine Water. The river flows in a north easterly direction, following the A71 road past Drumclog, and running to the south of Strathaven, where the river enters a more pronounced valley. The Avon flows between the village of Glassford, and Stonehouse to the south, before merging with the smaller Cander Water just south of Larkhall. The river then skirts the west side of Larkhall in a deepening gorge, crossed by the disused Larkhall railway viaduct, built in 1904 for the Caledonian Railway.

Beyond this the gorge is part of Chatelherault Country Park, to the south of Hamilton. There are several public footpaths along this section of the gorge, although the area was once the preserve of the Duke of Hamilton, forming the hunting and pleasure grounds of the Dukes&#x27; former home, Hamilton Palace. Many features of this period remain in the park, including the Duke&#x27;s Bridge which crosses the gorge. Older structures along the gorge include the ruins of Cadzow Castle, started in the 13th century, and the Cadzow Oaks, a group of oak trees, some of which are over 600 years old.

The river bends to the east at the end of the gorge between the villages of Barncluith and Ferniegair, flowing beneath three listed stone bridges: a viaduct carrying the Argyle Line railway tracks, carrying the A72 road, and the , now a footbridge. The Avon Water flows north beneath the M74 motorway, merging into the Clyde between Hamilton and Motherwell, beside Junction 6 of the M74.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Avon&quot; is derived from the Brittonic *&quot;āβonā-&quot; (from &quot;āβ&quot;, &quot;moving water&quot;, with the suffix &quot;–onā-&quot;), the word ancestral to Welsh &quot;afon&quot;, meaning &quot;a river&quot;.

<doc id="152157" wikidata="Q446960" url="?curid=152157" title="George Miller (filmmaker)">
<text>George Miller (born 3 March 1945) is an Australian filmmaker. Over the course of four decades he has received critical and popular success creating the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchise starting in 1979 with two of the films having been hailed as two of the greatest action films of all time. He has also earned numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Golden Globe Award. 

Miller rose to prominence directing the dystopian action-adventure films &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981) and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985). He then directed the dark fantasy comedy &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987), and the biographical medical drama &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), which he also co-wrote earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He produced and co-wrote the family film &quot;Babe&quot; (1995), earning an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and later directed the sequel &quot;&quot; (1998).

In 1995, he also produced the confronting cinema verité documentary &quot;Video Fool for Love&quot;, which dealt with film editor Robert Gibson&#x27;s personal life as captured in hundreds of hours of camcorder footage. 

He won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and directed its sequel &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011). He returned to &quot;Mad Max&quot; directing the critically acclaimed sequel &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), which went on to win six Academy Awards with Miller receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. He then directed the prequel film &quot;&quot; (2024).

Trained in medicine at the University of New South Wales, Miller worked as a physician for several years before entering the film industry full-time. He is a co-founder of the production houses Kennedy Miller Mitchell, formerly known as Kennedy Miller, and Dr. D Studios. Since the death of his producing partner Byron Kennedy, his younger brother Bill Miller and Doug Mitchell have produced his later films.

==Early life and education ==
Miller was born on 3 March 1945 in Chinchilla, Queensland, to Greek immigrant parents: Jim Miller and mother Angela. Jim (aka Dimitrios) was born on the Greek island of Kythira (at Mitata), Jim&#x27;s father anglicised his surname from Miliotis to Miller when he emigrated to Australia in 1920; Angela&#x27;s family were Greek refugees from Anatolia, displaced by the 1923 population exchange.

Miller attended Ipswich Grammar School and later Sydney Boys High School, then studied medicine at the University of New South Wales with his twin brother John. While in his final year at medical school (1971), George and his younger brother Chris made &quot;St. Vincent&#x27;s Revue Film&quot;, a one-minute short film that won them first prize in a student competition. 

In 1971, George attended a film workshop at Melbourne University where he met fellow student Byron Kennedy, with whom he formed a lasting friendship and production partnership, until Kennedy&#x27;s death. In 1972, Miller completed his residency at Sydney&#x27;s St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, spending his time off crewing on short experimental films. That same year, Miller and Kennedy founded Kennedy Miller Productions. The pair subsequently collaborated on numerous works. After Kennedy died in 1983, Miller kept his name in the company. It was later renamed Kennedy Miller Mitchell in 2009 as a way to recognise producer Doug Mitchell&#x27;s role in the company.

==Career==
=== 1971–1985: Ozploitation and &quot;Mad Max&quot; trilogy ===
Miller&#x27;s first work, the short film &quot;Violence in Cinema: Part 1&quot; (1971), polarised critics, audiences and distributors so much that it was placed in the documentary category at the 1972 Sydney Film Festival due to its matter-of-fact depiction of cinematic violence. In 1979, Miller made his feature-length directorial debut with &quot;Mad Max&quot;. Based on a script written by Miller and James McCausland in 1975, the film was independently financed by Kennedy Miller Productions and went on to become an international success. As a result, the film spawned the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series with two further sequels starring Mel Gibson: &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; also released as &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (1981) and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985). 

During the time between the second and third &quot;Mad Max&quot; films, Miller directed a remake of &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; as a segment for the anthology film &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). Despite not being involved or present, the infamous helicopter crash shook him, leading to a re-evaluation of the stunt-work in his future films. He also co-produced and co-directed many acclaimed miniseries for Australian television including &quot;The Dismissal&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Cowra Breakout&quot; (1984).

=== 1987–1995: Established director === 
In 1987, Miller directed &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson, Susan Sarandon, Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film proved to be a troubling experience for Miller. &quot;I quit the film twice and Jack [Nicholson] held me in there,&quot; said Miller. &quot;He said, &#x27;Just sit down, lose your emotion, and have a look at the work. If you think the work is good, stick with the film.&#x27; And he was a great man. I learnt more from him than anybody else I’ve worked with - he was extraordinary.&quot; Nicholson also coached Miller to exaggerate his needs during the production, asking for 300 extras when he only needed 150, knowing that his producers would give him less than he requested. The award-winning production designer Polly Platt also collaborated closely with Miller on &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;. Cher later said that prior to working on the film, Miller called her at home, the day after her 40th birthday, to inform her that he and Nicholson didn&#x27;t want her in the film. She was deemed &quot;too old and not sexy&quot;.

Following &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, Miller focused primarily on producing Australian projects. His role as producer of &quot;Flirting&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm&quot; and the TV miniseries &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; and &quot;Vietnam&quot;, all starring Nicole Kidman, was instrumental in the development of her career. Miller returned to directing with the release of the biographical medical drama &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), which he co-wrote with Nick Enright. The film starred Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. The film received critical acclaim with &quot;Variety&quot; describing the film as a &quot;true-life story brought to the screen intelligently and with passionate motivation by George Miller&quot;. For his work on the film Miller was nominated for the Academy Award and Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. The following year Miller was hired to direct the science fiction drama film &quot;Contact&quot; based on the story by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. After working on the film for over a year, Warner Bros. and Miller mutually agreed to part ways and Robert Zemeckis was eventually brought on to direct.

=== 1995–2011: &quot;Babe&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet&quot; films ===
In 1995 Miller produced and co-wrote the comedy-drama &quot;Babe&quot; directed by Chris Noonan. The film was a critical and financial success. The film earned 7 Academy Award nominations including for Miller for Best Adapted Screenplay. Miller went on to write and direct its sequel &quot;&quot; (1998). &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars praising Miller&#x27;s work on the sequel writing, &quot;It outdoes itself with the sets and special effects that make up &quot;the city.&quot; And it is still literate, humane and wicked. George Miller, who produced, directed and co-wrote the film, has improved and extended the ideas in &quot;Babe: Pig in the City,&quot; instead of being content to copy them.&quot; Critic Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named it the Best film of 1998. 

In 1995, Miller also produced &quot;Video Fool for Love&quot;, a controversial and divisive cinema verité documentary shot on video by film editor Robert Gibson that deals with Gibson&#x27;s personal life and relationship issues.
Miller was also the creator of the animated jukebox musical film &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) about the life of penguins in Antarctica. The Warner Bros.-produced film was released in November 2006. It was a runaway box office success earning $363 million worldwide, and also brought Miller his fourth Academy Award nomination, and his first win in the category of Best Animated Feature. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film writing, &quot;Miller...shows a remarkable persistence of vision. Even in a story about singing-and-dancing fat and feather, Mr. Miller can’t help but go dark and deep&quot; adding, &quot;[He] brings an unusual depth of feeling to his work as well as a distinct moral worldview&quot;.

In 2007, Miller signed on to direct a Justice League film titled &quot;Justice League: Mortal&quot;. While production was initially held up due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, further production delays and the success of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; led to Warner Bros. deciding to put the film on hold and pursue different options. As a partnership between his production company Kennedy Miller Mitchell and Omnilab Media, George Miller co-founded Dr. D Studios, a Sydney-based digital animation studio in mid-2007. In 2011, the &quot;Happy Feet&quot; sequel &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; was released by Dr. D Studios. But following the financially unsuccessful release of &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; and the long delay of &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), the studio closed down in 2013.

=== 2015–present: Career resurgence ===

In 2012, Miller began principal photography on &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, the fourth film in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series, after several years of production delays. &quot;Fury Road&quot; starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron was released on 15 May 2015. The film became a box office success and was met with widespread critical acclaim with several critics calling it one of the greatest action films ever made. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; labeled it a &quot;New York Times Critic&#x27;s Pick&quot; writing, &quot;Miller has always stayed true to his scrappy, pragmatic roots. At 70, he has a master craftsman’s intuitive sense of proportion and a visual artisan’s mistrust of extraneous verbiage&quot; adding, &quot;It’s all great fun, and quite rousing as well — a large-scale genre movie that is at once unpretentious and unafraid to bring home a message&quot;. It went on to receive 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, while Miller himself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.

In October 2018 it was announced that Miller would direct &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot;, which began filming in November 2020. The film starring Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2022. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;a heartfelt Aladdin-esque adventure for grownups&quot; adding, &quot;Miller shows he is now doing one-for-him-and-one-that’s-even-more-for-him. It’s an Arabian Nights-type fantasia which he has clearly been gagging to make for years&quot;. Justin Chang of &quot;NPR&quot; wrote that &quot;Miller unveils an outlandish premise with a sly wit that&#x27;s initially hard to resist&quot; but added the film &quot;ends on a muted, uncertain note&quot;. The film was a box office bomb grossing $20 million worldwide off a budget of $60 million.

In April 2017, Miller said that he and co-writer Nico Lathouris have finished two additional post-&quot;Fury Road&quot; scripts for the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series. The &quot;Fury Road&quot; lead, Tom Hardy, is committed to the next sequel. In 2015, and again in early 2017, Miller said &quot;the fifth film in the franchise will be titled &quot;Mad Max: The Wasteland&quot;.&quot; In 2020, it was reported that Miller would next direct the &quot;Mad Max&quot; spinoff &quot;&quot; starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. The film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a &quot;NYT Critic&#x27;s Pick&quot; declaring, &quot;Miller is such a wildly inventive filmmaker that it’s been easy to forget that he keeps making movies about the end of life as we know it. It’s a blast watching his characters fight over oil, water and women, yet while I’ve long thought of him as a great filmmaker it’s only with &quot;Furiosa&quot; that I now understand he’s also one kick-ass prophet of doom.&quot;

==Personal life==
Miller was married to actress Sandy Gore from 1985 to 1992; they have a daughter. He has been married to film editor Margaret Sixel since 1995. They have two sons. Sixel has worked in some capacity on many of Miller&#x27;s directorial efforts. Miller is a feminist, having told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in May 2015, &quot;I&#x27;ve gone from being very male dominant to being surrounded by magnificent women. I can&#x27;t help but be a feminist.&quot;

Miller is the patron of the Australian Film Institute and the Brisbane International Film Festival, and a co-patron of the Sydney Film Festival. 

Miller has said many times that the 1940 version of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is one of his favourite films.

<text>Milford is a coastal city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, between New Haven and Bridgeport. The population was 50,558 at the 2020 United States Census. The city includes the village of Devon and the borough of Woodmont. Milford is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region and New York metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early history===

When the English first encountered the territory, the Paugusset (an Algonquian-speaking tribe) predominated. English colonists affiliated with the contemporary New Haven Colony purchased land which today comprises Milford, Orange, and West Haven on February 1, 1639, from Ansantawae, chief of the local Paugusset. They knew the area as &quot;Wepawaug,&quot; named for the small river which runs through the town. The English built a grist mill by the Wepawaug River in 1640. Streets in Milford and Orange were later named &quot;Wepawaug&quot;.

During the Revolutionary War, the Milford section of the Boston Post Road, a vital route connecting Boston, New York, and other major coastal cities, was blockaded by Continental forces. Fort Trumbull was constructed to protect the town. The Liberty Rock monument commemorates the site of the blockade.

By 1822, the town had grown large enough that residents in Milford&#x27;s northern and eastern sections chartered the Town of Orange. During the next century and a half, the remaining section of Milford was known for shipbuilding, farming, and oystering. Industrial facilities were also developed.

Because of its location on Long Island Sound, Milford became a beach resort for residents of New Haven and Bridgeport in the latter 19th century.

In 1899, the &quot;Memorial Bridge&quot; (a &quot;stone bridge and tower commemorating the town&#x27;s history and founders&quot;) replaced the last mill over the Wepawaug, which had closed in 1894. The bridge was described as &quot;simple in design, its broad copings surmounted with rough hewn blocks of granite, bearing the names of the first settlers. There are ten blocks on the south and twenty on the north coping. At each end of the former is a stone four feet wide by five and a half high.&quot; It is located where Broad Street crosses the Wepawaug River.

In 1903, the southeastern portion of the town was incorporated as the Borough of Woodmont. In 1959, the Town of Milford, including the Borough of Woodmont, was incorporated as the City of Milford.
===Towns created from Milford===
Milford was one of the early settlements in south central Connecticut and, over time, gave rise to several new towns that broke off and incorporated separately. The following is a list of towns created from parts of Milford.

* Woodbridge in 1784 (also partly from New Haven)
** Bethany, created from Woodbridge in 1832
* Orange (originally North Milford) in 1822 (also partly from New Haven)
** West Haven, created from Orange in 1921

===The &quot;oatmeal lots&quot; of Liberty Park===
Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford. The lots, sometimes as small as by 10 feet, were carved out of a tract in a never-built subdivision called &quot;Liberty Park&quot;. A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the &quot;oatmeal lots&quot;. The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots would need to be combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford&#x27;s planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn&#x27;t find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.

In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials put an end to the oatmeal lots in a &quot;general foreclosure&quot; that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing. One of the streets in the Liberty Park subdivision plans, Shelland Street, was later built in the late 1990s as an access road to the Milford Power Company. The site is currently home to the Bic Corporation&#x27;s lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive.

In a separate land giveaway in 1955 tied to the &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot; television show, Quaker Oats offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike.

===Post-World War II development===
In the post-World War II period, Milford—like many Connecticut towns—underwent significant suburbanization. Interstate 95 was routed through the city, and the Milford section was completed in 1958.

The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the construction of the Connecticut Post Mall, one of the state&#x27;s largest shopping malls, and the extensive commercial development of the town&#x27;s stretch of the Boston Post Road. One notable small business located on the Boston Post Road during the 1970s was SCELBI Computer Consulting, credited by many as being the world&#x27;s first personal-computer manufacturer. Starting in 1975, the city began hosting the Milford Oyster Festival, which has since become firmly established as an annual Milford tradition that is held &quot;rain or shine&quot;.

The city became host to several headquarters of multinational corporations, including the Schick Shaving company, and Doctor&#x27;s Associates, Inc., owners of the Subway chain of fast-food restaurants.

==Culture and events==
Every year on the third Saturday in August, Milford celebrates its annual Oyster Festival, which serves as a combination of a typical town fair with a culinary celebration of the town&#x27;s location on historically shellfish-rich Long Island Sound. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink&quot; the lobster roll originated as a hot dish at a restaurant named Perry&#x27;s as early as 1929. This festival takes place in and around the Milford Green, near the center of town, as well as in various locations throughout the downtown area, and features a wide variety of events including canoe and kayak races, musical performances, and classic car shows.

The Milford Oyster Festival has drawn large musical acts over the years including Joan Jett, The Marshall Tucker Band, John Cafferty &amp; The Beaver Brown Band, and Soul Asylum. 

There are also other features such as carnival rides, food stands, crafts, face painting, and even opening your own oyster for a pearl.

The Milford Cultural Center, operated by the Milford Council for the Arts, offers various events throughout the year. The Firehouse Art Gallery was recently opened in Devon. The beach resort quality of the town lives on, with several rocky beaches, Silver Sands State Park, the Connecticut Audubon Society Coastal Center at Milford Point, Charles Island, two golf courses, and numerous other recreational facilities available for residents and tourists.

Milford&#x27;s Devon neighborhood is located at the mouth of the Housatonic River near Stratford, and features the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center overlooking the estuary.

===Islands and coastline===
Milford has over of shoreline facing Long Island Sound, the most of any town in Connecticut. A large portion of Milford&#x27;s shoreline forms the Silver Sands State Park. A newly built 3/4 mile boardwalk was opened in 2011 that connects Silver Sands to Walnut Beach in Devon. Charles Island is also a part of the park and is a protected bird nesting ground. There is a sandbar (called a tombolo since it is perpendicular, not parallel to the coast) accessible during low tide that people can walk on from Silver Sands Beach to Charles Island. However, the sandbar can be dangerous to walk on as the quick change from low tide to high tide has led to several drownings. Visitors to Charles Island include treasure hunters looking for stolen treasure believed to have been buried in 1699 by Captain William Kidd and his pirate crew.

The island is a part of the Hamonasset-Ledyard Moraine and was formed as glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. The Wisconsin glaciation formed drumlins in Milford: Clark, Burwell, Eels, Bryan and Merwin hills.

Milford owns three islands in the Housatonic River: Fowler Island, just to the south of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, Duck Island, and Nells Island, both near the mouth of the river. In addition to Silver Sands State Park, Milford has five public beaches with lifeguard services for its residents—Gulf Beach, Anchor Beach, Hawley Avenue Beach, Walnut Beach, and Middle Beach—as well as seven private beaches.

<text>The Kapp Putsch (), also known as the Kapp–Lüttwitz Putsch (), was an abortive coup d&#x27;état against the German national government in Berlin on 13 March 1920. Named after its leaders Wolfgang Kapp and Walther von Lüttwitz, its goal was to undo the German Revolution of 1918–1919, overthrow the Weimar Republic, and establish an autocratic government. It was supported by parts of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, as well as nationalist and monarchist factions.

Although the legitimate German government was forced to flee the city, the coup failed after a few days, when large sections of the German population joined a general strike called by the government. Most civil servants refused to cooperate with Kapp and his allies. Despite its failure, the Putsch had significant consequences for the future of the Weimar Republic. It was also one of the direct causes of the Ruhr uprising a few weeks later, which the government suppressed by military force, after having dealt leniently with leaders of the Putsch. These events polarized the German electorate, resulting in a shift in the majority after the June 1920 Reichstag election.

==Background==

After Germany had lost the First World War (1914–1918), the German Revolution of 1918–1919 ended the monarchy. The German Empire was abolished and a democratic system, the Weimar Republic, was established in 1919 by the Weimar National Assembly. Right-wing nationalist and militarist circles opposed the new republic and promoted the stab-in-the-back myth, claiming that the war had been lost only because the efforts of the undefeated German military had been undermined by civilians at home.

In 1919–1920, the government of Germany was formed by the Weimar Coalition, consisting of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), German Democratic Party (DDP, left-of-centre liberals), and Zentrum (conservative Catholics). President Friedrich Ebert, Chancellor Gustav Bauer, and Defence Minister Gustav Noske were all members of the SPD. According to the constitution, the president was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, represented in peace time by the Minister of Defence. The most senior officer of the land forces was called &quot;Chef der Heeresleitung&quot;, a post held in early 1920 by General Walther Reinhardt.

Chancellor Bauer was obliged to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, even though he disagreed with it. The treaty had been dictated by the victorious Allies of World War I; it forced Germany to assume responsibility for the war, reduced the area of Germany and imposed huge reparation payments and military restrictions on the nation. In early 1919, the strength of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, the regular German army, was estimated at 350, 000, with more than 250, 000 men enlisted in the various &quot;Freikorps&quot; (&quot;free corps&quot;), volunteer paramilitary units, largely consisting of returning soldiers from the war. The German government had repeatedly used &quot;Freikorps&quot; troops to put down Communist uprisings after the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which came into effect on 10 January 1920, Germany was required to reduce its land forces to a maximum of 100,000 men, who were to be only professional soldiers, not conscripts. The initial deadline was set for 31 March 1920 (later extended to the end of the year). &quot;Freikorps&quot; units were expected to be disbanded. Since the reason for their creation—internal repression—had become obsolete with the crushing of the leftist uprisings, they were becoming a threat to the government. Some senior military commanders had started discussing the possibility of a coup as early as July 1919.

==Coup==

===Run-up to the coup===

Although the Putsch has been named after Wolfgang Kapp, a 62-year-old nationalist East Prussian civil servant, who had been planning a coup against the republic for a while, it was instigated by the military; Kapp played a supporting role. On 29 February 1920, the Defence Minister Noske ordered the disbandment of two of the most powerful &quot;Freikorps&quot;, the and . The latter numbered from 5,000 to 6,000 men and had been stationed at the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Döberitz&quot;, near Berlin, since January 1920. An elite force, it had been created from former Imperial Navy officers and NCOs, boosted later by (those who had fought the Bolsheviks in Latvia in 1919). During the civil war in 1919, the brigade had seen action in Munich and Berlin. It was extremely opposed to the democratic government of Friedrich Ebert.

Its commander, &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Hermann Ehrhardt, declared that the unit would refuse its dissolution. On 1 March, it staged a parade without inviting Noske. General Walther von Lüttwitz, in command of all the regular troops in and around Berlin (&quot;Gruppenkommando I&quot;), the highest ranking general in the army at the time and in command of many &quot;Freikorps&quot;, said at the parade that he would &quot;not accept&quot; the loss of such an important unit. Several of Lüttwitz&#x27;s officers were horrified at this open rejection of the government&#x27;s authority and tried to mediate, by setting up a meeting between Lüttwitz and the leaders of the two major right-wing parties. Lüttwitz listened to and remembered their ideas but was not dissuaded from his course of action. Noske then removed the &quot;Marinebrigade&quot; from Lüttwitz&#x27;s command and assigned it to the leadership of the Navy, hoping that they would disband the unit. Lüttwitz ignored the order but agreed to a meeting with President Ebert, suggested by his staff.
In the evening of 10 March, Lüttwitz came with his staff to Ebert&#x27;s office. Ebert had also asked Noske to attend. Lüttwitz, drawing on demands by the right-wing parties and adding his own, now demanded the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly, new elections for the Reichstag, the appointment of technocrats (&quot;Fachminister&quot;) as Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs and Finance, the dismissal of General Reinhardt, appointment of himself as supreme commander of the regular army and the revocation of the orders of dissolution for the &quot;Marinebrigaden&quot;. Ebert and Noske rejected these demands and Noske told Lüttwitz that he expected his resignation the next day.

Lüttwitz went to Döberitz on 11 March and asked Ehrhardt whether he would be able to occupy Berlin that evening. Ehrhardt said he needed another day but in the morning of 13 March he could be in the centre of Berlin with his men. Lüttwitz gave the order and Ehrhardt began the preparations. It was only at this point that Lüttwitz brought the group known as &quot;Nationale Vereinigung&quot; into the plot. These included German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) member Wolfgang Kapp, retired general Erich Ludendorff, Waldemar Pabst (who had been behind the murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in January 1919), and , the last Berlin head of police in the old Reich. Their goal was to establish an authoritarian regime (though not a monarchy) with a return to the federal structure of the Empire. Lüttwitz asked them to be ready to take over the government on 13 March. The group was unprepared but agreed to the schedule set by Lüttwitz. One factor making them support quick action was that sympathetic members of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; in Berlin informed them that warrants for their arrest had been issued that day.

Lüttwitz was not dismissed but suspended from his post on 11 March. To defend the government, Noske ordered two regiments of &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; and one regular regiment to take position in the government quarter but doubted that a Putsch was imminent. The regimental commanders decided not to follow orders to shoot, a decision that received the approval of &quot;Chef des Truppenamts&quot; General Hans von Seeckt.

===Occupation of Berlin===

The reluctance to shed blood was one-sided. On the evening of 12 March, Ehrhardt ordered his brigade to march into Berlin, to &quot;ruthlessly break any resistance&quot; (&quot;jeden Widerstand rücksichtslos zu brechen&quot;) and to occupy the centre of the city with the government buildings. The Brigade, sporting swastikas on their helmets and vehicles, started off towards Berlin at around 10:00 pm. An hour later the &quot;Gruppenkommando&quot; knew about it and informed Noske. Two general officers met Ehrhardt and convinced him to give the government a chance to surrender before being taken into custody, assuming that all of Lüttwitz&#x27;s demands were accepted by 7:00 am. This was reported to Noske who met with Ebert. Ebert then called a cabinet meeting for 4:00 am. At 1:00 am Noske asked the senior commanders to his office in the Bendlerblock.

Noske asked the commanders to defend the government buildings but was turned down. All but two of the officers (one of them was Reinhardt, &quot;Chef der Heeresleitung&quot;) refused to follow an order to shoot at the rebel troops. Some suggested negotiations, others claimed that the troops would not understand an order to fire, some argued that the regular units would not be able to defeat the elite &quot;Marinebrigade&quot;. Seeckt spoke about comradeship. His exact words were not recorded, but have been reported as: &quot;troops do not fire on troops. So, you perhaps intend, Herr Minister, that a battle be fought before the &quot;Brandenburger Tor&quot; between troops that have fought side by side against a common enemy? When Reichswehr fires on Reichswehr all comradeship within the officers&#x27; corps will have vanished&quot;. Others have quoted Seeckt&#x27;s words as the even more succinct: &quot;Reichswehr does not fire on Reichswehr!&quot;

Noske, depressed enough by the disloyalty of the military to speak about suicide to an aide, reported to the cabinet at 4:00 am. At a confused meeting at the Reichskanzlei, the undefended cabinet took two decisions: to flee the city and to issue a call for a general strike. These were not unanimous, the Vice-Chancellor Eugen Schiffer and some of the other non-SPD ministers refused to leave the city, to preserve the opportunity to negotiate with the putschists. Only Ebert and the SPD ministers signed the call for a general strike. At 6:15 am they had to interrupt the meeting and flee. Within ten minutes of their departure, the &quot;Marinebrigade&quot; reached the &quot;Brandenburger Tor&quot;, where it was met by Lüttwitz, Ludendorff, Kapp and their followers. Shortly thereafter, Kapp&#x27;s men moved into the Reichskanzlei. Supported by a battalion of regular Reichswehr, they occupied the government quarter.

Kapp declared himself Chancellor (&quot;Reichskanzler&quot;) and formed a provisional government. Lüttwitz served as commander of the armed forces and Minister of Defence. Several well-known conservatives and former secretaries of state were invited to assume government positions but declined. International con-man Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln became Kapp&#x27;s press censor.

===Bloodshed in Harburg===

Since 1 January, Rudolf Berthold&#x27;s Iron Troop &quot;Freikorps&quot; had been returning to Germany from fighting in Lithuania. Their eventual destination was Zossen, where they would disarm. By 13 March, they had gotten as far as Stade. There, they discovered the insurrection was in progress. Balked from boarding a train there by striking rail workers, Berthold had his men occupy the train station, city hall, telegraph office, and post office. He then bedded his troops for the night in the local girls&#x27; high school. The following day, the Iron Troop commandeered a train, which crept along unsafe tracks into Harburg, Hamburg. Before the Iron Troop&#x27;s arrival, Independent Socialist city officials had quietly arrested the commanding officer of the local &quot;Reichswehr&quot; battalion, leaving the soldiers leaderless. Upon the train&#x27;s arrival, the officials directed the &quot;Freikorps&quot; to the local middle school for shelter.

On the following morning, 15 March 1920, a citizen militia began to coalesce around the school. At about noon, a &quot;Freikorps&quot; machine-gunner fired a burst over the gathering crowd to disperse them. A firefight ensued, with 13 civilian casualties. Three Iron Troop soldiers were also killed, and eight others captured and executed. With neither police nor &quot;Reichswehr&quot; troops to restrain the gathering militia, and little ammunition among his troops, Berthold realized he had to negotiate a surrender. He agreed to let his unarmed men exit the school at six pm upon assurance the militia would not harm them. During this surrender, an enraged crowd of onlookers mobbed the Iron Troop, and Berthold was murdered. The disarmed Iron Troop was taken to a nearby military base.

===Reactions===

There was no military resistance to the Putsch; the regular troops in Berlin, &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot;, navy, the army commands of East-Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg and Silesia, formally accepted the new minister of defence and Reichskanzler. Admiral Adolf von Trotha, the navy commander, came out in support of the coup as soon as he learned of it. In Bavaria, the Social Democratic state government resigned after refusing to install an emergency regime as demanded by Reichswehr General Arnold von Möhl, Georg Escherich and Gustav Ritter von Kahr. The Bavarian Parliament then elected Kahr, a right-wing politician associated with the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, as Minister President of Bavaria. In the rest of the Reich, the commanders of the &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; (military districts) did not declare for or against Kapp but were not neutral and most sympathised more or less openly with the putschists. The upper echelons of the bureaucracy were still dominated by those who had risen to their positions under the Empire and most were sympathetic to the coup, whilst remaining outwardly neutral and biding their time. In the eastern provinces, the bureaucracy fell in line behind Kapp and Lüttwitz.

==== General Strike against the Coup ====
The government moved to Dresden, where they hoped to get support from Generalmajor Maercker but he had been ordered by Berlin to take them into &quot;protective custody&quot; and they moved on to Stuttgart. The cabinet proclamation on calling on German workers to defeat the Putsch by means of a general strike met with enormous success and received massive support from the working class. The majority unions, sympathetic to the government dominated by social democrats, joined the call for a strike on the same day, as did the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and the Democratic Party; the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) followed one day later.

In Berlin, the strike started on 14 March and by the next day it had spread all over the Reich. It was the most powerful strike in the history of Germany, involving up to 12 million workers. The country was paralysed. In Berlin the gas, water and power supply stopped.

Adolf Hitler, who had been in contact with the members of the &quot;Nationale Vereinigung&quot; and was eager to help the coup along, was flown into Berlin from Munich by the Army. The pilot was Robert von Greim, whom Hitler later appointed as the last commander of the Luftwaffe. He was met by striking workers at an airfield outside of Berlin, where he landed by mistake, and had to disguise himself. Eventually Hitler was able to continue his flight together with Dietrich Eckart to Berlin, where they immediately went to the Reichskanzlei to meet Wolfgang Kapp. Hitler and Eckart were approached by Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln, who told them that Kapp had fled and the coup failed.

===Collapse===

With the country paralyzed, Kapp and Lüttwitz were unable to govern; in Berlin, communication between military units was by courier only. The rank and file of the bureaucracy were on strike, and there were no newspapers. Proclamations asking the workers to return to their jobs, promises of new elections and even the threat of capital punishment for strikers remained without results and the Putsch collapsed on four days after it had begun. Kapp had put Vice-Chancellor Schiffer and the members of the Prussian state government into protective custody on 13 March but they were released the next day and on 15 March, negotiations began. Representatives of the democratic right, Oskar Hergt and Gustav Stresemann also participated. The four big centre-right parties (Democratic Party, Zentrum, German People&#x27;s Party and German National People&#x27;s Party) agreed that the main threat was now &quot;bolshevism&quot; and that they had to &quot;win back&quot; the officer corps. It was considered undesirable that Kapp and Lüttwitz should be toppled, they must be seen to resign voluntarily.

The four parties, supported by some Social Democrats who had remained in Berlin, offered fresh elections, a cabinet reshuffle and an amnesty for all participants in the Putsch, if Kapp and Lüttwitz were to resign. The putschists offered only the resignation of Kapp, and Lüttwitz tried to hold on for another day as head of a military dictatorship but his commanders deserted him. They suggested to Schiffer, in the absence of Ebert in charge of the government&#x27;s affairs, that he appoint Seeckt as head of the Reichswehr, which Schiffer did in the name of Ebert. When Lüttwitz offered his resignation on 18 March, Schiffer accepted—again in Ebert&#x27;s name—while granting him full pension rights. Schiffer also suggested Pabst and Lüttwitz should leave the country, until the National Assembly had decided on the question of an amnesty and even offered them false passports and money.

On 18 March, Seeckt praised the discipline of the &quot;Marinebrigade Ehrhardt&quot; and the next day provided Ehrhardt with a written promise that he would not be arrested as long as he was in command of the brigade and the brigade left Berlin. When they were heckled by an unfriendly crowd of bystanders, they opened fire with machine guns, leaving twelve civilians dead and thirty severely wounded. Kapp remained in the country and only fled to Sweden in April. Lüttwitz first went to Saxony and only later left for Hungary. Both men used passports provided by supporters in the police. Ehrhardt went into hiding in Bavaria.

==Aftermath==
===Weimar politics===
In 2009, Layton wrote, &quot;At first sight the collapse of the Kapp &quot;Putsch&quot; could be viewed as a major success for the Weimar Republic. In the six days of crisis, it had retained the backing of the people of Berlin and had effectively withstood a major threat from the extreme right.&quot; Among the grievances which Kapp and his followers had against the government were that the National Assembly, which had been elected to serve temporarily, was beginning to act as a permanent Reichstag and that it seemed this assembly might revise the constitution with respect to the election of the president of the Republic, which would make the Reichstag, rather than the electorate, responsible for the presidential election. As a consequence of the political crisis that the putsch caused, the date of the general election for the first republican Reichstag was brought forward to 6 June. All attempts to change the method of election for the presidency of the Republic were abandoned. In the Reichstag elections of 6 June, the number of votes cast for the SPD and the Democratic Party fell by more than half compared to the January 1919 elections, while the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) (some of whose voters eventually switched to the Nazis) and the left-wing USPD gained substantially. The Weimar Coalition lost its majority in parliament and would never regain it.
===Ruhr uprising===

The effects of the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch throughout Germany were more lasting than in Berlin. In some parts of the country, the strike turned into an armed revolt. The violence came from local military commanders who supported the new government and arrested pickets, which the workers resisted. In Thuringia and Saxony the military defeated the workers after bloody fights. In the Ruhr, the workers continued their protests after the Putsch in Berlin had collapsed. In the Ruhr uprising, the Red Ruhr Army of about 50,000 workers went on the offensive with the goal of overthrowing the Weimar Republic and replacing it with a soviet-style council republic. On it took Dortmund, on 18 March Hamm and Bochum and on 19 March Essen, causing the local commander of the military district at Münster to order a withdrawal. By 22 March, the Ruhr was under the control of the revolutionary workers.

The legitimate government returned to Berlin on 20 March and demanded an end to the general strike. It offered some concessions to the unions, some of them made in bad faith. The unions (ADGB, Afa-Bund and DBB) demanded the creation of a new government made up of SPD and USPD led by Carl Legien, but only a new government based on the Weimar Coalition found a majority in the National Assembly. Hermann Müller (SPD) replaced Bauer as chancellor. The government then tried to negotiate with workers who refused to lay down their arms after the unions called off the strike on 22 March. When the negotiations failed, the revolt in the Ruhr was suppressed by Reichswehr and &quot;Freikorps&quot; units in early April 1920. Over 1,000 workers were killed, many in summary executions, some committed by units that had been involved in the Putsch, including the &quot;Marinebrigade Loewenfeld&quot;. Another 600 Reichswehr and Freikorps soldiers also lost their lives. As in 1918–1919, those on the left had cause to accuse the SPD and the Ebert government of siding with the enemies of the workers and of the republic.

===Putsch perpetrators===
The Putsch left a rump of military conspirators such as Pabst and Ehrhardt, who found refuge in Bavaria under the right-wing government of Gustav von Kahr (itself an indirect product of the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch) and there attempted to organize plots against the republican constitution and government of Germany. The crisis in the relations of Bavaria with the Reich (August–September 1921) which ended in Kahr&#x27;s resignation was a further phase of the same trouble.

After the Putsch Noske named Kapp, Pabst and Ehrhardt as being responsible, despite the support from much higher up in the army. Most of the participants were granted an amnesty and on 2 August 1920, the Reichstag passed a law that exculpated crimes committed during the Putsch and the subsequent Ruhr Uprising except those due to &quot;cruelty&quot; or &quot;self-interest&quot;. Of 705 cases brought against civilians, only the prosecution of von Jagow ended with a guilty verdict. &quot;Freikorps&quot; and Reichswehr members were subject to military law and of 775 courts-martial, 486 cases were closed. 48 officers were removed from their posts, six resigned, the others were subject to mild disciplinary actions. The &quot;Marinebrigade Ehrhardt&quot; was dissolved in May 1920 but most of its members were allowed to join the Reichswehr where they had successful careers. The courts were much harsher on the members of the Red Ruhr Army, many of whom were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment.

Kapp was arrested in Sweden on 16 April but not deported to Germany. He voluntarily returned to Germany in April 1922 and died the same year in prison while awaiting trial. Lüttwitz returned to Germany as part of an amnesty in 1924. Gustav Noske was forced to resign by the unions on 22 March, as a condition for ending the general strike and because some in the SPD thought that he had not been tough enough facing up to the putschists; Otto Gessler succeeded Noske as Defence Minister. General Reinhardt also resigned out of protest at Noske&#x27;s dismissal. General Seeckt became his successor as &quot;Chef der Heeresleitung&quot;.

Former Ottoman grand vizier Talat Pasha, the main perpetrator of the Armenian genocide, was hiding in Berlin after the war and appeared at the press conference to criticize the putschists for dilettantism.

===Monument to the March Dead===
Between 1920 and 1922 a monument in honour of the workers who were killed in the wake of the Kapp Putsch was erected in the Weimar central cemetery. The memorial was commissioned by the Weimar Gewerkschaftskartell (Union Cartel), which conducted a competition to select a design. It was built according to plans submitted by the architectural office of Walter Gropius. Although Gropius had said that the Bauhaus should remain politically neutral, he agreed to participate in the competition of Weimar artists at the end of 1920.

The monument was arranged around an inner space, in which visitors could stand. The repeatedly fractured and highly angular memorial rose up on three sides, as if thrust up from or rammed into the earth.

The monument was destroyed by the Nazis in February 1936. They objected to it politically and considered it an example of &quot;degenerate art&quot;, as Hitler characterized modern works.

<text>Nelson College is the oldest state secondary school in New Zealand, a feat achieved in part thanks to its original inception as a private school. It is an all-boys school in the City of Nelson that teaches from years 9 to 13. In addition, it runs a private preparatory school for year 7 and 8 boys. The school also has places for boarders, who live in two boarding houses adjacent to the main school buildings on the same campus.

A Nelson College old boy, Charles Monro, was instrumental in introducing the game of rugby into New Zealand.

==History==
The school opened with eight students on 7 April 1856 in premises in Trafalgar Square, Nelson, but shortly thereafter moved to a site in Manuka Street. In 1861, the school moved again to its current site in Waimea Road. The Deed of Foundation was signed in 1857 and set out the curriculum to be followed by the college. It included English language and literature, one or more modern languages, geography, mathematics, classics, history, drawing, music and such other branches of science as the Council of Governors should determine. The Deed stated that the purpose of the school was the &quot;advancement of religion and morality, and the promotion of useful knowledge, by offering to the youth of the Province general education of a superior character.&quot;

In 1858, the General Assembly passed the Nelson College Act, which confirmed the status of the school. There were nine initial trustees, including Charles Elliott, David Monro, John Barnicoat, Charles Bigg Wither, William Wells, and Alfred Domett. In that same year, Alfred Fell gifted the common seal, containing the college&#x27;s badge and motto, &quot;Pietas, Probitas et Sapientia&quot; (Loyalty, honesty and wisdom). A team from Nelson College took part in the first game of rugby played in New Zealand, against the Nelson Rugby Football Club on 14 May 1870 at what is now known as the Botanic Reserve, Nelson, and, in 1876, the first inter-College rugby match in New Zealand was played between Nelson College and Wellington College.
On 7 December 1904, the college was almost completely destroyed by fire. The main building, designed by William Beatson, was said to be a &quot;miniature of Eton,&quot; the architect being an old Etonian. In 1926, Nelson College was invited to join the annual rugby tournament between Christ&#x27;s College, Wanganui Collegiate School and Wellington College, known as the &quot;Quadrangular&quot;. In the 1929 Murchison earthquake, the main building of the college was once again severely damaged, although only two boys were injured.

In 2011, Nelson College became the first all-boys college in New Zealand to form a gay-straight alliance support group. The alliance operated from its own room. In 2017, the group was re-formed, after a failed attempt in 2015.

In 2019, long-serving and retiring headmaster Gary O&#x27;Shea claimed that the school needed more girls to stay up-to-date.

==House system==
The college has a house system with, six different houses that compete across a range of sporting codes, including cross country running and swimming, together with varied cultural activities:
* Barnicoat–Rutherford combined (white &amp; black)
* Chaytor (red)
* Domett (green)
* Monro (blue)
* Robinson (orange)
* Kahurangi (yellow)

The two boarding houses, Rutherford and Barnicoat, recently underwent a five-year refurbishment. A third boarding house, Fell, was closed to boarders at the end of 2018, and is now available for lease, predominantly to sports and community groups.

<doc id="152171" wikidata="Q250545" url="?curid=152171" title="Baz Luhrmann">
<text>Mark Anthony &quot;Baz&quot; Luhrmann (born 17 September 1962) is an Australian film director, producer, writer, and actor. With projects spanning film, television, opera, theatre, music, and recording industries, he is regarded by some as a contemporary example of an auteur for his style and deep involvement in the writing, directing, design, and musical components of all his work. He is the most commercially successful Australian director, with four of his films in the top ten highest worldwide grossing Australian films of all time.

On the screen, he is best known for his &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy&quot;, consisting of his romantic comedy film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992) and the romantic tragedies &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996) and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001). Following the trilogy, projects included &quot;Australia&quot; (2008), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013), &quot;Elvis&quot; (2022), and his television period drama &quot;The Get Down&quot; (2016) for Netflix. Additional projects include stage productions of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; for both Opera Australia and Broadway, and &quot;Strictly Ballroom the Musical&quot; (2014).

Luhrmann is known for his Grammy-nominated soundtracks for &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, as well as his record label House of Iona, a co-venture with RCA Records. Serving as producer on all of his musical soundtracks, he also holds writing credits on many of the individual tracks. His album &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; features music from many of his films and also includes his hit &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Luhrmann was born in Sydney. His mother, Barbara Carmel (), was a ballroom dance teacher and dress shop owner, and his father, Leonard Luhrmann, ran a petrol station and a movie theatre. He was raised in Herons Creek, a tiny rural settlement in mid-northern New South Wales. He attended St Joseph&#x27;s Hastings Regional School, Port Macquarie (1975–1978); St Paul&#x27;s Catholic College, performing in the school&#x27;s version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, and Narrabeen Sports High School, where he met future collaborator Craig Pearce.

Luhrmann received the nickname &quot;Baz&quot; at school, given to him because of his hairstyle, the name coming from the puppet character Basil Brush. While still in high school, Luhrmann changed his name by deed poll to Bazmark, joining his nickname and birth name together. In 1980, Luhrmann graduated from high school, and in the same year was cast opposite Judy Davis in the Australian film &quot;Winter of Our Dreams&quot;. In 1982, using the money he had earned from film and television work, he funded his own theatre company, The Bond Theatre Company. The company performed at the pavilion at Sydney&#x27;s Bondi Beach. At the same time, he conceived and appeared in a controversial television documentary, &quot;Kids of the Cross&quot;, where Luhrmann, embedded as a character, lived with a group of street kids. In 1983, he enrolled in an acting course at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. He graduated in 1985 alongside Sonia Todd, Catherine McClements and Justin Monjo. On 26 January 1997, he married Catherine Martin, a production designer; the couple has two children.

Luhrmann supports the Melbourne Demons in the Australian Football League.

==Career==
===Film===

After theatrical successes, including the short play &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; which premiered at the Wharf Theatre, Luhrmann moved into film. He made his directorial debut with the 1992 film version of &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;.

Luhrmann&#x27;s modern film interpretation &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), based on the William Shakespeare play and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, defeated &quot;Titanic&quot; at the BAFTAs for best direction, music and screenplay. The film was celebrated at the Berlin Film Festival, where it was recognised with the Golden Bear award for direction and Silver Bear for DiCaprio&#x27;s performance. Luhrmann also produced both volumes of the soundtrack album, which went triple-platinum.

Luhrmann&#x27;s Oscar-winning musical &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), set in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris at the dawn of the 20th century, told the story of an English poet/writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman). The film was praised by its adherents, including musical directors Robert Wise and Stanley Donen, as having re-invented the modern musical, blending decades of popular music in remixes and mash-ups. The movie was named one of the AFI&#x27;s top ten films of 2001 and in 2010 was chosen as the top film of the 2000s decade in a poll of 150,000 respondents in the United Kingdom. At the 59th Annual Golden Globes, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; took home the awards for Best Motion Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Score. The film also gave birth to a successful soundtrack album, produced by Luhrmann, which sold more than seven million copies and went double-platinum, led by the Grammy-winning number one hit single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.

Luhrmann&#x27;s 2008 historical epic &quot;Australia&quot; featured some of the country&#x27;s most celebrated actors, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and David Gulpilil. Situated between the two World Wars, the film blended a nostalgic romance with major events from Australian history, including the Bombing of Darwin, and the true story of the Stolen Generations, wherein thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children were stolen from their families by the state and forcibly integrated into white society. The movie&#x27;s racial politics were controversial for their time, and notably, its production coincided with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s 2008 Apology to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples. Marcia Langton, professor of Australian indigenous studies at Melbourne University publicly supported the film, saying &quot;Luhrmann depicts with satirical sharpness the racial caste system of that time... In his imagined cinema of the 1940s, the spatial and social shape of racism is reconstructed with such exact detail, I felt I had been transported back to my own childhood.&quot; While achieving modest box office success in the United States, the film was very successful in Europe, maintaining the #1 slot at the box office for many weeks in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Scandinavian countries. It is the second-highest grossing Australian film of all time, next to &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and ahead of &quot;Happy Feet&quot;.

In 2013, Luhrmann adapted F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, shot in 3D, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, Australian newcomer Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker, and legendary Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim. For the film, Luhrmann and costume/production designer Catherine Martin collaborated with Prada, Brooks Brothers, and Tiffany &amp; Co. to create period-inspired dresses, suits, and jewellery based on their own archives and true to the book&#x27;s own references to luxury brands. The film grossed over $353 million worldwide, making it the director&#x27;s highest-grossing movie to date. Critic Richard Roeper described the adaptation as &quot;the best attempt yet to capture the essence of the novel&quot; while Fitzgerald&#x27;s granddaughter praised the movie, saying &quot;Scott would have been proud.&quot; The following year, at the 86th Academy Awards, the film won in both of its nominated categories: Best Production Design and Best Costume Design. The soundtrack, produced by Luhrmann, Anton Monsted, and Jay-Z, sought to blend the music of the Jazz Age with contemporary hip hop as two historical analogues. Featured artists included Beyoncé, Jack White, Lana Del Rey, Sia, will.i.am, The xx, and Florence and the Machine; the soundtrack also included score from the film&#x27;s composer and Luhrmann&#x27;s repeat collaborator Craig Armstrong. The album&#x27;s sales exceeded expectations, marking the biggest digital sales week for a soundtrack in Billboard history, and peaking at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.

Luhrmann&#x27;s next project was a film about Elvis Presley&#x27;s relationship with Colonel Tom Parker, simply called &quot;Elvis&quot;, which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2022. Tom Hanks played Parker and Austin Butler portrayed Presley, having been cast after a series of screen tests, as well as music and performance workshops. The film opened in June 2022, becoming a box office hit and receiving eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Butler. In January 2023, Luhrmann signed a first-look deal with Warner Bros. Pictures after working with the studio on &quot;Elvis&quot;. In August 2023, it was reported that Luhrmann was being eyed as the top pick to direct Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Tangled&quot;.

In September 2024, it was reported that Luhrmann&#x27;s next theatrical release would be an adaption of the life of Joan of Arc, titled Jehanne d’Arc. The project was described as “The ultimate teenage girl coming of age story, set in the Hundred Years’ War.”

Luhrmann directed a 2004 commercial for Chanel N° 5 entitled &quot;N° 5 the Film.&quot; On &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; interview, he told Rose that the commercial was based in the 1953 film, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. The next year 2005, Luhrmann was appointed an Ambassador for the Australian Theatre for Young People, and in next three years, he was asked by the Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd to make adverts for the promotion of tourism in Australia. In 2009 during the 81st Academy Awards in February, Luhrmann put together a number dedicated to musicals which consisted of Hugh Jackman, Beyoncé, Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Dominic Cooper and Amanda Seyfried.

==Influence and legacy==
Luhrmann has cited Italian grand opera as a major influence on his work and has also given a nod to other theatrical styles, such as Bollywood films, as having influenced his style. Luhrmann was a ballroom dancer as a child and his mother taught ballroom dancing which was an inspiration for &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;. Luhrmann&#x27;s favourite films are &quot;Star 80&quot;, &quot;8½&quot;, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, &quot;Medium Cool&quot; and &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;.

Luhrmann&#x27;s influence has extended outside the traditional realm of media and entertainment. Deeply involved in the fashion and art worlds, Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;No. 5 the Film&quot; for Chanel not only holds a Guinness World Record for the highest budget for an advertising commercial ever produced, but pioneered the now commonplace genre of fashion film and branded content. Luhrmann works closely with the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Anna Wintour Costume Center, having chaired the annual Met Gala as well as producing a short film for the museum, celebrating Miuccia Prada and Elsa Schiaparelli. More recently, he and his wife Catherine Martin have adapted their style for projects in events, retail, architecture and design with Barneys New York and developer and hotelier Alan Faena.

In November 2022, Lurhmann featured in &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4; his chosen favourite track, book and luxury item were &quot;Che gelida manina&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; (sung by Pavarotti), Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, and a silk eye mask respectively.
