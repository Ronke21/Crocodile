<text>Mackinaw City ( ) is a village at the northernmost point of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, United States. Divided between Cheboygan and Emmet counties, Mackinaw City is located at the southern end of the Mackinac Bridge, which carries Interstate 75 over the Straits of Mackinac to St. Ignace, in the Upper Peninsula. Mackinaw City and St. Ignace also serve as access points for ferries to and from Mackinac Island. For these reasons, Mackinaw City is considered one of Michigan&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions.

The Mackinaw City area is home to a number of historic sites, including Fort Michilimackinac, Historic Mill Creek State Park, Old Mackinac Point Light, McGulpin Point Light, and the retired US Coast Guard Icebreaker &quot;Mackinaw&quot;.

==History==
=== Etymology and early settlement ===
The name of Mackinaw is a respelling of &quot;Mackinac&quot;, a strait between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, an island in the strait, and an important trading-post on the island; ultimately from Ojibwe mishinii-makinaang (“at the place of many snapping turtles”).

The predominant historic tribes in this area were three Algonquian peoples, known collectively as the Council of Three Fires: Ojibwe (Chippewa), Ottawa (Odawa), and Potawatomi at the time of French contact in the 17th century. These peoples had long frequented the surrounding region, which they called Michilimackinac, to fish, hunt, trade, and worship. Mackinac Island in the straits appeared to have the shape of a turtle. The Native Americans here had a creation myth based on the sacred turtle. The Straits of Mackinac was the center of two routes vital to the fur trade: one to Montreal in the east, by way of Lake Nipissing and the Ottawa River valley; and the other to Detroit in the south via Lakes Huron and St. Clair.

===European exploration and Fort Michilimackinac===
The first European to pass the site of Mackinaw City was Jean Nicolet, sent out from Quebec City by Samuel Champlain in 1633 to explore and map the western Great Lakes, and to establish new contacts and trading partnerships with the Indian tribes of the region. His reports resulted in the French government providing funds to send settlers, missionaries, traders, and soldiers to the Great Lakes region. Father Jacques Marquette had established a mission on Mackinac Island in 1671 (which was shortly thereafter moved to St. Ignace on the Michigan peninsula, where it remained active until 1705). The construction of Fort de Buade at St. Ignace in 1681 was an attempt by the authorities of New France to establish a military presence at the Straits, but it closed in 1697.

Mackinaw City&#x27;s first European settlement came in 1715 when the French built Fort Michilimackinac. They lost it to the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the British abandoned the fort in 1783, after the American Revolutionary War resulted in independence of its Thirteen Colonies. The site of the fort in present-day Mackinaw City is a National Historic Landmark and is now preserved as an open-air historical museum. As with the forts at other settlements of the era and region such as Detroit, Michilimackinac was a fairly small post. It housed French civilians inside the fort, and allowed them to garden, hunt, and fish outside the walls. It was a trading post for the fur trade.

At the end of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the British took possession of the fort, but continued to allow the French civilians to live within the walls, as they had good relations with the Odawa and Ojibwe for the fur trade. As a part of Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, Chippewa and Fox warriors captured the fort on June 2, 1763, in a surprise attack during a game of &quot;baggatiway&quot; or lacrosse; the British at the fort were taken prisoner and mostly killed.

Europeans, in the form of French and Scots-Irish traders from Detroit and elsewhere, did not return until the following spring, with the understanding that they would trade more fairly with the Native Americans. The British abandoned the vulnerable site on the mainland during the American Revolutionary War; from 1779 to 1781, the troops moved the fort, including its buildings, to Mackinac Island, where they established Fort Mackinac. What the British did not take with them, they burned; that way they could prevent the American rebels from using Michilimackinac as a base.

===Mackinaw City from mid-19th century to present===
In 1857, two men by the names of Conkling and Searles planned what would become Mackinaw City. The original plan reserved the northern portion as a park, to preserve the area that was once Fort Michilimackinac and to accommodate a hoped-for lighthouse. This was not built for nearly a generation after the land was set aside.

During the second half of the 1800s, the Mackinaw area (and northern Michigan in general) saw an increase in summer resort tourism. In 1875, Mackinac National Park became the second National Park in the United States after Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains.

Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse began operation in 1889 and the adjacent Fog Signal Building was built in 1906. This lighthouse, which operated until 1957, would eventually replace McGulpin Point Light, which operated between 1869 and 1906, at its location in the far western end of the village limits, with the current address of 500 Headlands Road.

The village became a vital port for train ferries crossing the Straits beginning in the 1890s, and later, for ferries for automobiles. In the 1890s, Mackinaw had one newspaper, the &quot;Mackinaw Witness&quot;, published weekly by Presbyterian missionary Rev. G. W. Wood, Jr.

Auto ferries began running in the early 1900s. Camping began in Michilimackinac State Park in 1907.

When the Mackinac Bridge was completed in 1957, the Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse was decommissioned immediately thereafter. At the same time, a grant was provided to the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, which owned the property at the Bridge&#x27;s southern terminus, to begin archeological excavations of the Michilimackinac ruins. Ultimately, a reconstruction of the fort to its 1770s appearance would be constructed.

Auto ferries, which had been running since the early 1900s, ended in 1957 after the completion of the Mackinac Bridge.

Train ferries crossed the Straits until 1984. Mackinaw City remains an important port city for tourists traveling by passenger ferry boat to Mackinac Island using Shepler&#x27;s ferry company, and Star Line services.

Through the course of time, the main industry of Mackinaw City became almost strictly tourist-oriented, with other major sources of employment being civic services such as mail, police, firefighting, schooling, and so on. Camping, which began in Michilimackinac State Park in 1907, was halted in 1971 as a Maritime Park was opened in 1972 around the lighthouse. This park was shut down in 1990, but Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse was opened to the public in 2004. Mill Creek State Park, which includes the area believed to be where Mill Creek&#x27;s sawmill once flourished when Mackinac Island was being settled, is located about five miles (8 km) southeast of the village along U.S. Highway 23 (US 23).

===Ferry service===

Two ferry companies operate out of Mackinaw City, connecting tourists and commuters to Mackinac Island: Shepler&#x27;s Ferry and Star Line Ferry.

===Bus service===
Indian Trails provides daily intercity bus service between St. Ignace and East Lansing, Michigan and between St. Ignace and Bay City, Michigan. Transfer between the lines is possible in Mackinaw City.

===Railways===
The New York Central&#x27;s Michigan Central subsidiary, the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad subsidiary, and other rail lines provided passenger traffic on trains such as the &quot;Northern Arrow&quot; to Mackinaw City. After the creation of the Penn Central in 1968, rail traffic diminished and the rail infrastructure deteriorated. The state invested greatly into the failing railways and established the Michigan Northern Railway to operate passenger and freight operations in the early 1980s. Despite sizable patronage, passenger services, as well as freight, operated in the red, prompting the state government to reassess its commitment to operations of the Michigan Northern Railway. All subsidies terminated in 1984, and the lines were sold to CSX Transportation in 1987. It dismantled the tracks shortly thereafter.

The former Michigan Central line to Mackinaw City was improved under the Rails to Trails program. It was rededicated in 2008 as the North Central State Trail, providing a public right-of-way from Mackinaw City to Gaylord.

===Air===
The nearest airports with scheduled passenger service are in Pellston Regional Airport, Cherry Capital Airport in Traverse City, and Alpena County Regional Airport in the Lower Peninsula and Chippewa County International Airport south of Sault Ste. Marie, in the eastern Upper Peninsula.

== Government ==
The official name of the community is &quot;The Village of Mackinaw City&quot; and as that suggests, it is a village by state law. Mackinaw City is governed by the General Law Village Act, Public Act No. 3, of 1895, as amended. The downtown district and much of the development lie within Mackinaw Township, Cheboygan County, but the larger portion of the village by area is in Wawatam Township, Emmet County, which borders Mackinaw Township to the west.

==Education==
Mackinaw City Public Schools provides Mackinaw City students with education. The town’s two schools, the elementary school (grades K-5) and the junior-senior high school (grades 6–12), are located in the same building.

<text>East Lansing is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. Most of the city lies within Ingham County with a smaller portion extending north into Clinton County. At the 2020 census the population was 47,741. Located directly east of the state capital of Lansing, East Lansing is well known as the home of Michigan State University. The city is part of the Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area.

==History==
East Lansing is located on land that was an important junction of two major Native American groups: the Potawatomi and the Fox. By 1850, the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company was established to connect a toll road to the Detroit and Howell Plank Road, improving travel between Detroit and Lansing, which cut right through what is now East Lansing. The toll road was finished in 1853, and included seven toll houses between Lansing and Howell.

Michigan State University was founded in 1855 and established in what is now East Lansing in 1857. For the first four decades, the students and faculty lived almost entirely on the college campus. A few commuted from Lansing, and that number increased when a streetcar line was built in the 1890s, but there were few places to live in the then-rural area surrounding the campus.

That started to change in 1887, when professors William J. Beal and Rolla C. Carpenter created Collegeville, along what is now Harrison Road and Center and Beal Streets, north of Michigan Avenue. Few faculty were attracted to the location, and the first residents were &quot;teamsters and laborers&quot;. In 1898, the College Delta subdivision (including what is now Delta Street) had the support of the college itself, which provided utilities, and several professors built homes there (one of which survives today at 243 W. Grand River Ave.). Other subdivisions followed.

At that time, the post office address was &quot;Agricultural College, Michigan&quot;. A school district encompassing the nascent community was created in 1900. In 1907, incorporation as a city was proposed under the name &quot;College Park&quot;; the legislature approved the charter but changed the name to &quot;East Lansing&quot;. The first seven mayors, starting with Clinton D. Smith in 1907 and Warren Babcock in 1908, were professors or employees of the college.

The city charter in 1907 prohibited the possession, sale, or consumption of alcoholic beverages, and East Lansing was a &quot;dry&quot; city until voters modified the charter provision in 1968. In the 21st century, downtown East Lansing has enjoyed a construction boom. Multiple city center complexes have resulted in the redevelopment of large parts of the historic downtown area, at a greatly increased population density.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Since 1998, East Lansing has expanded its borders through the use of 425 Agreements. The city is currently in three 425 Agreements with Bath Township, DeWitt Township, and Meridian Township, and has effectively added thousands of acres of land to its border.

* East Lansing and DeWitt Township entered into two 425s in 1998 and 2001, which involved nearly of land. The agreement stipulates that East Lansing gains full control of the land after 33 years.
* East Lansing and Bath Township entered into a 425 Agreement in June 2002 involving of land. The agreement stipulates that East Lansing gains full control of the land after 100 years.
* East Lansing and Meridian Township entered into a 425 in November 2002 involving of land. The agreement stipulates that the Meridian Township residents get to decide the fate of the land after 100 years.

The city has also made use of annexation of surrounding township lands in recent years. It annexed the of the Four Winds Golf Course in Meridian Township in 2001, and another of the township in 2006. The city also annexed from DeWitt Township the land that is currently the East Lansing Soccer Complex.

===Description===
The city&#x27;s downtown area is centered around Grand River Avenue, a wide, tree-lined boulevard that evolved out of the 19th-century plank road that connected Lansing to Detroit. Grand River Avenue and Michigan Avenue serve as a dividing line between the Michigan State University campus and the rest of the city.

<doc id="150545" wikidata="Q3295695" url="?curid=150545" title="Grand Ledge, Michigan">
<text>Grand Ledge is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. The city lies mostly within Eaton County, though a small portion extends into Clinton County to the north (no residents live in that portion). The city sits along the Grand River 12.7 miles (20.4 kilometers) west of downtown Lansing. The population was 7,786 at the 2010 census. The city is named for its sandstone rock ledges that are located between island park and Fitzgerald park. They rise above the Grand River and are used by recreational rock climbers.

==History==
=== Native American Settlement ===
Native Americans who lived in the vicinity of the Grand River near the ledges were of Pottawatomi, Chippewa, and Ottawa ancestry. They dug clams in the river, mined coal on the river banks, hunted for deer, turkey, fox, and bear, and fished for black bass. Their name for the ledges translated into English as &quot;Big Rocks&quot;.

===Modern Settlement===

Based on early records, Hugh Heward was the first white man to explore this area by water and record his findings. His journal describes the sandstone ledges as having high banks, some pine trees and heavy woods with the finest places possible for making syrup, and the existence of several small islands.
In 1847 Henry Trench settled in what would later become downtown Grand Ledge. After a few years he returned east. In 1850 settlers named their village Grand Ledge, and erected a post office. By 1869, the town gained a railroad stop along the Flint &amp; Pere Marquette Railroad. In 1871, the village was incorporated by the state of Michigan.

====Resort Era====
Grand Ledge grew as a resort area during the 1870s, spurred by the railroad access. John Burtch founded Seven Islands Resort in 1872, with the Dolly Varden steamer and a small inn on Second Island. Several wells were drilled, and the mineral-laden water they produced was touted for its curative property. In 1877 S.M. Hewings purchased the Seven Islands Resort, and in 1878 he built the Island House Hotel on Second Island. In 1880 Julian Scott Mudge purchased the Seven Islands Resort. To reduce the risk of flooding from Grand River, Mudge built a dam (1887). In 1888 the Railroad Trestle or High Bridge was built to bring the railroad south of the river and Grand Ledge became the second city in Michigan (after Lansing) to get electric lights. By that time an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 people visited the Seven Islands Resort annually.

===Golden Age===

In 1891 Mudge built a roller coaster on the Islands, probably the state&#x27;s first. Located on the first island below the bridge was an animal park with bears and deer. The second island was the center of the resort activities, with its hotel, picnic area, and fountain. The second and third islands were joined with a causeway, and a pavilion served as a ballroom and theatre for Vaudeville acts. The Resort featured a merry-go-round and a bandstand.

Mudge&#x27;s most notable improvement was the construction of “The Round House”. This three-story pagoda tower was built on the edge of Second Island, with half its foundation on island soil and the rest projecting over the river. During the construction, he kept the purpose of the unusual structure secret. This caused much speculation in the local community. Mudge eventually revealed that it was designed to have the second story rotate at a slow speed, while the third story rotated faster and was topped by a centrifugal swing that would whirl the adventurous rider out over the river.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth islands were left wild, and the seventh was a picnic spot, accessed by boat. As many as 75 boats plied the Grand River at Grand Ledge, and sidewheel riverboats ran between Second Island and the dam. The dam, constructed in 1887, ensured the proper water level for the operation of steamboats.
As many as nine hotels provided accommodations for visitors and the Pere Marquette Railroad offered excursion rates to the Seven Island Resort which, according to early records, was second in popularity only to the Petoskey resort areas.

===The Spring Flood of 1893===
A flood damaged the Round House in 1893. The construction was nearly complete by then, but the rushing waters pushed chunks of ice into its overhanging foundation. The structure was pushed off the foundation, but remained nearly in place, at a precarious angle. Although the building was saved, the mechanism that was to rotate its upper portions was so damaged that repairs were never initiated. The Round House remained on the site, becoming the most recognizable symbol of the entire resort era. “The building has come to be called Mudge’s Folly. This has a double meaning. While a folly can be a costly and foolish undertaking, it can also describe a picturesque structure built as an ornament, but without a real purpose.”.

==Geography==

===Airport===
Abrams Municipal Airport is a city-owned, public-use airport located two nautical miles (3.7 km) north of the central business district of Grand Ledge. The airport is accessible by road from Eaton Highway and is located south of Interstate 96, just east of M-100.

===Railroads===
CSX Transportation now operates the original railroad built through the town as part of their Plymouth Subdivision between Plymouth, MI and Grand Rapids, MI. A small yard remains active for local shippers, including a Lowes distribution center. The remnant of a branch line to Ionia begins here to serve a large grain elevator several miles north of town. As of 2022, one local freight and two through freights pass through town daily. Passenger service between Detroit and Grand Rapids, then provided by predecessor Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, ended after April 30, 1971.

The railroad crosses the Grand River adjacent to the Ledges on a spectacular high bridge. One of the largest railroad bridges in the state of Michigan, it remains a sought after landmark for railfans and general tourists alike.

<text>Traverse City ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the seat of government of Grand Traverse County, although it partly extends into Leelanau County. The city&#x27;s population was 15,678 at the 2020 census, while the four-county Traverse City metropolitan area had 153,448 residents. Traverse City is the largest city in Northern Michigan.

Traverse City is at the head of the East and West arms of Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Grand Traverse Bay is divided into arms by the Old Mission Peninsula, which is attached at its base to Traverse City. The city borders four townships–East Bay, Elmwood, Garfield, and Peninsula–all of which are primarily suburban.

Traverse City is nicknamed &quot;the Cherry Capital of the World&quot;, as the area surrounding Grand Traverse Bay is a hotspot for cherry production. The city hosts the National Cherry Festival, attracting approximately 500,000 visitors annually. The Traverse City area is also known for its wine production. Two American Viticultural Areas are adjacent to the city. Traverse City is home to the Traverse City State Hospital, a former state psychiatric institution, and Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City.

==History==
===19th century===
====American Indians====
Prior to European settlement, what is now Traverse City was part of the territory of the Council of Three Fires, an alliance of three Anishinaabe tribes, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi. The Odawa, who were particularly prevalent in the area, called the area Kitchiwikwedongsing, a name which was often shortened to Wequetong, meaning &quot;place at the head of the great bay&quot;. The area was the northern end of what is today known as the Old Indian Trail, a trail which serviced travel for the Hopewell, and later the Anishinaabe, coming to and from the Cadillac area.

====European-American settlement====
Grand Traverse Bay was named by 18th-century French voyageurs who made &quot;&quot;, or &quot;the long crossing&quot;, across the mouth of the bay, from present-day Norwood to Northport. The area was French territory at first, and then part of the Kingdom of Great Britain as the Province of Quebec. The area was ceded to the United States in 1783 following the Treaty of Paris, becoming part of the Northwest Territory.

In 1847, Captain Horace Boardman of Naperville, Illinois, purchased the land at the mouth of the Boardman River (then known as the Ottawa River) at the head of the west arm of the bay, which at the time was still inhabited by Native Americans. In 1847, the captain, his son, and their employees built a dwelling and sawmill near the mouth of the river. In 1851 the Boardmans sold the sawmill to Hannah, Lay &amp; Co (made up of Perry Hannah, Albert Tracy Lay and James Morgan), who improved the mill greatly. The increased investment in the mill attracted additional settlers to the new community. Perry Hannah today is known as the founding father of Traverse City.

Traverse City was originally part of Omeena County, which was originally set off in 1840 from Michilimackinac County. The county remained unorganized, lacking a central government until 1851, when it was reorganized as Grand Traverse County. The newly designated county government was assigned a county seat at Boardman&#x27;s Mills, a location in present-day downtown Traverse City.

====Further growth====
As of 1853, the only operating post office in the Grand Traverse Bay region was the one located at Old Mission, which was then known as &quot;Grand Traverse&quot;. While in Washington, D.C. in 1852, Mr. Lay had succeeded in getting the U.S. Post Office to authorize a new post office at his newer settlement. As the newer settlement had become known as &quot;Grand Traverse City&quot;, after the Grand Traverse Bay, Lay proposed this name for its post office, but the Post Office Department clerk suggested dropping the &quot;Grand&quot; from the name, to limit confusion between this new office and the one at nearby Old Mission. Mr. Lay agreed to the shortened name of Traverse City for the post office, and the village took on this name. Around this time, the first cherry trees were being planted on the Old Mission Peninsula, for which the peninsula is widely known today.

====Late 19th century====
In December 1872, rail service arrived in Traverse City via a Traverse City Railroad Company spur from the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad line at Walton Junction. The railroad tracked along the Boardman River and along Boardman Lake into Traverse City, and ended at a station along the Grand Traverse Bay, at the corner of present-day Grandview Parkway and Park Street. This new line of transportation from Southern Michigan opened up the area to settlement and industrial development. Many more people started flocking to the small community, and in 1881, Traverse City was incorporated as a village. This began the major commercial growth of the town.

In 1890, another rail line was extended to Traverse City, this one from Baldwin via Copemish and Interlochen. This line primarily served lumber companies, such as the Buckley &amp; Douglas Lumber Company, and was used to transport logs from the vast forest of Northwest Michigan to sawmills in Manistee and Traverse City. Two years later, new railroads were extended out of Traverse City. One line was extended along the bay into Leelanau County, and curved south to a preexisting spur at Lake Ann. Another line was extended east into present-day Williamsburg, and to Charlevoix and Petoskey. This railroad was largely to serve tourists.

In 1881, the Northern Michigan Asylum, later the Traverse City State Hospital, was established as the demand for a third psychiatric hospital in Michigan, in addition to those established in Kalamazoo and Pontiac, began to grow. Perry Hannah, by then a prominent Michigan Republican, used his political influence to secure its location in Traverse City. Under the supervision of prominent architect Gordon W. Lloyd, the first building, known as Building 50, was constructed in Victorian-Italianate style according to the Kirkbride Plan. The hospital opened in 1885 with 43 residents. Under Dr. James Decker Munson, the first superintendent from 1885 to 1924, the institution expanded. Twelve housing cottages and two infirmaries were built between 1887 and 1903 to meet the specific needs of male and female patients. The institution became the city&#x27;s largest employer and contributed to its growth. While the hospital was established for the care of the mentally ill, its use expanded during outbreaks of tuberculosis, typhoid, diphtheria, influenza, and polio. It also cared for the elderly, served as a rehab for drug addicts, and was used to train nurses.

On May 18, 1895, Traverse City was incorporated as a city. Perry Hannah served as the first mayor of Traverse City, after also serving as first and third village president.

===20th century===

The first National Cherry Festival was held in Traverse City in 1925. It was first called &quot;Blessing of the Blossoms&quot; and held in the spring to attract people during the blooming season. With the exception of the years before and during World War II, this tradition has been carried on since in Traverse City. The legislature moved the date of the festival to the summer, and it attracts tourists from around the state and across the country. During the week the festival takes place, the population of Traverse City rises from about 15,000 to about 500,000. In 2004 the legislature added &quot;Blossom Days&quot;, again as a spring festival.

Also in 1925, Munson Medical Center opened, and has since grown to serve much of Northern Michigan and serves as one of Traverse City&#x27;s largest employers.

In 1929, Traverse City&#x27;s first airport, Ransom Field, opened, offering flights to Grand Rapids. It closed in 1936, when the new Traverse City Airport (now called Cherry Capital Airport) was opened. In 1953 the grounds of Ransom Field were redeveloped as Memorial Gardens Cemetery.

In 1934, the original Traverse City High School building burnt down, with no casualties. For three years, while the high school was being rebuilt, classes were moved to the Perry Hannah House, the former residence of the city&#x27;s founder. Classes were moved back to the new school building in September 1937. In 1960, the high school was moved from downtown Traverse City to a new college-style campus on the grounds of Northwestern Michigan College, which opened a few years prior in 1951. The former high school building was converted to Traverse City Junior High. In 1997, the high school split into Traverse City Central and Traverse City West High Schools due to extreme overcrowding at the 1960s building.

In 1989, the Traverse City State Hospital closed, leaving hundreds without jobs, massive abandoned buildings, and many homeless former patients. Since 2000, the Minervini Group has undertaken the project of renovating the entire property into a social center, including many restaurants, retail spaces, office space, and residential space.
===21st century===
On November 3, 2015, Traverse City elected Jim Carruthers, its first openly gay mayor. After serving as mayor of Traverse City for six years, in June 2021 Jim Carruthers announced he would not run for his fourth mayoral term.

May 18, 2020, served as the city&#x27;s 125th anniversary of Traverse City&#x27;s incorporation as a city in 1895, and was known as the &quot;quarantine quasquicentennial&quot;.

In April 2021, a group composed mostly of White students from two Traverse City area school districts held an online mock slave auction via social media app in a private group chat titled &quot;Slave Trade&quot;, wherein they traded their Black student peers for monetary amounts while using derogatory language. After the local community was made aware of this event, a coalition of community members and Traverse City Area Public School (TCAPS) Board of Education officials drafted in response a resolution which denounced the behavior. The draft of the resolution itself led to community backlash initiated largely by White conservative parents and community members who regarded the planned resolution to be &quot;...interlaced with critical race theory&quot;. In the aftermath of the backlash, the resolution was edited by TCAPS school board officials. No date for consideration of the revised resolution has been set.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Traverse City has a total area of , of which, are land and is water. Most of the city is located within Grand Traverse County, though a small portion of the city extends northwesterly into Leelanau County. This portion was annexed by the city in 1989.

Traverse City is located in the northwest of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, and is located at the head of Grand Traverse Bay, a long, natural harbor separated from the waters of Lake Michigan by the Leelanau Peninsula. The bay is divided into an East Arm and West Arm by the Old Mission Peninsula, a thin strip of rolling hills and farmland known for its cherry crop and viticulture industry. As Traverse City contains shores on both of Grand Traverse Bay&#x27;s East and West Arms, one cannot access the Old Mission Peninsula without entering Traverse City.

The Boardman River is a prominent river bisecting Traverse City from south to north. It also snakes through Traverse City&#x27;s downtown district, effectively forming a peninsula, and dividing it from the Grandview Parkway. The river terminates at Grand Traverse Bay northeast of downtown Traverse City. The river&#x27;s watershed contributes one-third of the water volume to the bay and is one of Michigan&#x27;s top-ten fisheries, with more than of its designated as a Blue Ribbon trout fishery. It is also a state-designated &quot;Natural River&quot;. As of 2023, only one of the five dams constructed on the Boardman River remains.

Traverse City is surrounded by a substantial suburban ring, especially within Garfield Township, to its southwest. Garfield Township is the largest municipality in Northern Michigan by population. Other adjacent townships, East Bay, Elmwood, and Peninsula, and nearby Blair and Long Lake townships, boast significant suburban populations dependent upon Traverse City.

Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally protected sand dune on Lake Michigan, is located about west-northwest of Traverse City, in the southwest of Leelanau County.
=== Layout and cityscape ===
Traverse City is laid out in a grid plan, with major streets running east–west and north–south.

The tallest building, at 10 stories, is the Park Place Hotel.

===Neighborhoods and districts===
The City of Traverse City officially recognizes the following neighborhood associations:

* Base of Old Mission (BOOM) Neighborhood
* Boardman Neighborhood
* Central Neighborhood
* Fernwood Neighborhood
* Indian Woods Neighborhood
* Kids Creek Commons
* Midtown Centre Condominium
* Morgan Farms Neighborhood
* Oak Park Neighborhood
* Old Towne Neighborhood
* Slabtown Neighborhood
* Traverse Heights
* Triangle Neighborhood
The city also recognizes the following commercial districts:

* East Side Social District
* Front Street District
* North Boardman Lake (NoBo) District
* Old Town District
* Warehouse District

The city employs two tax increment financing (TIF) districts: TIF 97, overlapping with the Front Street District, and Old Town TIF in the Old Town District.

===Superfund site===
Traverse City has one superfund site, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This is the Avenue E Groundwater Contamination Site. At this location, toxic runoff from the Coast Guard Air Station contaminated the groundwater along Avenue E.

== Climate ==
Traverse City has a warm-summer continental climate (Köppen Dfb) close to being a hot-summer continental climate (Dfa).

<text>Memphis is a city that straddles the border between Macomb and St. Clair counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,084 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first European Americans to settle in the area of Memphis were members of the Wells family from Albany, New York; Anthony Wells resided here from 1834 and James Wells from 1835. The fledgling community was originally called &quot;Wells Settlement&quot; after them.

The name &quot;Memphis&quot; was chosen and applied in 1848 when a US post office was established. The village was named for its location on a bluff overlooking the Belle River, which settlers likened to the position of the ancient Egyptian Memphis, &quot;the City on the Nile&quot;. Memphis was incorporated as a village on April 4, 1865. It did not attain the status of a city until 1953.

The area was originally developed for agriculture, as most settlers were farmers. As lumbering became a major industry in Michigan, log rafts were floated down the Belle River into the St. Clair River and south to Detroit. Some lumber was processed in Memphis and Marine City, where there was a major shipbuilding industry. Much was shipped to developing midwestern cities such as Chicago or to the east.

<text>Milan ( or ) is a city in Monroe and Washtenaw counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,079 at the 2020 census.

The community was settled as early as 1831. Milan incorporated as a village in 1885 and much later as a city in 1967. The center of the downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Main Street Historic District.

==History==

The first settler to the area was John Marvin, who arrived in the spring of 1831 and settled the community under the name &quot;Tolanville&quot;, after Marvin&#x27;s brother-in-law Henry Tolan. Later, a part of downtown Milan would be named Tolan Square. He built his home and also operated a general store for travelers and other early residents. Other earlier settlers included Bethuel Hack and Harmon Allen, and their families became the area&#x27;s first permanent residents. The population began to grow, and the first post office was established on March 27, 1833, under the name &quot;Farmersville&quot;. The name was changed to Milan on April 21, 1836. The post office has remained in operation ever since and is presently located at 123 East Main Street. The community became part of York Township when it was organized in 1833 in Washtenaw County and Milan Township when it was organized in 1836 in the northwest corner of Monroe County. Other nearby communities included Azalia (East Milan), Cone (West Milan), and Mooreville.

Some of Milan&#x27;s earliest structures that remain today include the Community House, which was built in 1834 as a gristmill. It was purchased by Henry Ford in 1935 and used for processing soybeans for automotive paint. It is currently used as a banquet hall. The Hack House Museum was built in 1888 and served as a private residence for many years, and it is now occupied by the Milan Area Historic Society. One of the most recognizable structures is the Old Milan Fire Barn, which was built in 1897 and served as a fire station until 1979. The fire department moved out of the building, and the building became abandoned until it was donated to the Milan Area Historical Society in 1983. The building was restored and rededicated in 2002.

In the 1870s, a railway line was built through the community. The line was operated by the Wabash Railroad and later became an intersection with the Ann Arbor Railroad. The railroad continues to pass through the area but no longer has a station in Milan.

<text>Northville is a city in Wayne and Oakland counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Northville is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit, and northeast of Ann Arbor. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 6,119. It is entirely surrounded by Northville Township to the south, and Novi to the north.

==History==

===Settlement===

Northville was first settled by European Americans in 1825, and was incorporated as a Village in 1867. It was not incorporated as a City until 1955. Originally one of two communities within Plymouth Township, Northville Township split off in 1898 to form its own township.

The first land patent in the Northville area was granted to Gideon Benton in 1823; the current Cass Benton Park is located here. The first settlers did not arrive, however, until 1825. Many of these first settlers were originally from central and western New York State, with ancestors in New England. Others came from the nearby, already settled Plymouth community to Northville.

Among these early settlers were Alanson Aldrich, followed by Alvale Smith, who sold his property to John Miller. Miller built the first mill in Plymouth Township, sometime between 1825 and 1828. Mill Race Historical Village is now preserved at this site. Many employees of the mill began to build their houses near it. Northville was named for its relation north of Plymouth.

In 1827, Northville was home to a post office, and Gideon Benton was the US postmaster. Also in 1827, J.F. Davis, became the first resident doctor in Northville. A tailor, tavern, shoe shop, and two blacksmiths also started business in the village. Many of Northville&#x27;s first settlers&#x27; surnames became namesakes for contemporary street names today. These include Rufus Thayer Jr. (Thayer Blvd.), Joseph Yerkes (Yerkes St.), Daniel and Samuel Cady (Cady St.), William Dunlap (Dunlap St.), and other settlers. The first church was constructed in 1836 by a Methodist congregation.

===Victorian era===
Northville continued to grow throughout the Victorian era. This is evident in the architecture around downtown where many homes are in the Queen Anne style. Northville&#x27;s Victorian heritage is celebrated every September in the Victorian Festival, which was recently rechristened the &quot;Heritage Festival&quot;.

The first schoolhouse in Northville opened in 1853 and was taught by Jacob Ramsdell. Northville was incorporated as a village in 1867 from a portion of Plymouth Township. By the end of the nineteenth century, it had established a public school system headed by a superintendent.

===Village era===
Henry Ford purchased a factory in Northville and moved machinery from plants in the area to the factory in 1919. Known as the Northville Valve Plant, the plant was rebuilt in 1936, and enlarged in 1956. The plant provided valves for every Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln vehicle, except for the Lincoln Continental, until closing and being sold in 1981. The building now houses offices and a health club. In 1925, the Penniman-Allen Theater opened downtown and remained open through the mid-70&#x27;s. The theater eventually closed, but opened again in 1978 as the Marquis Theater and is now home to live children&#x27;s theater. When Northville was more rural, skiing was popular and tournaments were held often. In 1944, Northville Downs opened as the first nighttime harness racing track in Michigan. The Downs were built on the site of the former Wayne County Fair, where Joe Louis trained in 1939 for his World Championship later that same year. Northville Downs stayed in continuous operation from 1944 to 2024 and was located at the corner of Center Street and 7 Mile Road.

===City era===

The city was incorporated in 1955 along the boundaries of the Village of Northville, and grew rapidly during the prolonged period of white flight from the City of Detroit in the middle and late 20th century. The Village of Northville included portions of Novi Township in Oakland County and Northville Township in Wayne County. Over the next several years, the city boundaries expanded through annexation of portions of Novi Township and the Village of Novi both east and west of the city and north of Baseline Road. The city&#x27;s northern boundary was fixed by the incorporation of the Village of Novi into the City of Novi in 1969. The city has also annexed small portions of Northville Township, the most recent of which was an expansion of the Rural Hill Cemetery. Northville Township&#x27;s status as a Charter Township generally precludes the city from annexing any significant portion of the Township. The most recent annexation was permitted by the Township in order for the city to expand the city-owned and operated cemetery.

===Libraries===
In 1889, the Ladies Library Association was organized by Mary Lapham, and had 1,200 books and 150 members by 1892. The library was located in the former Young Men&#x27;s Hall until 1964, when it moved temporarily to the new City Hall. In 1975, the library moved again temporarily to the Northville Square Mall; in 1980 it returned to City Hall. In 1996, it moved into the newly built Northville District Library.

Of the city&#x27;s in area and population of 5,970, (51.4%) and 2,739 residences (45.9%) are within Wayne County. Oakland County contains of land (48.6%) and 3,231 residents (54.1%).

==Mill Race Village==
In 1972, the historic Mill Race Village was opened on the site of John Miller&#x27;s gristmill, made possible by a donation from Ford Motor Company. Historic buildings were colocated here to represent a typical gathering of early buildings and uses. Located on Griswold Avenue, the complex includes the following:

<doc id="150566" wikidata="Q881140" url="?curid=150566" title="Blaine, Minnesota">
<text>Blaine is a suburban city in Anoka and Ramsey counties in Minnesota, United States. Once a rural town, Blaine&#x27;s population has increased significantly in the last 60 years. For several years, Blaine led the Twin Cities metro region in new home construction. The population was 70,222 at the 2020 census. The city is mainly in Anoka County, and is part of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

Interstate 35W, U.S. Highway 10, and Minnesota State Highway 65 are three of the main routes in the city.

==History==
Phillip Leddy, a native of Ireland, was recorded in the 1857 census as having settled in the township of Anoka until his death in 1872, on land that later became Blaine. In 1862, he moved near a lake that now bears his misspelled name, Laddie Lake. Another early settler was the Englishman George Townsend, who lived for a short time near what today is Lever St. and 103rd Ave.

In 1865, Blaine&#x27;s first permanent resident, Greenberry Chambers, settled on the old Townsend claim. Chambers was a former slave who moved north from Barren County, Kentucky, after the American Civil War. Around 1884, Chambers and his family moved to St. Paul.

In 1870, George Wall, Joseph Gagner, and others soon settled in the area and it began to grow.

In 1877, Blaine separated from Anoka and organized as a township. That year the first election was held and Moses Ripley was elected the first Chairman of the Board of Supervisors. Ripley, who had come to Minnesota from Maine, persuaded his fellow board members to name the new township in honor of James G. Blaine, a U.S. Senator, statesman and three-time presidential candidate from Maine. By 1880, Blaine&#x27;s population had reached 128.

While many other Anoka County communities experienced growth due to farming, Blaine&#x27;s sandy soil and abundant wetlands discouraged farmers and it remained a prime hunting area. Blaine&#x27;s growth remained slow until after World War II, when housing developments began in the southern part of town and the community became more suburban. Blaine&#x27;s population grew from 1,694 in 1950 to 20,573 in 1970, 57,186 in 2010, and 70,222 in 2020. By 2023, the population was over 72,500.

The land development technique of sand mining opened thousands of acres of peat sod farms up for development. Beginning with the development of the Knoll Creek, Club West, Pleasure Creek and TPC Twin Cities, the existing land was modified through extensive grading efforts in the large open water areas. The sand from the excavation of those ponds was used to raise the level of the site. These site modifications are needed to accommodate the development of the homes and neighborhoods. The success of mining sand allowed for further development. The centerpiece of those developments is The Lakes of Blaine. Corporate residents include the Aveda Corporation, Infinite Campus, PTC Inc, MagnetStreet, the parking lot portion of a Medtronic Development, and Dayton Rogers Manufacturing.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Blaine is ) from Minneapolis and from St. Paul.

Blaine can be accessed from several major roadways in the Twin Cities, including Minnesota State Highway 65, Interstate 35W, University Avenue, Lexington Avenue, Hamline Avenue, U.S. Highway 10 and Minnesota State Highway 610.

===Major landforms===
The Blaine area was covered by a large glacier that shaped the landscape during the late Wisconsinan glaciation. The land used to be covered by river valleys 200 feet deep. The valleys filled with sediment. One valley ran northeast to southwest under Lino Lakes. As the glaciers retreated, the water gathered into a lake that covered much of Anoka County. Huge ice chunks were left in the glacier&#x27;s wake. They melted and formed depressions that filled with water. This became the chain of lakes between Lino Lakes and Circle Pines.

There are four major named water bodies partially or completely within the city limits. Sunrise Lake as part of The Lakes housing development is the largest body at 158 acres, with a depth near 40 feet in some places. The next largest body is Laddie Lake, the only naturally occurring lake in Blaine, which is also partially in Spring Lake Park, at 77 acres, reaching a maximum depth of six feet. The next largest body is Club West Lake at 39 acres and depths up to 25 feet, also man-made, in the Club West Housing development. The last named body of water in the city is Loch Ness; 11 acres, it is managed by the city and has a fishing dock. Several other large bodies of water found around the TPC of the Twin Cities, Pleasure Creek Neighborhood, Knoll Creek Development, and Crescent Ponds are not classified as lakes.

Blaine is also creating a 500-acre open space plan. It started acquiring portions of the property in the late 1990s, but most of it was acquired after Blaine voters approved a $3.5 million referendum in 2000. A tentative long-range plan calls for the construction of a nature center by 2020. The 70-acre Kane Meadows Park next to The Lakes development has been the centerpiece of this program.

The National Sports Center was the home of Minnesota&#x27;s professional soccer teams for 23 years. From 1990 to 2003 and 2008–2009 the National Sports Center was home for the now defunct Minnesota Thunder. After the Thunder folded, the sports center quickly stepped in and created the NSC Minnesota Stars for the 2009 season. The United States Soccer Federation ruled the stadium could not own the team, due to an increase in financial standards the stadium did not have, and the team re-branded to become the Minnesota Stars FC for the 2010–2012 seasons. The Minnesota United FC, after being re-branded in early 2013 to represent the history of soccer in Minnesota, played at the National Sports Center until their promotion to Major League Soccer in 2017, and they now play at Allianz Field in St. Paul but continue to use the National Sports Center as their training facility.

<doc id="150575" wikidata="Q1911131" url="?curid=150575" title="Sartell, Minnesota">
<text>Sartell is a city in Benton and Stearns Counties in the U.S. state of Minnesota that straddles the Mississippi River. It is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 19,351 at the 2020 census, making it St. Cloud&#x27;s most populous suburb and the fourth-largest city in central Minnesota, after St. Cloud, Elk River, and Willmar.

==History==

The first known Native American tribe in the area now known as Sartell were the Dakota. Greysolon du Luht (&quot;Duluth&quot;) visited the large Mdewakantonwan village Izatys on Mille Lacs Lake in 1679. As the Anishinaabe people moved westward around Lake Superior and into the interior away from the Europeans in the 18th century, they pushed the neighboring Sioux/Dakota people to their west—in present-day Minnesota—farther south and west away from them. By 1820 the Chippewa/Anishinaabe controlled all of northern Minnesota, but raids between them and the Dakota to the south continued. The area later named Sartell was an intertribal no man&#x27;s land when French fur traders and British geographers first descended the Mississippi River from the Anishinaabe north (Jean-Baptiste Perrault 1789, David Thompson 1798), and American explorers ascended the river from the Sioux south (Zebulon Pike 1805, Lewis Cass 1820, Henry Schoolcraft 1832, Joseph Nicollet 1836).

The Watab Creek in Sartell marked part of the border between the Anishinaabe to the north and the Dakota to the south, who had lived farther north and east before the Anishinaabe&#x27;s westward migrations. The U.S. legally established this border in its 1825 Treaty with the tribes at Prairie du Chien, which established a demarcation line between the Sioux and the Ojibwe at &quot;the mouth of the first river which enters the Mississippi on its west side above the mouth of Sac (Sauk) river; thence ascending the said river (above the mouth of Sac river)&quot;.

In 1846, 1,300 Ho-Chunk people were moved to the Sartell area, followed by the Chippewa/Anishinaabe sale of the area north of the Watab River and west of the Mississippi to the U.S. In 1848, more members of the Ho-Chunk/Winnebago tribe (related Dakotan speakers) were moved by order of the U.S. government to the mouth of the Watab Creek, now called the Long Prairie reservation, to serve as a human buffer between the warring Dakota and Anishinaabe. Unhappy living between two warring tribes, the Ho-Chunk stayed less than five years, moving again in 1853 to more peaceful territory 50 miles south on the Mississippi. Three years later they sold their grist and saw mills and moved south of Mankato. A 100-yard section of the old &quot;Indian Trail&quot; still remains just north of the creek&#x27;s mouth albeit overgrown. The area was known as &quot;Winnebago&quot; at the time of the 1866 ribbon map of the Mississippi River.

Sartell got its start as a small American town on the Mississippi River with lumber and a paper company as its main industries. The city&#x27;s present site was originally called &quot;The Third Rapids&quot;, as it was the third set of rough waters that French fur traders encountered as they traveled north from Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis.

One of the first white people to settle in the fledgling town was Joseph B. Sartell, who arrived in 1854 and worked as a millwright at a local sawmill. In 1877, he opened a flour mill at the nearby Watab River, and in 1884 he started Sartell Brothers Lumber Company with his sons.

In 1905, construction began on both the Sartell Pulp and Paper Company and the Sartell Dam across the Mississippi, near the &quot;third rapids&quot;. Both were completed in 1907, the dam project having claimed the lives of seven workers. Watab Pulp and Paper was rebuilt and expanded through the years, passing through multiple ownerships and eventually emerging as Verso Paper&#x27;s Sartell mill, the city&#x27;s largest employer.

In 1907, residents of the town decided to incorporate. Several influential people felt the town ought to be named Wengert, after a local businessman. But because of Joseph Sartell&#x27;s many relatives and generous contributions to the community, the town was incorporated as &quot;The Village of Sartell&quot; in his honor. From 1907 until 1973 there was a Sartell on nearly every City Council, the most prominent being Ripley &quot;Rip&quot; B. Sartell, store owner and mayor for 31 years.

The village continued to grow slowly, developing a number of businesses and a downtown on the east side of the Mississippi along U.S. Highway 10. In the 1960s, the highway was rerouted farther east, contributing to the downtown&#x27;s demise. In 1973 the Minnesota Legislature required all municipal designations be changed to &quot;city&quot;, so &quot;the Village of Sartell&quot; became &quot;the City of Sartell&quot;. The construction of the Sartell Bridge over the Mississippi in the early 1980s replaced the remaining businesses. This and Sartell&#x27;s location near St. Cloud&#x27;s major retail center account for its lack of a traditional &quot;downtown&quot;.

Independent School District 748, Sartell-St. Stephen, was created in 1969 because residents wanted to educate their children locally. Despite the lack of a downtown, the city continued to grow at an increasing pace in the 1970s. From 1960 to the present, the city&#x27;s population has gone from 700 to over 18,000.

==Economy==
Sartell&#x27;s largest employers have been the paper mill that started in 1907 as Watab Pulp &amp; Paper, became St. Regis Paper Company in 1947, and then Verso Paper Sartell Mill, and DeZurik Water Controls, whose valve production plant is in Sartell. The city also hosts a number of small businesses, including gas stations, restaurants, grocery stores, and salons. In 2012 the Verso Paper mill was severely damaged by an explosion and, due also to decreasing paper demand, was shut down and sold for parts. More recently the city has begun to urbanize, adding larger chain businesses in a newly developed area eventually to be a new downtown.

==Law and government==
Sartell&#x27;s city council consists of a mayor and four members elected at large. Sartell&#x27;s mayor is Ryan Fitzthum, and the council members are Jill Smith, Alex Lewandowski, Tim Elness, and Jeff Kolb. They possess the authority to pass and enforce ordinances, establish public and administrative policies, create advisory boards and commissions, and manage the city&#x27;s financial operations, including preparing a budget, auditing expenditures, and transacting other city business as required by law. The city council also appoints a city administrator, who oversees the city&#x27;s daily operation and implements the policies of the council.

City recreational facilities include 24 parks, miles of paved walking paths, playgrounds, a bike lane, tennis courts, baseball and soccer fields, ice rinks, a golf course and a wading pool.

==Religion==
The Sartell family was largely Presbyterian, and helped organize the first church in the town, Riverside Presbyterian, on the west bank of the Mississippi River about one mile north of the town&#x27;s (then) sole stop sign, to serve the Sunday interests of local Protestants. Saint Francis Xavier Church, Roman Catholic, was founded in 1948, named after Francis Xavier Pierz, a Slovenian missionary to Native Americans in the area, and largely responsible for attracting the large population of Slovenian, Polish, Bohemian, Slovakian and especially German farmers to the area.

==Transportation==
Transportation to and from Sartell is limited to surface roads, mainly U.S. Highway 10 and Minnesota State Highway 15, both of which pass along the outskirts of the city. St. Cloud Metro Bus service runs to destinations in Sartell and neighboring Sauk Rapids.

The city&#x27;s proximity to St. Cloud allows for convenient access to St. Cloud Regional Airport, as well as the city&#x27;s Amtrak and Greyhound stations.

The dams along the Mississippi River and the waterway&#x27;s relative shallowness render it useless for anything more than recreational watercraft traffic. Sartell&#x27;s location on the river facilitated the construction of the Old Sartell Bridge in 1914, which was replaced by the current Sartell Bridge in 1984.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

U.S. Highway 10, Minnesota State Highway 15, and County 1 are three of Sartell&#x27;s main routes. Other nearby routes in the St. Cloud area include Interstate 94/U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 23, and County 75. Sartell is immediately north of St. Cloud.

The city is on the Mississippi River, with the surrounding undeveloped property composed mainly of woodlands and farmland.

<doc id="150576" wikidata="Q736834" url="?curid=150576" title="St. Cloud, Minnesota">
<text>St. Cloud or Saint Cloud (; ) is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest population center in the state&#x27;s central region. The population was 68,881 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s 12th-largest city. St. Cloud is the county seat of Stearns County and was named after the city of Saint-Cloud, France (in Île-de-France, near Paris), which was named after the 6th-century French monk Clodoald.

Though mostly in Stearns County, St. Cloud also extends into Benton and Sherburne counties, and straddles the Mississippi River. It is the center of a contiguous urban area, with Waite Park, Sauk Rapids, Sartell, St. Joseph, Rockville, and St. Augusta directly bordering the city, and Foley, Rice, Kimball, Clearwater, Clear Lake, and Cold Spring nearby. The St. Cloud metropolitan area had a population of 199,671 at the 2020 census. It has been listed as the fifth-largest metro with a presence in Minnesota, behind Minneapolis–St. Paul, Duluth–Superior, Fargo-Moorhead, and Rochester. But the entire St. Cloud area is within Minnesota, while most of Fargo-Moorhead&#x27;s population is in North Dakota and Superior, Wisconsin, contributes significant population to the Duluth area.

St. Cloud is northwest of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis–St. Paul along Interstate 94, U.S. Highway 52 (conjoined with I-94), U.S. Highway 10, Minnesota State Highway 15, and Minnesota State Highway 23. The St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is made up of Stearns and Benton Counties. The city was included in a newly defined Minneapolis–St. Paul–St. Cloud Combined Statistical Area (CSA) in 2000. St. Cloud as a whole has never been part of the 13-county MSA comprising Minneapolis, St. Paul, Bloomington and parts of western Wisconsin, though the Sherburne County portion is part of the 13-county MSA.

St. Cloud State University, Minnesota&#x27;s third-largest public university, is located between the downtown area and the Beaver Islands, which form a maze for a two-mile stretch of the Mississippi. The approximately 30 undeveloped islands are a popular destination for kayak and canoe enthusiasts during safe river levels and flow. and are part of a state-designated 12-mile stretch of wild and scenic river.

St. Cloud owns and operates a hydroelectric dam on the Mississippi, the state&#x27;s largest city-owned hydro facility, that can produce almost nine megawatts of electricity, about 10% of the total electricity generated by 11 Mississippi hydro dams in Minnesota.

==History==
What is now the St. Cloud area was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Voyageurs and coureurs des bois from New France first encountered the Ojibwe and Dakota through the highly profitable North American fur trade with local Native American peoples.

Minnesota Territory was organized in 1849. The St. Cloud area opened up to homesteading after the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was signed with the Dakota people in 1851.

John L. Wilson, a Yankee homesteader from Columbia, Maine, with French Huguenot ancestry and an interest in Napoleon, named the settlement St. Cloud after Saint-Cloud, the Paris suburb where Napoleon had his favorite palace.

St. Cloud was a waystation on the Middle and Woods branches of the Red River Trails used by Métis traders between the Canada–U.S. border at Pembina, North Dakota, and St. Paul. The cart trains often consisted of hundreds of oxcarts. The Métis, bringing furs to trade for supplies to take back to their rural settlements, camped west of the city and crossed the Mississippi in St. Cloud or just to the north in Sauk Rapids.

The City of St. Cloud was incorporated in 1856. It developed from three distinct settlements, known as Upper Town, Middle Town, and Lower Town, that European-American settlers established starting in 1853. Remnants of the deep ravines that separated the three are still visible today. Middle Town was settled primarily by German Catholic immigrants and migrants from eastern states, who were recruited to the region by Father Francis Xavier Pierz, a Catholic priest who also ministered as a missionary to Native Americans.

Lower Town was founded by settlers from the Northern Tier of New England and the mid-Atlantic states, including former residents of upstate New York. Its Protestant settlers opposed slavery.

Upper Town, or Arcadia, was plotted by General Sylvanus Lowry, a slaveholder and trader from Kentucky who brought slaves with him, although Minnesota was organized as a free territory. He served on the territorial council from 1852 to 1853 and was elected president of the newly formed town council in 1856, serving for one year (the office of mayor did not yet exist).

Jane Grey Swisshelm, an abolitionist newspaper editor who had migrated from Pittsburgh, repeatedly attacked Lowry in print. At one point Lowry organized a &quot;Committee of Vigilance&quot; that broke into Swisshelm&#x27;s newspaper office and removed her press, throwing it into the Mississippi River. Lowry started a rival paper, &quot;The Union&quot;.

The U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1857 decision in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; ruled that slaves could not file freedom suits and found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, so the territory&#x27;s prohibition against slavery became unenforceable. Nearly all Southerners left the St. Cloud area when the Civil War broke out, taking their slaves with them. The total number of slaves in the community was estimated in single digits at the 1860 census. Lowry died in the city in 1865.

Many young men from St. Cloud and the surrounding area served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After it ended, many local Civil War veterans remained heavily involved in St. Cloud&#x27;s chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic, and raised money for the building of a statue in memory of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln that still stands near the St. Germain Street bridge.

Beginning in 1864, Stephen Miller served a two-year term as Minnesota governor, the only citizen of St. Cloud ever to hold the office. Miller was a &quot;Pennsylvania German businessman&quot;, lawyer, writer, active abolitionist, and personal friend of Alexander Ramsey. He was on the state&#x27;s Republican electoral ticket with Lincoln in 1860.

Steamboats regularly docked at St. Cloud as part of the fur trade and other commerce, although river levels were not reliable. This ended with the construction of the Coon Rapids Dam in 1912–14. Granite quarries have operated in the area since the 1880s, giving St. Cloud its nickname, &quot;The Granite City.&quot;

In 1917, Samuel Pandolfo started the Pan Motor Company in St. Cloud. He claimed his Pan-Cars would make St. Cloud the new Detroit, but the company failed at a time when resources were directed toward the World War I effort. He was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to defraud investors.

According to documents at the Stearns History Museum, more than 2,000 residents from the heavily German-American St. Cloud area served in the U.S. military against their ancestral homeland during World War I. On 26 January 1918, President Woodrow Wilson wrote a letter to Bishop Joseph Francis Busch thanking him for his support of the war effort.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

The city developed on both sides of the Mississippi River. Part of the Sauk River runs along its northern edge.

Just south of downtown is the 7-acre, 35-feet-deep Lake George. In 2021, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) credited decade-long city investments in stormwater filtration with reducing Lake George&#x27;s phosphorus levels well below the state standard. It called Lake George one of three &quot;success stories&quot; in the state, and planned to remove it from a list of impaired waters.

Granite bedrock quarried in the area has been estimated to be 1.7 billion years old and was exposed after several miles of rock above it eroded. The city lies on a band of modern Mississippi river sediment surrounded by land scoured several times by Wisconsin Age glaciers beginning about 35,000 years ago, ending with the Lake Superior St. Croix lobe. The later Des Moines lobe created glacial moraines and drift south and east of the city.

===Immigration===
St. Cloud has been a significant destination for immigrants throughout its history, beginning with German settlers in the late 19th century. This was followed by waves of Polish, Irish, and other European immigrants in the early 20th century. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the nature of immigration to St. Cloud has undergone a dramatic shift. New residents of the city have predominantly been from Africa, and particularly, from the war-torn country of Somalia. Unofficial estimates suggest that the number of Somalis in St. Cloud and the surrounding cities like Waite Park, St. Joseph, Sartell, and Sauk Rapids could be as high as 25,000, with approximately half of this population having moved to the city between 2009 and 2013. About 15% of the local school district being Somali and a large segment of Somalis currently enrolled in high schools, colleges, and universities. Home ownership among St. Cloud&#x27;s Somali community is considerably lower than other populations.

St. Cloud has been moved by Congressional redistricting to a wide variety of Minnesota regions, including northern, south central, northwest and southwest. In Congressional district maps in effect since 2003, it has been grouped with rural areas and suburbs north and west of the Twin Cities. The district had only minor changes in a 2022 map drawn by a five-judge panel based on the 2020 census. As of the 2020 census, the city of St. Cloud is the second largest in Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district, represented by Republican Tom Emmer. The St. Cloud, Minnesota metropolitan area that includes adjacent communities has about a quarter of the 6th district population, though some of the area lies outside the district.

The U.S. Census Bureau designated Mankato a Metropolitan Statistical Area in November 2008. Mankato is the home of Minnesota State University, the state&#x27;s second-largest university by enrollment.

==History==

Mankato Township was not settled by European Americans until Parsons King Johnson in February 1852, as part of the 19th-century migration of people from the east across the Midwest. New residents organized the city of Mankato on May 11, 1858, the day Minnesota became a state. The city was organized by Johnson, Henry Jackson, Daniel A. Robertson, Justus C. Ramsey, and others. A popular story says that the city was supposed to have been named &quot;Mahkato&quot;, but a typographical error by a clerk established the name as Mankato. According to Warren Upham, quoting historian Thomas Hughes of Mankato, &quot;The honor of christening the new city was accorded to Col. Robertson. He had taken the name from Nicollet&#x27;s book, in which the French explorer compared the &#x27;Mahkato&#x27; or Blue Earth River, with all its tributaries, to the water nymphs and their uncle in the German legend of Undine...No more appropriate name could be given the new city, than that of the noble river at whose mouth it is located.&quot; While it is uncertain that the city was intended to be called Mahkato, the Dakota called the river &quot;Makato Osa Watapa&quot; (&quot;the river where blue earth is gathered&quot;). The Anglo settlers adapted that as &quot;Blue Earth River&quot;. Frederick Webb Hodge, in the &quot;Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico&quot;, said the town was named after the older of the two like-named chiefs of the Mdewakanton nation of the Santee Dakota, whose village stood on or near the site of the present town.

&quot;Ishtakhaba&quot;, also known as Chief Sleepy Eye, of the Sisseton band, was said to have directed settlers to this location. He said the site at the confluence of the Minnesota and Blue Earth Rivers was well suited to building and river traffic, and yet safe from flooding.

 On December 26, 1862, United States Volunteers of the State of Minnesota carried out the largest mass execution in U.S. history at Mankato after the Dakota War of 1862. Companies of the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th Minnesota Infantry Regiments, and Minnesota Cavalry oversaw the hanging of 38 men: 35 Santee Sioux and 3 biracial French/native American, for their involvement in the war crimes committed during the uprising. A USV military tribunal reviewed nearly 500 cases, of which 303 received a death sentence, but President Lincoln requested the court files. He reviewed them, placing the rape cases at the top, and pardoning 265. Episcopal Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple urged leniency to which Lincoln responded that he had to take a balanced approach. His position and dismissals were unpopular in Minnesota. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the event a large granite marker was erected that stood at the site until 1971, when the city took it down. Today, a different monument marks the execution site. Across the street are two monuments to the Native Americans in what it called Reconciliation Park. The Blue Earth County Library, Main street and Reconciliation Park cover the immediate vicinity of the execution site.

In 1880, Mankato was Minnesota&#x27;s fourth-most populous city, with 5,500 residents.

Former Vice President Schuyler Colfax died while traveling through Mankato on January 13, 1885.

For example, Minneapolis, northeast of Mankato, averages over of snow per winter season, compared to Mankato&#x27;s seasonal average of . The coldest month, January, has an average monthly temperature around . Dangerously low wind-chill temperatures are a significant hazard during the winter months, as Arctic air outbreaks rush into the area from Canada, borne on high winds; this can bring about ground blizzard conditions, especially in nearby rural areas.

Summers are warm, with occasional but usually brief hot, humid periods, often interspersed with pushes of cooler air from Canada, often preceded by showers and thunderstorms. The hottest month, July, has an average monthly temperature around . Precipitation falls year round, but falls mostly as snow from December to February, sometimes March, and as showers and thunderstorms during the warmer season, from May to September. Mankato&#x27;s average wettest months are from June to August, with frequent thunderstorm activity. Mankato lies on the northern fringe of the central United States’ main tornado belt, with lower risk than in Iowa and Missouri to the south. The highest-risk months for severe thunderstorms and (rarely) tornadoes, are May through July. However, a very unusual early tornado outbreak affected areas within of Mankato on March 29, 1998, when an F3 tornado hit St. Peter, to Mankato&#x27;s north. On August 17, 1946, tornadoes struck southwestern areas of Mankato and the town of Wells to the southeast, killing 11 people.

The protagonist of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;Main Street&quot;, Carol Milford, is a former Mankato resident. Lewis describes Mankato as follows: &quot;In its garden-sheltered streets and aisles of elms is white and green New England reborn&quot;, alluding to its many migrants from New England, who brought their culture with them. Lewis wrote a substantial portion of the novel while staying at the J.W. Schmidt House at 315 South Broad Street, as now marked by a small plaque in front of the building.

In 1996, Don Descy created city-mankato.us as a teaching tool and example that not everything on the Internet should be believed.

==Hotdish==
In 2016 &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; credited a 1930 Mankato church congregation cookbook as the first written record of a hotdish recipe.

Mankato resident Joyce Nelson had a copy of the 1930 Lutheran church recipe book and it was found that the recipe was indeed included in that year&#x27;s cookbook. Mrs. C. W. Anderson had submitted a recipe for a &quot;HOT DISH&quot; made with hamburger, onions, Creamette pasta, celery, a can of peas, tomato soup and tomatoes.

<doc id="150582" wikidata="Q165096" url="?curid=150582" title="Princess Märtha Louise of Norway">
<text>Princess Märtha Louise of Norway (born 22 September 1971) is a Norwegian self-described clairvoyant, businesswoman and a member of the Norwegian royal family, although she is not a member of the royal house and has no public role. She is married to American conspiracy theorist Durek Verrett.

A member of the House of Glücksburg, she was born in Oslo in 1971 to then-Prince Harald and the former commoner Sonja Haraldsen. At the time she had no inheritance rights to the Norwegian throne. This changed in 1990, when she was included in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne, where she is currently fourth. Her father became king in 1991. While part of the extended royal family, she is not a member of the royal house. 

Märtha Louise is active as a businesswoman and alternative therapist, and does not carry out official engagements on behalf of the royal house. From 2007 to 2018 she led her own alternative therapy centre, commonly known in Norway as the &quot;angel school&quot; (), which focused on clairvoyance and communication with angels and communication with the dead. She was married to the writer and visual artist Ari Behn from 2002 to 2017. In May 2019, she publicly announced her romantic relationship and professional collaboration with Durek Verrett, a conspiracy theorist and self-described shaman who has served time in prison and who has been characterized by Norwegian media and other critics as a conman. Verrett was included as one of &quot;20 famous conspiracy theorists&quot; alongside David Icke and Alex Jones in an MSN article in 2024. As part of her withdrawal into private professional life, Märtha Louise lost the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; in 2002. 

She has often faced criticism in Norway for her claims of being clairvoyant and for exploiting her constitutional role and title as princess commercially (for which she has been derided in Norway as &quot;Princess Plenty More of Have-It-All&quot; (&quot;prinsesse Mertakk av Pose og Sekk&quot;)), with frequent calls for her to lose the title and place in the line of succession. For the same reason she has become relatively unpopular in Norway, with an antagonistic relationship with the media, leading her to declare a total boycott of Norwegian media in 2024. In 2019, the royal court announced that she will no longer use the title princess in her business activities as a clairvoyant. However, she has been criticized for continued commercial exploitation of the title, and for deliberately disregarding an agreement not to use the title &quot;Princess&quot; or the family connection to the royal family in any commercial activities, interviews or other public activities. In 2022, she relinquished her remaining royal duties to concentrate on alternative medicine. A majority of Norwegians favor the removal of her title. Märtha Louise has accused former friends of racism over their criticism of Verrett. Verrett&#x27;s sister Demi DeLaNuit criticized Märtha Louise for abusing her title to intimidate her. Verrett and Märtha Louise sold the rights to their wedding to a British tabloid. Norwegian media described the wedding as &quot;comical&quot; and &quot;embarrassing.&quot; Norwegian media criticized King Harald V for legitimizing and endorsing the exploitation of national values and symbols for Märtha Louise&#x27;s and Verrett&#x27;s personal financial gain. In November 2024 Norwegian media published recordings of Verrett where he admitted to sexual assault and &quot;sucking the cock&quot; of his clients during shamanistic sessions, and claimed that she knew everything. The royal family&#x27;s association with Verrett has been cited as contributing to a deterioration in its reputation. Political scientist Torvald Valland Therkildsen described the royal family as a parody that is a source of embarrassment to Norway.

== Early life ==
Märtha Louise was born on 22 September 1971 at The National Hospital the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, to the then Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja. Princess Märtha Louise was named after her late paternal grandmother and great-great-grandmother. At birth, she was not in line to the throne, because until 1990, only males could inherit the Norwegian throne. She was baptized a few months after her birth. Her godparents are King Olav V of Norway, Princess Margaretha of Sweden, Count Flemming of Rosenborg, Princess Ragnhild of Norway, Dagny Haraldsen, Haakon Haraldsen, Nils Jørgen Astrup and Ilmi Riddervold.

In 1973, Märtha Louise&#x27;s younger brother, Haakon Magnus, was born. In 1990 the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting full cognatic primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of sex, takes precedence in the line of succession. This change only affects those born in 1990 or later. Females born between 1971 and 1990 (i.e. only Märtha Louise), were given succession rights, but their brothers would be before them in the line of succession, meaning that Prince Haakon still took precedence over Märtha Louise in the line of succession. After the births of her brother&#x27;s two children, Ingrid Alexandra and Sverre Magnus, Märtha Louise was relegated to fourth in line.

== Education and career ==

Märtha Louise is a certified physiotherapist, following education in Oslo and internship in Maastricht, the Netherlands. She has not practised her profession, however, choosing instead, from her fascination in traditional Norwegian folk tales as well as a love of music, to establish her own commercial entertainment business based on giving public and televised performances reciting folk tales and singing with well-known Norwegian choirs. In December 2003, she took part in Oslo Gospel Choir&#x27;s Christmas concert with a solo performance, included on the companion CD album.

On 1 January 2002, Märtha Louise started her own business, in order to work with more freedom from her constitutional role as a princess. She began paying income tax, and the King, after consulting her, issued a royal edict which removed Märtha Louise&#x27;s style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (she is conventionally accorded the lesser style &quot;Highness&quot; abroad, although this style has no legal standing in Norway). However, she retains her place in the line of succession, and though her activities were reduced, she still carries out some public duties on behalf of the King.

After several postponements due to family births and her father&#x27;s illness, during which the princess took on some representation duties, Princess Märtha Louise and her husband moved to New York City in October 2004. In 2004, her first book, a children&#x27;s story about the first royal family of Norway was released – &quot;Why Kings and Queens Don&#x27;t Wear Crowns&quot;. Accompanying the book is a CD version of the Princess reading her story aloud.

Märtha Louise has studied physiotherapy, trained as a Rosen therapist and studied at an academy for holistic medicine. She claims she can communicate with animals and angels and started her own alternative therapy center named Astarte Education, after one of the oldest goddesses in the Middle East. Astarte Education offered a three-year course on healing, readings, and angels. 

The princess drew criticism in Norway after the announcement that she would start Astarte Education. In 2007, the newspaper &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; called for her to give up her royal titles. Norwegian state director of Health Lars E. Hanssen, Norwegian alternative medicine advocate Bernt Rognlien, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), religious historian Asbjørn Dyrendal and University of Oslo theology professor Inge Lønning all expressed misgivings about the princess&#x27;s plans. In 2015, Swedish author Jan Guillou questioned her mental health.

On 11 August 2007, Märtha Louise defended the school on NRK, the Norwegian public service television network. In the interview, she regarded her relationship with angels as &quot;creatures of light, which gave her a feeling of a strong presence and a strong and loving support.&quot; She responded to criticism that she should leave the Church of Norway by stating she still considered herself a Christian that was thankful the Church still had room for her.

On 2 October 2007, Princess Märtha Louise became the first member of the Norwegian royal family to ever appear in a court of law, as she wanted to halt sales of a book entitled &quot;Martha&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which used her photo on its cover without permission. She stated that she felt &quot;commercially exploited&quot; by the book&#x27;s use of her photo, which she regarded as misuse of her name and picture. Film critic Pål Bang-Hansen stated that Märtha Louise was a &quot;thief and hypocrite&quot;, claiming that she had stolen translated texts from his father&#x27;s books.

In 2007, the Princess was editor of the book &quot;Prinsesse Märtha Louises eventyrlige verden, Eventyr fra jordens hjerte, Rodinia&quot; containing 67 fairy tales from 50 countries. In 2009, she and her Astarte Education partner Elisabeth Samnøy published &quot;Møt din skyttsengel&quot; (&quot;Meet your guardian angel&quot;), followed by &quot;Englenes hemmeligheter. Deres natur, språk og hvordan du åpner opp for dem&quot; (&quot;The secrets of angels: Their nature, language, and how you open up for them&quot;).

== Princess Märtha Louise&#x27;s Fund ==

Her Royal Highness Princess Märtha Louise&#x27;s Fund was founded on 15 September 1972 and awards funds to projects carried out by non-governmental organizations in order to provide assistance to disabled children under the age of 16 in Norway. Princess Märtha Louise is the fund&#x27;s chairperson. In 2005, the fund had assets of approximately NOK 13,285,000, and total annual allocations came to about NOK 500,000.

== Controversy ==
In 2014, Märtha Louise faced some criticism due to her association with British clairvoyant Lisa Williams. Williams was in Oslo on 14 September 2014, and gave a seminar for Soulspring, formerly known as the Angel School, which Märtha Louise co-founded. Williams is known for her claims that she can communicate with the deceased. The Soulspring website carried the following message: &quot;We in Soulspring do not communicate with dead souls in our work. And here is where our work is separate from Lisa&#x27;s. To be completely honest, we don&#x27;t see the point of contacting the dead. They passed over to the other side for a reason and should be allowed to stay there.&quot; No one representing the royal family commented.

Märtha Louise has objected to claims that her second husband Durek Verrett didn&#x27;t grow up wealthy, and claimed that everyone was jealous of his family&#x27;s wealth. Royal correspondent Tove Taalsen questioned why Märtha Louise places such emphasis on Verrett&#x27;s alleged wealth as a child, and wrote that it is out of touch with Norway&#x27;s more egalitarian values. The political editor of &quot;Nettavisen&quot; Erik Stephansen criticized Märtha Louise&#x27;s complaints about the coverage of her and Verrett, and wrote that she has &quot;actively sought the spotlight with her entire family, exploited the princess title in every conceivable way – including commercially – and is now fully engaged in milking her own glamorous celebrity wedding in Geiranger for all it&#x27;s worth.&quot;

Märtha Louise has faced numerous calls to cease using the title &quot;princess&quot; commercially, and to relinquish the title altogether in light of her controversial commercial activities. She has been derided in Norway as &quot;Princess Plenty More of Have-It-All&quot; (&quot;prinsesse Mertakk av Pose og Sekk&quot;). Critics have pointed out that the title princess is not a private or personal title that can be used for private profit, but is a constitutional, public title and role, awarded under the Norwegian constitution, ultimately by the Norwegian state. Editor David Stenerud wrote that Märtha &quot;insists on being a Norwegian princess&quot; and that this constitutional title is linked to a public role in Norway.

In 2024 Norwegian media reported on a year-long reputation management project to improve Verrett&#x27;s reputation, and that Märtha Louise and Verrett have demanded the removal of a quote by Prime Minister Erna Solberg that described his views as &quot;very strange&quot; and linked to conspiracy thinking.

== Marriage and family ==
Regarding the marriage ceremony in 2024: Media said in September 2024, that the king was made to wait in a car, for 43 minutes.

===First marriage===
On 24 May 2002, Princess Märtha Louise married author Ari Behn (1972–2019) in Trondheim. The couple had three daughters: Maud Angelica, Leah Isadora and Emma Tallulah; all of whom are untitled. The family lived in Islington, London and Lommedalen, Bærum. Emma Tallulah Behn is a junior member of the national equestrian team, and won a bronze medal during the Norwegian National Horse Jumping Championships in 2021.

The couple divorced in 2017. In 2016, the Royal Court had announced that Märtha Louise and Behn would have joint custody of their three daughters. Ari Behn died by suicide on Christmas Day 2019.

=== Second marriage ===
In May 2019, she announced that she was in a relationship with an American citizen, a conspiracy theorist and self-styled shaman named Durek Verrett (born 17 November 1974 as Derek Verrett). Verrett was included as one of &quot;20 famous conspiracy theorists&quot; alongside David Icke and Alex Jones in a newspaper article in 2024. He has faced strong criticism in Norway and been characterized by Norwegian media and other critics as a conman. Together Märtha Louise and Verrett have organised seminars titled &quot;The Princess and the Shaman,&quot; which also were widely criticised. Specifically, Verrett has suggested that cancer is a matter of choice and has sold medallions online, said to ward off Covid-19, without any scientific evidence to support such claims.

Märtha Louise has claimed she is able to communicate with angels. Verrett also claims to have been initiated spiritually by an American woman who calls herself &quot;Princess Susana von Radić of Croatia&quot;, who is described by fact-checking site &quot;Vantrú&quot; as &quot;a fraud who claims to be a princess.&quot;

In June 2022, she announced that she and Verrett were engaged. They were married in a private ceremony on 31 August 2024 in Geiranger. Verrett and Märtha Louise sold the rights to the wedding to a British tabloid. Norwegian media described the wedding as &quot;comical&quot; and &quot;embarrassing,&quot; sparking outrage over perceived greed and betrayal of Norwegian traditions and the taxpayers who fund the monarchy. The decision to conceal themselves in a plastic tent and behind a curtain to prevent anyone but tabloid photographers from &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine from capturing images of their wedding was widely criticized as a display of &quot;shame and greed.&quot; Norwegian media criticized King Harald V for legitimizing and endorsing the exploitation of national values and symbols for Märtha Louise&#x27;s and Durek Verrett&#x27;s personal financial gain.

The newspaper &quot;iTromsø&quot; noted that Märtha Louise has faced extensive criticism for associating with a conspiracy theorist and over her &quot;commercialization and abuse of the title &#x27;princess&#x27;&quot;. Royal historian Trond Norén Isaksen said that &quot;for the sake of the monarchy&#x27;s integrity and reputation, it is absolutely necessary to sever the formal ties with Princess Märtha Louise&quot; and that it is necessary &quot;to revoke the princess title that Märtha Louise has exploited to its fullest extent. The royal family cannot be for sale.&quot; &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; wrote that her title must be removed.

<doc id="150585" wikidata="Q470362" url="?curid=150585" title="Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway">
<text>Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway (born Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, , on 19 August 1973) is a member of the Norwegian royal family. She is married to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.

A Norwegian commoner and single mother with a disadvantaged past, she was a controversial figure at the time of her engagement to Haakon in 2000. She became Crown Princess of Norway upon her marriage in 2001. The couple have two children, Ingrid Alexandra and Sverre Magnus, who are second and third in line to the Norwegian throne respectively. Mette-Marit additionally has a son from a previous brief encounter with Morten Borg, Marius Borg Høiby.

In October 2018, she was diagnosed with a form of pulmonary fibrosis. She is being treated at Oslo University Hospital and has restricted her royal duties.

==Background and education==
Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby was born in Kristiansand in the southern part of Norway, the daughter of Sven O. Høiby, who had been unemployed for some time but who had previously worked as a small-scale advertiser and journalist for a local paper in his hometown of Kristiansand, and Marit Tjessem, a former bank clerk. Her father was also a convicted felon, who had twice been convicted of violence. Her parents divorced, and her father later married professional stripper Renate Barsgård. She has a sister and two older brothers, including Per Høiby. Her step-brother, Trond Berntsen, by her mother&#x27;s 1994 marriage to Rolf Berntsen, died in the 2011 Norway attacks. Mette-Marit grew up in Kristiansand, spending many weekends and holidays in the nearby valley of Setesdal and on the coast, where she learned to sail. During her youth, she was active in the local &quot;Slettheia&quot; youth club, where she was also an activity leader. As a teenager, she played volleyball, qualifying as a referee and coach.

After starting at Oddernes upper secondary school in Kristiansand, Mette-Marit spent six months at Wangaratta High School located in North East Victoria in Australia as an exchange student with the exchange organisation, Youth For Understanding. Later, she attended Kristiansand Cathedral School, where she passed her final examinations in 1994. She then spent several months working for the Norwegian-British Chamber of Commerce at Norway House in Cockspur Street, London. When her assignment in London ended, Mette-Marit relocated to Norway.

By her own admission, Mette-Marit experienced a rebellious phase before she met Crown Prince Haakon Magnus. As a part-time student, she took six years, longer than usual, to complete her high school education before going on to take preparatory college courses at Agder College. She then worked on and off as a waitress at the restaurant Café Engebret in Oslo.

In the 1990s she was in a relationship with John Ognby, a man convicted of drug-related offenses. The relationship with Ognby got serious to the degree that they had bought her wedding dress for their planned wedding. A TV2 documentary titled &quot;Mette-Marit – vår tids Askepott&quot; focused on Mette-Marit&#x27;s past. In 1997 she had a son with Morten Borg, who was also a convicted felon and one of Ognby&#x27;s close friends.

In the late 1990s, Mette-Marit attended the Quart Festival, Norway&#x27;s largest music festival, in her hometown of Kristiansand. She met Crown Prince Haakon at a garden party during the Quart Festival season. Years later, after becoming a single mother, she met the prince again at another party related to the festival.

Since marrying Haakon, Mette-Marit has taken several university-level courses. In 2012, she obtained a master&#x27;s degree in executive management. Most of her ancestors were cotters and small farmers.

==Marriage and children==
When the engagement between Crown Prince Haakon and Mette-Marit was announced, public and media reaction was negative, with many Norwegians being &quot;horrified&quot; and feeling that the Crown Prince&#x27;s choice of partner was questionable; her lack of education, previous relationships with convicted felons and her socialization in a milieu &quot;where drugs were readily available&quot; were often cited by critics.

The couple married on 25 August 2001 at the Oslo Cathedral. Upon her marriage, she acquired the title, &quot;Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess of Norway&quot;. The couple have two children together: Princess Ingrid Alexandra, born 21 January 2004 at The National Hospital in Oslo and Prince Sverre Magnus, born 3 December 2005 at The National Hospital in Oslo.

At the time of their engagement, Mette-Marit was a single mother to a son named Marius Borg Høiby, born 13 January 1997 at Aker Hospital in Oslo, from her brief encounter with convicted felon Morten Borg. Høiby and Borg were never cohabitants or in a formal relationship. Mette-Marit has said of Marius: &quot;Marius became a symbol of the unusual choice we made when we got married (...) he will not have a public role and is not a public figure.&quot; In 2017 he moved to the United States to attend an unspecified college. In 2018 media reported that he had falsely portrayed himself as &quot;prince&quot;, although he has never held any title and is a commoner, not a royal. He was arrested in August 2024 after assaulting a woman at her apartment. Mette-Marit has been accused of warning her son about his impending arrest and of evidence tampering and witness tampering.

==Public life and further education==

During 2002 and 2003, the Crown Princess attended lectures in development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, apparently without graduating. She was also accepted as an intern at NORAD, the Norwegian government&#x27;s development organization. The appointment received criticism due to her lack of relevant qualifications.

Crown Princess Mette-Marit is a patron of the Norwegian Red Cross and several other organizations. In 2010, Crown Princess Mette-Marit was named Young Global Leader under the World Economic Forum, and in 2012 she became a member of the international Foundation Board of the Global Shapers Community.

In 2015, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Kate Roberts, senior vice-president of Population Services International, established Maverick Collective. On 26 April 2017, the Crown Princess was appointed as ambassador for Norwegian literature in the international arena.

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit established The Crown Prince and Crown Princess&#x27;s Foundation. The purpose of the foundation is to identify and support projects for young people in Norway with the objective of strengthening youth leadership and integration.

In October 2018, she was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, which will limit her official programmes. Mette-Marit, who has dealt with &quot;health challenges on a regular basis&quot; (such as pneumonia, several instances of norovirus, low blood pressure, along with some falls, concussions, a neck injury and a herniated disc), will undergo treatment at Oslo University Hospital.

=== UNAIDS ===
Crown Princess Mette-Marit became a UNAIDS International Goodwill Ambassador in 2006. Her focus as goodwill ambassador is on the empowerment of youth in the AIDS response. The Crown Princess participated in several international AIDS conferences and visited several countries to raise awareness of the work and mission of UNAIDS. She&#x27;s assisting UNAIDS in its activities around youth program and leadership. In later years, her work with UNAIDS expanded to highlighting the role of young women and adolescent girls in the AIDS response.

During 2014 United Nations General Assembly, she emphasized how stigma and discrimination are undermining advances in the AIDS response. The Crown Princess highlighted the opportunities offered by social media to empower young people in new areas of advocacy at the youth summit during her visit to Mali. During a visit to Tanzania in April 2016, Crown Princess Mette-Marit said &quot;It is moving to meet mothers who are in good health and caring for children born free from HIV thanks to antiretroviral medicines.&quot; She also remarked that it&#x27;s rewarding to see young skilled people in leadership roles of AIDS response and guiding the country towards an AIDS-free generation. She also opened the Youth Pavilion at the XVIII International AIDS Conference.

===Controversies===
In 2012, she attracted controversy for assisting a Norwegian couple with ties to the royal family in procuring surrogacy services in India, despite the fact that surrogacy is banned in Norway; she was criticized by women&#x27;s rights groups for participating in human trafficking that exploits women in developing countries. The next year, the practice was also banned in India as a form of human trafficking and harmful to women and children.

In 2019, she attracted controversy for her friendship with the American convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; she met him several times between 2011 and 2013, after his conviction on charges of sex trafficking of minors in 2008 and release from prison. Crown Prince Haakon also met Epstein during one of these occasions while the couple were on a holiday in Saint Barthélemy. Her friendship with Epstein was revealed by Norwegian media in the context of the scandal involving Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who in that year resigned from all public roles over his longstanding ties to Epstein and allegations of sexual abuse. In a statement, Mette-Marit spoke of her regret in failing to investigate Epstein&#x27;s past. The Royal Palace&#x27;s communications manager Guri Varpe stated that she ceased contact with Epstein as he was attempting to use his connection to her to &quot;influence other people.&quot;

<text>Granite Falls is a city located mostly in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, of which it is the county seat with a small portion in Chippewa County, Minnesota. The population was 2,737 at the 2020 census. The Andrew John Volstead House, a National Historic Landmark (NHL), is located in Granite Falls. Another NHL located in Granite Falls is the Julian A. Weaver House.

==History==
In 1870 a post office began operating at Granite Falls. The town was platted in 1872 and named for deposits of granite rock in the area. In 1874 the county seat was moved to Granite Falls and a small one courtroom courthouse was erected. In 1876 the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Congregation was formed and a church was built. Granite Falls was incorporated as a city in 1879 with East Granite Falls joining in 1889. The existing county courthouse was erected in 1880. In 1888 the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad built the town train station that still stands. The rail line remains active as a short line operated by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad (TC&amp;W). 

A grain elevator was built along the rail lines that today exists as the Farmers Co-Op elevator. In 2005 Granite Falls Energy LLC began producing Corn ethanol and extract Corn oil at their newly constructed plant.

===2000 tornado===
On July 25, 2000, the city of Granite Falls and Yellow Medicine County were hit by a powerful tornado. The tornado first touched down in rural parts of the county west-northwest of Granite Falls, hitting the city at 6:10 pm. After tearing through the residential sections of town, the tornado lifted at approximately 6:25PM after being on the ground for over nine miles. One person was killed, more than a dozen were injured, and the town and surrounding area suffered millions of dollars in property damage. Most of the damage in Granite Falls was rated F2 and F3, but the extent of the damage at the corner of 9th Avenue and 14th Street caused the National Weather Service to classify it as an F4 tornado.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

U.S. Highway 212 and Minnesota State Highways 23 and 67 are three of the main routes in the city.

===Climate===
Granite Falls, along with the rest of Minnesota, has a humid continental climate with significant differences between seasons. With a July mean temperature of Granite Falls just falls into the hot-summer zone of the Köppen classification of the humid continental climate regime. Winters are cold and dry influenced by arctic air masses affecting it through its continental position, while summers are influenced by humid subtropical air masses bringing hot temperatures and significant rainfall. Transitional periods are very short, since only April and October are between and in daily mean temperatures, with May–September being clearly above and November–March averaging below freezing. The middle three months in each of those cycles are also clearly warmer and colder, respectively, than the months at the beginning or at the end of transitional periods. That is in turn a typical feature of continental climates.

<text>Grand Portage is an unorganized territory in Cook County, Minnesota, United States, on Lake Superior, at the northeastern corner of the state near the border with northwestern Ontario. The population was 616 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated community of Grand Portage and the Grand Portage Indian Reservation are both located within Grand Portage Unorganized Territory of Cook County.

The adjacent Grand Portage National Monument, designated a National Monument in 1958, lies entirely within the boundaries of the Grand Portage Ojibwe Indian Reservation. The reconstructed depot celebrates fur trade and Ojibwe ways of life. The British North West Company built its inland headquarters at Grand Portage; the post was active until 1802.

Grand Portage is home to passenger ferries that provides access from the community to Isle Royale National Park, meaning Minnesota has access to the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the unorganized territory has a total area of , of which is land and (61.46%) is water.

Minnesota State Highway 61 (Old U.S. Highway 61) serves as a main route in the area.

The community of Grand Portage is located northeast of the city of Grand Marais; and southwest of the Canada–US border.

===Unincorporated communities===
The following unincorporated communities are located within Grand Portage Unorganized Territory:

* Grand Portage
* Mineral Center
* Pigeon River

===Climate===
Grand Portage has a humid continental climate that is prevalent throughout the state. Its version is significantly cooler in summers than more southerly areas and more severe in winters. Precipitation is dominant in summers, but can render some high volumes of snowfall in winter.

==History==
Beginning in the 17th century Grand Portage became a major center of the fur trade. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early). It was at the point where a major canoe fur trade route of the voyageurs left the great lakes. It was so named because the route began with a huge 9 mile portage. A portage is a place where the canoes and equipment are carried over land. The French established this trade with the Native Americans until the British took it over in the 18th century after the Seven Years&#x27; War. The North West Company established the area as its regional headquarters. Soon Grand Portage became one of Britain&#x27;s four main fur trading posts, along with Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackinac. Even after the American Revolutionary War and victory by the rebellious colonists, the British continued to operate in the area. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain had to cede former territory to the United States, including this area.

Finally with the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1796 defining the northern border between Canada and the US, British traders planned to move from Grand Portage. They wanted to avoid the taxes the US put on their operations, in its effort to encourage American traders instead. In 1802 the traders planned to move north to create a new center, what they called Fort William. In 1803 following the Louisiana Purchase, in which the U.S. acquired the lands to the west of Grand Portage, the British finally moved from Grand Portage to the new post in Canada. The North West Company moved its headquarters northward to what they named Fort William. After British fur traders abandoned the area, it rapidly declined economically until fisheries and logging became popular in the 19th century.

<doc id="150600" wikidata="Q994793" url="?curid=150600" title="Hastings, Minnesota">
<text>Hastings ( ) is a city mostly in Dakota County, Minnesota, of which it is the county seat, with a portion in Washington County, Minnesota, United States. It is near the confluence of the Mississippi, Vermillion, and St. Croix Rivers. The population was 22,154 at the 2020 census. It is named for the first elected governor of Minnesota, Henry Hastings Sibley.

The advantages of Hastings&#x27;s location that led to its original growth are that it is well-drained, provides a good riverboat port, and is close to a hydropower resource at the falls of the Vermillion River. Other sites closer to the river confluence are either too swampy (Dakota County) or too hilly (Washington County and Pierce County, Wisconsin).

U.S. Highway 61 and Minnesota State Highways 55 and 316 are three of Hastings&#x27;s main routes.

== History ==
In the winter of 1820, a military detachment from Fort Snelling settled the area around Hastings to guard a blocked shipment of supplies. Lieutenant William G. Oliver camped in an area that came to be known as Oliver&#x27;s Grove; in 1833 a trading post was opened there. After the Treaty of Mendota of 1851 opened the area for white settlement, Oliver&#x27;s Grove was surveyed and incorporated as a city in 1857, a year before Minnesota&#x27;s admission to the Union. The same year, Hastings was named the county seat of Dakota County. The name &quot;Hastings&quot; was drawn out of a bucket from suggestions placed in it by several of the original founders.


In the mid-19th century, Hastings, Prescott, Wisconsin, and the adjacent township of Nininger were areas of tremendous land speculation. Ignatius L. Donnelly promoted the area as a potential &quot;New Chicago.&quot; The Panic of 1857 put an end to this dream. The speculation and panic caused the cities&#x27; growth to be less than expected given their location at the confluence of two significant rivers; today, their combined population is approximately 25,000, and all that remains of Nininger is a few building ruins.

Hastings has Minnesota&#x27;s second-oldest surviving county courthouse (after Washington County Courthouse, Stillwater), finished in 1871 at a cost of $63,000. The county administration began moving to a new facility in 1974, and in 1989 the City of Hastings purchased the old building. It was rededicated in 1993 as City Hall.

In 1895 a spiral bridge was built over the Mississippi River, designed to slow down horse-drawn traffic as it entered downtown. The novel design became a tourist attraction, but the bridge was demolished in 1951 because it could not handle modern vehicles. The 1951 bridge was itself demolished and its replacement opened in 2013.

In 1930, the Army Corps of Engineers completed Lock and Dam No. 2 at Hastings, part of the canal lock systems on the Mississippi that stretch from Minneapolis to St. Louis. Lock and Dam No. 2 is the site of the nation&#x27;s first commercial, federally licensed hydrokinetic power facility, a partnership between the City of Hastings and Hydro Green Energy, LLC of Westmont, Illinois.

Fasbender Clinic, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is a city landmark.

=== Railroads ===

Hastings&#x27;s name was affixed to two major Minnesota railroads, the Hastings &amp; Dakota Railway and the Stillwater &amp; Hastings Railway.

In 1867 civic leaders William LeDuc, John Meloy, Stephen Gardner, E. D. Allen, and P. Van Auken—with financial backing from investors John B Alley, Oliver Ames, William Ames and Peter Butler—incorporated the Hastings &amp; Dakota Railway with the goal to &quot;cross the Rocky Mountains and meet the Pacific Ocean&quot;. In the 1870s the H&amp;D was completed from Hastings to the South Dakota border at Ortonville. During this time, the H&amp;D became part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad (Milwaukee Road) and became known as the H&amp;D Division of the Milwaukee Road. The H&amp;D also built the famous &quot;Lake Street Depression&quot; in Minneapolis, which gave the H&amp;D two districts around Minneapolis and St. Paul: the south district from Hastings to Cologne via Chaska, and the north district from Hastings to Cologne via St. Paul/Minneapolis. The H&amp;D never made it to the Pacific on its own, but the H&amp;D Division became the mainline of the Milwaukee&#x27;s Coast Extension to Seattle, which the Milwaukee completed in 1909.

In 1880 a new branch line, the Stillwater &amp; Hastings, was built between the two cities. It funneled logging and agriculture products from Stillwater to Hastings, allowing Hastings to become an important railroad switching hub. In 1882 the Milwaukee Road gained control of the S&amp;H and operated it as a profitable branch line. The Milwaukee abandoned the S&amp;H line in 1979, after 99 years of service.

The north H&amp;D district remains intact from Minneapolis to Ortonville—except for the Lake Street Depression—and is operated by the Twin Cities &amp; Western Railroad from Minneapolis to Hanley Falls and by BNSF Railway between Hanley Falls and Ortonville. Nearly all of the south H&amp;D district was abandoned over time, with the last section between Shakopee and Cologne abandoned in the early 1970s. The Canadian Pacific Railway spur from downtown Hastings to the Ardent Mills mill atop Vermillion Falls is all that remains of the south H&amp;D district. The old H&amp;D trestle over the Vermillion River at Hastings—which was replaced four different times—is now part of a bicycle path. The H&amp;D bridge over the Minnesota River at Chaska remained until 1995, when the Army Corps of Engineers removed it as the Chaska levees were rebuilt.

Canadian Pacific Railway now operates the former Milwaukee mainline through town as well as the Ardent Mills spur.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water. The Mississippi River forms most of Hastings&#x27;s northern border, while the Vermillion River flows through the southern part of town, over a falls adjacent to a ConAgra grain elevator. Bluffs lie along the northern shore of the Mississippi and there is a gorge surrounding the Vermillion below the falls. Hastings is home to two small lakes, Lake Rebecca and Lake Isabel. Both drain into the Mississippi River. The northeast corner of town, an area of soggy marshland and flood plain for the Mississippi and Vermillion Rivers, is known as &quot;Cow Town&quot;.

Hastings is on the Mississippi side of the confluence with the St. Croix River, so that the St. Croix is &quot;across&quot; the Mississippi River. Prescott, Wisconsin is on the Wisconsin side of the confluence.

<text>Northfield is a city in Dakota and Rice counties in the State of Minnesota. It is mostly in Rice County, with a small portion in Dakota County. The population was 20,790 at the 2020 census. Northfield is south of the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul and is an exurb of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.

==History==

Northfield was platted in October 1855 by John W. North. Northfield was founded by settlers from New England known as &quot;Yankees&quot; as part of New England&#x27;s colonization of what was then the far west. It was an early agricultural center with many wheat and corn farms. The town also supported lumber and flour mills powered by the Cannon River. As the &quot;wheat frontier&quot; moved west, dairy operations and diversified farms replaced wheat-based agriculture. The region has since moved away from dairy and beef operations, and it produces substantial crops of corn and soybeans, as well as hogs. The local cereal producer Malt-O-Meal is one of the few remnants of Northfield&#x27;s historic wheat boom. The city&#x27;s motto, &quot;Cows, Colleges, and Community&quot; (a recent change from &quot;Cows, Colleges, and Contentment&quot;), reflects the influence of the dairy farms as well as its two liberal arts colleges, Carleton College and St. Olaf College.

Since early in its history, Northfield has been a center of higher education. Carleton College (then Northfield College) was founded in 1866 by the Minnesota Conference of Congregational churches whose Congregation consisted of the &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers who had largely founded the town. These were people descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. Carleton soon established its campus on the northern edge of town. St. Olaf College was founded in 1874 on the western edge of town by Norwegian Lutheran immigrant pastors and farmers who were eager to preserve their faith and culture by training teachers and preachers. These two institutions, which today enroll more than 5,000 students, make Northfield a college town.

In the 1970s, completion of Interstate 35 six miles west of Northfield enabled the expansion of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metro area south of the Minnesota River. The downtown grain elevator accepted its last load of corn in 2000 and was torn down in 2002. Residential growth has been rapid since the mid-1990s. Northfield Hospital, which opened in 2003 in the town&#x27;s northwest corner, is in Dakota County, so chosen because government reimbursement rates are more generous for Dakota County than for Rice County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water. The peak elevation is about .

The town is roughly centered around the Cannon River and rises to the east and west from it.

Interstate 35 is west of Northfield. Minnesota State Highways 3, 19, and 246 are three of Northfield&#x27;s main routes.

==Economy==

Early in the city&#x27;s history, local merchants created a small town square between Fourth Street to the north, Division Street to the east, the Cannon River to the west, and the southern storefronts. The old Ames Mill/Malt-O-Meal plant was also nearby, originally powered by the dam on the river. Bridge Square and the surrounding downtown area remain a strong cultural attraction for the city. The square has several amenities including a large fountain, a memorial statue, and a concession stand known as &quot;the popcorn wagon&quot; run by the senior center. Several scenic walkways follow the river, and numerous shops and boutiques can be found on the neighboring streets.

Businesses serving the growing senior citizen community of Northfield have expanded to include the Northfield Senior Center, the Village on the Cannon, Millstream Commons, and new construction at the Northfield Retirement Center complex. The northern edge of the city has also been expanding with several residential and commercial developments.

Jesse James&#x27; and the James-Younger Gang&#x27;s 1876 attempt to rob the First National Bank of Northfield serves as a heritage tourism draw for the town. The original bank building was converted to a museum operated by the Northfield Historical Society. The First National Bank of Northfield operates from a main office built half a block away from the historic site. In its front lobby, a glass case showcases a gun used during the robbery.

The Northfield Convention and Visitors Bureau provides comprehensive tourism information and visit planning services.

===Defeat of Jesse James Days Celebration===
On September 7, 1876, Northfield experienced one of its most important historical events, when The James-Younger Gang attempted a robbery on the First National Bank of Northfield. Local citizens, recognizing what was happening, armed themselves and resisted the robbers and successfully thwarted the theft. The gang killed the bank&#x27;s cashier, Joseph Lee Heywood and a Swedish immigrant, Nicholas Gustafson. A couple of members of the gang were killed in the street, while Cole, Bob, and Jim Younger were cornered near Madelia, Minnesota. Jesse and Frank James escaped west into the Dakota Territory, while the remaining gang members were killed or taken into custody. Considering the James gang as related to postwar insurgency, the raid has sometimes been called the last major event of the American Civil War. Two popular Northfield slogans are &quot;Jesse James Slipped Here&quot;, based on the raid&#x27;s failure, and &quot;Get your guns boys, they&#x27;re robbing the bank!&quot;, which was the alarm sounded by hardware store merchant J.S. Allen that spurred Northfield men into action, arming themselves with long guns in a street shootout that lasted around seven minutes, leaving two gang members dead in the street. Bob Younger&#x27;s horse was killed and Frank James assassinated First National Bank acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood. Swedish immigrant Nicolaus Gustafson was shot in the head by Cole Younger and died of his injuries four days later. Bank teller Alonzo Bunker was shot in the shoulder as he tried to escape.

The events have become the basis of an annual outdoor heritage festival called &quot;The Defeat of Jesse James Days&quot;. It is held the weekend after Labor Day and is among the largest outdoor celebrations in Minnesota. Thousands of visitors witness reenactments of the robbery, which are staged on Division Street, outside of the First National Bank of Northfield. Other activities during the festival include a championship rodeo, carnival, car show, and parade, as well as arts and crafts expositions, and musical performances. Many food stations are set up in Bridge Square, and during the evenings live music is played in the Entertainment Center tent on Water Street. A horseshoe hunt takes place the week before the celebration: an antique horseshoe is hidden somewhere within the city on public grounds and the finder claims that year&#x27;s cash purse.

==In popular media==

The Northfield Public School district operates three elementary schools, a middle school, a high school, and an alternative learning center. In addition, Northfield has public charter schools: Arcadia (grades 6–12) and Prairie Creek Community School (grades K–5) in nearby Castle Rock.

Circa 1917, Steele County was the only one of the four to be considered &quot;wet&quot;, meaning it was legal to both own and consume alcohol, like in &quot;dry&quot; counties, but also legal to sell. During the Prohibition Act, several tunnels were dug under the businesses on Main Street for the purpose of making and peddling moonshine, according to many of the residents of Blooming Prairie.

<doc id="150606" wikidata="Q589846" url="?curid=150606" title="Beenie Man">
<text>Moses Anthony Davis OD (born 22 August 1973), professionally known as Beenie Man, is a Jamaican dancehall deejay. His awards include DJ of the Year Award eight years in a row. His twelfth studio album &quot;Art and Life&quot; received a Grammy Award in 2001.

==Biography==
Davis was born in the Waterhouse district of Kingston in 1973. He was involved in the music industry from a young age, started toasting at the age of five, and was encouraged by his uncle Sydney Knowles, who played drums for Jimmy Cliff. He won the Tastee Talent contest in 1981, and Radio DJ Barry G introduced him to local sound system operators, who helped to establish the popularity of the young deejay, who became known as Beenie Man. He recorded his debut single, &quot;Too Fancy&quot;, with record producer Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes in 1981, with Lawes also including him on the 1983 album &quot;Junjo Presents Two Big Sounds&quot; alongside established stars such as Dillinger, Fathead, and Ringo. His debut album, &quot;The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder&quot; was produced by Bunny Lee and released in 1983, his first hit single following the same year with the Winston Holness-produced &quot;Over the Sea&quot;. In 1984 Beenie Man recorded some material with Barrington Levy (released ten years later), but his music career was put on hold while he finished school, and spent time travelling to the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.

===1990s return===
Beenie Man continued performing and honed his craft beside the then dominant dancehall figures including Ninjaman, Admiral Bailey and Shabba Ranks. He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1992, and a rivalry with Bounty Killer began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer&#x27;s style and catch phrases. The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album &quot;Guns Out&quot;, with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash. Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with &quot;Matie&quot; (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.

===International stardom===
Partially as a result of prodding from his producers, Sly and Robbie, with whom he recorded cover versions of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Baldhead&quot; and &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the Rastafari movement, as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated &quot;I have not converted. I was baptised an Ethiopian Orthodox and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic.&quot; In 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Blessed&quot;, which established his reputation internationally. In 1995 he toured the United Kingdom and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated jungle version of Levy&#x27;s &quot;Under Mi Sensi&quot;.

In 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with Dennis Brown and Triston Palma to release &quot;Three Against War&quot; and Mad Cobra and Lieutenant Stitchie on &quot;Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie &amp; Beenie Man&quot;. He also collaborated with Lady Saw on &quot;Healing&quot;, Sanchez on &quot;Refugee&quot;, and Michael Prophet on &quot;Gun &#x27;n&#x27; Bass&quot;, further establishing his reputation. He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal &quot;Maestro&quot;, produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of &quot;Dancehall King&quot;, a title only bestowed previously on Yellowman in the early 1980s.
Beenie Man&#x27;s first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded &quot;Who Am I&quot; and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.

Beenie Man appeared as himself in the 1997 film &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot;.

In 1998, Beenie Man headlined Reggae Sunsplash and signed to Virgin Records to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was &quot;The Doctor&quot; (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, &quot;Romie&quot;, &quot;Who Am I&quot;, and &quot;Girls Dem Sugar&quot;, which featured American R&amp;B singer, Mýa. During this time he received an impressive number of international music awards including a MOBO Award for Best International Reggae Act in 1998, while remaining at the top of the local charts. In 2000, Beenie Man released &quot;Art &amp; Life&quot;, which featured Arturo Sandoval and Wyclef Jean (The Fugees), for which received a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. In the same year he co-produced (with Wyclef Jean) the debut album by actor Steven Seagal. Beenie Man, like many dancehall artists, is outspoken on a number of social issues, as exemplified by songs such as &quot;Steve Biko&quot; and &quot;Murderer&quot;.

In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called &quot;Feel It Boy&quot;, but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of &quot;Dude&quot;, featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing as well as rhymes by Shawnna. He thus cemented his fan base on both sides of the Atlantic.

He had hits in the United Kingdom in 1998 with &quot;Who am I&quot; (#10), in 2003 with &quot;Street Life&quot; (#13) and &quot;Feel It Boy&quot; (#9), a duet with Janet Jackson, and in 2004 with &quot;Dude&quot; (#7) and &quot;King of the Dancehall&quot; (#14). Also in 2004, The Associated Press observed that Beenie Man had &quot;become a name-brand artist worldwide&quot; and called him &quot;king of the dancehall reggae scene&quot;.

He was also a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

In April 2008, it was announced that Beenie Man was to co-write and star in the film &quot;Kingston&quot;.
In October 2010, Beenie Man came out with the EP &quot;I&#x27;m Drinking Rum and Red Bull&quot;, which included four songs, &quot;Im drinking Rum and Red Bull&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Okay&quot;, and two versions of &quot;Stack and Pile&quot;. He later released the full album on 28 February 2011. &quot;Im Drinking Rum and Red Bull&quot; features Future Fambo.
In September 2008, Beenie Man was cleared of charges of tax evasion.

In April 2009, Beenie Man signed with Brookland Entertainment, a new record label formed by Eric Nicks and The Trackmasters, in preparation to release his new album &quot;The Legend Returns&quot;, the music video for the release of his new single &quot;Gimme Gimme&quot; being shot in Canada on 18 April 2009. The song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; was released on the &quot;Overproof Riddim&quot; compilation album in 2011.

In 2014, Beenie Man and long-term rival Bounty Killer put aside their differences and recorded a single together, &quot;Legendary&quot;. The two performed a well-received Verzuz battle together on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on 23 May 2020. Around that time, Vibe described them as &quot;two of the most legendary icons in dancehall.&quot;

==Personal life==
Beenie Man married Michelle &quot;D&#x27;Angel&quot; Downer on 22 August 2006. In June 2007, Beenie Man separated from his wife. In March 2010, they released a duet single entitled &quot;You Are My First&quot;, although at the time they were separated.
The couple filed for divorce in 2011. All legalities were completed in 2019. 

==Controversy==
===Anti-gay lyrics===
The lyrics to some of his songs have been criticised for inciting the murder of homosexuals. He was removed from the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards after protests by gay-rights activists. That same year, Beenie Man was stopped by police at Heathrow Airport in London, after the cancellation of a concert in the United Kingdom. He then issued an apology for the lyrics through his record company. In 2005, gay rights group OutRage! suspended their opposition to Beenie Man after he agreed not to play songs featuring homophobic lyrics, and he performed in London that year. The following year, he claimed his lyrics were anti-paedophilia, not against consensual homosexual relationships.

In 2007, it was reported that Beenie Man, along with several other artists, had signed the Reggae Compassionate Act, an agreement to cease performances of anti-gay material. He later denied that he had signed the act.
As of 2010, protests have continued to cause cancellations of his concerts in some countries, including New Zealand, Belgium and the Netherlands.

In 2012, Beenie Man apologized to the gay community for his earlier homophobic lyrics: &quot;Let me make this clear and straight. I have nothing against no one. I respect each and every human being, regardless of which race or creed, regardless of which religious belief you believe in, and regardless of which sexual preference you are, including gays and lesbian people. I respect all human...Please I am begging you do not have me up for some songs I wrote a long time ago. I love each and every one and am just begging each and everyone to do the same.&quot; In other interviews, however, he was quoted making statements such as &quot;I never apologized&quot; and &quot;I told them to leave us alone, to try to understand where we are coming from.&quot; In 2015 prior to coming to New Zealand for a concert, GayNZ.com news site asked Beenie Man about the homophobic lyrics in his earlier songs. He hung up the telephone without answering.

===Yellowman feud===
In 2006, veteran deejay Yellowman publicly chastised Beenie Man for his hit &quot;King of the Dancehall&quot;. Known as &quot;King Yellowman&quot; since the 1980s, the deejay took exception to Beenie Man proclaiming himself &quot;king&quot;, as well as comments Beenie made regarding his appearance. Regarding the title of &quot;king&quot;, Yellowman stated: &quot;Him trying to make people feel like him was here before me, but him never deh here before me, because dem planning to do dem official crowning them claim say is an official crowning but dem a use some a di media as some of them organisation ...&quot;. Beenie Man made comments later that year in German-based Riddim Magazine, comparing Bounty Killer to Yellowman in appearance: &quot;Bounty Killer is a great artiste and he&#x27;s ugly, too. He&#x27;s got a rough thing about him, Jamaicans like that from the Shabba Rankin&#x27; days and the King Stitt days and the Yellowman days. They like ugly people.&quot; Yellowman responded, &quot;Him can diss me all him like, but him caan diss the Jamaican public. What kinda ting that him say inna &quot;Riddim&quot; magazine? If me ugly, him pretty, me know say me wear shirt, him wear blouse, me wear pants, him wear skirt.&quot;

== Legal issues ==

=== Court case ===
On 1 January 2021, Beenie Man was charged for breaches of the Disaster Risk Management Act (DRMA) and the Noise Abatement Act after he held an event in Jamaica in violation of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="150608" wikidata="Q986636" url="?curid=150608" title="Lake City, Minnesota">
<text>Lake City is a city in Goodhue and Wabasha counties in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It lies along Lake Pepin, a wide portion of the Mississippi River. The population was 5,252 at the 2020 census. Most of Lake City is located within Wabasha County with only a small portion in Goodhue County. Lake City is part of the Rochester, Minnesota Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Lake City is located southeast of the Twin Cities at the intersection of U.S. Highways 61 and 63 on the Mississippi River at Lake Pepin. Lac de Pleurs (Lake of Tears) was the name given to Lake Pepin by Father Louis Hennepin, who camped on the shore of the lake in 1680. He christened the large body of water Lac de Pleurs after observing his Sioux captors weeping near the lake over the death of a chief&#x27;s son. The war party of Isanti Sioux had captured Hennepin and his two companions several miles south along the Mississippi and were camping near the lake on their return north to their Sioux villages near present-day Mille Lacs.

The first known settler was Jacob Boody, who arrived in 1853. In the years to follow, several explorers passed through this area. The town was platted in 1855. The waters of Lake Pepin are deep enough to allow for a port, and in 1864 the Lake City town supervisors were given special powers by the State Legislature to create a port market for grain. Soon after, Lake City became noted as a profitable market for grain with the volume of trade in 1866 bringing in a little over a million and a half dollars.

Lake City became incorporated in 1872 and has become widely known for its attractive surroundings and bountiful fishing. The &quot;Sea Wing&quot; disaster occurred on July 13, 1890 when a strong squall line overturned the excursion vessel &quot;Sea Wing&quot; on Lake Pepin near Lake City. Over 200 people were aboard the vessel when it was overturned, and as a result 98 people drowned.

Water skiing was invented in Lake City by area resident, Ralph Samuelson, which he first performed in Lake Pepin during the summer of 1922. To commemorate this event, Lake City has adopted the nickname &quot;The Birthplace of Water Skiing&quot; and holds an annual town festival, called Water Ski Days. Water Ski Days typically includes three days of water skiing exhibitions, live music, beer garden, street carnival, sports tournaments, and Grand Parade; it is held annually during the last full-weekend in June. In 2020 Water Ski Days was slated to be held June 26–28 but was cancelled due to COVID-19. The festival that will be held in 2021 would have been the 50th, but will be the 49th because of the cancellation.

Lake City has three properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1872 James C. and Agnes M. Stout House, the 1899 Lake City City Hall, and the 1910 Williamson–Russell–Rahilly House.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water. U.S. Highways 61 and 63 are two of the main routes in the community.

From 1960 to 1996, Dayton was a Democratic stronghold, having voted Democrat in every election except for 1984 when it voted narrowly for then-incumbent Ronald Reagan, who won in a landslide over Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale. Between 2000 and 2020, Dayton would reliably vote Republican. However, in 2024, partially due to its increase in suburban development, Dayton returned to its Democratic roots when Kamala Harris won the city in 2024.

<text>Fort Snelling is a former military fortification and National Historic Landmark in the U.S. state of Minnesota on the bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The military site was initially named Fort Saint Anthony, but it was renamed Fort Snelling once its construction was completed in 1825.

Before the American Civil War, the U.S. Army supported slavery at the fort by allowing its soldiers to bring their personal enslaved people. These included African Americans Dred Scott and Harriet Robinson Scott, who lived at the fort in the 1830s. In the 1840s, the Scotts sued for their freedom, arguing that having lived in &quot;free territory&quot; made them free, leading to the landmark United States Supreme Court case &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Slavery ended at the fort just before Minnesota statehood in 1858.

The fort served as the primary center for U.S. government forces during the Dakota War of 1862. It also was the site of the concentration camp where eastern Dakota and Ho-Chunk non-combatants awaited riverboat transport in their forced removal from Minnesota when hostilities ceased. The fort served as a recruiting station during the Civil War, Spanish–American War, and both World Wars before being decommissioned a second time in 1946. It then fell into a state of disrepair until the lower post was restored to its original appearance in 1965. At that time, all that remained of the original lower post were the round and hexagonal towers. Many of the important buildings of the upper post remain today with some still in disrepair.

The historic fort is in the unorganized territory of Fort Snelling within Hennepin County, bordering Ramsey and Dakota counties.

There are now multiple government agencies that own portions of the former fort with the Minnesota Historical Society administering the Historic Fort Snelling site. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources administers Fort Snelling State Park at the bottom of the bluff. Fort Snelling once encompassed the park&#x27;s land. It has been cited as a &quot;National Treasure&quot; by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The historic fort is in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service unit.

== History ==

===Bdóte===

Bdóte (&#x27;meeting of waters&#x27; or &#x27;where two rivers meet&#x27;) is considered a place of spiritual importance to the Dakota. &quot;A Dakota-English Dictionary&quot; (1852) edited by missionary Stephen Return Riggs originally recorded the word as &quot;mdóte,&quot; noting that it was also &quot;a name commonly applied to the country about Fort Snelling, or mouth of the Saint Peters,&quot; now known as the Minnesota River. According to Riggs, &quot;The Mdewakantonwan think that the mouth of the Minnesota River is precisely over the center of the Earth and that they occupy the gate that opens into the western world.&quot;.

The confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers also became a place where Native Americans would sign treaties with the United States: the 1805 Treaty of St. Peters signed by the Mdewakanton Dakota, the 1837 White Pine Treaty signed by several Ojibwe bands, and the 1851 Treaty of Mendota signed by representatives of the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute Dakota.

===Land cession treaty===
In 1805, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike signed a treaty he was unauthorized to create, known as Pike&#x27;s Purchase (1805 Treaty of St. Peters). There were seven Dakota members present, with only two signing the treaty: Cetan Wakuwa Mani (Petit Corbeau) and Way Aga Enogee (Waynyaga Inaźin). It ceded 155,320 acres of land in the area (400 km2). The document offered an unspecified amount of money, later valued at $2,000, for the land. The treaty states:Article One — That the Sioux nation grants unto the United States for the purpose of establishment of military posts, nine miles square at the mouth of river St. Croix, also from below the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Peters, up the Mississippi to Include the falls of St. Anthony, extending nine miles on each side of the river.Legal scholars, historians, and the Dakota have long raised questions about the validity of the 1805 treaty. Although Pike was an army officer, he was not authorized to sign a treaty on behalf of the United States, nor were there any formal witnesses. Pike represented the treaty as having been agreed with the entire Sioux nation, but in reality it was only signed by representatives of two Mdewakanton villages.

From a legal point of view, there was insufficient description of the land the signers intended to convey. Furthermore, there was no consideration, or payment terms, stated in the treaty. Pike wrote in his journal he thought the land was worth US$200,000, but within the treaty itself he left the payment amount blank, deferring to Congress to determine the final amount to be paid. On April 16, 1808, when the U.S. Senate finally ratified the treaty, it approved payment to the Dakota in the amount of only $2,000. Payment for the ceded lands only arrived in 1819, when the United States Department of War sent Major Thomas Forsyth to distribute approximately $2,000 worth of goods. In 1838, Indian agent Lawrence Taliaferro paid a further $4,000 to try to settle the matter with the other Dakota band. The issue was raised in subsequent treaty negotiations in the 1850s. In 1863, the US Congress passed an act which &quot;abrogated and annulled&quot; all treaties with the Dakota people. The moral legitimacy of the land title is still disputed.

Pike Island, at the mouth of the Minnesota River, was later named after Zebulon Pike.

=== Frontier post ===
Following the War of 1812, the United States Department of War built a chain of forts and installed Indian agents from Lake Michigan to the Missouri River in South Dakota. These forts were intended to extend the United States presence into the northwest territories following the Treaty of Ghent and the demarcation of the 49th parallel. The treaty restricted British-Canadian traders from operating in the US. The forts were intended to enforce that, as well as to keep Indian lands free of white settlement until permitted by treaty. The forts were seen as the embodiment of federal authority, representing law and order, and provided protection to pioneers and traders. The Fort Snelling garrison also attempted to keep the peace among the Dakota and other tribes . Also built on army land was the St. Peter&#x27;s Indian Agency at Mendota. The Anglo-Europeans called the Minnesota River the St. Peter&#x27;s and the Indian Agency would be a part of Fort Snelling from 1820 to 1853.Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth commanded the expedition of 5th Infantry that built the initial outpost in 1819. That cantonment was called &quot;New Hope&quot; and was on the river flats along the Minnesota River. Col. Leavenworth lost 40 men to scurvy that winter and moved his encampment to Camp Coldwater because he felt the riverside location contributed to the outbreak. The new camp was near a spring closer to the fortification he was constructing. That spring would be the source of drinking water to the fort throughout the 19th century. The spring held a spiritual significance to the Sioux. The post surgeon began recording meteorological observations at the fort in January 1820. The U.S. Army Surgeon General had made the recording of four weather readings every day a duty of the surgeon at every Army post. Fort Snelling has one of the longest near-continuous weather records in the country. In 1820 Colonel Josiah Snelling took command of the outpost and the fort&#x27;s construction. Upon completion in 1824, he christened his work &quot;Fort St. Anthony&quot; for the waterfalls just upriver. That did not last long, as it was changed by General Winfield Scott to Fort Snelling in recognition of the fort&#x27;s architect commander.

From construction in 1820 to closure in 1858, four army units would garrison the fort, the 1st, 5th, 6th, 10th Regiments. plus a company from the 1st Dragoons. In 1827 the 5th Infantry would be replaced by the 1st Infantry for ten years with the 5th returning in 1837. The 5th would garrison the fort until the 1st relieved them again in 1840. In 1848 the 6th Infantry became the garrison. The garrison would change again in November 1855. The 10th commanded by Col. C.F. Smith assumed duty. Smith would go on to become a major general.

Colonel Snelling was recalled to Washington, leaving Fort Snelling in September 1827. He died the next summer from complications of dysentery and a &quot;brain fever&quot;.

In 1827 the first post office in Minnesota started at Fort Snelling with most mail forwarded from Prairie du Chien.

Colonel Zachary Taylor assumed command in 1828. He observed that the &quot;buffalo are entirely gone and bear and deer are scarcely seen.&quot; He also wrote that the &quot;Indians subsist principally on fish, water fowl and wild rice&quot;. While Taylor was posted to Fort Snelling, eight adult enslaved people with him died, as did several minors.

Along with the construction of the fort, an Indian Agency was constructed on the military Reservation opposite the fort at Mendota. It was administered by Major Lawrence Taliaferro. In 1834 Taliaferro and the fort commandant, Major Bliss, assisted missionaries Gideon and Samuel W. Pond in developing the Dakota alphabet and compiling a Dakota dictionary. Taliaferro also served as the Territorial Justice of Peace until 1838 when the Governor of Iowa named Henry Sibley his replacement.

The Agency was used to hold court, and those incarcerated were sent to Fort Snelling&#x27;s round tower. The town of St. Paul also sent its criminals to the tower until it built its first jail in 1851. Both Fort Snelling and Fort Ripley provided this civil service for internment of criminals until the territory developed the civil infrastructure needed. There were 21 enslaved people with Taliaferro, one of whom was Harriet Robinson. She married Dred Scott with Taliaferro officiating at Mendota.

John Marsh, arrived at the fort during the early 1820s. He started the first school in the Territory for the officers&#x27; children. Marsh developed a relationship with the Dakota, and compiled a dictionary of the dialect used by the Mendota tribe. He had studied medicine at Harvard without earning a degree. He continued his studies under the tutelage of the fort&#x27;s physician, Dr. Purcell. However, Purcell died before he completed the coursework and March moved west. Major Plympton became post commander in August 1837. He made determining the actual boundaries of the fort&#x27;s land a priority, doing two surveys. 
After the second he sent troops to evict &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; Parrant from Fountain Cave downriver. Parrant&#x27;s tavern there was the first commercial venture in what became St. Paul. Parrant was a notorious bootlegger doing business with both the Dakota and the soldiers, causing issues for the fort commander. The eviction coincided with the arrival of the Catholic missionary Lucian Galtier. That year also brought the arrival of Pierre Bottineau, the Kit Carson of the Northwest. He would serve the fort as a guide and interpreter. He could speak French and English, Dakota, Ojibwe, Cree, Mandan and Hochunk.Lieutenant Colonel Seth Eastman was commander of the fort twice in the 1840s. Eastman was an artist. He has been recognized for his extensive work recording the Dakota. His skill was such that he was commissioned by Congress to illustrate the six-volume study of &quot;Indian Tribes of the United States&quot; by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. The set was published 1851–1857 with hundreds of his works.
From 1833 to 1836 Dr. Nathan Sturges Jarvis (surgeon) was stationed at Fort Snelling. During that time he acquired a notable collection of northern plains Native American artifacts now housed at the Brooklyn Museum.

*In 1848 A Co of the 6th U.S. Infantry was dispatched from Fort Snelling to build Fort Ripley.
* In 1848 the Fort&#x27;s Military Reservation was declared too big, with the lands east of the Mississippi detached and sold. That land created much of what became St. Paul. 
* In the summer of 1849, D Company 1st Dragoons escorted Maj. Woods of the 6th Infantry at Fort Snelling, to mark a northern boundary line and select a site for a future fortification near Pembina.
* In 1850 E Co of the 6th Infantry was sent south to build Fort Dodge and would garrison the fort until the army closed it and sent E Co. to help construct Fort Ridgely.
* In 1850 Alexander Ramsey requested Congress fund five military roads in the Territory. Two ran from Mendota at Fort Snelling. One followed the Mississippi to Wabasha and the Iowa border. The other headed west to the Big Sioux River confluence with the Missouri.
* In 1853 C, E, and K Companies of the 6th Infantry were tasked with the construction of Fort Ridgely.
*Also in 1853, congress authorized money specifically to &quot;mount&quot; E Company of the 3rd Artillery to be stationed at Fort Snelling and Fort Ridgely until May 1861.
*1856 Major Edward Canby was fort commander. He became a general. The only one killed in the Indian wars. The town of Canby is named for him.
*1857–1861 G, I, and L Companies 2nd Artillery were variously posted to northern forts Snelling, Ridgely, Ripley.
*1864–65 The Minnesota Valley Railroad completed line from St. Paul to Minneapolis crossing the river at Mendota that passed beneath the Fort. Pilings remain of the line&#x27;s river crossing.

As the towns of Minneapolis and St. Paul grew and with Minnesota statehood before Congress, the need for a forward frontier military post had ceased. In 1857, with the fort&#x27;s deactivation looming, the garrison was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to join the other units being sent to Utah for what became known as the Utah War. With the departure of the 10th Infantry, Fort Snelling was designated surplus government property. In 1858, when Minnesota became a state, the army sold it to Franklin Steele for $90,000. Steele operated the two ferries serving the fort across both rivers at the same time he was the sutler to the fort. He also was a friend of the sitting president, James Buchanan. At that time the fort sat on . A small portion of that land was later annexed into south Minneapolis. The balance of that original land is now broken into: Historic Fort Snelling Interpretive Center (300 acres), Fort Snelling State Park (2,931 acres), Fort Snelling National Cemetery (436 acres), Fort Snelling VA Hospital (160 acres), Minnesota Veterans Home (53 acres), the Coldwater Spring unit of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (29 acres), the Upper Post Veterans Home, Minneapolis St Paul International Airport and the Minneapolis-St Paul Joint Air Reserve Station (2,930 acres).

===Slavery at the fort===
When Fort Snelling was built in 1820, fur traders and officers at the post, including Colonel Snelling, employed slave labor for cooking, cleaning, and other domestic chores. Although slavery was a violation of both the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820, an estimated 15–30 Africans were enslaved at the fort. US Army officers submitted pay vouchers to cover the expenses of retaining enslaved persons. From 1855 to 1857, nine individuals were enslaved at Fort Snelling. The last slave-holding unit was the 10th Infantry. Slavery was made unconstitutional in Minnesota when the state constitution was ratified in 1858.

Two women that had lived enslaved at Fort Snelling sued for their freedom and were set free in 1836. One, named Rachel, was enslaved Lieutenant Thomas Stockton at Fort Snelling from 1830 to 1831, then at Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien until 1834. When Rachel and her son were sold in St. Louis, she sued, claiming that she had been illegally enslaved in the Minnesota Territory. In 1836 the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in her favor making her a free person. The second woman, Courtney, also sued for freedom in St. Louis. When the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in Rachel&#x27;s favor, Courtney&#x27;s enslaver conceded her case as well, and freed Courtney and her son William. Courtney had another son named Godfrey that remained in Minnesota when she was sent to a slave market in St. Louis. He is the only known &quot;Minnesota runaway slave&quot; that ran away from the fort and was taken in by the Dakota. He was involved in the Dakota War and was the first defendant on the docket of the military tribunal for hanging.

The fort surgeon, Dr. John Emerson, purchased Dred Scott at a slave market in Saint Louis, Missouri, where slavery was legal. Emerson was posted to Fort Snelling during the 1830s and brought Scott north with him. There Scott meet and married Harriet and had two children as slaves at Fort Snelling from 1836 to 1840. Dr. Emerson&#x27;s wife Irene, returned to St. Louis taking the Scotts and their children in 1840. In 1843 Scott sued for his family&#x27;s freedom for illegally being indentured in free territory. Although he lost that first trial, he appealed and in 1850 his family was given their freedom. In 1852, Emerson appealed and the Scotts were again enslaved. Dred Scott appealed that decision and in 1857 the US Supreme Court decided that the Scotts would stay enslaved. &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; was a landmark case that held that neither enslaved nor free Africans were meant to hold the privileges or constitutional rights of United States citizens. This case garnered national attention and pushed political tensions towards the Civil War.

A longstanding precedent in freedom suits of &quot;once free, always free&quot; was overturned in this case. (The cases were combined under Dred Scott&#x27;s name.) It was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857), Chief Justice Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that enslaved Africans had no standing under the constitution, so could not sue for freedom. The decision increased sectional tensions between the North and South.

===Civil War===
When the American Civil War broke out the Government commandeered the fort for the War Department as an induction station. At the time Steele was in arrears, having made only one payment. When Governor Ramsey offered President Lincoln 1000 troops to fight the South the volunteers he got were organized at Fort Snelling into a regiment, the 1st Minnesota. More than 24,000 recruits were trained there.

Minnesota units mustered in at Fort Snelling:
* 1st Minnesota April 1861 (lineage today: 2nd Battalion 135th Infantry)
* 2nd Minnesota June–July 1861 (lineage today: 136th Infantry Regiment)
* 3rd Minnesota Oct–Nov 1861
* 4th Minnesota Oct–Nov 1861
* 5th Minnesota Mar–Apr 1862
* 6th Minnesota Sep–Nov 1862
* 7th Minnesota Aug–Oct 1862
* 8th Minnesota Jun–Sep 1862
* 9th Minnesota Aug–Oct 1862
* 10th Minnesota Aug–Nov 1862
* 11th Minnesota Aug–Sep 1864
* 1st Minnesota Infantry Battalion Aug–Sep 1864
* 1st Minnesota Sharpshooters Company Apr 1864
* 2nd Minnesota Sharpshooters Company Jan 1862
* 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Nov 1864 (today 151st Field Artillery)
* 1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Nov 1861
* 2nd Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Mar 1862
* 3rd Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Feb 1863
* 1st Minnesota Cavalry Oct–Dec 1862
* 2nd Minnesota Cavalry Regiment Dec 1863
* 1st Minnesota Light Cavalry(Bracket&#x27;s Battalion) Sep–Nov 1861
* Minnesota Independent Cavalry Battalion (Hatch&#x27;s Battalion) Jul 1863
* During the civil war, slightly over 100 African Americans approached Fort Snelling to volunteer for military service. Minnesota did not have an African American population large enough to field a &quot;colored&quot; unit as US Infantry units were segregated. Those volunteers were put on riverboats to Iowa and Missouri, states that had &quot;colored&quot; units: 1st Iowa Infantry Colored, 18th United States Colored Infantry Regiment, and the 68th United States Colored Infantry. The navy had a few volunteers also.
**In 1830 Fort Snelling was the birthplace of John Taylor Wood. He served on the &quot;Merrimack&quot; at the Battle of Hampton Roads during the civil war.

In 1860 and 1863 the Minnesota State Fair was held at the fort.

*In 1865 the Minnesota Central Railroad completed rail line from Northfield to Mendota. There the line crossed the river to Fort Snelling, continuing on to Minneapolis.
*In June 1865 the 10th US Infantry Hq, D, and F Companies returned to the 10th&#x27;s pre-war post at Fort Snelling. B and H Companies went to Fort Ridgely while A and I Companies went to Fort Ripley.

With the war over Steele submitted a claim of $162,000 for the forts use during the war. He hoped to gain the money&#x27;s he still owed from the 1857 purchase. In 1873 an agreement was reached giving the Army the fort. In exchange, his debt was cleared and Steele was given title to 6,395 acres of the original Fort Snelling Reservation.

===Dakota War===
On 19 August 1862, after hearing of attacks at the Lower Sioux Agency the day before, Governor Alexander Ramsey immediately went from St. Paul to Fort Snelling to assess military preparedness. Ramsey immediately ordered troops training at or near the fort to be detained from being sent east to fight in the American Civil War. On the same day, he asked his long-time friend and political rival, former Governor Henry Hastings Sibley, to lead an expedition up the Minnesota River to end the siege at Fort Ridgely. Ramsey gave him a commission as colonel and turned over four companies of the newly organized 6th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment to Sibley at Fort Snelling.

The fort became the rendezvous point for the state and federal military forces during the Dakota War of 1862. During the war, the 6th, 7th, and 10th Minnesota Regiments did garrison duty at Fort Snelling.

To deal with the uprising, the United States Department of War created the Department of the Northwest, headquartered at St. Paul and commanded by Major General John Pope. Gen. Pope arrived in St. Paul on 15 September, and sent requests to the governors of Iowa and Wisconsin for additional troops. The 25th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment arrived at Fort Snelling on 22 September, the day before the decisive Battle of Wood Lake, and were sent immediately to Mankato and Paynesville. The 27th Iowa Infantry Regiment arrived at Fort Snelling in October, well after the war was over. Four companies stayed at Fort Snelling, while the other six marched north to Mille Lacs and returned to Fort Snelling on 4 November; three days later they were sent to Cairo, Illinois.In November 1862, 1,658 Dakota, all innocent non-combatants, were moved from the Lower Sioux Agency to Fort Snelling, escorted by 300 soldiers under Lieutenant Colonel William Rainey Marshall. They were mostly Dakota women and children, but also included 22 Franco-Dakota and Anglo-Dakota men who had not been tried, as well as Christian and farmer Dakota such as Taopi, Chief Wabasha, Joseph Kawanke, Paul Mazakutemani, Lorenzo Lawrence, John Other Day and Snana who had opposed Chief Little Crow III and the &quot;hostile&quot; faction during the war.

An encampment was created below the fort on Pike Island. The Dakota had brought their own tipis and household goods with them, and set up more than 200 tipis. The military leaders had a palisade erected around the encampment to protect the Dakota from angry settlers, some of whom had attacked the women and children as they passed through Henderson en route to Fort Snelling. Shortly after they arrived, soldiers raped one of the Dakota women. The Dakota wintered there in 1862–63. An estimated 102 to 300 Dakota died due to the harsh conditions, lack of food, measles and cholera.

In May 1863, the Dakota who survived were loaded on two steamboats and taken down the Mississippi and up the Missouri River to Crow Creek by the Great Sioux Reservation. Three hundred more died on the way and three to four a day for weeks after they arrived. Some of the Dakota who made it to Crow Creek were forced to move again three years later to the Santee Sioux Reservation in Nebraska. For the women it was an extended period of hardship and degradation. The descendants of the displaced Dakota reside there today. A memorial is outside the Fort Snelling State Park visitor center commemorating all the Native Americans who died during this period.

Because of the prevailing attitudes towards all &quot;Indians&quot; the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) that were living outside Mankato were also sent to Fort Snelling. There, they too were put on riverboats for Crow Creek. They lost 500 along the way and once there, they and the Dakota would lose another 1,300 to starvation. 

In October 1863 Major E.A.C. Hatch and his Battalion were ordered from Fort Snelling to retrieve Dakota leaders who had crossed into Canada. Winter set in before they reached Pembina in Dakota Territory. Hatch made an encampment at Pembina, sending 20 men across the border. They encountered and killed Minnesota Dakota at St. Joseph in the Northwest Territory. At Fort Gerry two Dakota leaders were drugged, kidnapped and taken to Major Hatch for a bounty. The killings at St. Joseph caused almost 400 Dakota to turn themselves in to Hatch as well.

When conditions allowed, his Cavalry took the prisoners back to Fort Snelling. The two chiefs were hanged at the fort. They were Little Six (Sakpedan) and Medicine Bottle (Wakanozanzan). Chief Little Leaf managed to evade capture.

The next year four companies of the 30th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment arrived at Fort Snelling with three of them moving forward to Camp Ridgely en route to Alfred Sully&#x27;s Dakota campaign.

===Indian Wars and Spanish–American War===

Steele had made plans and plotted his purchase to build the City of Fort Snelling. Steele, however, failed to make payments as agreed causing the government to revoke the sale and repossess the fort lands. Placing the Department of the Northwest at Fort Snelling led to the fort&#x27;s further development in 1866 when the department transitioned to the Department of Dakota. The next year the headquarters of the department moved to St. Paul. The HQ returned to the fort in 1879 and would remain until 1886 when it went back to St. Paul. After the Civil war Minneapolis began to expand into the fort&#x27;s surroundings.

In March 1869 the 20th Regiment was transferred from Louisiana to the Department of Dakota. Headquarters, band and E Company were posted to Fort Snelling.

The United States Army assigned the 7th Infantry to garrison the fort in 1878 and six companies arrived in September. That year Congress approved $100,000 to be spent on the Department of Dakota and the old fort&#x27;s walls were torn down for reuse in the new construction. The following October the remaining four companies of the 7th Infantry arrived and took over garrison duties. The six companies that had been the garrison departed to fight the Utes at White River, Colorado. They returned to Fort Snelling in 1880. In November 1882 the 7th was relieved by the 25th Infantry (colored). The 25th&#x27;s HQ, band and four companies would garrison the fort until 1888 when they were relieved by the 3rd Infantry. During the 1880s, companies of the 7th Cavalry would be at the fort. The 3rd Regiment would remain until 1898. Some of the garrison were sent to Cuba and fought in the Spanish–American War of 1898. During one of the last battles of the Indian Wars, six soldiers of the 3rd Infantry were killed at the Battle of Leech Lake October 5, 1898. Those killed were Major Wilkinson, Sgt. William Butler, and Privates Edward Lowe, John Olmstead (Onstead), John Schwolenstocker (aka Daniel F. Schwalenstocker), and Albert Ziebel. Those men were buried at north end of the post. Ten others were wounded in the battle. Among them were five Minnesotans: Privates George Wicker, Charles Turner, Edward Brown, Jes Jensen, and Gottfried Ziegler. Pvt. Oscar Burkard would receive the last Medal of Honor awarded during the Indian wars for his action on 5 October 1898 at Leech Lake with the 3rd Infantry. He was also from Minnesota.

In 1895 General E. C. Mason, post commandant, called for the preservation of what remained of the old fort, having realized something had been lost with the dismantling of the walls. Nothing came of the preservation proposal, but from 1901 through 1905 Congress would spend $2,000,000 on the Fort Snelling upper post.

In 1901 the 14th Infantry became the garrison followed by the 28th in 1904. From 1905 to 1911 squadrons of the 3rd, 2nd, and 4th Cavalry Regiments were the occupants of the new cavalry barracks on the upper post.

In June 1916 President Wilson had General Pershing in Mexico on the trail of Poncho Villa. To provide border security Minnesota&#x27;s entire National Guard was activated at Fort Snelling, comprising three Infantry Regiments and one Artillery. A camp was created on the upper post named Camp Bobleter for organizing the activation. Upon returning to Minnesota the 1st Infantry Regiment was re-designated the 135th Infantry. It is the direct descendant of the 1st Minnesota formed at the fort in 1862.

*Sgt. Charles H. Welch was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Little Big Horn in 1876. His award lists his home as Fort Snelling. Welch enlisted in the Army on June 8, 1873, at Fort Snelling, and was assigned to D Company 7th U.S. Cavalry.

===World War I===

Once the United States entered the war the fort became a recruit processing station. For WWI the 41st Infantry was constituted at the fort in May 1917 and inactivated in September 1921. The army established an officer training school which closed when the war ended. At that time the only building seeing use was the base hospital. It was expanded to 1200 beds and designated General Hospital 29. During the 1918 influenza pandemic it saw extensive use. That hospital would be the forerunner of the VA Hospital at Fort Snelling now. Between wars, the 14th Field Artillery and the 7th Tank Battalion were assigned to Fort Snelling while the base was considered the &quot;Country Club of the U. S. Army&quot;.

In 1921 the 3rd Infantry was in Ohio and ordered to report to Fort Snelling with no designated transport. They marched the 940 miles only to have the 2nd and 3rd Battalions inactivated upon arriving at Fort Snelling. The following June the 1st Battalion was inactivated only for a short time. The regiment would remain at Fort Snelling until 1941. Also in 1921 the US Army created the 88th Divisional area in Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota. Fort Snelling became a Citizens Military Training Camp (CMTC) for the 351st Infantry Regiment of the 88th Division. The Officers of the unit worked with the CCC program at Fort Snelling. When Pearl Harbor happened the regiment&#x27;s officers were immediately activated for active duty units so that when the 351st was called up it had very few officers to meet the call.

===Civilian Conservation Corps===

In 1933 the Civilian Conservation Corps was created by Executive Order 6101. Fort Snelling was located in Seventh Corps Area of the US Army and the Works Progress Administration(WPA) established a supply depot at Fort Snelling to support CCC camps. A CCC Headquarters Company was stationed at the Fort. Minnesota had two CCC companies that were entirely African American. One of these worked next the Fort in Fort Snelling State Park.

===World War II===

During WWII the Fort Snelling military reservation served both the army and navy. The army had an enlistment center there that processed 300,000 enlistees. The War Department chose the base to be the site of the army&#x27;s Military Railroad Service(MRS) HQ in 1942 and a winter warfare program later. The MRS was closely linked to commercial railroading with multiple Minnesota railroads sponsoring MRS Railroad Operating Battalions. That year the Army created two Railroad Divisions with the Great Northern Railroad sponsoring the 704th. The 1st MRS Division was activated at Fort Snelling (as the 701st) from where it deployed to the Mediterranean(Italy, Southern France, and North Africa). It was commanded by Brig. Gen. Carl R. Gray Jr. of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway. Gen. Gray was responsible for creating a Commendation for Meritorious Service(MRS Certificate of Merit) specific to railroading troops. In January 1943 the 701st Railway Grand Division, sponsored by the New York Central Railroad, was stood up at Fort Snelling. Minnesota Railroads sponsored multiple Railroad Operating Battalions(ROB)s with the Great Northern sponsoring the 732nd ROB. Even though sponsored by the Great Northern, the 732nd trained at Fort Sam Houston. It landed in France and was one of two ROBs. The 732nd operated in support of Gen. Patton&#x27;s 3rd Armored Division and went into Germany with them. During the Battle of the Bulge Patton&#x27;s armor would come to the 732nds trains to refuel. The Army positioned field Artillery directly adjacent to the rail lines so that the 732nd delivered ammo directly to the guns. The 757th Railroad Shop Battalion, sponsored by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, set up operations at Cherbourg. The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway sponsored the 714th ROB in the Territory of Alaska.

In 1944 the Military Intelligence Service Language School (MISLS) for Japanese language had outgrown its facilities at Camp Savage and it relocated to Fort Snelling. With the move the curriculum was expanded with Chinese. 
It had 125 classrooms, 160 instructors, and 3000 students. June 1946 would see the fort&#x27;s 21st and last commencement at the school. The War Department constructed scores of buildings at the fort for housing and teaching during the war. The language school was relocated to Monterey, California, in June 1946.

In 1943 the navy opened an air station on the north side of Wold-Chamberlain Field that existed until 1970. That area is now used by reserve units and the Minnesota Air National Guard. WWII Fort Snelling facilities covered 1,521 acres at war&#x27;s end.

=== Post-war 20th century ===
The War Department decommissioned Fort Snelling a second time on 14 October 1946. Various federal agencies were allowed to request land parcels from the land that made up Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory. Since the army departed, the majority of the structures fell into disrepair. In 1960, the fort itself was listed as a National Historic Landmark, citing its importance as the first major military post in the region, and its later history in the development of the United States Army.

Many acres of fort land have been lost to roads. Construction of the Mendota Bridge ran a state highway across old fort land. More fort land was lost when an Interstate 494 interchange was added as well as access roads to the International Airport, National Cemetery, VA Hospital and bridge into St. Paul.

In 1963 Fort Snelling became headquarters of United States Army Reserve 205th Infantry Brigade, that had units throughout the upper Midwest. In 1994 that ended as a part of force-structure eliminations.

The fort has been reconstructed to replicate its original appearance starting in 1965. Time and use had been hard on the original fort. The walls, barracks and buildings had been removed. There was archaeological work done at the site in 1957–1958 and again in 1966–1967. At that time all that remained of the original fort were the round and hexagonal towers. State archaeologists located the foundations of all that had been demolished allowing them to pin point the structures they reconstructed. The Minnesota Historical Society has since made the original walled fort or &quot;Lower Post&quot; into an interactive interpretive center. It has been staffed from spring to early fall with personnel attired in period costumes. Although restoring the original fort assured its survival, many of the buildings constructed later, composing the &quot;Upper Post&quot;, suffered serious disrepair and neglect. Many of them have been demolished.

=== 21st century ===
In May 2006, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added Upper Post of Fort Snelling to its list of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places&quot;. Some restoration on historic Fort Snelling continues. Crews removed the flagpole from the iconic round tower and installed it in the ground, a change since its opening as a historic fort.

===USS &quot;Fort Snelling&quot; (LSD-30)===

USS &quot;Fort Snelling&quot; (LSD-30) was a Thomaston-class dock landing ship of the United States Navy. She was named for Fort Snelling at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, for many years the northernmost military post in the land of the Dakota and Ojibwe. She was the second ship assigned that name, but the construction of Fort Snelling (LSD-23) was canceled on 17 August 1945.

&quot;Fort Snelling&quot; (LSD-30) was laid down on 17 August 1953 by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss.; launched on 16 July 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Robert P. Briscoe, wife of Vice Admiral Briscoe; and commissioned on 24 January 1955, Commander H. Marvin-Smith in command.

<text>Rockford is a city in Wright and Hennepin counties in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 4,316 at the 2010 census. While Rockford is mainly located within Wright County, a small part of the city extends into Hennepin County. It is part of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan statistical area. Minnesota State Highway 55 serves as a main route in the city.

==History==

Evidence of indigenous settlement in what is today Rockford can be found in burial mounds ranging from 500 to 1500 years old, as well as a trail which runs under the Bridge Street Bridge on the Hennepin County side. 
The area was a natural border land between the Ojibwe and Dakota, with both tribes utilizing the space for hunting and wintering. Though the space was primarily utilized by the Dakota, there also existed an Objibwe village near modern-day Dayton, on the Crow River.

As colonial settlement widened in Wisconsin, the Ho-Chunk were pushed west and forced to resettle near Rockford. Though the creation of a reservation at the site was proposed, concerns were raised about the proximity of an indigenous reservation so close to Minneapolis, a rapidly-developing economic center at the time. 
After the Treaty Traverse de Sioux in 1851, the land was opened to white settlers; after surveying was completed in 1854, plots became available for purchase to homesteaders.

In 1855,  brothers-in-law George F. Ames and Joel Florida of Illinois came up the Crow River with carpenter Guildford D. George with hopes of starting a mill town. Eventually the town would boast multiple thriving mills: a lumber, a flour, and a saw mill. Four years later, in 1859, the first US troops called to Minnesota were dispatched to Rockford in response to the so-called Wright County War, a period of rioting in the area.

A stockade was built in town during the Dakota Uprising of 1862, and again in 1863.

Rockford was incorporated in 1881, with a railroad running through the town being completed in 1886.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.

The Crow River is formed at Rockford by the confluence of its North and South Forks.

La Crescent is located in the northeast portion of Houston County; the northern edge of the city falls into Winona County. The city is known as the &quot;Apple Capital of Minnesota&quot; because John S. Harris planted apple trees here, resulting in many orchards in the present-day city. It is recognized as a &#x27;Tree City&#x27; by the Arbor Day Foundation, and a &#x27;Minnesota GreenStep City&#x27; by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

==History==
Lying on the west bank of the Mississippi River, the city is surrounded by bluffs with views of the river and abundant wildlife. Humans have inhabited this area for thousands of years. The most recent inhabitants before the arrival of white settlers were the Dakota people, a branch of the Sioux, and the Ho-Chunk, or Winnebago.

Following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Nathan Boone, youngest son of Daniel Boone, was among the early surveyors of this area. The various Indian tribes who had lived here were forced out and relocated in the 1840s to accommodate white settlement.

La Crescent was founded in 1851 by Peter and Emma Cameron, who called it &quot;Camerons&quot;. The Camerons were two of the town&#x27;s most colorful characters; he tried to dig a canal to change the flow of the Mississippi River so it would flow closer to La Crescent and bypass La Crosse, Wisconsin across the river. He died 10 weeks before its scheduled completion in 1857, and the canal was never finished, although the canal can still be seen in aerial photographs of the city. The Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson lived in La Crescent prior to 1872, when he moved westward to Denver and later Alaska.

The second name of La Crescent was &quot;Manton&quot;, named by William and Harvey Gillett, after they cleared the downtown area for settlement for Peter Cameron. In quick succession, the town&#x27;s name was changed again by a somewhat unscrupulous land speculation venture, the Kentucky Land Company. They wanted a more romantic-sounding name for the town to attract settlers and came up with &quot;La Crescent&quot;, after the bend or &quot;crescent&quot; shape of the Mississippi River around the town. La Crescent incorporated in 1857.

Horticulturalist John S. Harris arrived in La Crescent in 1856, who helped give the town its identity of &quot;Apple Capital of Minnesota&quot;, a title that the city copyrighted in 2002. Despite the belief of &quot;99 out of 100 people that apples could not grow in Minnesota&quot;, Harris planted the area&#x27;s first apple trees in 1857, experimenting until he grew trees hardy enough to withstand Minnesota winters. He planted thousands of apple trees and hundreds of varieties, a full half of which he said were total failures. Harris became known as &quot;Father of the Orchardists&quot; in Minnesota, and was a founding member of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.

La Crescent sits three miles southwest across the Mississippi River from Onalaska, Wisconsin and west of the northern part of La Crosse. Winona, Minnesota is 21 miles to the northwest of La Crescent. It is the largest city in Houston County and the second largest in Winona County.

===Bluffs===
La Crescent is known for having more bluffs than most Minnesota cities. It lies on the side of a large bluff, with other large hills within the city. Since La Crescent is below the normal level of the rest of the area, the bluffside provides some protection from winds.

===Lake===
La Crescent sits next to Blue Lake, which the US Fish and Wildlife Service lists as a high quality wetland, due to its diverse species, with year-round fishing. Most visible around the lake are migratory bird species such as Wood Ducks, Ruddy Ducks, Hooded Mergansers, Least and American Bitterns, Common Morrhends, Night Herons, Sandhill Cranes, and Tundra Swans. In the early spring, the water appears clear, before natural aquatic vegetation grows over.

<text>Le Sueur ( ) is a city in Le Sueur County in the U.S. state of Minnesota, between Mankato and the Twin Cities. It lies along the Minnesota River and U.S. Highway 169. Le Sueur was named in honor of the French explorer Pierre-Charles Le Sueur. The population was 4,213 at the 2020 census.

The community is known locally as the &quot;Valley of the Jolly Green Giant&quot;. A large billboard, with the caption &quot;Welcome to the Valley&quot; and Green Giant logo, remains even after the company and Green Giant label were bought by Pillsbury in 1979. Pillsbury merged with General Mills in 2001. In 2016, General Mills spun off Green Giant to B&amp;G Foods and the canning is done in Montgomery, Minnesota. The old canning processing plant in Le Sueur was used until 1995. It is still used for Ag related research for corn varieties. Peas are no longer researched at the Le Sueur plant. The sugar snap pea variety was developed by a scientist at the Le Sueur plant.

==History==

Le Sueur was named its current name in 1853 by the community there at the time after the explorer Pierre-Charles Le Sueur who explored this area from 1683 to 1722. Before this, the area was known by the French as &quot;Prairie La Fleche&quot;, or &quot;arrow prairie&quot;. It is believed this place name originates from a translation of the native Dakota name for the area, &quot;Wahinoge&quot;, or &quot;flint quarry&quot;, a material used to make arrowheads.

In 1852, the first claim on the area that is now the city of Le Sueur was made by George W. Thompson. Soon after Thompson settled here, Henry McLean, presenting a license from the governor for him to operate with natives of the area, demanded Thompson&#x27;s vacation. Despite his vacation, Thompson was able to claim lands one mile upriver. Within that year, Thompson, accompanied by a party led by J.M. Farmer, founded the village of &quot;Le Sueur&quot;.
McLean, accompanied by John Christy and John Catheart and unaware of the village upriver, attempted to found his own village of &quot;Le Sueur&quot;. However, as an identically named settlement had already been legally platted upriver, McLean was required to settle for the name &quot;Le Sueur City&quot;. Rivalry over the righteous claim of Le Sueur caused both cities to legislate civil matters separately and deterred the incorporation of either community. However, in 1867, a special act by Minnesota Legislature was able to remedy this by uniting both communities into one
borough town, &quot;Le Sueur&quot;.

William Worrall Mayo was an early resident who began his practice in Le Sueur. He eventually founded the world-famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, with his sons William and Charles. His old home, the Dr. William W. Mayo House, was restored to its mid-1800 appearance and turned into a museum; it, along with several other buildings in Le Sueur, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The company that is now known as Green Giant was founded in 1903 as The Minnesota Valley Canning Company, by 14 Le Sueur local merchants.
In 1925, along with the introduction of &quot;Green Giant Great Big Tender Peas&quot;, a company mascot based on Paul Bunyan was introduced called &quot;The Jolly Green Giant&quot;. The new mascot spurred the company to change its name to &quot;Green Giant Co.&quot; in 1950.
The canning company flourished in Le Sueur until Pillsbury&#x27;s purchase of Green Giant 1979 which moved Green Giant headquarters from Le Sueur to Minneapolis. In January 1995, Pillsbury officially announced the closure of the entirety of the original Green Giant processing plant, with the exception of a Green Giant research center. Of note, the more-than-55-foot fiberglass Jolly Green Giant statue resides not in Le Sueur but 60 miles away in Blue Earth, Minnesota.

Despite the devastation of Green Giant&#x27;s departure, unemployment is low due to expansions to the pre-existing Le Sueur Inc. foundry and Davisco creamery and Cambria, a manufacturer of natural quartz surfaces. A Mars pet food plant existed in Le Sueur shortly until it was closed in 2009.

==Education==
The school system of Le Sueur, Le Sueur-Henderson School District, services the 1,076 students of Le Sueur and the nearby city of Henderson jointly. This system consists of Park Elementary School and Le Sueur-Henderson Secondary School in Le Sueur and Hilltop Elementary School in Henderson. Each school in the system services its own division of the system from Kindergarten to 12th grade. Park Elementary School serves Kindergarten-3rd grade; Hilltop serves 4th-5th grade; Le Sueur-Henderson Secondary School serves 6th-12th grade.

Beyond the public school system, the St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic School, a private Catholic elementary school, serves students from pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. Despite being a Catholic institution, St. Anne&#x27;s admits students from all Christian denominations.

==Places of worship==

The City of Le Sueur holds six churches total with a Catholic church, a Methodist church, an Evangelical church, and three Lutheran churches.

On July 26, 1862, the Saint Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish was established by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis with Father Venn as its first pastor. And within a year, a church was built. the church was affiliated, as of its original founding, with Le Sueur&#x27;s French populace.

The Zion United Church of Christ, the first Lutheran church of Le Sueur still in existence today, was formed from the two churches present in the Le Sueur area at the year of 1868, A German native Lutheran church and a New Knoxville, Ohio native Reform church. The church moved to three different parts of Le Sueur until being plotted in its current location in 1956. Until a 1931 vote changed it to English, church services were held in German.

A few years after the Zion church&#x27;s merger, a wave of Swedish immigration spurred the formation of the First Lutheran Church, in 1883. The church moved to three different parts of Le Sueur until being plotted in its current location in 1980. Church services were held in Swedish until 1927 when they were changed to English.

In 1955, the Grace Lutheran Church was founded as a member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.

In 1978, the Word of Life Lutheran Brethren Church was formed by a group of Le Sueur Lutheran families. The church existed only among church members&#x27; houses until a church building was purchased, the First Lutheran Church&#x27;s previous building, in 1980. The church was plotted in its current location in 1996.

Le Sueur also holds the Le Sueur United Methodist Church.

<text>New Prague ( ) is a city in Scott and Le Sueur counties in the state of Minnesota. The population was 8,162 at the 2020 census. Although the northern portion of the City is located within the Metropolitan Council geographic area, the City of New Prague, through special legislation (M.S. 473.121, Subd. 2), is outside the Metropolitan Council review area/approval jurisdiction. 

==History==

===Origin===
New Prague was laid out in 1856, and named after Prague, the capital of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). The immigrants from Bohemia built the town of New Prague, and many of them identified as Czechs.

At the advice of Catholic Bishop Rev. Joseph Cretin, Anton Philipp, a native German, first settled within the present limits of New Prague. In 1856 Philipp purchased 160 acres in Helena Township, Scott County. Philipp did not make an official plat of the town but began selling lots that same year, marking the beginning of New Prague. Several Bohemian families came to the area shortly after Philipp arrived.

===Late 19th century===
New Prague&#x27;s early development was not spectacular for a variety of reasons. First, during the Civil War years, 1861–1865, European immigration almost stopped as European immigrants were naturally wary of the American Civil War. Second, located in the middle of the Big Woods, the enormous challenge of clearing fields proceeded at a slow pace.

The town was known as Praha from 1872 to 1879. On March 1, 1877, state of Minnesota approved the incorporation of Praha as a village. In 1879 the name was changed to Prague.

One of the most important developments in the new village occurred in 1877 when the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway (M &amp; St. L) reached New Prague. The arrival of the railroad era expedited agriculture as New Prague&#x27;s most important industry. A link with the outside world enabled farmers to send their commodities to markets and created a conduit to bring inventory to the village&#x27;s businesses. Just four years after the M &amp; St. L reached New Prague, the first grain elevator and flour mill were completed, marking the beginning of New Prague earning its nickname, the “Flour City.”

Czech immigration to the United States reached its peak during the 1880s with 62,000 coming to the United States during this decade. Along with Montgomery, which is approximately eight miles south of New Prague, New Prague was becoming the center of “The Bohemian Triangle” of Minnesota covering parts of Scott, Le Sueur and Rice counties, which are neighboring counties. Through the decades since 1856, Le Sueur County has had more Bohemians than any other county in the state.

Construction was booming in the 1880s. The town&#x27;s first bank opened in 1883, the Czech-Slovak Protective Society (C. S. P. S.) Opera Hall was built, the New Prague Foundry started business, the second public school was built, and two hotels were constructed.

The village&#x27;s name was changed from Prague to New Prague on February 25, 1884.

The 1890s were probably New Prague&#x27;s heyday decade. The town was becoming a major market for farm produce and was providing goods and services for growing numbers of farmers and villagers for miles around. Streets were being graded and wooden sidewalks built along the streets. New Prague was incorporated as a city on April 4, 1891. New Prague Flouring Milling Company completed its mill in 1895. Electric lights were installed in the city in 1895, and telephone lines were installed in 1898.

Similar to the rest of the state, the 1880s and 1890s were two decades with the greatest growth in population. New Prague&#x27;s population more than tripled during that 20-year period going from 384 residents to 1228, while the state&#x27;s population more than doubled during that same period.

Original businesses outgrew their original log and wood-frame storefronts. A large commercial district filled with solid brick, stone, and wood-frame commercial structures developed along Main Street.

New Prague had one of the largest earthquakes in Minnesota history. On December 11, 1860, there was a 4.7 magnitude earthquake with a Mercalli intensity of VI.

<text>Princeton is a city in Mille Lacs and Sherburne counties in the U.S. state of Minnesota, at the junction of the Rum River and its West Branch. It is north of Minneapolis and east of St. Cloud, at the intersection of Highways 169 and 95. The population was 4,819 at the 2020 census and an estimated 5,311 in 2022. A majority of its residents live in Mille Lacs County.

==History==
In the winter of 1855 Samuel Ross, Jame W. Gillian, Dorilus Morrison, John S. Prince and Richard Chute platted the town of Princeton. The plat was officially recorded on April 19, 1856.

===Lumbering===
Princeton&#x27;s location near the junction of the Rum River and its West Branch was critical to the town&#x27;s development. In 1847, Daniel Stanchfield led an expedition to explore the Rum River. The group discovered vast white pine forests upstream from Princeton&#x27;s future site along the Rum River, the West Branch Rum River, and their tributaries. Three sawmills were built in Princeton between 1856 and 1867. Lumbermen floated logs down the Rum River to the Princeton mills, though most of the logs passed through Princeton to mills in Minneapolis.

===Brickmaking===
Brick-making was another important industry in the Princeton area. The industry developed about two miles northeast of Princeton near beds of clay. A community known as Brickton formed in the location. From 1889 through the late 1920s several brickyards operated in Brickton, collectively producing as many as 20 million bricks per year. When the brick industry declined, Brickton ceased to exist. &quot;Years after the last brick had been shipped from Brickton, specifications in contracts for construction of public buildings often stated that it should be of Princeton brick or of equally good quality.&quot;

===Other===
Other important industries in Princeton&#x27;s early years included wheat farming (before potatoes became primary), potato farming, starch production, dairy, and distilled spirits production, in which the town&#x27;s distillery continues to play a key role.

==Geography==
Princeton is at the southern end of Mille Lacs County and extends south into the northeast corner of Sherburne County. The city center is about three-quarters of a mile north of the county border. U.S. Highway 169 passes through the west side of the city on a four-lane bypass, leading north to Milaca, the Mille Lacs county seat, and south to Elk River, the Sherburne county seat. State Highway 95 passes through the north side of the city, leading east to Cambridge and west to St. Cloud.

==&quot;Coke Geysers&quot; world record attempt==
The Princeton High School Student Council organized a community effort to break the world record for simultaneously erupting coke geysers on May 27, 2011. The record of 2,854 bottles was set in October 2010 in the Philippines. Hundreds of students participated, with a goal of setting off a series of 3,000 geysers, a figure they exceeded with 3,051 total simultaneous eruptions. But &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; personnel did not officiate the event and never made the record official. Students say the idea grew from a plan for a graduation prank into a way to put their small town on the map. A video of the attempt was broadcast on Minnesota NBC News affiliate KARE 11 and edited by a YouTube user named Physics314Nerd.
