<text>In the textual criticism of the New Testament, the Byzantine text-type (also called Traditional Text, Ecclesiastical Text, Constantinopolitan Text, Antiocheian Text, or Syrian Text) is one of the main text types. The New Testament text of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Patriarchal Text, are based on this text-type. Similarly, the Aramaic Peshitta which often conforms to the Byzantine text is used as the standard version in the Syriac tradition, including the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Chaldean church. 

It is the form found in the largest number of surviving manuscripts of the Greek New Testament. Consequently, the Majority Text methodology, which prefers the readings that are most common or which are found in the great preponderance of manuscripts, generates a text that is Byzantine text (in turn leading to the Byzantine priority rule-of-thumb.)
Whilst varying in around 1,800 places from printed editions, the Byzantine text-type also underlies the Textus Receptus Greek text used for most Reformation-era (Protestant) translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. 

The Byzantine text is also found in a few modern Eastern Orthodox editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as the standard Byzantine text. There are also some textual critics such as Robinson and Hodges who still favor the Byzantine Text, and have produced Byzantine-majority critical editions of the Greek New Testament. This view was famously defended by John Burgon.

Modern translations (since 1900) mainly use eclectic editions that conform more often to the Alexandrian text-type, which has been viewed as the most accurate text-type by most scholars, although some modern translations that use the Byzantine text-type have been created.

== Manuscripts ==

The earliest clear notable patristic witnesses to the Byzantine text come from early eastern church fathers such as Gregory of Nyssa (335 – c. 395), John Chrysostom (347 – 407), Basil the Great (330 – 379) and Cyril of Jerusalem (313 – 386). The fragmentary surviving works of Asterius the Sophist († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text. Although somewhat closer to the Alexandrian text, the quotations of Clement of Alexandria (150 –  215) sometimes contain readings which agree with the later Byzantine text-type. The incomplete surviving translation of Wulfila (d. 383) into Gothic is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types. The second or third earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac Peshitta (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings); usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century; although in respect of several much contested readings, such as Mark 1:2 and John 1:18, the Peshitta rather supports the Alexandrian witnesses. Despite being characterized by mixed readings, significant Byzantine components also exist in the Syro-Palestinian manuscripts, which likely originated from the 5th century.

Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the Ethiopic version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the Garima Gospels and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as &quot;early Byzantine&quot;. Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with Papyrus 66.
In the very early 7th century, Thomas Herakel worked on a revision of the Philoxenian version, thus producing the Harklean version in Syriac. This text very closely resembles the Byzantine text-type and due to its wide distribution, it is preserved in over 120 manuscripts. Many of the extant Georgian and Armenian manuscripts also conform to the Byzantine text-type, although this is due to the manuscripts having gone through revisions to bring them closer to the Byzantine text. Additionally, the Byzantine text is the textual basis of the Old Church Slavonic manuscripts of the Bible, although they sometimes contain readings from other textual traditions.

Some debate exists on the manuscript basis of Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate and if this text was influenced by the Byzantine text. Wordsworth concluded that Jerome mainly used a text-type similar to Codex Siniaticus and Vaticanus, however his conclusions were rejected by H. J. Vogels who instead argued that the Greek manuscripts used by Jerome mostly agreed with the Byzantine text. Vogel&#x27;s analysis of the Vulgate was criticized by both F. C. Burkitt and Lagrange, Burkitt instead argued that Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate was influenced by multiple Greek manuscripts from different text-types, some of which were similar to Codex Alexandrinus while others similar to Codex Vaticanus.

Individual readings in agreement with the later Byzantine text have been found in the very early papyri, such as . Some such as Harry Sturz have concluded from this that the Byzantine text-type must have had an early existence, however others have been cautious in making this conclusion. According to Zuntz, although some Byzantine readings may be ancient, the Byzantine tradition as a whole originates from a later period, not as a creation but as a process of choosing between early variants. It has also been questioned if some of the readings found in the early papyri which agree with later Byzantine readings are genetically significant or accidental.

== Characteristics ==

Compared to Alexandrian text-type manuscripts, the distinct Byzantine readings tend to show a greater tendency toward smooth and well-formed Greek, they display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel Synoptic Gospel passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or &quot;difficult&quot; issues of exegesis.

== &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; and &quot;Majority Text&quot; ==

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by Erasmus and published by Johann Froben of Basel on March 1, 1516 (Novum Instrumentum omne). Erasmus provided substantial scholarly annotations based on multiple Greek manuscripts and Patristic evidence, but produced a Greek text on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he initially back-translated from the Latin Vulgate; he also introduced some readings from the Caesarean text-type, Vulgate and Church Fathers. This text came to be known as the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; or &quot;received text&quot; after being thus termed by Bonaventura Elzevir, an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus&#x27; text. The New Testament of the King James Version of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. 

The different Byzantine &quot;Majority Text&quot; of Hodges &amp; Farstad as well as Robinson &amp; Pierpont is called &quot;Majority&quot; because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. 

Although the Textus Receptus may be considered a late Byzantine text, it still differs from the Majority Text of Robinson and Pierpont in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent &quot;translatable&quot; differences. Most of these variants are minor, however the Byzantine text excludes the Comma Johannium and Acts 8:37, which are present in the Textus Receptus. Despite these differences, the RP Byzantine text agrees far more closely with the Textus Receptus than with the critical text, as the Majority Text disagrees with the critical text 6,577 times in contrast to the 1800 times it disagrees with the Textus Receptus. Additionally, many of the agreements between the Textus Receptus and the Byzantine text are considered very significant, such as the reading &quot;God&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16 and the inclusion of the Story of the Adulteress.

== Modern critical texts ==
Textual critic and biblical scholar Karl Lachmann was the first scholar to produce an edition that broke with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, ignoring previous printings and basing his text on ancient sources, therefore discounting the mass of late Byzantine manuscripts and the Textus Receptus. The critical Greek New Testament texts of today (represented by UBS/NA Greek New Testaments) are considered to be predominantly representative of the Alexandrian text-type in nature, but there are some critics such as Robinson and Hodges who still favor the Byzantine Text, and have produced Byzantine-Majority critical editions of the Greek New Testament. Around 6,500 readings differ between the Majority text and the modern critical text (represented by UBS/NA Greek New Testaments), although the two still agree 98% of the time. A critical edition of Family 35 of the Byzantine text has also been created by Wilbur N Pickering, who believes that Family 35 most accurately reflects the original text of the New Testament.

The Byzantine type is also found in modern Greek Orthodox editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John&#x27;s gospel, (funded by the United Bible Societies in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in Birmingham, UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, &quot;The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition&quot; was published.

Textual critic Herman von Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:
* K: no uncials, hundreds of minuscules, among them codex 2, 3, 8, 14, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 73, 75, 76, 78, etc.
* K: no uncials, no early minuscules, hundreds of minuscules: 18, 35, 55, 66, 83, 128, 141, 147, 155, 167, 170, 189, 201
* K (subfamily of K): S V Ω 461
* K (Family E): E F G H
* I (also K), now Family Π: (A) K Y Π; this subgroup is the oldest, but only 5% of manuscripts belong to it. The majority of them have text mixed with other Byzantine subfamilies.

Since the discovery of , , and , these have demonstrated early manuscript witnesses to a small selection of Byzantine text readings. Examples:

Luke 10:39
: : A W Byz b
: : B D L Ξ 579 892 cop syr

Luke 10:42
: : A C W Byz
: : B
: : 38 sy

Luke 11:33
: : 33 Byz
: : B F Θ ƒ ƒ

John 10:29
: : B it
: : ƒ ƒ Byz

John 11:32
: : B C* D L X
: : Θ Byz

John 13:26
: : B C L X 33
: : A Θ

Acts 17:13
: omitted: E Byz

1 Corinthians 9:7
: : * A B D* G P
: : Byz

Ephesians 5:9
: : * A B D* G P
: : Byz

Philippians 1:14
: : A B (D*) P Ψ 33 81 104 326 365 629 1175 1241 2464
: omitted: D Byz

Other examples of Byzantine readings were found in in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14, 51; 5:8; 6:10, 57; 7:3, 39; 8:41, 51, 55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; and 14:17. Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings. These readings support the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and Maurice Robinson (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date, which some authors have interpreted as a rehabilitation of the Textus Receptus. However in 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.

== Modern translations ==
The Byzantine majority text of Robinson and Pierpont is the basis of the World English Bible. And an interlinear translation of the Hodges-Farstad text has been made by Thomas Nelson. The Holman Christian Standard Bible was initially planned to become an English translation of the Byzantine majority text, although because Arthur Farstad died just few months into the project, it shifted to the Critical Text. However, the HCSB bible was still made to contain the Byzantine majority readings within its footnotes. Similarly, the New King James version contains the Byzantine majority readings within the footnotes, although it is a translation of the Textus Receptus. There also exists multiple translations of the Aramaic Peshitta into English, translations have been made by John W. Etheridge, James Murdock and George M. Lamsa. The Peshitta has also been translated into Spanish and into Malayam. 

An English translation of Family 35 has also been created by Wilbur Pickering, called &quot;The Sovereign Creator Has Spoken&quot; translation.

<text>Manos Hatzidakis (also spelled Hadjidakis; ; 23 October 1925 – 15 June 1994) was a Greek composer and theorist of Greek music, widely regarded as one of the greatest Greek composers of all time. He was one of the main proponents of the &quot;Éntekhno&quot; form of music, along with Mikis Theodorakis, and he is credited as the founder of the Orchestra of Colours, an ensemble performing lesser-known works and the music of Greek composers, and influenced a broad swathe of Greek culture through his writings and radio broadcasts. With his theoretical and compositional work, he is considered to be the first to connect post-war the worded music with traditional music.

In 1960, Hatzidakis won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; from the film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, but he refused the award because he felt that Athens was misrepresented in the film.

==Early life==
Hadzidakis was born on 23 October 1925 in Xanthi, Greece, to lawyer Georgios Hatzidakis, who came from the village of Myrthios, Agios Vasileios, in the Rethymno prefecture in Crete; and Aliki Arvanitidou, who came from Adrianoupolis. The family prospered from sales of tobacco grown locally, but the boy&#x27;s father died in 1931 and his mother took him to live in Athens in comparative poverty.

Hatzidakis studied music theory with Menelaos Pallandios, in the period 1940–1943. At the same time, he studied philosophy at the University of Athens. However, he never completed this course. He met and connected with other musicians, writers, and intellectuals including George Seferis, Odysseas Elytis, Angelos Sikelianos, Yannis Tsarouchis and especially the poet Nikos Gatsos who became a close friend. During the last stages of the Axis occupation of Greece, Hatzidakis was an active participant in the Greek Resistance through membership of the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (EPON), the youth branch of the major resistance organisation EAM, where he met Mikis Theodorakis with whom he soon developed a strong friendship.

==Career==
Hatzidakis&#x27;s first composition was the tune for the song &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (&quot;Χάρτινο το Φεγγαράκι&quot;), from Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; staged by Karolos Koun&#x27;s Art Theatre of Athens. His first piano piece, &quot;For a Little White Seashell&quot; (&quot;Για μια Μικρή Λευκή Αχιβάδα&quot;), came out in 1947, and in 1948 he set a collection of Gatsos poetry to music: &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;. In 1949, Hatzidakis shook the musical establishment by delivering an influential lecture on rembetika, the urban folk songs that flourished in Greek cities, mainly Piraeus, after the Asia Minor refugee influx in 1922. Hatzidakis focused on the economy of expression, the deep traditional roots and the genuineness of emotion displayed in rembetika, and exalted the likes of composers like Markos Vamvakaris and Vassilis Tsitsanis. Putting theory to practice, he adapted classic rembetika in his 1951 piano work, &quot;Six Popular Pictures&quot; (&quot;Έξι Λαϊκές Ζωγραφιές&quot;), which was later also presented as a folk ballet. Also in 1949 he co-founded the Greek Dance Theatre Company with the choreographer Rallou Manou.

At this point he began writing immensely popular songs and movie soundtracks alongside more serious works, such as 1954&#x27;s &quot;The C.N.S. Cycle&quot; (&quot;O Kyklos tou C.N.S.&quot;), a song cycle for piano and voice. In 1955 he wrote the score for Michael Cacoyannis&#x27; film &quot;Stella&quot;, with actress Melina Mercouri singing the movie&#x27;s trademark song &quot;Love that became a double-edged knife&quot; (&quot;Αγάπη που &#x27;γινες δίκοπο μαχαίρι&quot;).

He composed the score for the 1955 film Laterna, ftoxia kai filotimo &quot;Λατέρνα, φτώχεια και φιλότιμο&quot;

In 1958, Hatzidakis met Nana Mouskouri, his first &quot;ideal interpreter&quot;. It was 1960 that brought him international success, as his song &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; (&quot;Τα παιδιά του Πειραιά&quot;), from Jules Dassin&#x27;s film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; (Ποτέ την Κυριακή), won him an Academy Award and became a worldwide hit. Hatzidakis did not attend the Academy Award ceremony in 1961, and refused to collect his award. He said that the film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; with a prostitute as its protagonist reflected negatively on Athens.

In 1962, Hatzidakis founded a music competition to encourage Greek composers, with the first award going to Iannis Xenakis in 1963. Also in 1962, Hatzidakis produced the musical &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; (&quot;Οδός Ονείρων&quot;) and completed his score for Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Birds&quot; (&quot;Όρνιθες&quot;), another Art Theater production which caused an uproar over Koun&#x27;s revolutionary direction. The score was also used later by Maurice Béjart&#x27;s Ballet of the 20th Century. He also wrote the music for a song which Arthur Altman added English lyrics to and gave to Brenda Lee. The song was &quot;All Alone Am I&quot;. In 1964, he released the album &quot;15 Vespers&quot; (&quot;Δεκαπέντε Εσπερινοί&quot;) with the famous song &quot;Mr Antonis (&quot;Ο Κυρ Αντώνης&quot;).

In 1965, his LP &quot;Gioconda&#x27;s Smile&quot; (&quot;Το Χαμόγελο της Τζιοκόντας&quot;) was released on Minos-EMI. The album was re-released in 2004, digitally remastered as an audiophile LP and a CD in the EMI Classics collection. In 1966, Hatzidakis travelled to New York City for the premiere of &quot;Illya Darling&quot;, a Broadway musical based on &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, which starred Mercouri. 

==Living outside Greece==
Hatzidakis lived in the United States from 1966 to 1972, during which he completed several more major compositions, including &quot;Rhythmology&quot; (&quot;Rythmologia&quot;) for solo piano, his compilation, &quot;Gioconda&#x27;s Smile&quot; (produced by Quincy Jones), and the song cycle, &quot;Magnus Eroticus&quot; (&quot;Megalos Erotikos&quot;), in which he used ancient (Sappho, Euripides), medieval (stanzas from folk songs and George Hortatzis&#x27; romance &quot;Erophile&quot;) and modern (Dionysios Solomos, Constantine Cavafy, Odysseus Elytis, Nikos Gatsos) Greek poems, as well as an excerpt from the Old Testament book &quot;Song of Songs&quot;. He released the album &quot;Reflections&quot;, a collaboration with the New York Rock &amp; Roll Ensemble.

==Later years==
Hatzidakis returned to Greece in 1972 and recorded &quot;Magnus Eroticus&quot; with opera-trained alto Fleury Dantonaki and singer Dimitris Psarianos. Following the Greek junta&#x27;s overthrow in 1974, he became active in public life and assumed a number of leadership positions in the Athens State Orchestra (KOA), the Greek National Opera (ELS/GNO), and the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT). In 1985 he launched his own record company &quot;Seirios&quot;, named after Sirius, the hunting dog of mythical Orion. In 1989 Hatzidakis founded and directed the Orchestra of Colours, an ensemble performing lesser-known works and the music of Greek composers.

Although he said Greece must enter the European Economic Community (EEC, later the European Union) for economic reasons, he believed that Greece would be culturally assimilated.

In the later years of his life, Hatzidakis explained that his work was meant not to entertain but to reveal. Further, he disclaimed part of his work, written for the Greek cinema and theater, as unrepresentative.

==Death==
Hatzidakis died from a heart attack on 15 June 1994 in Athens at the age of 68. In 1999 the city of Athens dedicated the museum Technopolis in his memory. He was buried in Paiania.

<doc id="155027" wikidata="Q1517110" url="?curid=155027" title="Alexandrian text-type">
<text>In textual criticism of the New Testament, the Alexandrian text-type is one of the main text types. It is the text type favored by the majority of modern textual critics and it is the basis for most modern (after 1900) Bible translations.
Over 5,800 New Testament manuscripts have been classified into four groups by text type. Besides the Alexandrian, the other types are the Western, Caesarean, and Byzantine. Compared to these later text types, Alexandrian readings tend to be abrupt, use fewer words, show greater variation among the Synoptic Gospels, and have readings that are considered difficult. That is to say, later scribes tended to polish scripture and improve its literary style. Glosses would occasionally be added as verses during the process of copying a Bible by hand. From the ninth century onward, most surviving manuscripts are of the Byzantine type.

The King James Version and other Reformation-era Bibles are translated from the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, a Greek text created by Erasmus and based on various manuscripts of the Byzantine type. In 1721, Richard Bentley outlined a project to create a revised Greek text based on the Codex Alexandrinus. This project was completed by Karl Lachmann in 1850. Brooke Foss Westcott and F. J. A. Hort of Cambridge published a text based on Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus in 1881. &quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; by Eberhard Nestle and Kurt Aland, now in its 28th edition, generally follows the text of Westcott and Hort.

== Manuscripts ==

Up until the ninth century, Greek texts were written entirely in upper-case letters, referred to as uncials. During the ninth and tenth centuries, minuscules came to replace the older style. Most Greek uncial manuscripts were recopied in this period and their parchment leaves typically scraped clean for re-use. Consequently, surviving Greek New Testament manuscripts from before the ninth century are relatively rare, but nine (over half of the total that survive) witness a more-or-less pure Alexandrian text. These include the oldest near-complete manuscripts of the New Testament: Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 and Codex Sinaiticus (both believed to date from the early fourth century).

A number of substantial papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament survive from earlier still, and those that can be ascribed a text-type, such as and from the second to the third century, also tend to witness to the Alexandrian text.

The earliest Coptic versions of the Bible (into a Sahidic variety of the late second century) use the Alexandrian text as a Greek base, while other second and third century translations (into Latin and Syriac) tend rather to conform to the Western text-type. Although the overwhelming majority of later minuscule manuscripts conform to the Byzantine text-type, detailed study has, from time to time, identified individual minuscules that transmit the alternative Alexandrian text. Around 17 such manuscripts have been discovered so far and so the Alexandrian text-type is witnessed by around 30 surviving manuscripts, by no means all of which are associated with Egypt although in that area, Alexandrian witnesses are the most prevalent. 

According to Robert Boyd, the Arabic manuscripts of the New Testament appear to have an origin within the Alexandrian text-type.

The Alexandrian text-type is witnessed to in the writings of Origen (185 – c. 253), Athanasius (296–298 – 373), Didymus (313 – 398) and Cyril of Alexandria (376 – 444). The quotations of Clement of Alexandria also often agree with the Alexandrian text-type, although sometimes they contain readings which are instead common in the Byzantine text-type. 

===List of notable manuscripts representing Alexandrian text-type===

According to the present critics codices and B are the best Alexandrian witnesses, which present the pure Alexandrian text. All other witnesses are classified according to whether they preserve the excellent -B line of text. With the primary Alexandrian witnesses are included and citations of Origen. With the secondary witnesses are included manuscripts C, L, 33, and the writings of Didymus the Blind.

== Characteristics ==
All extant manuscripts of all text-types are at least 85% identical and most of the variations are not translatable into English, such as word order or spelling. When compared to witnesses of the Western text-type, Alexandrian readings tend to be shorter and are commonly regarded as having a lower tendency to expand or paraphrase. Some of the manuscripts representing the Alexandrian text-type have the Byzantine corrections made by later hands (Papyrus 66, Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Ephraemi, Codex Regius, and Codex Sangallensis). When compared to witnesses of the Byzantine text type, Alexandrian manuscripts tend:

* to have a larger number of abrupt readings, such as the shorter ending of the Gospel of Mark, which finishes in the Alexandrian text at Mark 16:8 (&quot;.. for they were afraid.&quot;) omitting verses Mark 16:9-20; Matthew 16:2b–3, John 5:4; John 7:53-8:11;
* Omitted verses: Matt 12:47; 17:21; 18:11; Mark 9:44.46; 11:26; 15:28; Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34; 24:7; 28:29.
* In Matthew 15:6 omitted η την μητερα (αυτου) (&quot;or (his) mother&quot;): א B D copsa;
* In Mark 10:7 omitted phrase και προσκολληθησεται προς την γυναικα αυτου (&quot;and be joined to his wife&quot;), in codices Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Athous Lavrensis, 892, ℓ &quot;48&quot;, syrs, goth.
* Mark 10:37 αριστερων (&quot;left&quot;) instead of ευωνυμων (&quot;left&quot;), in phrase εξ αριστερων (B Δ 892v.l.) or σου εξ αριστερων (L Ψ 892*);
* In Luke 11:4 phrase αλλα ρυσαι ημας απο του πονηρου (&quot;but deliver us from evil&quot;) omitted. Omission is supported by the manuscripts: Sinaiticus, B, L, &quot;f&quot;1, 700, vg, syrs, copsa, bo, arm, geo.
* In Luke 9:55-56 it has only στραφεις δε επετιμησεν αυτοις (&quot;but He turned and rebuked them&quot;): א B C L W X Δ Ξ Ψ 28 33 565 892 1009 1010 1071 Byzpt Lect
* to display more variations between parallel synoptic passages, as in the Lukan version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (Luke 11:2), which in the Alexandrian text opens &quot;Father.. &quot;, whereas the Byzantine text reads (as in the parallel Matthew 6:9) &quot;Our Father in heaven.. &quot;;
* to have a higher proportion of &quot;difficult&quot; readings, as in Matthew 24:36, which reads in the Alexandrian text &quot;But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only&quot;; whereas the Byzantine text omits the phrase &quot;nor the Son&quot;, thereby avoiding the implication that Jesus lacked full divine foreknowledge. Another difficult reading is Luke 4:44.

The above comparisons are tendencies, rather than consistent differences. There are a number of passages in the Gospel of Luke in which the Western text-type witnesses a shorter text, the Western non-interpolations. Also, there are a number of readings where the Byzantine text displays variation between synoptic passages, that is not found in either the Western or Alexandrian texts, as in the rendering into Greek of the Aramaic last words of Jesus, which are reported in the Byzantine text as &quot;Eloi, Eloi..&quot; in Mark 15:34, but as &quot;Eli, Eli..&quot; in Matthew 27:46.

<text>Georgios Nikolaou Papanikolaou (or George Papanicolaou ; ; 13 May 1883 – 19 February 1962) was a Greek physician, zoologist and microscopist who was a pioneer in cytopathology and early cancer detection, and inventor of the pap smear for detection of cervical cancer.

After studying medicine in Greece and Germany, he emigrated in 1913 to the United States and was faculty at Cornell Medical College. He first reported that uterine cancer cells could be detected in vaginal smears in 1928, but his work was not widely recognized until the 1940s. An extensive trial of his techniques was carried out in the early 1950s. In 1961, he was invited to the University of Miami to lead and develop the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute there.

==Early life and education==

Papanikolaou was born in Kymi, Greece, on 13 May 1883. He attended the University of Athens, where he studied literature, philosophy, languages and music. Urged by his father, he pursued a medical degree, which he received in 1904. He was then conscripted into military service. When his military obligation ended in 1906, he returned to Kymi to practice medicine with his father. In 1907, he began studying in Germany under Ernst Haeckel at the University of Jena for one semester before moving to University of Freiburg, where he was supervised by August Weismann. He then attended the University of Munich, where he graduated with a PhD in zoology in 1910.

==Career==
In 1910, after obtaining his Ph.D from the University of Munich, Papanikolaou then returned to Athens, where he married Andromachi Mavrogeni, who later became his laboratory assistant and research subject. He then departed for Monaco, where he worked for the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco and participated in the Oceanographic Exploration Team of Prince Albert I of Monaco in 1911.

===Cornell University===
Two years later, in 1913, along with his wife, he immigrated to New York City in order to work in the pathology department at New York Hospital and the Department of Anatomy at Cornell University&#x27;s Medical College.

Papanikolaou was also inspired by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, writing papers on philosophical matters for an Athenian literary quarterly. Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical thought was particularly crucial in shaping his character.

The importance of his work was recognized in 1942 with publication, along with Herbert F. Traut (1894–1963), of &quot;Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear&quot;. The book discusses the preparation of vaginal and cervical smears, physiologic cytologic changes during the menstrual cycle, the effects of various pathological conditions, and the changes seen in the presence of cancer of the cervix and of the endometrium of the uterus. He thus became known for his invention of the Papanicolaou test, commonly known as the Pap smear or Pap test, which is used worldwide for the detection and prevention of cervical cancer and other cytologic diseases of the female reproductive system.

===University of Miami===
In 1961, he moved to Miami, Florida, to develop the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute at the University of Miami, but died there on 19 February 1962 due to a myocardial infarction. His wife Andromachi Papanikolaou, known as Mary, continued his work at the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute after his death; she died in Miami on 13 October 1982.

==Discoveries==

In 1914, Papanikolaou and his wife worked at the Department of Anatomy at the Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and contributed to the histological and physiological changes associated with the oestrus cycle in the guinea pig. In 1917, Papanikolaou along with Charles R. Stockard demonstrated that, in the guinea pig, the histologic cyclic changes that occur in the reproductive tract during the estrus cycle also occur in the vaginal mucosa and can be detected by cytologic examination of vaginal smears. This technique (termed the &quot;Papanicolaou technique&quot;) was groundbreaking and also facilitated the discovery of an ovarian hormone.

Papanikolaou then began examining the human reproductive system. His wife Mary, was a crucial partner in this research. She was working in the same laboratory as an unpaid laboratory technician. Every day Mary provided a vaginal sample for the research. She also prepared her own samples in the laboratory for further analysis. She provided daily samples for twenty-one years, eventually encouraging her friends to also provide samples for the research.

In 1920, Georgios Papanikolaou realized that he could tell the difference between normal and malignant cells on the cervix by viewing smears on a slide under a microscope. In 1925, with funds from the National Research Council and the Maternal Health Committee, Papanikolaou recruited 12 hospital staff volunteers, together with a number of pregnant gynecological and surgical patients, for a systematic study of cervical cell morphology. The participants were regularly tested to determine normal hormonal changes and to diagnose early pregnancy. Upon examination of a slide made from a smear of one of the participant&#x27;s vaginal fluid, Papanikolaou discovered that abnormal cancer cells could be plainly observed under a microscope. &quot;The first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix,&quot; he later wrote, &quot;gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career.&quot;

In 1928, Papanikolaou told an incredulous audience of physicians about the noninvasive technique of gathering cellular debris from the lining of the vaginal tract and smearing it on a glass slide for microscopic examination as a way to identify cervical cancer. That year, he had undertaken a study of vaginal fluid in women, in hopes of observing cellular changes over the course of a menstrual cycle. In female guinea pigs, Papanicolaou had already noticed cell transformation and wanted to corroborate the phenomenon in human females. It happened that one of Papanikolaou&#x27;s human subjects was suffering from uterine cancer.

At a 1928 medical conference in Battle Creek, Michigan, Papanikolaou introduced his low-cost, easily performed screening test for early detection of cancerous and precancerous cells. However, this potential medical breakthrough was initially met with skepticism and resistance from the medical community. Papanicolaou&#x27;s next communication on the subject did not appear until 1941 when, with gynecologist Herbert Traut, he published a paper on the diagnostic value of vaginal smears in carcinoma of the uterus. This was followed two years later by an illustrated monograph based on a study of over 3,000 cases. In 1954, he published another memorable work, the &quot;Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology&quot;, thus creating the foundation of the modern medical specialty of cytopathology. The complete works of Papanicolaou as the founder of exfoliative cytology include 5 books and 158 original articles, all of which are summarised in his monographs.

===Controversy===
Romanian physician Aurel Babeș made similar discoveries in the cytologic diagnosis of cervical cancer. He discovered that if a platinum loop (rather than a cotton swab, as used by Papanikolaou and by modern doctors) was used to collect cells from a woman&#x27;s cervix, and the cells were then dried on a slide and stained, it could be determined if cancer cells were present. This was the first screening test to diagnose cervical and uterine cancer. Babeș presented his findings to the Romanian Society of Gynaecology in Bucharest on 23 January 1927. His method of cancer diagnosis was published in a French medical journal, &quot;La Presse Médicale&quot;, on 11 April 1928, but Papanicolaou was not aware of Babeș&#x27;s research. On the other hand, Babes was aware of Papanikolaou&#x27;s studies. Moreover, the medical community has established that the two techniques are different in their design. Babeș&#x27;s technique of preparing, staining and examining vaginal smears was substantially different from Papanicolaou&#x27;s and would never have lent itself to mass screening for cervical cancer without modification.

Recent scientific papers have analyzed the ways that Babeș&#x27;s method differed from Papanikolaou&#x27;s and note that the paternity of the Pap test belongs solely to Papanicolaou.

Although a few scholars believe that Babeș was the true pioneer in the cytologic diagnosis of cervical cancer, Papanikolaou is still widely considered the pioneer in the field by mainstream scholarship. In Romania, cervical testing is referred to as the &quot;Méthode Babeș-Papanicolaou&quot; in honor of both scientists.

==Awards and honors==
Papanikolaou was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize, but never won. This was likely because the prize is rarely awarded for diagnostic tools, as well as because a death of one of Papanikolaou&#x27;s great admirers, who was a member of the Nobel Prize Committee, occurred around that time and also due to the committee&#x27;s reluctance to award a Nobel Prize for another cancer discovery following a former embarrassing award in 1926 to Johannes Fibiger, who claimed that worms caused cancer. Nevertheless, Papanikolaou received many other prestigious prizes and awards for his discoveries, such as the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research (the American equivalent to the Nobel Prize in Physiology), which he received in 1950. In total, he received hundreds of honorary awards.

These include honorary awards by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Cancer Society. In 1949, the Medical School of the University of Athens named Papanikolaou an honorary doctorate, while the Academy of Athens in November 1957 proclaimed him an honorary member. In 1962, he was also posthumously given an award by the United Nations, after being nominated by the World Health Organization.

==Commemorations==
In 1958, &quot;The Papanicolaou Award&quot;, the highest award given by the American Society of Cytopathology, was established in honor of Papanikolaou and awarded annually since.

In 1978, Papanikolaou&#x27;s work was honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a 13-cent stamp for early cancer detection.

Between 1995 and 2001, his portrait appeared on the obverse of the Greek ₯10,000 banknote, until its replacement by the euro.

In 2011, &quot;A Man of Science&quot;, a statue portraying Papanicolaou was permanently installed in Weill Cornell Medicine&#x27;s main lobby at 1300 York Avenue in New York City.

On 13 May 2019, the 136th anniversary of his birth, a Google Doodle featuring Papanikolaou was shown in North America, parts of South America, and parts of Europe and Israel. He and his wife Andromachi&#x27;s efforts in the fight against cervical cancer, along with that of Helen Octavia Dickens and Hashime Murayama, are featured in the documentary film &quot;The Cancer Detectives&quot; which first aired on &quot;American Experience&quot; on March 26, 2024.

<doc id="155033" wikidata="Q180455" url="?curid=155033" title="Aristotle Onassis">
<text>Aristotle Socrates Onassis (, ; , ; 20 January 1906 – 15 March 1975) was a Greek and Argentine business magnate. He amassed the world&#x27;s largest privately-owned shipping fleet and was one of the world&#x27;s richest and most famous men. He was married to Athina Mary Livanos, had a long-standing affair with opera singer Maria Callas and was married to American former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

Onassis was born in Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire to Greek parents and fled the city with his family to Greece in 1922 in the wake of the burning of Smyrna. He moved to Argentina in 1923 and established himself as a tobacco trader and later a shipping owner during the Second World War. Moving to Monaco, Onassis fought Prince Rainier III for economic control of the country through his ownership of SBM and its Monte Carlo Casino. In the mid-1950s, he sought to secure an oil shipping arrangement with Saudi Arabia and engaged in whaling expeditions. In the 1960s, Onassis attempted to establish a large investment contract—Project Omega—with the Greek military junta and he sold Olympic Airways, which he had founded in 1957. He was greatly affected by the death of his son, Alexander, in 1973 and died two years later.

== Early life ==

===Ottoman Empire===
Aristotle Socrates Onassis was born in 1906 in Karataş, a suburb of the Ottoman port city of Smyrna (now İzmir, Turkey) in Anatolia to Greek parents Socrates Onassis and Penelope Dologlou. Aristotle had one sister, Artemis, and two half-sisters, Kalliroi and Merope, by his father&#x27;s second marriage following Penelope&#x27;s death (1912). Socrates Onassis became a successful shipping entrepreneur and sent his children to prestigious schools. When Aristotle graduated from the local Evangelical Greek School at the age of 16, he spoke four languages: Greek (his native language), Turkish, Spanish, and English.
Smyrna was occupied by Greece (1919–1922) in the aftermath of the Allied victory in World War I, but then Smyrna was re-taken by Turkey during the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22). The Onassis family&#x27;s substantial property holdings were lost, causing them to become refugees fleeing to Greece after the Great fire of Smyrna in 1922. During this period, Onassis lost three uncles, an aunt and her husband, Chrysostomos Konialidis and their daughter, who were burned to death in a church in Akhisar where 500 Christians were seeking shelter from the Great Fire of Smyrna. The Asia Minor catastrophe in 1922 was devastating for the Onassis family. His father was imprisoned and his business was transferred to Turkish ownership. The rest of the family fled to Greece where they had to stay in an outdoor refugee camp.

=== Argentina ===
In 1923, Onassis returned to Istanbul with $250 in his pocket. In August of that year, he arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Nansen passport, and got his first job as a telephone operator with the British United River Plate Telephone Company, while following studies in commerce and port-duty administration at &quot;Aduanas Argentinas&quot;. He later became an entrepreneur, creating an Argentine import-export company, going into business for himself and making a fortune importing English-Turkish tobacco to Argentina. He reportedly told Maria Callas that he made his fortune in Buenos Aires by forming a shipping company used for trafficking heroin. He obtained Argentine citizenship in 1929. Eventually he established his first shipping trading company in Buenos Aires, Astilleros Onassis. After gaining his first fortune in Argentina, he expanded his shipping business worldwide and relocated to New York City, United States, where he built up his shipping businesses empire while keeping offices in Buenos Aires and Athens. His legacy in Buenos Aires was the creation of a shipping empire and a Hellenic Culture Fund providing youth scholarships and an academic international exchange program between Argentina, Greece, Monaco and the United States; the programs are funded and administered by the Onassis Foundation and were eventually under the managing direction of his daughter Christina Onassis.

== Business ==

===Shipping===
Onassis built up a fleet of freighters and tankers that eventually exceeded seventy vessels. Most of the fleet operated under flags of convenience where laws and regulations are looser than those of the owners&#x27; country. More austere regulations in countries such as the United States, which afforded higher wages and safety standards, allowed access to domestic routes with higher freight rates but at far greater running expense. As was then common practice in international shipping, Onassis&#x27;s fleet had mostly Panamanian and Liberian flags and sailed tax-free while operating at low cost. This and his astute business sense helped Onassis earn handsome profits in the highly competitive shipping market. Onassis made large profits when the Big Oil companies like Mobil, Socony, and Texaco signed long-term contracts known as time charters at fixed prices before the stock market fell.

The high profitability of the Onassis fleet has been attributed in large part to his disregard for standards that normally govern international shipping. For example, after his Liberian-registered tanker ran aground and spilled oil into Chedabucto Bay, Nova Scotia in 1970, still the most significant oil spill off Canada&#x27;s East Coast (about 25% of the amount spilled by the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; in Alaska in 1989), there was a Commission of Inquiry. Led by Patrick McTaggart-Cowan, executive director of the Science Council of Canada, the Commission found that the &quot;Arrow&quot; had been operating with almost none of its navigation equipment serviceable: &quot;radar had ceased to function an hour before the ship struck; the echo sounder had not been in working condition for two months; and the gyrocompass... had a permanent error of three degrees west. The officer on watch at the time of the accident, the ship&#x27;s third officer, &quot;had no license&quot; and none of the crew had any navigational skill except the master, &quot;and there are even doubts about his ability.&quot;

===Monaco===
Onassis arrived in the Mediterranean principality of Monaco in 1953 and began to purchase the shares of Monaco&#x27;s Société des bains de mer de Monaco (SBM) via the use of front companies in the tax haven of Panama, and took control of the organisation in the summer of that year. Onassis moved his headquarters into the Old Sporting Club on Monaco&#x27;s Avenue d&#x27;Ostende shortly after taking control of the SBM. The SBM was a significant owner of property in Monaco: its assets included the Monte Carlo Casino, the Monaco Yacht Club, the Hôtel de Paris and a third of the country&#x27;s acreage. Onassis&#x27;s takeover of the SBM was initially welcomed by Monaco&#x27;s ruler, Prince Rainier III as the country required investment, but Onassis and Rainier&#x27;s relationship had deteriorated by 1962 in the wake of the boycott of Monaco by the French President, Charles de Gaulle.

Onassis and Rainier had differing visions for Monaco. Onassis wished the country to remain a resort for an exclusive clientele, but Rainier wished to build hotels and attract a greater number of tourists. Monaco had become less attractive as a tax haven in the wake of France&#x27;s actions, and Rainier urged Onassis to invest in the construction of hotels. Onassis was reluctant to invest in hotels without a guarantee from Rainier that no other competing hotel development would be permitted, but promised to build two hotels and an apartment block. Unwilling to give Onassis his guarantee, Rainier used his veto to cancel the entire hotel project, and publicly attacked SBM for their &#x27;bad faith&#x27; on television, implicitly criticising Onassis. Rainier and Onassis remained at odds over the direction of the company for several years and in June 1966 Rainier approved a plan to create 600,000 new shares in SBM to be permanently held by the state, which reduced Onassis&#x27;s stake from 52% to under a third. In the Supreme Court of Monaco the share creation was challenged by Onassis who claimed that it was unconstitutional, but the court found against him in March 1967. Following the ruling Onassis sold his holdings in SBM to the state of Monaco and left the country. According to Frank Brady in &quot;Onassis: An Extravagant Life&quot;, Onassis&#x27;s words about the issue were: &quot;We were .&quot;

===Saudi Arabia===
During the oil boom of the 1950s Onassis was in final discussions with the King of Saudi Arabia for securing a tanker transport deal. Since the Arabian-American Oil Co. (currently, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, but still known as Aramco) had a monopoly on Saudi oil by a concession agreement, the US government was alarmed by the tanker deal. By 1954, a specific U.S. policy for Saudi Arabia, in addition to strengthening the US &quot;special position,&quot; was to take &quot;all appropriate measures to bring about the cancellation&quot; of an agreement between the Saudi government and Onassis to transport Saudi oil on his tankers and &quot;in any case, to make the agreement ineffective&quot;. [Doc. 128] The arrangement would have ended monopoly control of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s oil by American oil companies, but was forestalled by the US government. 
For this reason he became a target of the US government and in 1954, the FBI investigated Onassis for fraud against the U.S. government. He was charged with violating the citizenship provision of the shipping laws which require that all ships displaying the U.S. flag be owned by U.S. citizens. Onassis entered a guilty plea and paid $7 million.

=== Whaling ===
Between 1950 and 1956, Onassis had success whaling off the west coast of South America. His first expedition made a net profit of US$4.5 million. International agreements limited the number, size and dates between which whales could be taken. The Onassis factory ship and its attendant catcher ships paid little attention to these restrictions. &quot;The Norwegian Whaling Gazette&quot; made accusations based on sailors&#x27; testimonials, such as one given by Bruno Schalaghecke, who worked on the factory ship &quot;Olympic Challenger&quot;: &quot;Pieces of fresh meat from the 124 whales we killed yesterday still remains on the deck. Among them all, just one could be considered adult. All animals that pass within the range of the harpoon are killed in cold blood.&quot;

In 1954 the government of Peru claimed the Onassis fleet were whaling within of the coast of Peru without permission and sent naval vessels to intercept them. Peruvian air force planes were also sent and dropped bombs that exploded near the factory ship. Most vessels in the fleet were captured by the Peruvian vessels and taken to Payta where they were interned.

The venture came to an end after the business was sold to Kyokuyo Hogei Kaisha Whaling Company, one of the biggest Japanese whaling companies, for $8.5 million. Norwegian authorities suspected the involvement of Hjalmar Schacht in Onassis&#x27;s whaling enterprises. Schacht had previously been connected with Onassis&#x27;s Saudi Arabian deals.

=== Olympic Airways ===

In 1956, Greek airlines in general faced economic difficulties, whereby companies like TAE were affected by strikes and cash shortage. The Greek government decided to give this and other companies to the private sector, and, on 30 July 1956, Onassis signed a contract granting him the operational rights to the Greek air transport industry. When Onassis heard during the negotiations that he would not be able to use the five Olympic rings in his logo due to copyright issues, he simply decided to add a sixth ring.
Operation effectively started in 1957, with one DC-4, two DC-6s and 13 DC-3s. The following year saw 244,000 passengers transported. The agreement lasted until 10 December 1974, when a number of factors (namely, a series of strikes, shortage of passengers, fuel price increase, and a law from the new Greek government forbidding Olympic Airways to fire employees) led Onassis to terminate his contract.

Following this event, Paul Ioannidis, a high-ranking director from Olympic Airways, said the following of Onassis: &quot;Deep down, [he] did not want to relinquish Olympic Airways. He found it flattering to own an airline. It was something in which he took deep pride. It was his accomplishment. He was married to the sea, but Olympic was his mistress. We used to say that he would spend all the money he made at sea with his mistress in the sky.&quot;

Onassis&#x27;s time at the head of Olympic Airways is known as a golden era, due to investments he made in training and the acquisition of cutting-edge technology. For example, in 1959, he signed a deal with De Havilland to buy four Comet 4B jets. Onassis was also renowned for his attention to service quality, which led him to buy gold-plated utensils and candles for the dining service of the first-class section.

During 1974, the last year of Onassis&#x27;s involvement with the company, Olympic Airways transported 2.5 million passengers and had a work force of 7,356 persons. At the time, his ownership of Olympic Airways distinguished Onassis as one of only two men in the world to own a private airline, the other being Howard Hughes of TWA.

=== Investments ===

Onassis was involved in the privatization of the Greek national airline and founded the privatized Olympic Airways (today Olympic Air) in 1957.
Stocks accounted for one-third of his capital, held in oil companies in the United States, the Middle East, and Venezuela. He also owned additional shares that secured his control of 95 multinational businesses in five continents. He owned gold-processing plants in Argentina and Uruguay and a large share in an airline in Latin America and $4 million worth of investments in Brazil. Also, he owned companies like Olympic Maritime and Olympic Tourist; a chemical company in Persia; apartments in Paris, London, Monte Carlo, Athens, and Acapulco; a castle in South France; the Olympic Tower (a 52-storey high-rise in Manhattan); another building in Sutton Place; Olympic Airways and Air Navigation; the island of Skorpios; the luxury yacht &quot;Christina O&quot; and, finally, deposit accounts and accounts in treasuries in 217 banks in the whole world.

===Project Omega===
In October 1968, amidst the Greek military junta and shortly after his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, Onassis announced the launch of Project Omega, a $400 million investment program that aimed to build considerable industrial infrastructure in Greece including an oil refinery and aluminum smelter. Onassis had cultivated Greek junta dictator Georgios Papadopoulos, for his assistance with the scheme, loaning Papadopoulos the use of his villa and buying dresses for his wife. The project was financially supported by the American bank First National City, and Onassis&#x27;s American financial supporters eventually tired of the unfavourable terms demanded by him. The project was heavily criticized by people such as Helen Vlachos, a journalist from Athens. Another Greek Colonel, Nikolaos Makarezos, preferred a deal offered by Onassis&#x27;s rival, Stavros Niarchos, and the project was eventually split between them. The failure was due partly to opposition from influential people within the military junta, such as Ioannis-Orlandos Rodinos, Deputy Minister of Economic Coordination, who opposed Onassis&#x27;s offers in preference to Niarchos.

== Relationships and family ==
=== Athina Livanos ===
Onassis married Athina Mary &quot;Tina&quot; Livanos, daughter of shipping magnate Stavros G. Livanos and Arietta Zafiraki, on 28 December 1946. Livanos was 17 at the time of their marriage; Onassis was 40. Onassis and Livanos had two children, both born in New York City: a son, Alexander (1948–1973), and a daughter, Christina (1950–1988). Onassis named his legendary super-yacht after his daughter. To Onassis, his marriage to Athina was more than the fulfillment of his ambitions. He also felt that the marriage dealt a blow to his father-in-law and the old-money Greek traditionalists who held Onassis in very low esteem. The couple had been living separately, by the mid-1950s, with the beginning of the end of the marriage, according to Onassis&#x27; biographer, Peter Evens, coming after Livanos found Onassis in bed with a friend of hers at their home in Cap d&#x27;Antibes, the Château de la Croë. The house was, then, acquired by Onassis&#x27;s brother-in-law and business rival Stavros Niarchos, who bought it for his wife, Eugenia Livanos, Athina&#x27;s sister. Onassis and Livanos divorced in June 1960, during Onassis&#x27;s well publicised affair with Maria Callas.

=== Maria Callas ===
Onassis and legendary opera soprano Maria Callas carried on an affair, despite the fact that they were both married. They met in 1957, during a party in Venice promoted by Elsa Maxwell. After this first encounter, Onassis commented to Spyros Skouras: &quot;There [was] just a natural curiosity. After all, we were the most famous Greeks alive, in the world.&quot; Callas and Onassis both divorced their spouses but did not marry each other, although their relationship continued for many years.

=== Jacqueline Kennedy ===
Onassis was a friend of Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. They married on 20 October 1968 on Onassis&#x27;s private Greek island, Skorpios.

Before the marriage, an agreement was reached between Onassis and Ted Kennedy, Jacqueline&#x27;s former brother-in-law. Jacqueline would receive US $3 million, plus US $1 million for each of her two children, to compensate for the US $150,000 that she then received from the Kennedy family trust, which she would lose by re-marrying. Upon Onassis&#x27;s death, she would also continue to receive US $150,000, each year, for the rest of her life. 

After Onassis&#x27;s death, Christina settled with Jacqueline for $25 million, in exchange for her not contesting Onassis&#x27;s will.

During their marriage, the Onassises inhabited six residences: his apartment in Paris (88 Avenue Foch), her 15-room apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue in New York City, her horse farm in New Jersey, his house in Athens, his house on Skorpios and his yacht &quot;Christina O&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
Onassis died at age 69 on 15 March 1975 at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, of respiratory failure, a complication of the myasthenia gravis from which he had suffered the last years of his life. Onassis was buried on his island of Skorpios in Greece, alongside his son, Alexander, and his sister, Artemis. Onassis&#x27;s will established a charitable foundation in memory of his son, the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, which received 45% of Onassis&#x27;s estate. The remainder of his estate was left to his daughter, Christina. Christina&#x27;s share has since passed to her only child, Athina, at the time making Athina one of the wealthiest women in the world.

Jacqueline Onassis also received her share of the estate, settling for a reported $10 million ($26 million according to other sources), which was negotiated by her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy. This amount would reportedly grow to several hundred million, under the financial stewardship of her companion, Maurice Tempelsman.

The Boeing 727, which transported Onassis&#x27;s remains, was later purchased for US $100,000 by an American electrical engineer and turned into an unconventional private residence in Hillsboro, Oregon.

<doc id="155035" wikidata="Q151976" url="?curid=155035" title="Mikis Theodorakis">
<text>Michail &quot;Mikis&quot; Theodorakis ( ; 29 July 1925 – 2 September 2021) was a Greek composer and lyricist credited with over 1,000 works.

He scored for the films &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964), &quot;Z&quot; (1969), and &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973). He was a three-time BAFTA nominee, winning for &quot;Z&quot;. For the score in &quot;Serpico&quot;, he earned Grammy nominations. Furthermore, for the score to &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, with its song &quot;Zorba&#x27;s Dance&quot;, he was nominated for a Golden Globe. 

He composed the &quot;Mauthausen Trilogy&quot;, also known as &quot;The Ballad of Mauthausen&quot;, which has been described as the &quot;most beautiful musical work ever written about the Holocaust&quot; and possibly his best work. Up until his death, he was viewed as Greece&#x27;s best-known living composer. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.

Politically, he was associated with the left because of his long-standing ties to the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). He was an MP for the KKE from 1981 to 1990. Despite this, however, he ran as an independent candidate within the centre-right New Democracy party in 1989, in order for the country to emerge from the political crisis that had been created due to the numerous scandals of the government of Andreas Papandreou. He helped establish a large coalition between conservatives, socialists and leftists. In 1990, he was elected to the parliament (as in 1964 and 1981), became a government minister under Konstantinos Mitsotakis, and fought against drugs and terrorism and in favor of culture and education. He continued to speak out in favour of leftist causes, Greek–Turkish–Cypriot relations, and against the War in Iraq. He was a key voice against the 1967–1974 Greek junta, which imprisoned him and banned his songs.

Theodorakis was born on the Greek island of Chios and spent his childhood years in provincial Greek cities including Mytilene, Cephallonia, Patras, Pyrgos, and Tripoli. His father, a lawyer and a civil servant, was from the small village of Galatas on Crete and his mother, Aspasia Poulakis, was from an ethnically Greek family in Çeşme, in what is now Turkey. He was raised with Greek folk music and was influenced by Byzantine liturgy; as a child he had already talked about becoming a composer.

His fascination with music began in early childhood; he taught himself to write his first songs without access to musical instruments. He took his first music lessons in Patras and Pyrgos, where he was a childhood friend of George Pavlopoulos, and in Tripoli, Peloponnese, he gave his first concert at the age of seventeen. He went to Athens in 1943, and became a member of a Reserve Unit of ELAS. He led a troop in the fight against the British and the Greek right in the Dekemvriana. During the Greek Civil War he was arrested, sent into exile on the island of Icaria and then deported to the island of Makronisos, where he was tortured and twice buried alive.

During the periods when he was not obliged to hide, not exiled or jailed, he studied from 1943 to 1950 at the Athens Conservatoire under . In 1950, he finished his studies and took his last two exams &quot;with flying colours&quot;. He went to Crete, where he became the &quot;head of the Chania Music School&quot; and founded his first orchestra.

== Studies in Paris ==

In 1953, Theodorakis married Myrto Altinoglou. The following year, they travelled to Paris, where he entered the Conservatory and studied musical analysis under Olivier Messiaen and conducting under Eugene Bigot.

His symphonic works: a Piano concerto, his first suite, his first symphony, and his scores for the ballet: &quot;Greek Carnival, Le Feu aux Poudres, Les Amants de Teruel&quot;, received international acclaim. In 1957, he won the Gold Medal in the Moscow Music Festival. In 1959, after the successful performances of Theodorakis&#x27;s opera &quot;Antigone&quot; at Covent Garden in London, the French composer Darius Milhaud proposed him for the &quot;American Copley Music Prize&quot; – an award of the &quot;William and Noma Copley Foundation&quot;, which later changed its name to &quot;Cassandra Foundation&quot; as the &quot;Best European Composer of the Year&quot;. His first international scores for the film &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Honeymoon&quot; (aka &quot;Luna de Miel&quot;), directors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, were successful: &quot;The Honeymoon Song&quot;, title song of the later, became part of the repertoire of The Beatles.

== Back to Greek roots ==
In 1960, Theodorakis returned to Greece and his roots in Greek music. With his song cycle &quot;Epitaphios&quot;, he contributed to a cultural revolution in his country. His most significant and influential works are based on Greek and world poetry – &quot;Epiphania&quot; (Giorgos Seferis), &quot;Little Kyklades&quot; (Odysseas Elytis), &quot;Axion Esti&quot; (Elytis), &quot;Mauthausen&quot; (Iakovos Kambanellis), &quot;Romiossini&quot; (Yannis Ritsos), and &quot;Romancero Gitano&quot; (Federico García Lorca) – he attempted to give back to Greek music a dignity which in his perception it had lost. He developed his concept of &quot;metasymphonic music&quot; (symphonic compositions that go beyond the &quot;classical&quot; status and mix symphonic elements with popular songs, Western symphonic orchestra and Greek popular instruments).

He founded the &quot;Athens Little Symphony Orchestra&quot; and gave many concerts in the country, trying to familiarize people with symphonic music.

After the assassination of Gregoris Lambrakis in May 1963 he founded the &quot;Lambrakis Democratic Youth&quot; (&quot;Lambrákides&quot;) and was elected its president. Under Theodorakis&#x27;s impetus, it started a vast cultural renaissance movement and became the greatest political organisation in Greece with more than 50,000 members. Following the 1964 elections, Theodorakis became a member of the Greek Parliament, associated with the left-wing party EDA. Because of his political ideas, the composer was black-listed by the cultural establishment; at the time of his biggest artistic glory, a large number of his songs were censored-before-studio or were not allowed on the radio stations.

During 1964, he wrote the music for the Michael Cacoyiannis film &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, whose main theme, since then, exists as a trademark for Greece. It is also known as &quot;Syrtaki dance&quot;, inspired by old Cretan traditional dances.

== During the dictatorship ==

On 21 April 1967 the Regime of the Colonels took power in a putsch. Theodorakis was a symbol of resistance to the military regime. He went into hiding, issued the first call for resistance against the dictatorship on 23 April. and founded the (PAM). On 1 June, the Colonels published &quot;Army decree No 13&quot;, which banned playing, and even listening to his music. Theodorakis was arrested on 21 August, and jailed for five months. He was released at the end of January 1968, and then deported in August to Zatouna with his wife, Myrto, and their two children, Margarita and . Later he was interned in the concentration camp of Oropos.

An international solidarity movement, headed by such personalities as Dmitri Shostakovich, Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Miller, and Harry Belafonte demanded to get Theodorakis freed. On request of the French politician Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, Theodorakis was allowed to go into exile to Paris on 13 April 1970. Theodorakis&#x27; flight left secretly from an Onassis-owned private airport outside Athens. He arrived at Le Bourget Airport where he met Costa Gavras, Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin. Theodorakis was immediately hospitalized with tuberculosis. His wife and children joined him a week later in France, having travelled from Greece via Italy on a boat.

He would compose, alongside Pagani, the anthem of the French Socialist Party, in 1977.

== Resistance in exile ==
In 1971, Mikis Theodorakis was invited to Chile by then-president Salvador Allende. In Valparaíso, he listened to a group of young people who introduced him to part of the work of the poet Pablo Neruda. Theodorakis loved it and promised to give Chile his musical opinion on the &quot;Canto General&quot;. Back to Paris, in 1972 Theodorakis met Pablo Neruda when the Greek composer was rehearsing the musicalization of &quot;Canto General&quot;. Neruda was impressed and asked him to include poems such as &quot;Lautaro&quot; and &quot;A Emiliano Zapata&quot;.

He was received by Gamal Abdel Nasser and Tito, Yigal Allon and Yasser Arafat, while François Mitterrand, Olof Palme and Willy Brandt became his friends. For millions of people, Theodorakis was the symbol of resistance against the Greek dictatorship together with Melina Mercouri.

== Return to Greece ==
After the fall of the colonels, Mikis Theodorakis returned to Greece on 24 July 1974 to continue his work and his concert tours, both in Greece and abroad. His return was in triumph, with huge crowds and his music playing on the radio. At the same time he participated in public affairs. In 1978, through his article &quot;For a United Left Wing&quot;, he had &quot;stirred up the Greek political life. His proposal for the unification of the three parties of the former United Left (Greece)—which had grown out of the National Liberation Front—had been accepted by the Greek Communist Party which later proposed him as the candidate for mayor of Athens during the 1978 elections.&quot; (Andreas Brandes) He was later elected several times to the Greek Parliament (1981–1986 and 1989–1993) and for two years, from 1990 to 1992, he was a minister in the government of Constantine Mitsotakis. After his resignation as a member of Greek parliament, he was appointed General Musical Director of the Choir and the two Orchestras of the Hellenic State Radio (ERT), which he reorganised and with which he undertook successful concert tours abroad.

He was committed to raising international awareness of human rights, environmental issues, and the need for peace. For this reason, he initiated, along with the Turkish author, musician, singer and filmmaker Zülfü Livaneli, the Greek–Turkish Friendship Society.

From 1981, Theodorakis had started the &quot;fourth period&quot; of his musical writing, during which he returned to the symphonic music, while still going on to compose song-cycles. His most significant works written in these years are his &quot;Second&quot;, &quot;Third&quot;, &quot;Fourth&quot;, and &quot;Seventh Symphony&quot;, most of them being first performed in the former German Democratic Republic between 1982 and 1989. It was during this period that he received the Lenin Peace Prize. He composed his first opera Kostas Kariotakis (The Metamorphoses of Dionysus) and the ballet Zorba the Greek, premièred in the Arena of Verona during the Festival Verona 1988. During this period, he also wrote the five volumes of his autobiography: &quot;The Ways of the Archangel&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

In 1989, he started the &quot;fifth period&quot;, the last, of his musical writing: He composed three operas (lyric tragedies) &quot;Medea&quot;, first performed in Bilbao (1 October 1991), &quot;Elektra&quot;, first performed in Luxembourg (2 May 1995) and &quot;Antigone&quot;, first performed in Athens Concert Hall (7 October 1999). This trilogy was complemented by his last opera &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, first performed in Athens (14 April 2002): a call for peace... With his operas, and with his song cycles from 1974 to 2006, Theodorakis ushered in the period of his &quot;Lyrical Life&quot;.

In March 1997, gave a concert at the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt. Afterwards he was hospitalized due to respiratory difficulties and it was when he declared that this was his last concert.
Theodorakis was Doctor honoris causa of several universities.

== Later life and death ==
He later lived in retirement, reading, writing, publishing arrangements of his scores, texts about culture and politics. On occasions he took position: in 1999, opposing NATO&#x27;s Kosovo war and in 2003 against the Iraq War. In 2005, he was awarded the &quot;Sorano Friendship and Peace Award&quot;, the Russian &quot;International St.-Andrew-the-First-Called Prize&quot;, the insignia of &quot;Grand Officer of the Order of Merit&quot; of Luxembourg, and the &quot;IMC UNESCO International Music Prize&quot;, while already in 2002 he was honoured in Bonn with the &quot;Erich Wolfgang Korngold Prize&quot; for film music at the International Film Music Biennial in Bonn (cf also: Homepage of the Art and Exhibition Hall Bonn). In 2007, he received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the distribution of the &quot;World Soundtrack Awards&quot; in Ghent.

A final set of songs titled: &quot;Odysseia&quot; was composed by utilizing poetry written by Costas Kartelias for lyrics. In 2009 he composed a Rhapsody for Strings (Mezzo-Soprano or Baryton ad lib.). Created on 30 January 2013, Theodorakis achieved the distinction of producing one of the largest works by any composer of any time.

On 26 February 2019, Theodorakis was hospitalized with heart problems. On 8 March, he underwent surgery for a pacemaker. He died of cardiopulmonary arrest at his home in Athens on 2 September 2021, at the age of 96. The Greek Prime Minister declared three days of national mourning to honour him, and his body lay in state in the chapel of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, with thousands of people, including artists, as well as political leaders from all Greek parties paying their last respects. Epitaphs were delivered by the president of the Hellenic Republic, Aikaterini Sakellaropoulou, and the general secretary of the Communist Party of Greece, Dimitrios Koutsoumbas. Afterwards, according to his will, his body was transferred by boat overnight to be buried in his hometown of Galatas, near Chania, Crete, where his parents and brother were buried. 

==Political views==
===Israel and Jews===
Theodorakis opposed Israel&#x27;s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. He criticised Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou for establishing closer relations with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was guilty, he said, of &quot;war crimes in Lebanon and Gaza.&quot; Theodorakis was a vocal critic of Zionism, and referred to himself as an &quot;anti-Zionist.&quot; In 2003, he stated, &quot;Everything that happens today in the world has to do with the Zionists ... American Jews are behind the world economic crisis that has hit Greece as well.&quot; He was accused of saying that &quot;this small nation (Israel) is the root of evil&quot;. Theodorakis later clarified his comments, stating in a letter to the Central Council of Jews in Greece that what he had said was: &quot;Unfortunately the state of Israel supports the United States and their foreign policy, which is the root of the Evil and, therefore, it is close to the root of the Evil.” He was also accused of having admitted his anti-Semitism during an interview on Greek TV on 8 February 2011. His controversial statement on television had been: “I should clarify that I am anti-Semite. Essentially, I love the Jewish people, I love the Jews, I have lived long with them but as much as I hate anti-Semitism, I hate Zionism even more so”, being &quot;I am anti-Semite&quot; an obvious slip of the tongue for &quot;anti-Zionist&quot;. In 2013, he condemned Golden Dawn for Holocaust denial.

===Views of the United States===
Theodorakis was a long-time critic of the United States foreign policy. During the invasion of Iraq, he called Americans &quot;detestable, ruthless cowards and murderers of the people of the world&quot;. He said he would consider anyone who interacted with &quot;these barbarians&quot;, for whatever reason, as his enemy. Theodorakis greatly opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav Wars. He participated in a charity concert protesting the bombing in 1999.

===2010–2011: Non-political movement===
On 1 December 2010, Mikis Theodorakis founded &quot;Spitha: People&#x27;s Independent Movement&quot;, a non-political movement which calls people to gather and express their political ideas. The main goal of &quot;Spitha&quot; is to help Greece stay clear of its economic crisis. On 31 May 2011, Theodorakis gave a speech attended by approximately 10,000 people in the center of Athens, criticising the Greek government for the loan debt it has taken from the International Monetary Fund.

===Positions on Macedonia===
In 1997 Mikis Theodorakis stated on the Macedonian issue that &quot;The name does not matter so much, as long as the peoples live in peace&quot;. Later, in an interview, he stressed &quot;In fact, this country is being pushed towards improving relations with Greece. So why shouldn&#x27;t it be possible for our relations to prosper at all levels and whatever comes up? The Customs Union, confederation, etc. are just conditions. In any case, I think that the name issue will be overcome when the relations between the two peoples reach such a point that the name will not matter at all&quot;.

Theodorakis was one of the main speakers at the Rally for Macedonia in Athens, which took place on 4 February 2018. In his speech, he stated that &quot;Macedonia is one, was, is and will always be Greek.&quot; The statements garnered support from parties in parliament, while even Golden Dawn MPs welcomed Mikis Theodorakis&#x27; shift on the name of Macedonia. Members of SYRIZA and Yiannis Boutaris commented negatively on Theodorakis&#x27; statements. Also, the day before the rally, a group of anarchists threw paint at the entrance of his house and then wrote threatening messages, such as: &quot;Your story starts from the mountain and ends in the national swamp of Syntagma Square.

<text>DAS Air Cargo was a Ugandan cargo airline based at Entebbe as Dairoo Air Services. It operated all-cargo services between Europe and 20 cities throughout Africa, the Middle East and the Far East. Entebbe was a major hub for business in east and southern Africa and also for flights from Bangkok which stage through Dubai. Its main bases were London Gatwick Airport and Entebbe International Airport, with hubs at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi, Dubai International Airport and Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. The European office was at Crawley, England

==History==
The airline was established in 1983 in Ghana and started operations in June 1983. It initially provided ad hoc charters and wet-lease flying for established operators. In 1987 it began regular cargo services between London and Lagos and Entebbe. In 1990, the DAS Air Cargo USA division was opened to operate cargo operations there for the airline. The division was based in Miami, Florida, and shared its offices with DAS Air Cargo&#x27;s main business partner, passenger charter airline First Choice Airways-another airline which later went bankrupt.

DAS Air Cargo also had an EASA 145 approved maintenance facility at Kent International Airport in the UK. The facility was used for maintenance on their own aircraft as well as those of World Airways, Gemini Air Cargo and Avient Aviation.

In 2006 DAS Air Cargo was banned from conducting flights within the European Union. On 6 March 2007, the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, removed DAS Air Cargo from its list of banned aircraft after they made safety improvements.

The company called in the administrators on 17 September 2007 and all flying stopped. Their aircraft were stored at Manston, England, which subsequently closed in 2015.

On 20 November 2007, it was announced on that Continental Aviation Services (Nigeria) Ltd bought all of the business and assets (including the sole remaining DC-10), however the liabilities remain with Das Air Ltd.

<text>Odysseas Elytis (; , pen name of Odysseas Alepoudellis, ; 2 November 1911 – 18 March 1996) was a Greek poet, man of letters, essayist and translator, regarded as the definitive exponent of romantic modernism in Greece and the world. He is one of the most praised poets of the second half of the twentieth century, with his &quot;Axion Esti&quot; &quot;regarded as a monument of contemporary poetry&quot;. In 1979, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Biography==
Descendants of the Alepoudelis, whose name going back was Alepos and even further back connected to the revolutionary Lemonis in Lesbos, Panayiotis Alepoudelis and his younger brother Thrasyboulos were both born in the village Kalamiaris of Panagiouthas of Lesbos. Their family had become well-established the industries of soap manufacturing and olive oil production in Heraklion, Crete in 1895. In 1897 Panagyiotis married Maria E. Vrana (1880-1960) from the village Papados of Geras, Lesbos. From this union and as the last of six siblings, Odysseas was born in the early hours of 2 November 1911. He is pictured on the far left wearing a sailor&#x27;s uniform in the photo of his family. The Alepoudelis later moved to Athens, where his father re-situated the soap factory in Piraeus. In 1918 his older sister and first born Myrsene (1898-1918) died in the Spanish influenza. While on summer holidays from their Athens home as guests on the island of Spetses in the Haramis home in the St Nicolaos neighbourhood his own father also died in the summer of 1925 from pneumonia. His father Panayiotis may have been the inspiration for Elytis to write. Apparently his father wrote poetry and it remained unpublished. In 1927 wrought with overtiredness Odysseas was diagnosed with tuberculosis. While in bed recuperating he voraciously read all the Greek poetry he could and in this year discovered Cavafy. In 1928 he graduated from high school and successfully passed the difficult entrance exams to law school at University of Athens. He read in the newspapers of the suicide of the poet Karyiotakis. In 1929 Elytis took a sabbatical between high school and university and decided secretly that he must only become a poet. In 1930 he and his family moved to Moshoniseon 148. Elytis had initial aspirations to become a lawyer but did not sit for his final examinations and did not get his legal qualification. He also had expressed aspirations to become a painter in the manner of the surrealists but his family quickly thwarted this idea. Around this timeframe Elytis noticed and noted that the month surrounding the Ides Of March was not good for him and was cautious while tracking it for the rest of his life.

In 1935 Elytis published his first poem in the journal &quot;New Letters&quot; (&quot;Νέα Γράμματα&quot;) at the prompting of such friends as George Seferis. In the same year he also became a lifelong friend of writer and psychoanalyst Andreas Embirikos, who allowed him to have access to his vast library of books. In 1977, two years after the death of his friend, Elytis wrote a tribute book to Embiricos from within the commonalities that founded their ideas aptly titled &quot;Reference to Andreas Embiricos&quot; and originally published by Tram publishers Thessaloniki. His entry to the magazine &quot;New Letters&quot; in 1935 was in November which was the 11th issue and with his pseudonym Elytis established therein. With a distinctively earthy and original form in his expression, Elytis assisted inaugurating a new era in Greek poetry and its subsequent reform after the Second World War. In 1960 his older brother Constantine (1905-1960) died, followed by his mother, Maria Vrana Alepoudelis. Elytis was simultaneously awarded the First National Prize for poetry for his work &quot;Axion Esti&quot;. 

In 1967 Elytis travelled to Egypt, visiting Alexandria, Cairo, Luxor and Aswan. Returning to Greece in March, he finished his piecing together of the fragments of Sappho&#x27;s verses translated into modern Greek and brought them together with his own diaphanous iconography. These were published finally in 1984 without the drawings which are deposited separately in the archives of the American School of Classical Studies along with the original manuscripts of the initial translations of Sappho. With the April 21st military dictatorship in force, Elytis disappeared from public view.At the time of the dictatorship he lived at Skoufa 26 and upon his return from Paris in 1972 he moved to Skoufa 23 to a fifth floor apartment, his final residence in Athens before he died. 

From 1969 to 1972, under the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, Elytis exiled himself to Paris after he refused money from the junta and established a modest residence there. In Paris he lived with Marianina Kriezi (1947-2022), who subsequently produced and hosted the legendary children&#x27;s radio broadcast &quot;Here Lilliput Land&quot;. Kriezi was extraordinary, having published a book of poems at the age of fourteen. The title of The book was &quot;Rhythms and Beats&quot; and she sent a first edition copy to George Seferis along with a hand written letter asking him to write a page of his poetry in long hand in fountain pen and gift it to her. Apparently she was going to put across from her bed and see it every morning when she awoke for the rest of her life treasuring the words of poetry. The irony is that she met up with Elytis who was in contrast to the cerebral Seferis, unmarried and a poet of the senses. There is speculation that Kriezi and Elytis were secretly married in Paris but with their return to Greece their French marriage was invalidated and they separated, never divorcing. When Elytis died, however, he was buried wearing the silver wedding band that had the name &quot;Marianina&quot; engraved inside it.Kriezi died suddenly at the start of the year 2022 at the age of seventy six and the Greek parliament stood in a three minutes silence for her contributions to Hellenic civilization via her radio blockbuster &quot;Here Lilliput&quot;.Her circumstances were not reported but she died in impoverished circumstances. The silver ring is on the cover of &quot;Analogies of Light&quot; within a picture that shows only the author&#x27;s hands writing inside a book. Ivar Ivask also noted the presence of the photo of Kriezi [a muse inside a silver frame across from the photo of his mother] in the home of Elytis when editing the aforementioned book. On the day he died three photographs of women that he had loved and influenced him were in his small apartment. In his bedroom the black and white photo of his mother was by his left bedside table and the photo of Kriezi taken in Paris in the late sixties was across from his bed on the left entering from the living room. In the living room on top of the fancy dresser drawers was a colour photo of Anita Mozas (born in Toronto in 1957) who had first met the poet in 1973 and then interviewed him for the CBC radio in early 1980. Elytis made her his authorized biographer in 1987 and stated she understood him as Dora Maar had understood Picasso. Francoise Gilot supported the decision of Elytis to make Anita Mozas his biographer after having met her and become friends with her. 

===The war===
In 1937 he served his military requirements. As an army cadet, he joined the National Military School in Corfu. He assisted Frederica of Hanover off the train and on to Greek soil personally when she arrived from Germany to marry hereditary Prince Paul. During the war he was appointed Second Lieutenant, placed initially at the 1st Army Corps Headquarters, then transferred to the 24th Regiment, on the first-line of the battlefields. In 1941, he contracts an acute case of typhus abdominalis and is transferred to the Ioanina Hospital into the pathology unit for officers. Elytis came very close to his death here and was given the options between staying at the hospital and be a prisoner when the Germans fully invaded and occupied Greece, or be transferred with the risk of intestinal perforation and hemorrhage. On the eve of the invasion of the German armies, he decided to be transferred to Aigrinio and from there eventually back to Athens where he made a slow but steady recovery during the German occupation. He began to outline poetry for his eventual work &quot;Sun The First&quot;; in Alexandria Seferis delivered a lecture on Elytis and Antoniou. Elytis was sporadically publishing poetry and essays after his initial foray into the literary world.

He was a member of the Association of Greek Art Critics, AICA-Hellas, International Association of Art Critics.

===Programme director for ERT===
He was twice Programme Director of the Greek National Radio Foundation (1945–46 and 1953–54), Member of the Greek National Theatre&#x27;s Administrative Council, President of the Administrative Council of the Greek Radio and Television as well as Member of the Consultative Committee of the Greek National Tourists&#x27; Organisation on the &quot;Athens Festival&quot;. In 1960 he was awarded the First State Poetry Prize, in 1965 the Order of the Phoenix and in 1975 he was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa in the Faculty of Philosophy at Thessaloniki University and received the Honorary Citizenship of the Town of Mytilene.

===Travels===
In 1948–1952 and 1969–1972 he lived in Paris. There, he audited philology and literature seminars at the Sorbonne and was well received by the pioneers of the world&#x27;s avant-garde (Reverdy, Breton, Tzara, Ungaretti, Matisse, Picasso, Francoise Gilot, Chagall, Giacometti) as Tériade&#x27;s most respected friend. Teriade was simultaneously in Paris publishing works with all the renowned artists and philosophers (Kostas Axelos, Jean-Paul Sartre, Francoise Gilot, René Daumal) of the time. Elytis and Teriade had formed a strong friendship that solidified in 1939 with the publication of Elytis first book of poetry entitled &quot;Orientations&quot;. Both Elytis and Teriade hailed from Lesbos and had a mutual love of the Greek painter Theophilos. Starting from Paris he travelled and subsequently visited Switzerland, England, Italy and Spain. In 1948 he was the representative of Greece at the &quot;International Meetings of Geneva&quot;, in 1949 at the Founding Congress of the &quot;International Art Critics Union&quot; in Paris and in 1962 at the &quot;Incontro Romano della Cultura&quot; in Rome.

In 1961, upon an invitation of the State Department, he traveled through the USA from March to June to New York Washington New Orleans Santa Fe Los Angeles San Francisco Boston Buffalo Chicago His return was to Paris to meet up with Teriade and then to Greece — Upon similar invitations in 1962 with Andreas Embiricos and Yiorgos Theotokas (1905-1966) through the Soviet Union to Odessa Moscow and Leningrad. Elytis did not like Yevgeny Yevtushenko when they were introduced but appreciated Voznesensky That summer he spent part of his holidays on Corfu Island and the rest on Lesbos where he and Teriade, who had returned from Paris, were establishing the foundations of a museum dedicated to the painter Theophilos. In 1964 the inaugural performance of the oratorio to the poetry of the &quot;Axion Esti&quot; as set to music by MIkis Theodorakis was held. In 1965 he completes the essays that will be comprised as the book &quot;The Open Papers&quot; and in that summer visits the Greek islands yet again. He visited Bulgaria in 1965 with his friend Yiorgos Theotokas on the invitation of the Union of Bulgarian Authors; it would be their final journey together as Theotokas would die in October 1966. Their guide throughout this country was the poet Elisaveta Bagryana (1893-1991), who had been nominated three times until then for the Nobel prize in Literature. In 1965 he was also bestowed with the Phoenix Cross, the highest honour of the Greek nation.

Elytis was a believer and follower of numerology in all its forms: Biblical, Kabbalah, Chaldean and Pythagorean. He also believed in vedic astrology and held certain beliefs of Hinduism to be true. Pablo Picasso had given him three instructions about the course of life which he attempted to uphold sacrosanct. Elytis was beset with the untimely death of friends and relatives throughout his life: Yiorgos Theotokas, George Seferis, Andreas Embiricos, George Sarandaris. Of all the deaths that happened, Karydis, his publisher at Ikaros, shook him up the most. Elytis had cordial relations with Yiannis Ritsos and close ties with his best friend Nikos Gatsos, both poets of the same generation.

===Death===

Odysseas Elytis had been completing plans to travel overseas to see friends when he died of a heart failure in Athens on 18 March 1996, at the age of 84. He had made it known that he was a believer in cremation and had wished that somehow he could have been cremated which the tenets of his Greek Orthodox religion do not support or allow. He was also a supporter of the legalization of euthanasia for people who wished to die after pain and suffering. Furthermore, he believed it was a woman&#x27;s right to choose abortion in any circumstance.

In the last ten years of his life he lived with a companion, Sofia Iliopoulou, who was 53 years his junior. Iliopoulou is an activist for children throughout the world imparting her knowledge whenever she is able to. She is a successful artist in her own right, translating and composing her own works and giving poetry recitals at the Theocharakis Foundation in Athens. 

The funeral was held the next day after his death. The funeral was jammed with people who had loved his poetry. He was buried in a family grave beside his family, including his mother and brother.

Iliopoulou, as his life partner, inherited the immovable property in real estate of Elytis which consisted of four apartments and the trustee power of copyrights to his work. She has been promoting Elytis with excellence in his legacy. Elytis was survived in his bloodline by his niece Myrsene (from his oldest brother Theodoros born 1900) and his next in line older brother Evangelos. This brother (born 1909-2002) also received a writ of condolence from the mayor of Athens on behalf of the nation at the funeral at the First Cemetery of Athens.

==Poetry==
Elytis&#x27; poetry has marked, through an active presence of over forty years, a broad spectrum of subject matter and stylistic touch with an emphasis on the expression of that which is rarefied and passionate. He borrowed certain elements from Ancient Greece and Byzantium but devoted himself exclusively to today&#x27;s Hellenism, of which he attempted—in a certain way based on psychical and sentimental aspects—to reconstruct a modernist mythology for the institutions. His main endeavour was to rid people&#x27;s conscience from unjustifiable remorses and to complement natural elements through ethical powers, to achieve the highest possible transparency in expression and finally, to succeed in approaching the mystery of light, &quot;the metaphysics of the sun&quot; of which he was a &quot;worshiper&quot; -&quot;idolater&quot; by his own definition. A parallel manner concerning technique resulted in introducing the &quot;inner architecture&quot;, which is evident in a great many poems of his; mainly in the phenomenal landmark work &quot;It Is Truly Meet&quot; (&quot;Το Άξιον Εστί&quot;). This work due to its setting to music by Mikis Theodorakis as an oratorio, is a revered anthem whose verse is sung by all Greeks for all injustice, resistance and for its sheer beauty and musicality of form. Elytis&#x27; theoretical and philosophical ideas have been expressed in a series of essays under the title &quot;The Open Papers&quot; (&quot;Ανοιχτά Χαρτιά&quot;). Besides creating poetry he applied himself to translating poetry and theatre as well as a series of collage pictures. Translations of his poetry have been published as autonomous books, in anthologies or in periodicals in eleven languages.

<doc id="155038" wikidata="Q165823" url="?curid=155038" title="Giorgos Seferis">
<text>Giorgos or George Seferis (; ), the pen name of Georgios Seferiadis (Γεώργιος Σεφεριάδης; March 13 – September 20, 1971), was a Greek poet and diplomat. He was one of the most important Greek poets of the 20th century, and a Nobel laureate.

He was a career diplomat in the Greek Foreign Service, culminating in his appointment as Ambassador to the UK, a post which he held from 1957 to 1962.

==Biography==
Seferis was born in Vourla near Smyrna in Asia Minor, in the Aidin Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (now İzmir, Turkey). His father, Stelios Seferiadis, was a lawyer, and later a professor at the University of Athens, as well as a poet and translator in his own right. He was also a staunch Venizelist and a supporter of the demotic Greek language over the formal, official language (katharevousa). Both of these attitudes influenced his son. In 1914 the family moved to Athens, where Seferis completed his secondary school education. He continued his studies in Paris from 1918 to 1925, studying law at the Sorbonne. While he was there, in September 1922, Smyrna/Izmir was taken by the Turkish Army after a two-year Greek military campaign on Anatolian soil. Many Greeks, including Seferis&#x27;s family, fled from Asia Minor. Seferis would not visit Smyrna again until 1950; the sense of being an exile from his childhood home would inform much of Seferis&#x27;s poetry, showing itself particularly in his interest in the story of Odysseus. Seferis was also greatly influenced by Kavafis, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.

He returned to Athens in 1925 and was admitted to the Royal Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the following year. This was the beginning of a long and successful diplomatic career, during which he held posts in England (1931–1934) and Albania (1936–1938). He married Maria Zannou (&#x27;Maro&#x27;) on April 10, 1941 on the eve of the German invasion of Greece. During the Second World War, Seferis accompanied the Free Greek Government in exile to Crete, Egypt, South Africa, and Italy, and returned to liberated Athens in 1944. He continued to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and held diplomatic posts in Ankara, Turkey (1948–1950) and London (1951–1953). He was appointed minister to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq (1953–1956), and was Royal Greek Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1961, the last post before his retirement in Athens. Seferis received many honours and prizes, among them honorary doctoral degrees from the universities of Cambridge (1960), Oxford (1964), Thessaloniki (1964), and Princeton (1965).

===Cyprus===
Seferis first visited Cyprus in November 1953. He immediately fell in love with the island, partly because of its resemblance, in its landscape, the mixture of populations, and in its traditions, to his childhood summer home in Skala (Urla). His book of poems &quot;Imerologio Katastromatos III&quot; was inspired by the island, and mostly written there–bringing to an end a period of six or seven years in which Seferis had not produced any poetry. Its original title &quot;Cyprus, where it was ordained for me...&quot; (a quotation from Euripides&#x27; &quot;Helen&quot; in which Teucer states that Apollo has decreed that Cyprus shall be his home) made clear the optimistic sense of homecoming Seferis felt on discovering the island. Seferis changed the title in the 1959 edition of his poems.

Politically, Cyprus was entangled in the dispute between the UK, Greece and Turkey over its international status. Over the next few years, Seferis made use of his position in the diplomatic service to strive towards a resolution of the Cyprus dispute, investing a great deal of personal effort and emotion. This was one of the few areas in his life in which he allowed the personal and the political to mix. Seferis described his political principles as &quot;liberal and democratic [or republican].&quot;

===Nobel Prize===
In 1963, Seferis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;for his eminent lyrical writing, inspired by a deep feeling for the Hellenic world of culture.&quot; Seferis was nominated in total four times for the Nobel Prize. Romilly Jenkins nominated him in 1955, T.S. Eliot nominated him in 1961, Eyvind Johnson and Athanasius Trypanis Trypanis both nominated in 1962 and it was the 1963 nomination again by Eyvind Johnson that won him the prize. Seferis was the first Greek to receive the prize (followed later by Odysseas Elytis, who became a Nobel laureate in 1979). But in his acceptance speech, Seferis chose rather to emphasise his own humanist philosophy, concluding: &quot;When on his way to Thebes Oedipus encountered the Sphinx, his answer to its riddle was: &#x27;Man&#x27;. That simple word destroyed the monster. We have many monsters to destroy. Let us think of the answer of Oedipus.&quot; While Seferis has sometimes been considered a nationalist poet, his &#x27;Hellenism&#x27; had more to do with his identifying a unifying strand of humanism in the continuity of Greek culture and literature. The other five finalists for the prize that year were W. H. Auden, Pablo Neruda (1971 winner), Samuel Beckett (1969 winner), Yukio Mishima and Aksel Sandemose.

===Later life===
In 1967 the repressive nationalist, right-wing Regime of the Colonels took power in Greece after a coup d&#x27;état. After two years marked by widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, Seferis took a stand against the regime. On March 28, 1969, he made a statement on the BBC World Service, with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in Athens. In authoritative and absolute terms, he stated &quot;This anomaly must end&quot;.

Seferis did not live to see the end of the junta in 1974 as a direct result of Turkey&#x27;s invasion of Cyprus, which had itself been prompted by the junta&#x27;s attempt to overthrow Cyprus&#x27;s president, Archbishop Makarios. He died in Athens, on September 20, 1971. The cause of death was reported to be pneumonia, aggravated by a stroke he had suffered after undergoing surgery for a bleeding ulcer about two months earlier.

At his funeral, huge crowds followed his coffin through the streets of Athens, singing Mikis Theodorakis&#x27; setting of Seferis&#x27;s poem &#x27;Denial&#x27; (then banned); he had become a popular hero for his resistance to the regime. He is buried at the First Cemetery of Athens.

==Legacy==

His house at Pangrati district of central Athens, just next to the Panathinaiko Stadium of Athens, still stands today at Agras Street.

There are commemorative blue plaques on two of his London homes – 51 Upper Brook Street (residence of the Greek Ambassador), and at 7 Sloane Avenue.

In 1999, there was a dispute over the naming of a street in İzmir &quot;Yorgos Seferis Sokagi&quot; due to continuing ill-feeling over the Greco-Turkish War in the early 1920s.

In 2004, the band Sigmatropic released &quot;16 Haiku &amp; Other Stories,&quot; an album dedicated to and lyrically derived from Seferis&#x27;s work. Vocalists included recording artists Laetitia Sadier, Alejandro Escovedo, Cat Power, and Robert Wyatt. Seferis&#x27;s famous stanza from &quot;Mythistorema&quot; was featured in the Opening Ceremony of the 2004 Athens Olympic Games:

&quot;I woke with this marble head in my hands;&quot;
&quot;It exhausts my elbows and I don&#x27;t know where to put it down.&quot;
&quot;It was falling into the dream as I was coming out of the dream.&quot;
&quot;So our life became one and it will be very difficult for it to separate again.&quot;

Stephen King quotes several of Seferis&#x27;s poems as epigraphs in his 1975 novel &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;.

The composer Richard Causton wrote a piece for solo flute, &quot;Sleep&quot;, which is inspired by &quot;Mythistorema&quot;.

<text>An opera house is a theater building used for performances of opera. Like many theaters, it usually includes a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, backstage facilities for costumes and building sets, as well as offices for the institution&#x27;s administration.

While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. Indeed, the term &quot;opera house&quot; is often used as a term of prestige for any large performing arts center.

==History==

===Greco-Roman antiquity===
Based on Aristoxenus&#x27;s musical system, and paying homage to the architects of ancient Greek theater, Vitruvius described, in the 1st century BC, in his treatise &quot;De architectura&quot;, the ideal acoustics of theaters. He explained the use of brazen vases that Mummius had brought to Rome after having had the theater of Corinth demolished, and as they were probably used in the Theater of Pompey. As wooden theaters were naturally sonorous, these vases, placed between the seats on the stands, served as resonators in the stone buildings: &quot;By means of this arrangement, the voice, which will come from the stage as from a center, will extend in circles, will strike in the cavities of the vases, and will be made stronger and clearer, according to the relationship of consonance that it will have with one of these vases.&quot; The odeon built by Pericles near the Theater of Dionysus in Athens was, according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, intended for the rehearsal of music that was to be sung in the grand theater or, according to Plutarch, for the jury to audition musicians competing for a prize.

Ancient theaters provided the ideal conditions, but it was not yet time for opera: the aim was to worship the deities, not to venerate the muses. The subject was religious, it was accompanied by singing and instrumental music. Worship was public, and the audience was made up of citizens as well as other categories of the population. Four centuries later, the Church abandoned spectacles as practiced in Antiquity. Histrions, representative of Greco-Roman civilization, gradually disappeared.

===Middle Ages===
The Middle Ages saw the abandonment of ancient theaters, which were transformed into gigantic stone quarries, like many other ancient buildings, both public or private. Music still had its place in worship. It continued to bring audiences together, but its content was completely renewed. The &quot;Jeu de Daniel&quot; (&quot;Play of Daniel&quot;) was a sung play, characteristic of the medieval Renaissance of the 12th century. The subject, taken from the biblical Book of Daniel, deals with Israel&#x27;s captivity in Babylon. The play was written and performed by students of the Episcopal School of Beauvais, located in northern France. In the 15th century, sung theater of a religious nature found a special place in the mystery plays performed on cathedral squares. As before, they dealt with sacred subjects, but they were not about worship per se. Secular musical theater also existed, but had a more popular and intimate aspect (see, for example, Adam de la Halle&#x27;s &quot;Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot; (&quot;Play of Robin and Marion&quot;), in the 13th century).

===Modern period===
At the beginning of the 17th century, in Italy, singing underwent yet another renewal, with the emergence of Baroque art at the height of the Renaissance. Italy continues to have many working opera houses, such as the Teatro Massimo in Palermo (the biggest in the country), the in Naples and the in Milan. The Teatro San Cassiano in Venice was the world&#x27;s first public opera house, inaugurated as such in 1637.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, opera houses were often financed by rulers, nobles, and wealthy people who used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambition and social position. There was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing and the first opera house in Germany, the Oper am Gänsemarkt, was built in Hamburg in 1678, followed by the Oper am Brühl in Leipzig in 1693, and the in Naumburg in 1701. With the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the 19th century, European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system.

Early United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities, hosting community dances, fairs, plays, and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events. In the 2000s, most opera and theatre companies are supported by funds from a combination of government and institutional grants, ticket sales, and private donations.

== Other uses of the term ==
In the 19th-century United States, many theaters were given the name &quot;opera house&quot;, even ones where opera was seldom if ever performed. Opera was viewed as a more respectable art form than theater; calling a local theater an &quot;opera house&quot; therefore served to elevate it and overcome objections from those who found the theater morally objectionable.

<doc id="155044" wikidata="Q235388" url="?curid=155044" title="Christy Carlson Romano">
<text>Christy Carlson Romano (born March 20, 1984) is an American actress, podcaster, and singer. On the Disney Channel, she played Ren Stevens on &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and voiced the titular character from &quot;Kim Possible&quot;.

==Early life==
Romano was born on March 20, 1984, in Milford, Connecticut, the youngest of four children of Anthony and Sharon (née Carlson) Romano. Romano was raised Catholic. She is of Italian descent. She began her career at six years old when she was cast in several national tours of Broadway shows, including &quot;Annie,&quot; &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; with Keith Carradine, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; with Marie Osmond. She made her first feature film appearance in 1996 as a singing &quot;Chiquita Banana&quot; in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Henry Fool&quot; (1997) and &quot;Looking for an Echo&quot; (2000).

==Career==
===Film and television===
Romano made her Broadway debut in 1998 as Mary Phagan in the musical &quot;Parade&quot; by Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown. In 2002, she acted in three Disney Channel projects simultaneously, supplementing her work on &quot;Even Stevens&quot; with a starring role in &quot;Cadet Kelly,&quot; alongside Hilary Duff, and voice acting as the title character in &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. Romano was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for her work on &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. The show inspired an adventure scavenger hunt activity at Disney&#x27;s Epcot which ran for over five years, as well as two Disney Channel movies &quot;Kim Possible: So the Drama&quot; and &quot;Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time&quot;.

Romano voiced Yuffie Kisaragi in the English version of the movie &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children,&quot; as well as in the Disney/Square game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Throughout her teens and twenties, she starred in movies for ABC Family and Disney Channel, including &quot;Campus Confidential,&quot; &quot;Taking Five,&quot; &quot;The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold&quot;, and &quot;The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream.&quot; Various other appearances include MTV&#x27;s &quot;Kaya,&quot; CBS&#x27; &quot;Joan of Arcadia,&quot; The WB&#x27;s &quot;Summerland&quot;, and TNT&#x27;s &quot;Hawthorne.&quot; 

In February 2004, Romano began a 31-week run as Belle in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; on Broadway. Romano was the youngest actress to portray the character on Broadway. She reprised the role in Atlanta&#x27;s 2005 Fox Theatre production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. In September 2008, she joined the Broadway company of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; as Kate Monster for several weeks. Romano starred as Michelle off-Broadway in &quot;White&#x27;s Lies&quot; at New World Stages in 2010, alongside Betty Buckley and Tuc Watkins.

Romano penned a novel, &quot;Grace&#x27;s Turn,&quot; for Disney literary subsidiary Hyperion, which received accolades by the New York Public Library (NYPL) as the 2007 Teenage Book of the Year. In 2012, she directed a music video for Steph Gold&#x27;s &quot;THE SUN&quot; which was accepted into the Los Angeles Shorts Fest 2012. Amongst other titles, Romano has appeared in many films since her Disney days including Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Deadly Daycare&quot;, Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;The Girl in the Photographs&quot;, &quot;Loosies&quot;, and &quot;Christmas with the Andersons&quot;. In March 2016, she directed her first feature, &quot;Christmas All Over Again&quot; starring Nickelodeon&#x27;s Sean Ryan Fox and YouTube star Todrick Hall; Lionsgate released the film for Christmas 2016.

Romano appeared as pop star Poppy Blu in the live action &quot;Kim Possible&quot; television movie which premiered on February 15, 2019. Starting that year, Romano started her own YouTube show called &quot;Christy&#x27;s Kitchen Throwback&quot;, in which she would cook recipes with former child actors and Disney stars as guest hosts. In August 2020, it was announced that Romano would host the cooking show &quot;Bucket List Bistro&quot; for Fox.

On November 15, 2024, Fox announced that Romano was one of fifteen contestants to appear in the third season of reality quasi-military training television series &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot;.

===Podcasts===
Romano hosts several podcasts. She hosts &quot;Vulnerable&quot; where she interviews former child stars. She also hosts &quot;I Hear Voices&quot; with her former &quot;Kim Possible&quot; co-star Will Friedle. She also hosts &quot;Even More Stevens&quot; with her former &quot;Even Stevens&quot; co-stars Nick Spano and Steven Anthony Lawrence.

In 2023, Romano launched a company called PodCo, a podcast network that focuses on rewatches hosted by the stars of popular TV series such as &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot;, &quot;Even Stevens&quot;, and others.

===Music===
While working at Disney, Romano recorded songs as part of soundtracks for &quot;Kim Possible&quot; and other Disney projects. She first sang on the Disney Channel on a musical episode of &quot;Even Stevens&quot; which led to more singing on the series and with Disney in general. In 2004, Walt Disney Records released Romano&#x27;s debut album &quot;Greatest Disney TV &amp; Film Hits&quot;, a compilation of previously released soundtrack appearances and new material. After her Broadway run of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; Romano signed a record deal with Jason Flom at Atlantic Records. Flom was fired before Romano released her first album and Romano&#x27;s deal was not honored. She continued to write music with Kara DioGuardi and The Matrix and placed her songs in several movies.
===Other ventures===
After her singing career, Romano began narrating audiobooks, including &quot;Pop Princess&quot; by Rachel Cohn, &quot;The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer&quot; trilogy by Michelle Hodkin, and &quot;Beautiful Blue World&quot; by Suzanne M. LaFleur. She also narrated audiobooks &quot;To Catch a Killer&quot; by Sheryl Scarborough, &quot;Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits&quot; by David Wong, &quot;Kaleidoscope Hearts&quot; by Claire Contreras, and the &quot;Adventures of Owl Series&quot; by Kristi Charish. On August 22, 2006, she published her own novel, &quot;Grace&#x27;s Turn&quot;, for which she provided the narration as well.

==Personal life==
After &quot;Even Stevens&quot; ended, Romano struggled with depression, self-harm, and alcohol abuse during her late teen years and early twenties. Her experience of playing Belle in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; on Broadway was taxing on her voice, which was already in delicate condition after she had to have surgery to remove vocal nodules right before her audition. She also admitted that she was pushing her voice past its limit in order to get through her run while trying to make Disney Theatrical Productions proud.

Romano later attended Barnard College and received her degree in Film Studies. Romano and writer-producer Brendan Rooney met in February 2011 while she was studying at Barnard College. They became engaged in November and, after two years of engagement, married on December 31, 2013 at the Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta. They have two daughters: Isabella Victoria, born December 24, 2016, and Sophia Elizabeth, born February 18, 2019.

In a 2023 &quot;Fox News Digital&quot; article Romano stated &quot;I don’t identify as a celebrity at all, by the way. I think ‘public person’ probably makes more sense, or now content creator. I think that the term celebrity is so gross and outdated.&quot;

On February 7, 2025, Romano was shot in her right eye during a clay pigeon shooting outing with her husband for his 42nd birthday, which was accidentally caused by another party. Rooney assessed the situation and had her taken to a hospital. She described her injuries that involved a bullet hole underneath her eye which was swollen with blood inside her eyeball, a fragment on her side near the eye which got cleaned out, and a fragment that got lodged behind her eye which is too risky to have surgically removed. Romano stated that the doctors will continue to monitor her and can see normally at the moment.

<text>Remote viewing (RV) is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen subject, purportedly sensing with the mind. A remote viewer is expected to give information about an object, event, person, or location hidden from physical view and separated at some distance. Physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), are generally credited with coining the term &quot;remote viewing&quot; to distinguish it from the closely related concept of clairvoyance. According to Targ, the term was first suggested by Ingo Swann in December 1971 during an experiment at the American Society for Psychical Research in New York City.

Remote viewing experiments have historically lacked proper controls and repeatability. There is no scientific evidence that remote viewing exists, and the topic of remote viewing is generally regarded as pseudoscience.

The idea of remote viewing received renewed attention in the 1990s upon the declassification of documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program sponsored by the U.S. government that attempted to determine potential military applications of psychic phenomena. The program ran from 1975 to 1995 and ended after evaluators concluded that remote viewers consistently failed to produce actionable intelligence information.

==History==

===Early background===

In early occult and spiritualist literature, remote viewing was known as and traveling clairvoyance. Rosemary Guiley described it as &quot;seeing remote or hidden objects clairvoyantly with the inner eye, or in alleged out-of-body travel.&quot;

The study of psychic phenomena by major scientists started in the mid-nineteenth century. Early researchers included Michael Faraday, Alfred Russel Wallace, Rufus Osgood Mason, and William Crookes. Their work predominantly involved carrying out focused experimental tests on individuals thought to be psychically gifted. Reports of apparently successful tests were met with much skepticism from the scientific community.

In the 1930s, J. B. Rhine expanded the study of paranormal performance into larger populations by using standard experimental protocols with unselected human subjects. But, as with the earlier studies, Rhine was reluctant to publicize this work too early because of the fear of criticism from mainstream scientists.

Paranormal studies remained a fringe area of scientific exploration. However, by the 1960s, the prevailing counterculture attitudes were sympathetic to paranormal ideas. The emergence of what is termed &quot;New Age&quot; thinking and the popularity of the Human Potential Movement provoked a mini-renaissance that renewed public interest in consciousness studies and psychic phenomena. It also helped to make financial support more available for research into such topics.

In the early 1970s, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ joined the Electronics and Bioengineering Laboratory at Stanford Research Institute (SRI, now SRI International), where they initiated studies of the paranormal that were, at first, supported with private funding from the Parapsychology Foundation and the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

In the late 1970s, the physicists John Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski tested the psychic Matthew Manning in remote viewing, and the results proved &quot;completely unsuccessful&quot;.

One of the early experiments, lauded by proponents as having improved the methodology of remote viewing testing and raising future experimental standards, was criticized as leaking information to the participants by inadvertently leaving clues. Some later experiments had negative results when these clues were eliminated.

The viewers&#x27; advice in the &quot;Stargate project&quot; was always so unclear and non-detailed that it has never been used in any intelligence operation.

===Decline and termination===

In the early 1990s, the Military Intelligence Board, chaired by Defense Intelligence Agency chief Harry E. Soyster, appointed Army Colonel William Johnson to manage the remote viewing unit and evaluate its objective usefulness. Funding dissipated in late 1994, and the program declined. The project was transferred from DIA to the CIA in 1995.

In 1995, the CIA hired the American Institutes for Research (AIR) to perform a retrospective evaluation of the results generated by the Stargate Project. Reviewers included Ray Hyman and Jessica Utts. Utts maintained that there had been a statistically significant positive effect, with some subjects scoring 5–15% above chance. Hyman argued that Utts&#x27; conclusion that ESP had been proven to exist &quot;is premature, to say the least.&quot; Hyman said the findings had yet to be replicated independently, and that more investigation would be necessary to &quot;legitimately claim the existence of paranormal functioning&quot;. Based upon both of their studies, which recommended a higher level of critical research and tighter controls, the CIA terminated the $20 million project in 1995. &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated in 1995 that three full-time psychics were still working on a $500,000-a-year budget at Fort Meade, Maryland, which would soon be closed.

The AIR report concluded that no usable intelligence data was produced in the program. David Goslin of the American Institute for Research said, &quot;There&#x27;s no documented evidence it had any value to the intelligence community&quot;.

===PEAR&#x27;s Remote Perception program===

Beginning in the late 1970s, the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) carried out extensive research on remote viewing. By 1989, it had conducted 336 formal trials, reporting a composite z-score of 6.355, with a corresponding p-value of . In a 1992 critique of these results, Hansen, Utts and Markwick concluded &quot;The PEAR remote-viewing experiments depart from commonly accepted criteria for formal research in science. In fact, they are undoubtedly some of the poorest quality ESP experiments published in many years.&quot; The lab responded that &quot;none of the stated complaints compromises the PEAR experimental protocols or analytical methods&quot; and reaffirmed their results.

Following Utts&#x27; emphasis on replication and Hyman&#x27;s challenge on interlaboratory consistency in the AIR report, PEAR conducted several hundred trials to see if they could replicate the SAIC and SRI experiments. They created an analytical judgment methodology to replace the human judging process criticized in past experiments, and they released a report in 1996. They felt the results of the experiments were consistent with the SRI experiments. However, statistical flaws have been proposed by others in the parapsychological community and within the general scientific community.

==Scientific reception==
A variety of scientific studies on remote viewing have been conducted. Early experiments produced positive results, but they had invalidating flaws. None of the more recent experiments have shown positive results when conducted under properly controlled conditions. This lack of successful experiments has led the mainstream scientific community to reject remote viewing, based upon the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain remote viewing, and the lack of experimental techniques which can provide reliably positive results.

Science writers Gary Bennett, Martin Gardner, Michael Shermer and professor of neurology Terence Hines describe the topic of remote viewing as pseudoscience.

C. E. M. Hansel, who evaluated the remote viewing experiments of parapsychologists such as Puthoff, Targ, John B. Bisha, and Brenda J. Dunne, noted that there was a lack of controls, and precautions were not taken to rule out the possibility of fraud. He concluded the experimental design was inadequately reported and &quot;too loosely controlled to serve any useful function.&quot;

The psychologist Ray Hyman says that, even if the results from remote viewing experiments were reproduced under specified conditions, they would still not be a conclusive demonstration of the existence of psychic functioning. He blames this on the reliance on a negative outcome—the claims on ESP are based on the results of experiments not being explained by normal means. He says that the experiments lack a positive theory that guides as to what to control on them and what to ignore, and that &quot;Parapsychologists have not come close to (having a positive theory) as yet&quot;.

Hyman also says that the amount and quality of the experiments on RV are far too low to convince the scientific community to &quot;abandon its fundamental ideas about causality, time, and other principles&quot; due to its findings still not being replicated successfully under scrutiny.

Martin Gardner has written that the founding researcher Harold Puthoff was an active Scientologist before his work at Stanford University, which influenced his research at SRI. In 1970, the Church of Scientology published a notarized letter that Puthoff had written while he was conducting research on remote viewing at Stanford. The letter read, in part: &quot;Although critics viewing the system Scientology from the outside may form the impression that Scientology is just another of many quasi-educational quasi-religious &#x27;schemes,&#x27; it is in fact a highly sophistical and highly technological system more characteristic of modern corporate planning and applied technology&quot;. Among some of the ideas that Puthoff supported regarding remote viewing was the claim in the book &quot;Occult Chemistry&quot; that two followers of Madame Blavatsky, founder of theosophy, were able to remote-view the inner structure of atoms.

Michael Shermer investigated remote viewing experiments and discovered a problem with the target selection list. According to Shermer, with the sketches, only a handful of designs are usually used, such as lines and curves, which could depict any object and be interpreted as a &quot;hit&quot;. Shermer has also written about confirmation and hindsight biases that have occurred in remote viewing experiments.

Various skeptic organizations have conducted experiments for remote viewing and other alleged paranormal abilities, with no positive results under properly controlled conditions.

===Sensory cues===

The psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff&#x27;s remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute. In a series of 35 studies, they could not replicate the results, so they investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff&#x27;s experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday&#x27;s two targets or having the session date written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment&#x27;s high hit rates. According to Terence Hines:

Thomas Gilovich has written:

According to Marks, when the cues were eliminated the results fell to a chance level. Marks achieved 100 percent accuracy using cues alone, without visiting any of the sites himself. James Randi has written that controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cueing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students also solved Puthoff and Targ&#x27;s locations from the clues in the transcripts.

Marks and Kamman concluded: &quot;Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis.&quot; In 1980, Charles Tart claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff&#x27;s experiments revealed an above-chance result. Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues. Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote, &quot;Considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart&#x27;s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues.&quot;

The information from the Stargate Project remote viewing sessions was vague and included irrelevant and erroneous data. The project was never useful in any intelligence operation, and it was suspected that the project managers, in some cases, changed the reports so they would fit background cues.

Marks in his book &quot;The Psychology of the Psychic&quot; (2000) discussed the flaws in the Stargate Project in detail. He wrote that the experiments had several flaws. The possibility of cues or sensory leakage was not ruled out, the experiments were not independently replicated, and some of the experiments were conducted in secret, making peer review impossible. He further noted that the judge, Edwin May, was also the principal investigator for the project, risking a significant conflict of interest. Marks concluded the project was nothing more than a &quot;subjective delusion&quot;, and after two decades of research, it had failed to provide any scientific evidence for remote viewing.

Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire, and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) has pointed out several problems with one of the early experiments at SAIC, including information leakage. However, he indicated the importance of its process-oriented approach and of its refining of remote viewing methodology, which meant that researchers replicating their work could avoid these problems. Wiseman later insisted there were multiple opportunities for participants in that experiment to be influenced by cues and that these cues can affect the results when they appear.

<text>Frodsham is a market town, civil parish, and electoral ward in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. Its population in 2021 was 9,300. It is south of Liverpool and southwest of Manchester. The River Weaver runs to its northeast and on the west it overlooks the estuary of the River Mersey. The A56 road and the Chester–Manchester railway line pass through the town, and the M56 motorway passes to the northwest.

In the medieval era, Frodsham was an important borough and port belonging to the Earls of Chester. Its parish church, St. Laurence&#x27;s, still exhibits evidence of a building present in the 12th century in its nave and is referenced in the Domesday Book. A market is held each Thursday, and Frodsham&#x27;s viability as a trading centre was emphasised by the presence of the &quot;big five&quot; clearing banks and several building societies, though the branches of HSBC and NatWest have recently closed. Development in the town&#x27;s shops and premises with alcohol licences is evident through the opening or modernisation of contemporary-style bar, restaurants, take-aways, and public houses since 2002, and in the continued presence of small, specialised, businesses operating from town-centre shops.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The etymology of Frodsham&#x27;s name is not entirely clear. It is called &quot;Frotesham&quot; in the Domesday Book. A literal translation of the Old English would give personal name of &quot;Frod&quot; or an old spelling of &quot;ford&quot;, and &quot;ham&quot; which means a village or homestead; hence Frod&#x27;s village or the village on the ford (ford-ham). However, an alternative, more obscure etymology exists which suggests the name means &quot;promontory into marsh&quot;, which would make sense considering that Frodsham had a promontory castle very close to marshland. Another possible etymology is Old English &#x27;frōd&#x27; (“wise, prudent; experienced, old”) and &#x27;Ham&#x27; (&quot;homestead, settlement, or village&quot;), with the &#x27;s&#x27; having been added through phonetic evolution or linguistic simplification over time, giving the meaning &#x27;Wise Village&#x27;. Frodsham is unique as the name of a settlement in the British Isles. Earlier spellings of the name have included Fradsham, Frandsham, Frodisham, Ffradsam and Ffradsham.

===Early history===
Frodsham Hill is the location of an Iron Age promontory fort, the outline of which can still be seen.

The town is of Saxon origin; its 11th-century church is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Frodsham was an important manor of the medieval Earls of Chester and was created a borough in the early 13th century, probably by Earl Ranulf III. The mouth of the River Weaver, where it joins the Mersey, made Frodsham into a significant port for the coasting trade, particularly for the export of Cheshire salt, brought down the river from Northwich and Nantwich. The site of the manor house was in Castle Park; the building was of stone and was fortified. In an account of 1315 it is called &#x27;castellum&#x27; (little castle), although &#x27;manerium&#x27; (manor house) was the usual designation.

===Recent history===
Frodsham was the headquarters of Runcorn Rural District Council. In 1974 the district was split between Halton Borough Council, Warrington Borough Council and Vale Royal District Council (latterly Vale Royal Borough Council). In the early 1990s Vale Royal Borough Council opened a new purpose-built headquarters in Winsford. At the same time, its offices in Hartford near Northwich (the former headquarters of Northwich Rural District Council) and at Castle Park in Frodsham (the former headquarters of Runcorn Rural District Council) were downgraded.

Castle Park House had a major refurbishment in 2005–06 and now operates as a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for Cheshire West and Chester Council, providing a number of services for the community and for businesses.

In 1992 the parish council became Frodsham Town Council and Frodsham was no longer a village. The chair of the parish council became the mayor of Frodsham. The majority of powers were held by Cheshire County Council and Vale Royal Borough Council who were replaced by Cheshire West and Chester Council on 1 April 2009.

Frodsham was home to Frodsham School, a science and technology college, which closed in July 2009 owing to the falling birth rate, and was amalgamated with Helsby High School. The site was redeveloped and now houses the new health centre for the town.

Frodsham, like the neighbouring village of Helsby, has a hill overlooking the Mersey estuary, which is popular with dog walkers and naturalists. Frodsham Hill, overlooking Frodsham and the Liverpool skyline, is a large sandstone hill, home to many farms, prestige homes and the Mersey View nightclub (commonly known as &#x27;the View&#x27;) and Forest Hills Hotel. Before the construction of the hotel and nightclub, famously hosting one of the Beatles&#x27; first appearances, the site was home to a very large helter skelter and a fine collection of vintage coin-operated amusement machines.

The Frodsham Caves are found in the sandstone foundations of Frodsham Hill.

==Geography==
Frodsham sits beneath the imposing wooded escarpment of Beacon Hill, which is also known locally as Frodsham Hill or Overton Hill and whose top attains a height of just over . The hill forms the northern end of the Mid-Cheshire Ridge, a range of sandstone hills that extends southwards to Delamere Forest and Tarporley.

The northern boundaries of the modern parish are defined by the River Weaver (canalised in part as the Weaver Navigation) and the inner Mersey Estuary into which it flows. The Manchester Ship Canal runs parallel to the Mersey along the northern edge of the low-lying ground of Frodsham Marsh and Lordship Marsh, which themselves extend south and east to the built-up area of Frodsham.

The town is close to the junction of the A56, the main link between Chester and Warrington, with the B5152 road, which runs southeast to connect with Kingsley, Northwich and Tarporley in the centre of the county. The Chester–Manchester railway line passes through the town and the M56 motorway runs parallel to the road and railway along the southeastern edge of the marsh. The formerly separate settlements of Netherton and Overton form the southern districts of the town while the easternmost section towards Frodsham Bridge is known as Newtown.

===Geology===
The parish, like most in Cheshire, is underlain by a suite of sedimentary rocks dating from the Triassic Period. They comprise (in ascending order) the early Triassic age Kinnerton Sandstone, Chester and Wilmslow Sandstone formations together with the Late Triassic age Helsby Sandstone, Tarporley Siltstone and Sidmouth Mudstone formations. Those formations up to and including the Helsby Sandstone Formation are assigned to the Sherwood Sandstone Group. It is this formation whose relatively hard-wearing sandstones form the higher ground of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Hill and Harrol Edge. The younger siltstones and mudstones are assigned to the Mercia Mudstone Group. The sequence of sandstones is exposed in a railway cutting and two road cuttings, which are collectively designated as a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Several faults run roughly northwest–southeast through the area, notably the Overton Fault, which roughly parallels the B5439 and B5152 roads, and the Frodsham Fault, which runs north from the vicinity of Crowmere to the mouth of the River Weaver. Both of these faults and others in the area downthrow to the east. Movement on them is thought to have taken place in the Tertiary period. The uplift resulted in trapping the water table at an elevation of around at which level springs developed.

Overlying the bedrock are a variety of superficial deposits (otherwise known as drift). These comprise a thin and patchy cover of glacial till (or &#x27;boulder clay&#x27;), largely a legacy of the last ice age, together with spreads of glacio-fluvial sand and gravel, a product of the eventual deglaciation of the area. Recent alluvium fills the deeply incised valley of the Weaver and also extends across the Marsh to the Mersey estuary.

===Climate===
Being close to the west coast and the Irish Sea, the climate is generally temperate with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean average temperature in the years 1971 to 2000 was 9.4 to 9.7 °C, slightly above the average for the United Kingdom as was the average amount of annual sunshine at 1391 to 1470 hours. The average annual rainfall was 741 to 870 mm, slightly below the average for the UK. The average number of days in the year when snow is on the ground is 0 to 6, which is low for the United Kingdom. The average number of days of air frost is 2 to 39, which is also low.

==Demography==
The population of Frodsham parish at the 2021 census was 9,300.

97.1% of the population identified as White, 1.3% Mixed, 1.0% Asian, 0.3% Black and 0.3% other.

Christianity was the most common religion in the 2021 census, at 57.5%. 36.2% said they had no religion. Minority religions were 0.4% Buddhism, 0.3% Islam, 0.2% Hinduism, 0.2% Judaism, 0.0% Sikhism and 0.3% other.

==Transport==
There is a railway station in Frodsham which is managed by Transport for Wales. It runs an hourly service between Manchester Piccadilly and Llandudno via Frodsham and Chester. There are also infrequent services by Northern between Ellesmere Port and Helsby.

Bus services are available to Chester, Runcorn, Ellesmere Port, Hatchmere (adjacent to Delamere Forest) and to Northwich. Frodsham is from Liverpool John Lennon Airport and from Manchester Airport.

==Education==
There are four primary schools in Frodsham: Frodsham Manor House Primary School; St Luke&#x27;s Catholic Primary School; Frodsham Church of England Primary School; and Frodsham Weaver Vale Primary School. The only secondary school in the town, Frodsham School, a science and technology college, closed in 2009 and has been converted into a health clinic, library and leisure centre. 
==Religion==
There is one Anglican church in Frodsham, St Laurence&#x27;s on Church Road, Overton. Frodsham Methodist Church is on Kingsley Road, also just outside the centre of Frodsham in the Five Crosses/Overton area of the town. The town has, in the past, had a number of Methodist churches built to replace older chapels. Most recent to close were Trinity Wesleyan Methodist Chapel (later Trinity Methodist Church) and Bourne Primitive Methodist Chapel (later Bourne Methodist Church). The spire of Trinity is still a visible landmark in the town. The Roman Catholic church is St. Luke&#x27;s in High Street. There are two Evangelical chapels, Main Street Community Church and King&#x27;s Church (Free Methodist) on Chester Road. 

==Local government arrangements==
Frodsham lies within the administrative area of Cheshire West and Chester Council. Two councillors are elected from the Frodsham ward to serve on that Council. The Frodsham ward has the same boundaries as the Town&#x27;s own parish boundaries. The current Councillors are Cllr Chris Basey and Cllr Lynn Riley, both Conservatives, who were both elected to serve until the 2023 Local Government Elections for Cheshire West and Chester.

Frodsham Town Council is the local council or parish council for Frodsham. This council is made up of 16 councillors. The town councillors are elected from one of four parish wards called Waterside Ward, Lakes Ward, Overton &amp; Five Crosses Ward and Castle Park Ward. Four councillors are elected from each ward. These town councillors are elected to serve four-year terms of office, the most recent elections being on 7 May 2015. If any vacancy occurs during the four-year term 10 local parishioners from the relevant ward can require a by-election to be held, otherwise the other town councillors can co-opt an eligible person to be a councillor. The last by-election occurred in September 2013 in West ward. The last co-option occurred in September 2011 in North ward.

The then Frodsham Parish Council resolved to style itself a town in 1992. From 1992 to 2012 the chairman of the council served as the Town Mayor but using the courtesy title of &#x27;Mayor of Frodsham&#x27;. However, strictly, the chairman was only entitled to be known as &#x27;town mayor&#x27;.

In April 2012 the council resolved to split the roles of chairman and Mayor of Frodsham and separate votes are now held for each position. The council also resolved to create a convention offering the mayorship to the councillor who had served the longest since last being Mayor, or having been first elected regardless of any political or personal affiliations.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Frodsham&#x27;s proximity to North Wales means that BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received from the Moel-y-Parc TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside on 95.8 FM, Capital North West &amp; Wales on 97.1 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Smooth Radio North West on 100.4 FM, and Dee Radio on 106.3 FM.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Chester and District Standard&quot;.

In November 2014 Frodsham made national headlines due to a hoax in which it was claimed that actor William Shatner would be turning on the town&#x27;s Christmas lights. A Twitter account, @Frodshamxmas, having spent the preceding weeks presenting itself as (though never directly claiming to be) the official social media account for the town&#x27;s festivities, tweeted that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor would be making an appearance. Several local news outlets, local councillors and the local MP unwittingly retweeted the claims until Shatner issued a tweet confirming them to be false. The perpetrator(s) of the hoax have never come forward.

<text>Gawsworth is a civil parish and village in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,705. It is one of the eight ancient parishes of Macclesfield Hundred. Twenty acres of the civil parish were transferred to Macclesfield civil parish in 1936.

The country houses Gawsworth Old Hall, Gawsworth New Hall and Gawsworth Old Rectory are in the village. The authors of the Cheshire volume of the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series state: There is nothing in Cheshire to compare with the loveliness of Gawsworth: three great houses and a distinguished church set around a descending string of pools, all within an enigmatic large-scale formal landscape.

A wood near the village known as Maggotty Wood is the burial place of the eighteenth-century dramatist Samuel &quot;Maggotty&quot; Johnson. His ghost is reputed to haunt the wood.

==Governance==
Gawsworth Parish Council consists of 9 elected Councillors in two wards, Gawsworth Village and Gawsworth Moss. It is within the Gawsworth Ward of Cheshire East Council. In the UK Parliament it is represented by Tim Roca MP for the Macclesfield constituency.

<text>Gawsworth Old Hall is a Grade I listed country house in the village of Gawsworth, Cheshire, England. It is a timber-framed house in the Cheshire black-and-white style. The present house was built between 1480 and 1600, replacing an earlier Norman house. It was probably built as a courtyard house enclosing a quadrangle, but much of it has been demolished, leaving the house with a U-shaped plan.

Notable residents have included Mary Fitton, perhaps the &quot;Dark Lady&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, and Samuel &quot;Maggoty&quot; Johnson, a playwright described as the last professional jester in England, whose grave is nearby in Maggoty Wood, a small National Trust woodland. In 1712 a dispute about the ownership of the Gawsworth estate culminated in a celebrated duel, in which both the combatants were killed.

The hall is surrounded by formal gardens and parkland, which once comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden and, possibly, a tilting ground for jousting. The grounds are listed Grade II*, and contain four Grade II listed buildings, including the gatehouse, gatepiers, and garden walls. The hall and grounds are open to the public at advertised times, and events are organised. During the summer months a series of concerts and other entertainment is arranged in an open-air theatre near the hall.

==History==
The original house on the site dated from the Norman era. The earliest documentary reference is the granting of a licence for the administration of a chapel within the house in 1365. The house was then owned by Thomas Fitton, who had inherited it by marriage in 1316, and it remained in the possession of the Fitton family until 1611. The original house was replaced in the 15th and 16th centuries. Building started in 1480, and continued in stages until about 1600. Since then, parts of the house have been demolished, and others have been considerably altered. It is considered by the architectural historians Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz that the site of the house was originally moated, and that its plan was that of a quadrangle, forming a courtyard house.

In 1579 the house was inherited by Sir Edward Fitton III on the death of his father, Sir Edward Fitton II. Sir Edward III was the father of Mary Fitton, a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth and a candidate for the &quot;Dark Lady&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. Following the death of Sir Edward Fitton, 2nd Baronet in 1643, the estate passed to Charles Gerard, later the first Earl of Macclesfield. There was a dispute about the legal ownership of the estate between Sir Charles and his cousin Alexander Fitton, which was resolved in Sir Charles&#x27;s favour in 1663. Demolition of parts of the house took place in about 1700, and it is thought by de Figueiredo and Treuherz that the west range was removed, possibly including the gatehouse. At the beginning of the 18th century the dispute between the Fittons and the Gerards resurfaced, culminating in a duel in Hyde Park, London, in 1712 between the rival claimants: Lord Mohun, from the Gerard family, and the 4th Duke of Hamilton, from the Fittons. Both of the combatants were killed. The estate remained with the Gerards, until it was bought by William Stanhope, who later became the first Earl of Harrington, and it remained with this family until 1935. The house was owned by the Cheshire antiquary Raymond Richards until his death in 1978. Richards collected items from historic buildings that were being demolished in the 1960s, either incorporating them into the house or displaying them in the grounds. The house is still owned and run by the Richards family.

==Architecture==

===Exterior and plan===
Gawsworth Old Hall is a timber-framed house in the Cheshire black-and-white tradition, roofed in Kerridge sandstone. It has been estimated that the weight of the roof may be in excess of . The house is in mainly in two storeys. In the north range, and on the south front, the timber frame has been encased in brick, with timbering applied to its outer surface. Internally the roof trusses have been retained. Its plan is that of a U-shape with its open side facing the west, towards what was the courtyard. The main entrance is in the north range, leading into the Entrance Hall. To the west of this is the Library, and to the east, the Morning Room. The Entrance Hall leads into the longest range, the eastern range, consisting of the Long Hall, at the north end, and the Dining Room. The Long Hall was originally the Great Hall, and was open to the roof, but is now divided into two floors. To the east of the range extend the kitchen and the chapel. The Dining Room leads into a room now known as the Green Room, which is canted ten degrees to the east. This was also originally open to the roof, but was not a great hall. De Figueiredo and Treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger, separate structure, probably a barn, and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built. Little of the south range remains. It originally contained domestic apartments, which formerly extended to join the now-demolished west range. In the angle between the Dining Room and what remains of the south range is the Drawing Room. The special feature of this room is a canted bay window on the north side, extending upwards for three storeys. The only dated item in the building is the Fitton coat of arms on the north front, which was carved by Richard Rany in 1570.

===Interior===
Many of the original features have been lost as a consequence of the many changes that have taken place over the centuries. Additional features have been added to the interior by Raymond Richards, such as the doorcase around the entrance. The Entrance Hall has retained its medieval shape and low ceiling. It contains the coat of arms of the Richards family and items of weaponry, including a decorative suit of armour dating from the 19th century and moved here from Scarisbrick Hall. To the west of the Entrance Hall is the Library. This is in the shape of a double cube, measuring by . Its major item is a richly carved Tudor chimneypiece. The bookcases were designed by A. W. N. Pugin. Both of these items were moved here by Raymond Richards, the bookcases coming from Scarisbrick Hall. The bookcases contain a comprehensive collection of books relating to Cheshire. In a corner cabinet is a flint axe head dating from about 2000 BC. This was discovered in the park nearby in 1912. To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Long Hall. This has retained the fireplace and ceiling introduced in the Tudor era. The hall contains items of antique furniture, and paintings by David Wilkie, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. To the south of the Long Hall is the principal staircase, which was remodelled in 1920. The area around the staircase contains a Waterford glass chandelier dating from about 1780, and a portrait of the first Earl of Harrington by Allan Ramsay. From this area, a door leads into the chapel. This is the third or fourth chapel in the house, and was dedicated to Thomas More when he was canonised in 1935. Much of the woodwork in it dates from 1803. Many of the ornaments in the chapel were brought here by Richards from a redundant church in Ipswich. Two marble plaques in the chapel are by Thomas Thornycroft, a sculptor born in the nearby village. Alongside the chapel is an ambulatory or baptistry which contains a font and items of stained glass, made by Morris &amp; Co. and designed by Edward Burne-Jones. These were obtained by Richards from All Saints Church, Birkenhead. They depict the Crucifixion, and Saints Agnes, George, Stephen and Alban. The south door contains fragments of ancient glass from Plas Newydd in Llangollen that were originally in a medieval church. Adjacent to the chapel is a conservatory containing marble sculptures by John Warrington Wood.

To the south of the Long Hall is the Dining Room, which is little changed since the Tudor era. Its contents include a 16th-century refectory table, an oak escritoire from about 1650, and items of Wedgwood majolica ware made in about 1830. The Dining Room leads to the small Guard Room, which contains two 17th-century chairs and an 18th-century blunderbuss. To the west of this is the Drawing Room, the principal living room of the hall, which has been little altered since the middle of the 16th century. To the south of the Drawing Room is a small room known as the Gold Room. This room has retained a frieze dating from the early 16th century, including carvings of Tudor roses, flowers and birds. Also in the room is a bust of Charles Gerard. In the southeast corner of the hall is the Green Room. This contains a painting of Gawsworth Rectory by Charles Tattershall Dodd, and a complete set of a dinner service by Minton, comprising 120 pieces.

A staircase from the east of the Guard Room leads to the Gallery on the upper floor, to the south side of which is the Solar, containing a 16th-century four-poster bed known as the Boswell bed. It was formerly in Lympne Castle, Kent. The house&#x27;s principal bedroom is the Hall Room, much of which has survived from the early 16th century. It contains a four-poster bed from the era of William and Mary and a portrait by Zuccaro of members of the Fitton family, which was formerly in Brereton Hall. A room next to the Hall Room has been converted into a modern bathroom, next to which is Mary Fitton&#x27;s Bedroom, which contains an old plaster frieze. The other rooms on floor are the French Room, containing an 18th-century French bed, and a small bedroom known as the Griffin Room. Adjacent to this is the Billiard Room, which has exposed roof timbers. As well as the billiard table, the room contains a marble sculpture of Echo by Alfred Gatley and a bust of John Milton.

==Grounds==
===Gardens===
Associated with the house is an inner garden of about surrounded by a parkland of about ; both are enclosed by walls. To the south of the hall the inner garden comprises a modern formal garden occupying the site of the original 16th-century formal garden. Beyond this, in the parkland, are the earthworks of an earlier garden. The parkland is almost square in shape, with a section curving out from the south border. It consists of &quot;one huge grassed area&quot; with &quot;lumps and bumps&quot;. The Cheshire historian George Ormerod, writing in 1819, considered that this area contained a tilting ground for jousting. That claim is repeated in the hall&#x27;s official guidebook, which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that Queen Elizabeth I would visit the hall on her royal progress, but she never did so. There is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden, but it is generally accepted that it comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden. A raised mound of earth in the southwest corner of the garden would have been used to view the garden from an elevated position. A corresponding mound at the southeast corner was removed during the Second World War. To the west of the hall a wooded area known as the Rookery contains mature lime trees. Limited excavation work carried out in 1989–90 discovered, &quot;inter alia&quot;, a filled-in canal running north–south down the centre of the garden. The excavations provided &quot;a tremendous insight into the past, although not enough to date it with certainty&quot;. To the north of the hall are four fish ponds.

===Structures===
Four structures in the grounds around the hall are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed buildings; Grade II listing means that a building or structure is considered to be &quot;of special interest&quot;. The 17th-century gatehouse is constructed in brick with ashlar dressings and a stone slate roof, in two storeys and three bays. The gate piers date from the late 17th or early 18th century. They are in painted ashlar surmounted by 20th-century ball finials. The garden walls were built in the 16th century, with later additions and alterations. They are constructed in brick with ashlar dressings. At the southern end is a large rectangular enclosure. In nearby woodland are the grave and memorial to Samuel &quot;Maggoty&quot; Johnson, a playwright said to have been the last professional jester in England, who lived in the hall and died in 1773 aged 82. A table tomb over the grave consists of an inscribed stone slab on a brick plinth. Adjacent to it is another inscribed stone slab, dating from the 19th century.

==Present day==
Gawsworth Old Hall is south of the village of Gawsworth, southeast of Macclesfield. Immediately to the west is the Grade I listed Church of St James, to the north beyond a fish pond is the Grade II* listed Gawsworth New Hall, and nearby is the Grade I listed Gawsworth Old Rectory. The Old Hall was listed Grade I on 25 July 1952. Grade I listing is granted to buildings of &quot;exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important&quot;, and encompasses only 2.5 per cent of all listed buildings. The grounds have been designated Grade II* in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Designation as Grade II* means that the site is &quot;particularly important, of more than special interest&quot;.

The hall is open to the general public at advertised times. A series of events is held in the grounds and in the hall during the year. There is a licensed tea room in the grounds, and the hall is also licensed for civil weddings. Ceremonies are conducted in the Long Hall, and receptions can be held in a marquee in the grounds. During the summer months plays, concerts and other entertainments take place in the open-air theatre close to the hall.

<text>Ordsall Hall is a large former manor house in the historic parish of Ordsall, Lancashire, now part of the City of Salford, in Greater Manchester, England. It dates back more than 750 years, although the oldest surviving parts of the present hall were built in the 15th century. The most important period of Ordsall Hall&#x27;s life was as the family seat of the Radclyffe family, who lived in the house for more than 300 years. The hall was the setting for William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s 1842 novel &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot;, written around the plausible although unsubstantiated local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned in the house.

Since its sale by the Radclyffes in 1662, the hall has been put to many uses: a working men&#x27;s club, a school for clergy, and a radio station among them. The house was bought by the old Salford Council in 1959 and opened to the public in 1972, as a period house and local history museum. The hall is a Grade I listed building, and entrance is free.

==History==
Ordsall Hall is a formerly moated Tudor mansion, the oldest parts of which were built during the 13th century, although there has been a house on the site for over 750 years. David de Hulton is recorded as the owner of the original hall, in 1251. The manor of Ordsall came into the possession of the Radclyffe family in about 1335, but it was not until 1354 that Sir John Radclyffe established his right of inheritance. The manor was described in 1351 as a messuage, of land, of meadow and of wood.

===Radclyffe family home===

During the 1340s, Sir John Radclyffe campaigned with Edward III in France, distinguishing himself at the battles of Caen, Crécy and Calais. As a reward for his service, the King allowed Sir John to take some Flemish weavers back to his Ordsall estate, where he built cottages for them to live in. English weaving skills at that time were poor, and textiles from Manchester were considered to be of particularly poor quality, so the Flemish weavers were employed in instructing the local weavers. They also started up a silk weaving industry, the foundation for Manchester&#x27;s later cotton industry.

The Dutch humanist and theologian Erasmus stayed at Ordsall Hall in 1499, and described it thus:

The original cruck hall was replaced by the present Great Hall in 1512, after Sir Alexander Radclyffe was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. The hall is typical of others built at that time in the northwest of England, although it is one of the largest, and is unusual for the period in having no wall fireplace. The hall has an elaborate roof structure, as in the similar Rufford Old Hall. There is a slightly later small room above the large oriel bay, which may be an early addition as at Samlesbury Hall.

Other alterations and additions were made during the 17th century, including a modest brick house added onto the west end in 1639, perhaps intended as a home for Sir Alexander&#x27;s bailiff, as he himself no longer used the hall as his main residence by that time. The house was built at 90° to the timber-framed building, to which it was later joined. During the Civil War Sir Alexander, as a Royalist, was imprisoned and suffered financial hardship. Reduced means eventually forced his heir, John Radclyffe, into selling the hall to Colonel Samuel Birch in 1662, thus ending more than 300 years of his family&#x27;s occupation.

===Later use===

At the time of the 1666 hearth tax survey, Ordsall Hall was the largest house in Salford, with 19 hearths. The Oldfield family of Leftwich, near Northwich, bought the estate at the end of the 17th century, and in 1704 it was sold again, to John Stock, a trustee of Cross Street Chapel. His family were probably the last owners to reside at the hall. The Stocks lived in the hall&#x27;s central section, comprising &quot;a large hall, lounge dining room, a chapel, six rooms on a floor, with brewhouse, large courts, stable, etc&quot;, while the two wings were leased to tenants from about 1700. In 1756, the hall was sold to Samuel Hill of Shenstone, Staffordshire. Two years later, on Hill&#x27;s death, the house passed to his nephew, Samuel Egerton of Tatton.

The hall remained in occupation until 1871, the last residents being the descendants of John Markendale, who had taken over the lease of the building in 1814. The land surrounding the hall was used by the Mather family of cowkeepers and butchers for many years. During the last quarter of the 19th century, Ordsall Hall became engulfed &quot;in mean streets and industry&quot;. From 1875, Haworth&#x27;s Mill rented the hall and used it as a working men&#x27;s club. The Great Hall was converted into a gymnasium after being cleared of the inserted floor and later partitions, and provision was made elsewhere for billiards, a skittle alley, and a bowling green. In 1883, the hall was bought by Wilbraham Egerton, 2nd Baron Egerton, and restored during 1896–98 by the Manchester architect Alfred Darbyshire at a cost of £6,000 (). The restoration allowed Lord Egerton to found a clergy training school at the hall. Provisions for the school included the construction of a church dedicated to St Cyprian in the north forecourt, and a new servants&#x27; wing on the south side. In 1908, the school was moved to Egerton Hall, changing its name to the Manchester Theological College. The men&#x27;s social club at Ordsall Hall survived until 1940. During the Second World War, the hall was used as a radio station. In the 1960s, the church and servants&#x27; wing built for the clergy school were demolished.

Salford Corporation purchased Ordsall Hall from the executors of Maurice Egerton, 4th Baron Egerton in 1959. After major restoration work, it was opened to the public in April 1972, as a period house and local history museum. Like many old buildings, Ordsall Hall has stories of hauntings. A White Lady who is said to appear in the Great Hall or Star Chamber is popularly believed to be Margaret Radclyffe, who died of a broken heart in 1599 following the death in Ireland of her brother, Alexander.

In March 2007, the Extraordinary Ordsall Campaign applied for a grant of £5.1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to regenerate Ordsall Hall and secure its future. After supporters had raised £1 million by September 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund provided the remaining £4.1 million. Only 40 per cent of the building was then open to the public, but following restoration work further rooms were expected to be opened. The building closed for refurbishment in early 2009, and re-opened to the public on 15 May 2011. In 2013, the newly restored building received a Bronze Award in the Small Visitor Attraction category organised by tourist body VisitEngland, one of 320 nominations from across the country.

==Architecture==

There are two separate elements to the present-day house: the timber-framed south range built in the 15th century, and the brick west range constructed in 1639. The hall was originally built around a central quadrangle, but the other wings making up that space are no longer present. Drawing on the earliest description of the house, from 1380, Salford City Council describes how it comprised &quot;a hall, five chambers, a kitchen and a chapel. It was associated with two stables, three granges, two shippons, a garner, a dovecote, an orchard and a windmill, together with of arable land and of meadow.&quot;

Substantial alterations appear to have taken place during the early years of Samuel Egerton&#x27;s ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed – although part of it can still be seen in the north wall – when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.

There are believed to have been underground passages leading from the hall into Manchester. One, running under the River Irwell to the Hanging Bridge Hotel at the northern end of Deansgate, was described in 1900, following the rediscovery of the Hanging Bridge after it had been buried for 200 years:
==Guy Fawkes==

Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot;, wrote about the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall&#x27;s Star Chamber. Fawkes is supposed to have escaped capture by the King&#x27;s soldiers by way of a tunnel from Ordsall Hall to an inn at the cathedral end of Hanging Bridge, at the northern end of present-day Deansgate. There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is remembered in the name of the modern road that runs to the east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.

<text>In physiology, dehydration is a lack of total body water that disrupts metabolic processes. It occurs when free water loss exceeds intake, often resulting from excessive sweating, health conditions, or inadequate consumption of water. Mild dehydration can also be caused by immersion diuresis, which may increase risk of decompression sickness in divers.

Most people can tolerate a 3-4% decrease in total body water without difficulty or adverse health effects. A 5-8% decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness. Loss of over 10% of total body water can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst. Death occurs with a 15 and 25% loss of body water. Mild dehydration usually resolves with oral rehydration, but severe cases may need intravenous fluids.

Dehydration can cause hypernatremia (high levels of sodium ions in the blood). This is distinct from hypovolemia (loss of blood volume, particularly blood plasma).

Chronic dehydration can cause kidney stones as well as the development of chronic kidney disease.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The hallmarks of dehydration include thirst and neurological changes such as headaches, general discomfort, loss of appetite, nausea, decreased urine volume (unless polyuria is the cause of dehydration), confusion, unexplained tiredness, purple fingernails, and seizures. The symptoms of dehydration become increasingly severe with greater total body water loss. A body water loss of 1-2%, considered mild dehydration, is shown to impair cognitive performance. While in people over age 50, the body&#x27;s thirst sensation diminishes with age, a study found that there was no difference in fluid intake between young and old people. Many older people have symptoms of dehydration, with the most common being fatigue. Dehydration contributes to morbidity in the elderly population, especially during conditions that promote insensible free water losses, such as hot weather.

==Cause==
Risk factors for dehydration include but are not limited to: exerting oneself in hot and humid weather, habitation at high altitudes, endurance athletics, elderly adults, infants, children and people living with chronic illnesses.

Dehydration can also come as a side effect from many different types of drugs and medications.

In the elderly, blunted response to thirst or inadequate ability to access free water in the face of excess free water losses (especially hyperglycemia related) seem to be the main causes of dehydration. Excess free water or hypotonic water can leave the body in two ways – &quot;sensible&quot; loss such as osmotic diuresis, sweating, vomiting and diarrhea, and &quot;insensible&quot; water loss, occurring mainly through the skin and respiratory tract. In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water homeostasis in the body. These occur primarily through either impaired thirst/water access or sodium excess.

== Mechanism ==
Water content of a human body varies from 70-75% in newborns to 40% and less in obese adults, an average value of 60% is suggested. Within the body, water is classified as intracellular fluid or extracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid refers to water that is contained within the cells. This consists of approximately 57% of the total body water weight. Fluid inside the cells has high concentrations of potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and proteins. Extracellular fluid consists of all fluid outside of the cells, and it includes blood and interstitial fluid. This makes up approximately 43% of the total body water weight. The most common ions in extracellular fluid include sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate.
The concentration of dissolved molecules and ions in the fluid is described as Osmolarity and is measured in osmoles per liter (Osm/L). When the body experiences a free water deficit, the concentration of solutes is increased. This leads to a higher serum osmolarity. When serum osmolarity is elevated, this is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. These receptors trigger the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH resists dehydration by increasing water absorption in the kidneys and constricting blood vessels. It acts on the V2 receptors in the cells of the collecting tubule of the nephron to increase expression of aquaporin. In more extreme cases of low blood pressure, the hypothalamus releases higher amounts of ADH which also acts on V1 receptors. These receptors cause contractions in the peripheral vascular smooth muscle. This increases systemic vascular resistance and raises blood pressure.

==Diagnosis==
=== Definition ===
Dehydration occurs when water intake does not replace free water lost due to normal physiologic processes, including breathing, urination, perspiration, or other causes, including diarrhea, and vomiting. Dehydration can be life-threatening when severe and lead to seizures or respiratory arrest, and also carries the risk of osmotic cerebral edema if rehydration is overly rapid.

The term &quot;dehydration&quot; has sometimes been used incorrectly as a proxy for the separate, related condition of hypovolemia, which specifically refers to a decrease in volume of blood plasma. The two are regulated through independent mechanisms in humans; the distinction is important in guiding treatment.

=== Physical examination ===
Common exam findings of dehydration include dry mucous membranes, dry axillae, increased capillary refill time, sunken eyes, and poor skin turgor. More extreme cases of dehydration can lead to orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, weakness, and altered mental status. Depending on the underlying cause of dehydration, other symptoms may be present as well. Excessive sweating from exercise may be associated with muscle cramps. Patients with gastrointestinal water loss from vomiting or diarrhea may also have fever or other systemic signs of infection.

The skin turgor test can be used to support the diagnosis of dehydration. The skin turgor test is conducted by pinching skin on the patient&#x27;s body, in a location such as the forearm or the back of the hand, and watching to see how quickly it returns to its normal position. The skin turgor test can be unreliable in patients who have reduced skin elasticity, such as the elderly.

=== Laboratory tests ===
While there is no single gold standard test to diagnose dehydration, evidence can be seen in multiple laboratory tests involving blood and urine. Serum osmolarity above 295 mOsm/kg is typically seen in dehydration due to free water loss. A urinalysis, which is a test that performs chemical and microscopic analysis of urine, may find darker color or foul odor with severe dehydration. Urinary sodium also provides information about the type of dehydration. For hyponatremic dehydration, such as from vomiting or diarrhea, urinary sodium will be less than 10 mmol/L due to increased sodium retention by the kidneys in an effort to conserve water. In dehydrated patients with sodium loss due to diuretics or renal dysfunction, urinary sodium may be elevated above 20 mmol/L. Patients may also have elevated serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Both of these molecules are normally excreted by the kidney, but when the circulating blood volume is low, the kidney can become injured. This causes decreased kidney function and results in elevated BUN and creatinine in the serum. 

== Prevention ==
For routine activities, thirst is normally an adequate guide to maintain proper hydration. Minimum water intake will vary individually depending on weight, energy expenditure, age, sex, physical activity, environment, diet, and genetics. With exercise, exposure to hot environments, or a decreased thirst response, additional water may be required. In athletes in competition, drinking to thirst optimizes performance and safety, despite weight loss, and as of 2010, there was no scientific study showing that it is beneficial to stay ahead of thirst and maintain weight during exercise.

In warm or humid weather, or during heavy exertion, water loss can increase markedly, because humans have a large and widely variable capacity for sweating. Whole-body sweat losses in men can exceed 2 L/h during competitive sport, with rates of 3–4 L/h observed during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in the heat. When such large amounts of water are being lost through perspiration, electrolytes, especially sodium, are also being lost.

In most athletes exercising and sweating for 4–5 hours with a sweat sodium concentration of less than 50 mmol/L, the total sodium lost is less than 10% of total body stores (total stores are approximately 2,500 mmol, or 58 g for a 70-kg person). These losses appear to be well tolerated by most people. The inclusion of sodium in fluid replacement drinks has some theoretical benefits and poses little or no risk, so long as these fluids are hypotonic (since the mainstay of dehydration prevention is the replacement of free water losses).

== Treatment ==

The most effective treatment for minor dehydration is widely considered to be drinking water and reducing fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can be replenished. Consumption of solid foods can also contribute to hydration. It is estimated approximately 22% of American water intake comes from food. Urine concentration and frequency will return to normal as dehydration resolves.

In some cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and electrolytes (through oral rehydration therapy, or fluid replacement by intravenous therapy). As oral rehydration is less painful, non-invasive, inexpensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration. Solutions used for intravenous rehydration may be isotonic,hypertonic, or hypotonic depending on the cause of dehydration as well as the sodium concentration in the blood. Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes).

When fresh water is unavailable (e.g. at sea or in a desert), seawater or drinks with significant alcohol concentration will worsen dehydration. Urine contains a lower solute concentration than seawater; this requires the kidneys to create more urine to remove the excess salt, causing more water to be lost than was consumed from seawater. If a person is dehydrated and taken to a medical facility, IVs can also be used.

For severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other severely inhibiting symptoms are present (the patient is incapable of standing upright or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is normal in all but the most extreme cases.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for dehydration depends on the cause and extent of dehydration. Mild dehydration normally resolves with oral hydration. Chronic dehydration, such as from physically demanding jobs or decreased thirst, can lead to chronic kidney disease. Elderly people with dehydration are at higher risk of confusion, urinary tract infections, falls, and even delayed wound healing. In children with mild to moderate dehydration, oral hydration is adequate for a full recovery.

<text>Great Budworth is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England, north of Northwich off the A559 road, east of Comberbach, northwest of Higher Marston and southeast of Budworth Heath. Until 1948, Great Budworth was part of the Arley Hall estate. At the 2021 census, the population of the parish was 302.

==Etymology==
According to Sir Peter Leycester, the name Great Budworth comes from the Old Saxon words &quot;bode&quot; (&quot;dwelling&quot;) and &quot;wurth&quot; (&quot;a place by water&quot;).

==History==
The early history of Great Budworth is documented in the Domesday Book of 1086, which mentions a priest at Great Budworth. In 1130, St Mary and All Saints Church was given to the Augustinian canon of Norton Priory by William FitzNigel, Constable of Chester and Baron of Halton.

The lord of the manor during the reign of Henry III was Geoffrey de Dutton. He donated to Norton Priory a third of his land to endow masses for his soul. After the dissolution of the monasteries, King Henry VIII granted the estate to John Grimsditch. It was afterwards divided into several parcels.

There may have been a school in Great Budworth as early as 1563, but certainly one existed by 1578. For centuries, the village was owned by the head of Arley Hall who would collect rent from the villagers. Rowland Egerton-Warburton of Arley Hall paid for restorations and improvements to the church in the 1850s. Egerton-Warburton also undertook a &quot;campaign to render it (the village) picturesque in Victorian eyes&quot;. To this end he commissioned architects including William Nesfield and John Douglas to work on buildings in the village. Douglas remodelled the George and Dragon inn in 1875, and restored some of the cottages.

A running pump was the only source of drinking water for the whole community until 1934 when a piped supply was first connected. Until 1948, Great Budworth was part of the Arley Hall estate.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Great Budworth, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Great Budworth Parish Council and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The parish council meets at the Parish Hall on Smithy Lane.

===Administrative history===
Great Budworth was an ancient parish. It was in length, and by land area it was the second largest parish in Cheshire, after Prestbury. The parish straddled the hundreds of Bucklow, Eddisbury and Northwich. It was subdivided into 35 townships:

*Allostock
*Anderton
*Antrobus
*Appleton
*Aston by Budworth
*Barnton
*Bartington
*Birches
*Castle Northwich
*Cogshall
*Comberbach
*Crowley
*Dutton
*Great Budworth
*Hartford
*Higher Whitley
*Hulse
*Lach Dennis
*Little Leigh
*Lostock Gralam
*Lower Whitley
*Marbury
*Marston
*Nether Peover
*Northwich
*Peover Inferior
*Pickmere
*Plumley
*Rudheath
*Seven Oaks
*Stretton
*Tabley Inferior
*Wincham
*Winnington
*Witton cum Twambrooks
Several of the townships had chapels of ease, a notable example being St Helen&#x27;s Church at Witton, built in the 14th century to serve the southern townships of Great Budworth parish, including Northwich.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Great Budworth, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes.

==Geography==

Great Budworth is approached from the main Warrington to Northwich road about from Northwich, along a ridge overlooking two meres, Budworth to the west and Pickmere to the east.

===Flora and fauna===
In the Middle Ages, Budworth Mere was used as a fish hatchery. Stocked with bream and pike, its reeds shelter breeding reed warblers and great crested grebes. Other avifauna includes mallards and coots.

==Landmarks==
The Grade I listed St Mary and All Saints Church is in the village. Arley Hall, a historic house, is nearby. Also of note in the area are the George and Dragon and Cock o&#x27; Budworth public houses, 54–57 High Street, Dene Cottages, Goldmine House and Belmont Hall.

===St Mary and All Saints&#x27; Church===
St Mary and All Saints&#x27; Church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Great Budworth. Clifton-Taylor includes it in his list of best English parish churches. Richards describes it as &quot;one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture remaining in Cheshire&quot;. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered it to be &quot;one of the most satisfactory Perpendicular churches in Cheshire&quot;. In the north chapel is a memorial to Sir Peter Leicester, the 17th-century historian, and in the Warburton Chapel is the alabaster effigy of Sir John Warburton who died in 1575. In the north chapel is an organ designed by Samuel Renn, installed in 1839.

===Houses===
Goldmine House and its attached cottage (Rose Cottage), designated as a Grade II listed building, were built in 1870 for Rowland Egerton-Warburton of Arley Hall and were designed by the Chester architect John Douglas. Built with brown brick with some timber framing, and clay tile roofs the house faces west. It is a double storied building with two gabled bays. The cottage is simple in form with a dormer and blue brick diapering.

Dene Cottages, a Grade II listed pair of cottages, were built in 1867–68, again for Rowland Egerton-Warburton and by Douglas. The lower storeys are constructed in brown brick. The upper storeys are timber-framed with plaster panels. The roof is in clay tiles. The plaster panels are pargetted with floral motifs.

Belmont Hall in this parish was built by J. H. Smith-Barry Esq., who deposited in it his valuable collection of pictures and statues, afterwards removed to Marbury. Smith-Barry sold it to Henry Clarke. Built in 1755 and designed by James Gibbs, it is a Grade I listed building. As of 2020 it is occupied by Cransley School.

===George and Dragon pub===

The George and Dragon pub, another Grade II listed building, was initially built as a simple three-bay Georgian inn. In 1875, John Douglas was commissioned to restore it by Egerton-Warburton. He added tall rubbed chimneys, mullioned windows and a steep pyramidal turret. The double-storied inn has bays built in brick with a roughcast rendering on the upper storey. It has clay tiled covered hipped roofs. Its other architectural features comprise a projecting two-storey porch with oak post-and-rail fence inscribed with a number of sayings on either side, lateral bay with four-light mullioned window in the lower storey and a three-light mullioned window in the upper storey, a tall rubbed brick chimneystack, and the inn sign located diagonally from the right corner. The inn continues to function as a public house and restaurant. In 2015 the pub was used as a location in the video game &quot;&quot; by developer Baggy Cat.

===54–57 High Street===
54–57 High Street is a row of four Grade II listed dwellings in the High Street, built in the early 18th century. They were refaced and partly rebuilt for Rowland Egerton-Warburton of Arley Hall by John Douglas in 1870 or 1875. The two outer buildings are houses and the two central buildings are cottages. They are built in brown brick with clay tile roofs, and have two storeys plus attics. Each building has a gable, those on the outer buildings larger than those on the inner, all decorated with brick and plaster.

==Culture==
The Soul Cakers Play is a seasonal folk play performed in the village every November which brings together the whole community. It features Saint George, the Black Knight and a Hobby Horse. In Great Budworth, the &quot;soul cake&quot; may be a glass of beer or other sustenance; into it comes the devil, or Beelzebub, now &quot;Belshy Bob&quot;. The village is a popular location for films and television including &quot;Cluedo&quot;, and more recently a NatWest advert and the 2019 BBC drama &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.

<text>De Pinte () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. Before its existence as an independent municipality in 1868, De Pinte was a part of Nazareth. The municipality comprises the towns of De Pinte proper and Zevergem. In 2021, De Pinte had a total population of 10,990. The total area is 17.78 km².

==History==
The name of the municipality is issued from an inn, which was called &quot;Het Pijntken&quot;, which was situated in the actual Pintestraat 69, and which was firstly used as the name of the municipality when it became independent of Nazareth on 2. June 1868 and it was called &#x27;Little Nazareth&quot; at that time. At the end of the 19th century many horticultural companies came in this area and further on in the 20th century, they were all parceled out. De Pinte became also a train station between Ghent and Kortrijk (as from 1839) and Ghent-Oudenaarde (as from 1857). The territory remained a vast stretch of moorland of the Abbey of Ghent Saint-Peter, which was called Scheldevelde. As from the 13th century, there was in the east of the current village center, a mining farm located, in which activities started from the 18th century with a systematic exploration. On the Ferrari-map from the 1770s, the place appears as a rural area with scattered hamlets and country estates. In the place of the current center, the map still shows the hamlet Pintestraete. In 1791 there was already a first request for the establishment of an auxiliary church. Its construction was started, but was soon stopped due to the French occupation.

The colours of De Pinte are red and white. The flag can be described as semi-red and semi-white, with a shield and three eight-pointed stars of gold (2:1), next to twelve silver blocks (4:1:7). The ratios are 2:3.

When the community was founded at the end of the Ancien Régime, the area was part of the community of Nazareth. Sometimes, the village was called &quot;Little Nazareth&quot;. Already in the Dutch period (1829) a request for autonomy was presented under the name &quot;William Village&quot;, but was refused. In 1838, new plans for a church were approved and 1839, a first church was consecrated. In the middle of the 19th century, De Pinte intersected by railway lines, the railway Ghent-Kortrijk (1839) and Ghent-Oudenaarde (1857). A railway station was opened De Pinte. On 2 June 1868, the community became independent of Nazareth and became an independent municipality under the name De Pinte. Late 19th century, there were a number of horticultural establishments, which were executed later in the twentieth century.

In 1977, the former municipalities of De Pinte and Zevergem were joined into the new municipality De Pinte. The whimsical south border of the municipality was straightened by boundary adjustments until the Scheldt.

The municipality comprised the towns of Lovendegem proper and Vinderhoute. In 2018, Lovendegem had a total population of 9,574. The total area is 19.48 km2.

== History ==
The name of the town was first recorded as &quot;Lovendenghiem&quot; in 1150, but there are traces of human settlements back to the Iron Age. The name means &quot;settlement of the people of Lubantos (person)&quot;. Lovendegem used to be a complicated patchwork of &quot;heerlijkheden&quot; (landed estates) and one barony. The religious wars of the late 16th century and the subsequent repression by the Iron Duke caused a near abandonment of Lovendegem. For most of its history, it was an agricultural community. From the 1960s onwards, Lovendegem developed into a residential town. and experienced a steady population growth.

The Ghent-Bruges Canal crosses the municipality, with the town of Lovendegem to the north of the canal, and Vinderhoute to the south.

<doc id="155068" wikidata="Q696355" url="?curid=155068" title="Melle, Belgium">
<text>Melle () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the villages of and Melle proper. On 1 January 2018 Melle had a total population of 11,574. The total area is 15.21 km² which gives a population density of 761 inhabitants per km².

Melle was mentioned in documents in 830, although the archeological findings prove the region was inhabited long before that date.

The name Melle has two possible derivations: the Celtic word &quot;melina&quot; means &quot;brown water&quot;; the prehistoric name &quot;Melinos&quot; means &quot;honey yellow&quot;.

The village of Melle consists of three regions: Melle-Centre, Melle-Vogelhoek and Gontrode (since the fusion in 1976).

One of its famous products is the Delirium Tremens beer, bottled by the Huyghe brewery. This beer is exported worldwide and was voted &quot;Best beer in the world&quot; in 1998 at the World Beer Championships in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Miss Belgium 2000, Joke van de Velde grew up and went to high school in Melle.

The College van de paters Jozefieten, founded in 1837 by canon Constant Van Crombrugghe is known all around the country. Several Belgian and international celebrities went to this school (e.g. Cédric Van Branteghem (runner), a brother of Princess Mathilde). It was the first school in Belgium where a commercial science and an industrial science course were offered. An Irish student brought along a football in 1863. This was the first football to reach the European continent.

The village gained more national fame thanks to the TV show &quot;Schalkse Ruiters&quot;, which featured host Bart De Pauw playing a comedy character named &quot;The Man from Melle&quot; and who claimed to be from the (then non-existent) &quot;Koekoekstraat nr. 70 in Melle&quot;. At a certain point the city council decided to name one of their new streets &quot;Koekoekstraat&quot; and painted a door with house number 70 on the wall.

<text>Marston is a village and civil parish within the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester, in Cheshire, North West England. It is sited beside the River Weaver, close to Anderton and the Anderton Boat Lift. The nearest major settlement is Manchester, which lies to the north-east. It is the site of the Lion Salt Works, which is now an industrial museum.

==Landscape==
Marston lies west of the Peak District on the Cheshire Plain. Superficial Alluvium deposits on the West side of Marston has produced higher, fluctuating topography in this area as well as glaciofluvial deposits on the South side producing a ridge by Wincham Brook. The surrounding flat areas are composed of Devensian Till.

==History==
One of Marston&#x27;s defining features is its old salt mine. First worked on since around 1777, the mine covers an excavated area of 85 acres.

In 1884:

:&quot;one salt mine, the most noticeable, was visited by the Emperor Nicholas of Russia&quot;.

Since then the mine has been illuminated with over 10,000 lights, used for banquets and visited by distinguished members of the British Association in 1854. The new lighting and visit by the British Association attracted almost 1,000 individuals to the mine in one day.

In 1874 the Church of St Paul was erected. Designed by Mr. Douglas, architect of Chester, in the Early English style, it consists of an organ chamber on the south side, nave, north aisle with porch and a low spire and turret containing one bell.

==Population, institutional and occupational history==
Historically Marston was a Township in the Great Budworth Parish (Bucklow Hundred, SJ 6776) and became a Civil Parish in 1866. Between 1837 and 2009 Marston had been part of 5 Registration districts- Northwhich (1837–1974), Vale Royal (1974–1998), Cheshire Central (1998–2007), Cheshire (2007–2009) and Cheshire West and Chester (2009+). In 1889 Marston&#x27;s area was reduced by 272 acres due to a boundary change- Wincham, east of Marston, gained this area which included 18 individuals as well as Jackson&#x27;s and Barber&#x27;s Farm.
Marston had a population of 538 according to the 2011 census.

In 1881 the primary occupation (making up 12.4% of the total population) was &quot;Worker in Mineral Substances&quot;. This large section of employment would have been due to Marstons extensive salt mine. At this time period workers in this industry where all male- 23% of males worked in this industry in 1881.

<text>Drakar och Demoner (Swedish for &quot;Dragons and Demons&quot;, in Sweden commonly referred to by the abbreviation &quot;DoD&quot;) is a Swedish fantasy role-playing game first published in 1982 by the game publishing company Äventyrsspel (&quot;Adventure Games&quot;, later renamed Target Games).

The latest three editions of the game have been localised into English under the names of Trudvang Chronicles, Ruin Masters and Dragonbane.

== Development history ==
&quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; has its origins in the Swedish recreational wargaming scene. Target Games, the company that went on to publish &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot;, was founded in 1980 to import and sell wargames. One of the founders of Target Games, Fredrik Malmberg, moved to the United States in order to import wargames to Sweden, while also working for various game publishers. There he came in contact with the burgeoning role-playing game scene in the United States.

Seeing that role-playing games were much more popular in the US than wargames, Malmberg got the idea that Target Games should publish a Swedish language role-playing game. (English language role-playing games like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; had made some inroads in Sweden at the time, but the language barrier prevented them from reaching a larger audience.) Malmberg (who rented a room from Steve Perrin during his stay in the California) was one of the game testers of the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;Stormbringer&quot; role-playing games and had access to the unpublished manuscript of the upcoming &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; multi-genre set of three role-playing games.

Malmberg states that he was influenced by working with Chaosium&#x27;s rules sets, and considered &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules to be inferior and obsolete. Target Games bought a license to publish Chaosium&#x27;s &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; combined with the fantasy-themed &quot;Magic World&quot; booklet from &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; to create a new Swedish language role-playing game: &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot;. Since Target Games was a reseller of games and not a publisher, Target Games&#x27; board decided to found a separate arm of the company that would publish games, and they named it &quot;Äventyrspel&quot;.

The second edition was published in 1984, rewriting the text from scratch, fixing many translation errors, glitches in the rules, with no other major changes made. One of the available player races, the anthropomorphic ducks, was incorporated from Glorantha.

A rules transition began in 1985, not with the third edition which mostly corrected spelling errors, but with the publication of an &quot;Expert&quot; rule expansion: &quot;Drakar och Demoner Expert&quot;. Among other things it introduced hit locations, and the use of a 20-sided die instead of the percentile die for skill rolls.

The fourth edition in 1991 was a major revision of the rules, superseding &quot;Drakar och Demoner Expert&quot; by incorporating it into the basic rules and then expanding them.

In 1994, Target Games released a fifth edition, called &quot;Drakar och Demoner Chronopia&quot;. This edition came with an integrated campaign setting. Changes to the rules were minor, mostly reflecting the new setting.

In the late 1990s, Target Games found itself in financial difficulties and discontinued their line of role-playing games. The rights to &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; were transferred to Paradox Entertainment, who in turn licensed them to RiotMinds. RiotMinds published a new version of the game in 2000. This sixth edition was a complete overhaul of the game rules, supporting a much less generic game world. The idea of &quot;Expert&quot; rules was reused, and many rules expansions followed.

When RiotMinds released their &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; ruleset, it featured a concept very close to levels (&quot;yrkesnivåer&quot;). It didn&#x27;t take long before an official addendum appeared on their website, with optional rules on how to play without this feature. In the subsequent reprints (as well as later editions) little or no traces of &quot;yrkesnivåer&quot; remain.

In 2006, RiotMinds published the seventh edition, which has many rule changes to better support its campaign world. Among those were the removal of the basic character stats (&quot;grundegenskaper&quot;) which were replaced with &#x27;exceptional abilities&#x27; (&quot;exceptionella karaktärsdrag&quot;), and the introduction of specializations of skills. This boxed edition is called &quot;Drakar och Demoner Trudvang&quot;.

In 2015 RiotMinds announced a re-release of the 1987 edition of the game featuring new art and minor fixes, but otherwise identical. A line of products including several new campaigns was planned after its August 2016 release. On May 16, 2016, RiotMinds announced that &quot;Drakar och Demoner Trudvang&quot; would be released in an English version, under the name &quot;Trudvang Chronicles&quot;.

In 2019, RiotMinds successfully crowdfunded &quot;Ruin Masters&quot;, an updated and re-designed English version of the classic game, including new art and design. It has cover art by Adrian Smith, and interior art from artists including, Jesper Ejsing, Johan Egerkrans and Alvaro Tapia. &quot;The Ruin Masters Bestiary&quot; was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2021.

In August 2021, RiotMinds announced that it had sold the IP for &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; to Fria Ligan (Free League Publishing). RiotMinds stated they would continue to support their &quot;Ruin Masters&quot; game and its Caldarox setting with no connection to &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot;. Consequently, Free League successfully crowdfunded a new edition of the game in August 2022, called Dragonbane in English. The new edition has English, Swedish, and German language versions.

== Campaign settings ==
Like many other early role-playing games, &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; started out without a fully developed campaign setting.

The first campaign setting of &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; was called Ereb Altor (Ereb being the name of the continent where most – if not all – official adventures take place, Altor being the name of the planet on which Ereb is located). It was created bit by bit by different writers through adventures and source books creating a somewhat haphazard world; medieval feudal states exist side-by-side with comparably advanced Renaissance-styled nations.

With the fifth version Target Games decided to introduce a new, darker campaign setting named Chronopia, thereby ceasing publication of new material for Ereb. After an outcry among fans of Ereb ensued, Target Games decided that Ereb and Chronopia both existed on Altor but on different hemispheres. At this time, a tabletop miniatures game line was also started; see Chronopia below. In 2015, Cabinet Holdings acquired Paradox Entertainment Inc. and all subsidiaries and their properties, including Chronopia.

RiotMinds created a brand-new campaign setting called Trudvang, which utilized cultures, creatures and monsters based on Scandinavian folklore instead of the standard fantasy creatures.

== Other media ==
=== Miniature games ===

First Edition: &quot;Chronopia: Dark Fantasy Battles&quot; (1997) was a tabletop miniature game published by Target Games. Players would field an army composed of 25 mm miniatures which were composed of pewter, resin, or a composite of both. The game featured eight different armies for players to choose from.

Second Edition: &quot;Chronopia: War in the Eternal Realm&quot; (2002) was a tabletop miniature game published by Excelsior Entertainment.

In 2015, Cabinet Holdings acquired Paradox Entertainment Inc. and all subsidiaries and their properties, including Chronopia.

In 2022, German company Uhrwerk Verlag ran a successful crowdfunding-campaign to re-release thetabletop miniature game.

=== Computer game ===
In 1999, a Drakar och Demoner video game was released by the name of &quot;Drakar och Demoner: Själarnas Brunn&quot; (released as &quot;Dragonfire: The Well of Souls&quot; internationally). It was made by then-defunct Swedish developer ComputerHouse GBG AB. The game takes place in the original campaign setting of Ereb Altor six years after the events in the popular adventure trilogy &quot;Den Nidländska Reningen&quot;.

=== Film ===
In 2013, 28 minute short film &quot;Drakar och Demoner – Tronländaren&quot; was released.

<text>Nazareth () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of and Nazareth proper. In 2021, Nazareth had a total population of 11,844. The total area is 35.19 km2 which gives a population density of 320 inhabitants per km2.

== Etymology ==
There are various hypotheses for the origin of the name &quot;Nazareth&quot;, dated to a text of songs from 1259 CE. It is possible that Nazareth was named after the biblical city of Nazareth. It is also possible, but less likely, that Nazareth was originally a slip of the word &quot;magherhet&quot; (thinness).

== History ==

The community was first recorded in 1259.

== Heraldry ==

The arms of Nazareth is a composition of two family crests:

::The first part is the arms of the family Rockolfing: three gold roses geknopt throat in the field, vert scrolled head and a shield charged with a throat depth and looking round lion of gold, tongued gules.

::The second part is the escutcheon of the family Kervyn Volkaersbeke: saber in a twill together right in the head by an acorn, stemmed and browsed in two pieces, left in the mind of a six-pointed star, everything from gold and the one point eagle leg of silver.

<doc id="155094" wikidata="Q493" url="?curid=155094" title="Arthur Rimbaud">
<text>Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud (, ; ; 20 October 1854 – 10 November 1891) was a French poet known for his transgressive and surreal themes and for his influence on modern literature and arts, prefiguring surrealism.

Born in Charleville, he started writing at a very young age and excelled as a student, but abandoned his formal education in his teenage years to run away to Paris amidst the Franco-Prussian War. During his late adolescence and early adulthood, he produced the bulk of his literary output. Rimbaud completely stopped writing literature at age 20 after assembling his last major work, &quot;Illuminations&quot;.

Rimbaud was a libertine and a restless soul, having engaged in a hectic, sometimes violent romantic relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine, which lasted nearly two years. After his retirement as a writer, he travelled extensively on three continents as a merchant and explorer until his death from cancer just after his thirty-seventh birthday. As a poet, Rimbaud is well known for his contributions to symbolism and, among other works, for &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;, a precursor to modernist literature.

== Life ==

=== Family and childhood (1854–1861) ===
Arthur Rimbaud was born in the provincial town of Charleville (now part of Charleville-Mézières) in the Ardennes department in northeastern France. He was the second child of Frédéric Rimbaud (7 October 1814 – 16 November 1878) and Marie Catherine Vitalie Rimbaud (née Cuif; 10 March 1825 – 16 November 1907).

Rimbaud&#x27;s father, a Burgundian of Provençal heritage, was an infantry captain who had risen from the ranks; he had spent much of his army career abroad. He participated in the conquest of Algeria from 1844 to 1850, and in 1854 was awarded the Legion of Honor &quot;by Imperial decree&quot;. Captain Rimbaud was described as &quot;good-tempered, easy-going and generous,&quot; with the long moustache and goatee of a Chasseur officer.

In October 1852, Captain Rimbaud, then aged 38, was transferred to Mézières where he met Vitalie Cuif, 11 years his junior, while on a Sunday stroll. She came from a &quot;solidly established family&quot;, but one with its share of bohemians; two of her brothers were alcoholics. Her personality was the &quot;exact opposite&quot; of Captain Rimbaud&#x27;s; she was reportedly narrowminded, &quot;stingy and ... completely lacking in a sense of humour&quot;. When Charles Houin, an early biographer, interviewed her, he found her &quot;withdrawn, stubborn and taciturn&quot;. Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s private name for her was &quot;Mouth of Darkness&quot; ().

On 8 February 1853, Captain Rimbaud and Vitalie Cuif married; their first-born, Jean Nicolas Frédéric (&quot;Frédéric&quot;), arrived nine months later on 2 November. The next year, on 20 October 1854, Jean Nicolas Arthur (&quot;Arthur&quot;) was born. Three more children followed: Victorine-Pauline-Vitalie on 4 June 1857 (who died a few weeks later), Jeanne-Rosalie-Vitalie (&quot;Vitalie&quot;) on 15 June 1858 and, finally, Frédérique Marie Isabelle (&quot;Isabelle&quot;) on 1 June 1860.

Though the marriage lasted seven years, Captain Rimbaud lived continuously in the matrimonial home for less than three months, from February to May 1853. The rest of the time his military postings—including active service in the Crimean War and the Sardinian Campaign (with medals earned in both)—meant he returned home to Charleville only when on leave. He was not at home for his children&#x27;s births, nor their baptisms. Isabelle&#x27;s birth in 1860 must have been the last straw, as after this Captain Rimbaud stopped returning home on leave altogether. Though they never divorced, the separation was complete; thereafter Mme Rimbaud let herself be known as &quot;widow Rimbaud&quot; and Captain Rimbaud would describe himself as a widower. Neither the captain nor his children showed the slightest interest in re-establishing contact.

=== Schooling and teen years (1861–1871) ===
Fearing her children were being over-influenced by the neighbouring children of the poor, Mme Rimbaud moved her family to the Cours d&#x27;Orléans in 1862. This was a better neighbourhood, and the boys, now aged nine and eight, who had been taught at home by their mother, were now sent to the Pension Rossat, an old but well-regarded school. Throughout the five years that they attended the school, however, their formidable mother still imposed her will upon them, pushing them for scholastic success. She would punish her sons by making them learn a hundred lines of Latin verse by heart, and further punish any mistakes by depriving them of meals. When Arthur was nine, he wrote a 700-word essay objecting to his having to learn Latin in school. Vigorously condemning a classical education as a mere gateway to a salaried position, he wrote repeatedly, &quot;I will be a rentier&quot;. Arthur disliked schoolwork and resented his mother&#x27;s constant supervision; the children were not allowed out of their mother&#x27;s sight, and until they were fifteen and sixteen respectively, she would walk them home from school.
As a boy, Arthur Rimbaud was small and pale with light brown hair, and eyes that his lifelong best friend, Ernest Delahaye, described as &quot;pale blue irradiated with dark blue—the loveliest eyes I&#x27;ve seen&quot;. An ardent Catholic like his mother, he had his First Communion when he was eleven. His piety earned him the schoolyard nickname &quot;. That same year, he and his brother were sent to the . Up to then, his reading had been largely confined to the Bible, though he had also enjoyed fairy tales and adventure stories, such as the novels of James Fenimore Cooper and Gustave Aimard. At the Collège he became a highly successful student, heading his class in all subjects except mathematics and the sciences; his schoolmasters remarked upon his ability to absorb great quantities of material. He won eight first prizes in the French academic competitions in 1869, including the prize for Religious Education, and the following year won seven first prizes.

Hoping for a brilliant academic career for her second son, Mme Rimbaud hired a private tutor for Arthur when he reached the third grade. Father Ariste Lhéritier succeeded in sparking in the young scholar a love of Greek, Latin and French classical literature, and was the first to encourage the boy to write original verse, in both French and Latin. Rimbaud&#x27;s first poem to appear in print was &quot; (&quot;The Orphans&#x27; New Year&#x27;s Gifts&quot;), which was published in the 2 January 1870 issue of ; he was just 15.

Two weeks later, a new teacher of rhetoric, the 22-year-old Georges Izambard, started at the Collège de Charleville. Izambard became Rimbaud&#x27;s mentor, and soon a close friendship formed between teacher and student, with Rimbaud seeing Izambard as a kind of elder brother. At the age of 15, Rimbaud was showing maturity as a poet; the first poem he showed Izambard, &quot;&quot;, would later be included in anthologies, and is often regarded as one of Rimbaud&#x27;s three or four best poems. On 4 May 1870, Rimbaud&#x27;s mother wrote to Izambard to object to his having given Rimbaud Victor Hugo&#x27;s to read, as she thought the book dangerous to the morals of a child.

The Franco-Prussian War, between Napoleon III&#x27;s Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, broke out on 19 July 1870. Five days later, Izambard left Charleville for the summer to stay with his three aunts – the Misses Gindre – in Douai. In the meantime, preparations for war continued and the Collège de Charleville became a military hospital. By the end of August, with the countryside in turmoil, Rimbaud was bored and restless. In search of adventure he ran away by train to Paris without funds for his ticket. On arrival at the , he was arrested and locked up in Mazas Prison to await trial for fare evasion and vagrancy. On 5 September, Rimbaud wrote a desperate letter to Izambard, who arranged with the prison governor that Rimbaud be released into his care. As hostilities were continuing, he stayed with the Misses Gindre in Douai until he could be returned to Charleville. Izambard finally handed Rimbaud over to Mme Rimbaud on 27 September 1870 (his mother reportedly slapped him in the face and admonished Izambard), but he was at home for only ten days before running away again.

From late October 1870, Rimbaud&#x27;s behaviour became openly provocative; he drank alcohol, spoke rudely, composed scatological poems, stole books from local shops, and abandoned his characteristically neat appearance by allowing his hair to grow long. On 13 and 15 May 1871, he wrote letters (later called the by scholars), to Izambard and his friend Paul Demeny respectively, about his method for attaining poetical transcendence or visionary power through a &quot;long, immense and rational derangement of all the senses&quot; (to Demeny). &quot;The sufferings are enormous, but one must be strong, be born a poet, and I have recognized myself as a poet&quot; (to Izambard).

=== Life with Verlaine (1871–1875) ===
Rimbaud wrote to several famous poets but received either no reply or a disappointing mere acknowledgement (as from Théodore de Banville), so his friend, office employee Charles Auguste Bretagne, advised him to write to Paul Verlaine, a rising poet (and future leader of the Symbolist movement) who had published two well-regarded collections. Rimbaud sent Verlaine two letters with several of his poems, including the hypnotic, finally shocking &quot;Le Dormeur du Val&quot; (&quot;The Sleeper in the Valley&quot;), in which Nature is called upon to comfort an apparently sleeping soldier. Verlaine was intrigued by Rimbaud, and replied, &quot;Come, dear great soul. We await you; we desire you&quot;, sending him a one-way ticket to Paris. Rimbaud arrived in late September 1871 and resided briefly in Verlaine&#x27;s home. Verlaine&#x27;s wife, Mathilde Mauté, was seventeen years old and pregnant, and Verlaine had recently left his job and started drinking. In later published recollections of his first sight of Rimbaud at the age of sixteen, Verlaine described him as having &quot;the real head of a child, chubby and fresh, on a big, bony, rather clumsy body of a still-growing adolescent&quot;, with a &quot;very strong Ardennes accent that was almost a dialect&quot;. His voice had &quot;highs and lows as if it were breaking&quot;.

Rimbaud and Verlaine soon began a brief and torrid affair. They led a wild, vagabond-like life spiced by absinthe, opium, and hashish. The Parisian literary coterie was scandalized by Rimbaud, whose behaviour was that of the archetypal &quot;enfant terrible&quot;, yet throughout this period he continued to write poems. Their stormy relationship eventually brought them to London in September 1872, a period over which Rimbaud would later express regret. During this time, Verlaine abandoned his wife and infant son (both of whom he had abused in his alcoholic rages). In London they lived in considerable poverty in Bloomsbury and in Camden Town, scraping a living mostly from teaching, as well as with an allowance from Verlaine&#x27;s mother. Rimbaud spent his days in the Reading Room of the British Museum where &quot;heating, lighting, pens and ink were free&quot;. The relationship between the two poets grew increasingly bitter, and Verlaine abandoned Rimbaud in London to meet his wife in Brussels.
Rimbaud was not well-liked at the time, and many people thought of him as dirty and rude. The artist Henri Fantin-Latour wanted to paint first division poets at the 1872 Salon, but they were not available. He had to settle for Rimbaud and Verlaine, who were described as &quot;geniuses of the tavern&quot;. The painting, &quot;By the table&quot;, shows Rimbaud and Verlaine at the end of the table. Other writers, such as Albert Mérat, refused to be painted with Verlaine and Rimbaud, Mérat&#x27;s reason being that he &quot;would not be painted with pimps and thieves&quot;, in reference to Verlaine and Rimbaud; in the painting, Mérat is replaced by a flower vase on the table. Mérat also spread many rumours in the salons that Verlaine and Rimbaud were sleeping together; the spread of those rumours was the commencement of the fall for the two poets, who were trying to build a good reputation for themselves.

In late June 1873, Verlaine returned to Paris alone but quickly began to mourn Rimbaud&#x27;s absence. On 8 July he telegraphed Rimbaud, asking him to come to the Grand Hôtel Liégeois in Brussels. The reunion went badly, they argued continuously, and Verlaine took refuge in heavy drinking. On the morning of 10 July, Verlaine bought a revolver and ammunition. About 16:00, &quot;in a drunken rage&quot;, he fired two shots at Rimbaud, one of them wounding the 18-year-old in the left wrist.

Rimbaud initially dismissed the wound as superficial but had it dressed at the St-Jean hospital nevertheless. He did not immediately file charges, but decided to leave Brussels. About 20:00, Verlaine and his mother accompanied Rimbaud to the Gare du Midi railway station. On the way, by Rimbaud&#x27;s account, Verlaine &quot;behaved as if he were insane&quot;. Fearing that Verlaine, with a pistol in the pocket, might shoot him again, Rimbaud &quot;ran off&quot; and &quot;begged a policeman to arrest him&quot;. Verlaine was charged with attempted murder, then subjected to a humiliating medico-legal examination. He was also interrogated about his correspondence with Rimbaud and the nature of their relationship. The bullet was eventually removed on 17 July and Rimbaud withdrew his complaint. The charges were reduced to wounding with a firearm, and on 8 August 1873 Verlaine was sentenced to two years in prison.

Rimbaud returned home to Charleville and completed his prose work &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot; (&quot;A Season in Hell&quot;)—still widely regarded as a pioneering example of modern Symbolist writing. In the work, it is widely interpreted that he refers to Verlaine as his &quot;pitiful brother&quot; (&quot;frère pitoyable&quot;) and the &quot;mad virgin&quot; (&quot;vierge folle&quot;), and to himself as the &quot;hellish husband&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;époux infernal&quot;), and described their life together as a &quot;domestic farce&quot; (&quot;drôle de ménage&quot;).

In 1874, he returned to London with the poet Germain Nouveau. They lived together for three months while he put together his groundbreaking &quot;Illuminations&quot;, a collection of prose poems, although he eventually did not see it through publication (it only got published in 1886, without the author&#x27;s knowledge).

=== Travels (1875–1880) ===
Rimbaud and Verlaine met for the last time in March 1875, in Stuttgart, after Verlaine&#x27;s release from prison and his conversion to Catholicism. By then Rimbaud had given up literature in favour of a steady, working life. Stéphane Mallarmé, in a text about Rimbaud from 1896 (after his death), described him as a &quot;meteor, lit by no other reason than his presence, arising alone then vanishing&quot; who had managed to &quot;surgically remove poetry from himself while still alive&quot;. Albert Camus, in &quot;L&#x27;homme révolté&quot;, although he praised Rimbaud&#x27;s literary works (particularly his later prose works, &quot;Une saison en enfer&quot; and &quot;Illuminations&quot; – &quot;he is the poet of revolt, and the greatest&quot;), wrote a scathing account of his resignation from literature – and revolt itself – in his later life, claiming that there is nothing to admire, nothing noble or even genuinely adventurous, in a man who committed a &quot;spiritual suicide&quot;, became a &quot;bourgeois trafficker&quot; and consented to the materialistic order of things.

After studying several languages (German, Italian, Spanish), he went on to travel extensively in Europe, mostly on foot. In May 1876 he enlisted as a soldier in the Dutch Colonial Army to get free passage to Java in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Four months later he deserted and fled into the jungle. He managed to return &quot;incognito&quot; to France by ship; as a deserter he would have faced a Dutch firing squad had he been caught.

In December 1878, Rimbaud journeyed to Larnaca in Cyprus, where he worked for a construction company as a stone quarry foreman. In May of the following year he had to leave Cyprus because of a fever, which on his return to France was diagnosed as typhoid.

=== Abyssinia (1880–1891) ===

Rimbaud finally settled in Aden, Yemen, in 1880, as a main employee in the Bardey agency, going on to run the firm&#x27;s agency in Harar, Ethiopia. In 1884, his &quot;Report on the Ogaden&quot; (based on notes from his assistant Constantin Sotiro) was presented and published by the Société de Géographie in Paris. In the same year he left his job at Bardey&#x27;s to become a merchant on his own account in Harar, where his commercial dealings included coffee and (generally outdated) firearms.
At the same time, Rimbaud engaged in exploring and struck up a close friendship with the Governor of Harar, &quot;Ras&quot; Mekonnen Wolde Mikael Wolde Melekot, father of future emperor Haile Selassie. He maintained friendly relations with the official tutor of the young heir. Rimbaud worked in the coffee trade. &quot;He was, in fact, a pioneer in the business, the first European to oversee the export of the celebrated coffee of Harar from the country where coffee was born. He was only the third European ever to set foot in the city, and the first to do business there&quot;.

In 1885, Rimbaud became involved in a major deal to sell old rifles to Menelik II, king of Shewa, at the initiative of French merchant Pierre Labatut. The explorer Paul Soleillet became involved early in 1886. The arms were landed at Tadjoura in February, but could not be moved inland because Léonce Lagarde, governor of the new French administration of Obock and its dependencies, issued an order on 12 April 1886 prohibiting the sale of weapons. When the authorization came through from the consul de France, Labatut fell ill and had to withdraw (he died from cancer soon afterwards), then Soleillet died from embolism on 9 October. When Rimbaud finally reached Shewa, Menelik had just scored a major victory and no longer needed these older weapons, but still took advantage of the situation by negotiating them at a much lower price than expected while also deducting presumed debts from Labatut. The whole ordeal turned out to be a disaster.

In the following years, between 1888 and 1890, Rimbaud established his own store in Harar, but soon got bored and dismayed. He hosted explorer Jules Borrelli and merchant Armand Savouré. In their later testimonies, they both described him as an intelligent man, quiet, sarcastic, secretive about his prior life, living with simplicity, and taking care of his business with accuracy, honesty and firmness.

=== Sickness and death (1891) ===

In February 1891, in Aden, Rimbaud developed what he initially thought was arthritis in his right knee. It failed to respond to treatment, and by March had become so painful that he prepared to return to France for better treatment. Before leaving, Rimbaud consulted a British doctor who mistakenly diagnosed tubercular synovitis, and recommended immediate amputation. Rimbaud remained in Aden until 7 May to set his financial affairs in order, then caught a steamer, &quot;L&#x27;Amazone&quot;, back to France for a 13-day voyage. On arrival in Marseille, he was admitted to the Hôpital de la Conception, where, a week later on 27 May, his right leg was amputated. The post-operative diagnosis was bone cancer—probably osteosarcoma.

After a short stay at the family farm in Roche, from 23 July to 23 August, he attempted to travel back to Africa, but on the way his health deteriorated, and he was re-admitted to the Hôpital de la Conception in Marseille. He spent some time there in great pain, attended by his sister Isabelle. He received the last rites from a priest before dying on 10 November 1891, at the age of 37. The remains were sent across France to his home town and he was buried in Charleville-Mézières. On the 100th anniversary of Rimbaud&#x27;s birth, Thomas Bernhard delivered a memorial lecture on Rimbaud and described his end:

== Poetry ==
The first known poems of Arthur Rimbaud mostly emulated the style of the &quot;Parnasse&quot; school and other famous contemporary poets like Victor Hugo, although he quickly developed an original approach, both thematically and stylistically (in particular by mixing profane words and ideas with sophisticated verse, as in &quot;&quot;Vénus Anadyomène&quot;, &quot;Oraison du soir&quot; or &quot;Les chercheuses de poux&quot;&quot;). Later on, Rimbaud was prominently inspired by the work of Charles Baudelaire. This inspiration would help him create a style of poetry later labeled as symbolist.

In May 1871, aged 16, Rimbaud wrote two letters explaining his poetic philosophy, commonly called the &quot;Lettres du voyant&quot; (&quot;Letters of the Seer&quot;). In the first, written 13 May to Izambard, Rimbaud explained:

The second letter, written on 15 May—before his first trip to Paris—to his friend Paul Demeny, expounded his revolutionary theories about poetry and life, while also denouncing some of the most famous poets that preceded him (reserving a particularly harsh criticism for Alfred de Musset, while holding Charles Baudelaire in high regard, although, according to Rimbaud, his vision was hampered by a too conventional style). Wishing for new poetic forms and ideas, he wrote:

Rimbaud expounded the same ideas in his poem &quot;Le Bateau ivre&quot; (&quot;The Drunken Boat&quot;). This hundred-line poem tells the tale of a boat that breaks free of human society when its handlers are killed by &quot;Redskins&quot; (&quot;Peaux-Rouges&quot;). At first, thinking that it is drifting where it pleases, the boat soon realizes that it is being guided by and to the &quot;poem of the sea&quot;. It sees visions both magnificent (&quot;the awakening blue and yellow of singing phosphores&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;éveil jaune et bleu des phosphores chanteurs&quot;) and disgusting (&quot;nets where in the reeds an entire Leviathan was rotting&quot; &quot;nasses / Où pourrit dans les joncs tout un Léviathan&quot;). It ends floating and washed clean, wishing only to sink and become one with the sea.

Archibald MacLeish has commented on this poem: &quot;Anyone who doubts that poetry can say what prose cannot has only to read the so-called &quot;Lettres du Voyant&quot; and &quot;Bateau ivre&quot; together. What is pretentious and adolescent in the &quot;Lettres&quot; is true in the poem—&quot;unanswerably&quot; true.&quot;

While &quot;Le Bateau ivre&quot; was still written in a mostly conventional style, despite its inventions, his later poems from 1872 (commonly called &quot;Derniers vers&quot; or &quot;Vers nouveaux et chansons&quot;, although he did not give them a title) further deconstructed the French verse, introducing odd rhythms and loose rhyming schemes, with even more abstract and flimsy themes.

After &quot;Une saison en enfer&quot;, his &quot;prodigious psychological biography written in this diamond prose which is his exclusive property&quot; (according to Paul Verlaine), a poetic prose in which he himself commented some of his verse poems from 1872, and the perceived failure of his own past endeavours (&quot;Alchimie du verbe&quot;), he went on to write the prose poems known as &quot;Illuminations&quot;, forfeiting preconceived structures altogether to explore hitherto unused resources of poetic language, bestowing most of the pieces with a disjointed, hallucinatory, dreamlike quality. Rimbaud died without the benefit of knowing that his manuscripts not only had been published but were lauded and studied, having finally gained the recognition for which he had striven.

Then he stopped writing poetry altogether. His friend Ernest Delahaye, in a letter to Paul Verlaine around 1875, claimed that he had completely forgotten about his past self writing poetry. French poet and scholar Gérard Macé wrote: &quot;Rimbaud is, first and foremost, this silence that can&#x27;t be forgotten, and which, for anyone attempting to write themselves, is there, haunting. He even forbids us to fall into silence; because he did, this, better than anyone.&quot;

French poet Paul Valéry stated that &quot;all known literature is written in the language of &quot;common sense&quot;—except Rimbaud&#x27;s&quot;. His poetry influenced the Symbolists, Dadaists, and Surrealists, and later writers adopted not only some of his themes but also his inventive use of form and language.

== Letters ==

Rimbaud was a prolific correspondent and his letters provide vivid accounts of his life and relationships. &quot;Rimbaud&#x27;s letters concerning his literary life were first published by various periodicals. In 1931 they were collected and published by Jean-Marie Carré. Many errors were corrected in the [1946] Pléiade edition. The letters written in Africa were first published by Paterne Berrichon, the poet&#x27;s brother-in-law, who took the liberty of making many changes in the texts.&quot;

== Cultural legacy ==

University of Exeter professor Martin Sorrell argues that Rimbaud was and remains influential in not only literary and artistic circles but political spheres as well, having inspired anti-rationalist revolutions in America, Italy, Russia, and Germany. Sorrell praises Rimbaud as a poet whose &quot;reputation stands very high today&quot;, pointing out his influence on musicians Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Patti Smith, and writer Octavio Paz. Dylan has referred to Rimbaud multiple times over his career, including in the track &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go&quot; (1975, on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;).

=== Media portrayals ===
Rimbaud has been depicted in various media, including:
* 1964: Alan Bickford in &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;
* 1971: Nelo Risi&#x27;s film &quot;Una stagione all&#x27;inferno&quot; (A season in hell), with Terence Stamp as Rimbaud and Jean-Claude Brialy as Verlaine.
* 1978: Lorenzo Ferrero&#x27;s opera &quot;Rimbaud, ou Le Fils du soleil&quot; (Rimbaud, or the Child of the Sun)
* 1979: David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s photographic series &quot;Arthur Rimbaud in New York&quot;, which contrasts Rimbaud&#x27;s face with life in New York City in the late 1970s.
* 1995: Agnieszka Holland&#x27;s film &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Rimbaud and David Thewlis as Verlaine.
* 2025: Jessica Benhamou&#x27;s film Alchemy of the Word, starring James Craven as Rimbaud and Jordan Luke Gage as Verlaine.

<text>Cocos Island () is a volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean administered by Costa Rica, approximately southwest of the Costa Rican mainland. It constitutes the 11th of the 15 districts of Puntarenas Canton of the Province of Puntarenas. With an area of approximately , the island is roughly rectangular in shape. It is the southernmost point of geopolitical North America if non-continental islands are included, and the only landmass above water on the Cocos tectonic plate.

The entirety of Cocos Island has been designated a Costa Rican National Park since 1978, and has no permanent inhabitants other than Costa Rican park rangers. As a result, it has been labelled as the world&#x27;s largest uninhabited tropical island. Surrounded by deep waters with counter-currents, Cocos Island is admired by scuba divers for its populations of hammerhead sharks, rays, dolphins and other large marine species. The wet climate and oceanic qualities give Cocos an ecological character that is not shared with either the Galápagos Archipelago or any of the other islands (for example, Malpelo, Gorgona or Coiba) in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Because of the unique ecology of the island and its surrounding waters, Cocos Island National Park became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The island can only be reached by sea, which usually takes 36 to 48 hours.

==Present status and international distinctions==
Cocos Island was declared a Costa Rican National Park by means of an executive decree in 1978 and designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997. In 2002, the World Heritage Site designation was extended to include an expanded marine zone of . In addition, it is included in the list of Wetlands of International Importance. In 2009, Cocos Island was short-listed as a candidate for the New7Wonders of Nature by the New7Wonders of the World Foundation, ranking second in the island category.

Thanks to the great diversity of marine life in its waters, Cocos Island was named one of the best 10 scuba diving spots in the world by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors and a &quot;must do&quot; according to diving experts. Popular dive spots around the island are Bajo Alcyone (hammerhead sharks), Manuelina Garden (coral garden) and Dos Amigos Grande (natural underwater arch formation). For many, the main attractions are the large pelagic fish species, which are very abundant in this unique meeting point between deep and shallow waters. The largest schools of hammerhead sharks in the world are consistently reported there. Encounters with dozens if not hundreds of these and other large animals are nearly certain in every dive. Smaller and colorful species are also abundant in one of the most extensive coral reefs in the southeastern Pacific. Famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau visited the island several times and in 1994 called it &quot;the most beautiful island in the world&quot;. Such accolades have highlighted the urgent need to protect Cocos Island and its surrounding waters from illegal large-scale fishing, poaching and other threats.

The only persons allowed to live on Cocos Island are Costa Rican park rangers, who have established two encampments, including one at English Bay. Access by civilians is very limited; tourists and ship crew members are allowed ashore only with permission of island rangers, and are not permitted to camp, stay overnight or collect any flora, fauna or minerals from the island. Occasional amateur radio DXpeditions are allowed to visit.

The island is also very popular in pirate lore. It is said that over 300 expeditions have searched for buried treasure there, such as the hoard of Benito Bonito, the Treasure of Lima, and many others. Some small caches have been discovered, leading many to believe that the stories of vast pirate treasures are true, though the majority of searches have been unsuccessful. Treasure hunting is strictly prohibited by the Costa Rican government and permits are not being issued.

===Hermandad Marine Reserve===

In 2022 Ecuadorean President Guillermo Lasso announced the expansion of the Galápagos Marine Reserve by 50%, adding to protect submarine mountains northeast of the islands as the Hermandad Marine Reserve. It will connect with the protected area around Cocos Island.

==Geology and landscape==


Cocos Island is an oceanic island of both volcanic and tectonic origin. It is the only emergent island of the Cocos Plate, one of the minor tectonic plates. Potassium–argon dating established the age of the oldest rocks between 1.91 and 2.44 million years and it is composed primarily of basalt, which is formed by cooling lava. Cocos Island is the emergent summit of a Pliocene and Pleistocene shield volcano along the central part of the aseismic Cocos Ridge. It contains a caldera inside which is a lava dome of trachytic composition. The most recent eruptions on Cocos Island originated from northeast-trending fissures which were the sources of lava flows.

The island is approximately rectangular in shape, measuring about with a perimeter of around . The landscape is mountainous and irregular; the highest point is Cerro Iglesias, at . In spite of its mountainous character, there are flatter areas between in elevation in the center of the island, which are said to be a transitional stage of the geomorphological cycle of V-shaped valleys.

Cocos Island has a number of short rivers and streams that drain abundant rainfall into four bays, three of them on the north side (Wafer, Chatham and Weston). The largest rivers are the Genio and the Pittier, which drain their water into Wafer Bay. Sheer, cliffs ring much of the island, preventing convenient access except at a few beaches; the easiest point of entry is at Chatham Bay. The mountainous landscape and the tropical climate combine to create over 200 waterfalls throughout the island. The island’s soils are classified as entisols, which are highly acidic and would be easily eroded by the island’s high rainfall on the steep slopes were it not for the dense forest coverage.

==Climate==

The climate of Cocos Island is mostly determined by the latitudinal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which creates cloudiness and precipitation that is constant throughout the year. This makes the climate humid and tropical with an average annual temperature of and an average annual rainfall of over . Rainfall remains high throughout the year, although lowers somewhat from January through March and again during late September and October. Numerous oceanic currents from the central Pacific Ocean, particularly the North Equatorial Countercurrent, converge on the island and also have an important influence. The island has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af).

==Ecology==

Cocos Island is home to dense tropical moist forests. It is the only oceanic island in the eastern Pacific region with such rain forests and their characteristic types of flora and fauna. The cloud forests present at its higher elevations are also unique in the eastern Pacific. The island was never linked to a continent, so the flora and fauna arrived via long-distance dispersal from the Americas, and the island therefore has a high proportion of endemic species.

===Flora===

The island has 235 known species of flowering plants, of which 70 are endemic. A good comprehensive study on the flora of the island is provided in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences&quot;. Additionally, 74 species of ferns and fern allies (lycopodiophytes and pteridophytes), 128 species of mosses and liverworts, 90 species of fungi and 41 species of slime molds have been reported. Nevertheless, more exhaustive investigations are expected to reveal many more species.

The island has three main plant communities. The coastal forests extend from the coast up to elevation. Purple coral tree (&quot;Erythrina fusca&quot;), coconut palm (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;), and pond-apple (&quot;Annona glabra&quot;) are the predominant trees, with an understory of ferns, shrubs of the Rubiaceae and Solanaceae families, sedges and grasses, and herbaceous plants of the Leguminosae and Malvaceae families.

The inland forests extend from elevation. &quot;Palo de hierro&quot; or huriki (&quot;Sacoglottis holdridgei&quot;), &quot;avocado&quot; (&quot;Ocotea insularis&quot;) and the endemic &quot;Cecropia pittieri&quot; are the most common canopy trees. The trees are festooned at all levels with epiphytic plants, including orchids, ferns, bromeliads and mosses. The understory includes sedges such as &quot;Hypolitrum amplum&quot; and various species of ferns and tree ferns, including &quot;Cyathea armata&quot; and &quot;Danaea media&quot;. The palm &quot;Euterpe precatoria&quot; is also common. Cloud forests are found at the highest elevations, over , where &quot;Melastoma&quot; spp. are predominant.

The general vegetation of Cocos Island has greatly changed since the island was first named and described by Europeans. Captain Wafer, who visited the island in 1685 and whose name was given to the landing place, describes extensive coconut groves extending inland into the interior of the island. Thor Heyerdahl posited that it was very unlikely that these groves developed naturally, and that pre-European man must once have cleared considerable areas in the ravine bottoms and interior plateaus and ridges, utilizing the clearings for coconut plantations of substantial extent. Heyerdahl theorized that these plantations were used to provide fresh liquid and food for pre-Columbian voyages (made by balsa rafts using &quot;guara&quot; navigation) between Guatemala and northwestern South America. After the Spanish conquest and its consequences, these voyages ended and the tropical jungle recovered the land that had been laboriously cleared by early human hands.
There is, however, no concrete archeological evidence of human habitation before European contact.

===Fauna===

====Terrestrial====

The island has over 400 known species of insects, of which 65 (16%) are endemic. The greatest diversity is found among the Lepidoptera and Formicidae. Over 50 species of other arthropods have been described (spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and isopods).

Two species of lizard are found on the island, the Cocos Island anole (&quot;Anolis townsendi&quot;) and the Pacific least gecko (&quot;Sphaerodactylus pacificus&quot;); both are endemic. No amphibians have been reported.

Nearly 90 bird species have been reported. The island and neighboring rocks are home to large nesting colonies of migratory seabirds, including the brown booby (&quot;Sula leucogaster&quot;), red-footed booby (&quot;Sula sula&quot;), great frigatebird (&quot;Fregata minor&quot;), white tern (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;) and brown noddy (&quot;Anous stolidus&quot;). Seven species of land birds inhabit the island, including three endemics: the Cocos cuckoo (&quot;Coccyzus ferrugineus&quot;), Cocos flycatcher (&quot;Nesotriccus ridgwayi&quot;) and Cocos finch (&quot;Pinaroloxias inornata&quot;), with the latter two being monotypic in their respective genera. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

The island has no native land mammal species, but humans have introduced five: pigs, deer, goats, cats, and rats. Because they harm the local ecosystems by either foraging native flora or preying on native fauna, they are the subject of control efforts.

====Marine====

The rich coral reef, volcanic tunnels, caves, massifs and deeper waters surrounding Cocos Island are home to more than 30 species of coral, 60 species of crustaceans, 600 species of molluscs and over 300 species of fish. These include large populations of yellowfin tuna (&quot;Thunnus albacares&quot;), giant mantas (&quot;Manta birostris&quot;), sailfish (&quot;Istiophorus platypterus&quot;) and sharks, such as whitetip reef shark (&quot;Triaenodon obesus&quot;) and scalloped hammerhead shark (&quot;Sphyrna lewini&quot;). The largest of all species of fish is also present, the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;). In December 2017, a female tiger shark (a species that returned to the waters of Isla del Coco in 2012, after 30 years of not being seen in the area) killed New Yorker Rohina Bhandari while she was scuba diving in Manuelita in the Isla del Coco National Park.

Other large marine animals include humpback whales (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;), orcas (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala macrorhynchus&quot;), bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) and sea lions (&quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;).

There are also reptiles: hawksbill turtles (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;), green turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and olive ridley turtles (&quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;).

===Habitats threatened===

The island&#x27;s largely unperturbed habitats are, nonetheless, under growing human pressure. Illegal poaching of large marine species in and around its protected waters has become a main concern. Growing local and worldwide demand for tuna, shark fin soup and other seafood is threatening the island&#x27;s fragile ecosystems. The government of Costa Rica has been openly accused of passivity and even benefiting corruptly from illegal shark fin and other seafood trade to large markets, such as China and other Asian countries. The government has shown some willingness to protect the island&#x27;s natural riches and prosecute poachers. However, efforts to effectively patrol the waters and enforce environmental laws face big financial and bureaucratic difficulties, as well as being prone to the corruption of local, national and international authorities.

Recent events show that large-scale illegal poaching keeps happening. Despite initial hope in stopping and charging poachers, who have been caught with abundant evidence, they have often been quickly released under suspicious circumstances. Also, efforts to raise funds for protection have been dwarfed.

Marvin Orlando Cerdas, a judge with the local Puntarenas Court of Justice, obscurely allowed 22 poachers caught red-handed to escape the country. Also under highly suspicious and allegedly corrupt circumstances, District Attorney Michael Morales Molina stopped the auction for public benefit of confiscated goods immediately after the spokesman of the large illegal poaching ship &quot;Tiuna&quot; simply made the request.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The island is believed to have been uninhabited by humans prior to European discovery. However, there has been little archaeological investigation into oceanic eastern Pacific islands, including Cocos Island. This is due to the fragile environments on such islands, which for many years have been untouched by humans, and because these islands are at a considerable distance from islands that had Polynesian populations. Likewise, Indigenous Americans on the west coast of the continent were not known to inhabit any remote eastern Pacific islands. In 2008, Cocos Island, the Desventuradas Islands, Galápagos Islands and Juan Fernández Islands (all uninhabited when discovered by Europeans) were surveyed by archaeologists from the Australian National University. Their investigation found that the Galápagos Islands may have been visited by a Polynesian vessel, but it is unclear what their findings were for Cocos Island.

===Discovery and early cartography===
In his &quot;Historia general y natural de las Indias&quot; (1535, expanded in 1851 from his previously unpublished papers), Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés discusses the discovery of the island by his contemporary, Spanish navigator Juan de Cabezas (also known as Juan de Grado), in 1526. D. Lievre, &quot;Una isla desierta en el Pacífico; la isla del Coco&quot; in &quot;Los viajes de Cockburn y Lievre por Costa Rica&quot; (1962: 134) tells that the first document with the name &quot;Isle de Coques&quot; is a map painted on parchment, called that of Henry II, that appeared in 1542 during the reign of Francis I of France. The planisphere of Nicolas Desliens (1556, Dieppe) places this &quot;Ysle de Coques&quot; about one and a half degrees north of the Equator.

Willem Blaeu&#x27;s &quot;Grand Atlas&quot;, originally published in 1662, has a colour world map on the back of its front cover which shows &quot;I. de Cocos&quot; right on the Equator. Frederik De Witt&#x27;s &quot;Atlas, 1680&quot; shows it similarly. The &quot;Hondius Broadside map&quot; of 1590 shows &quot;I. de Cocos&quot; at 2 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude, while in 1596 Theodore de Bry showed the Galápagos Islands near 6 degrees north of the Equator. Emanuel Bowen, in &quot;A Complete system of Geography&quot;, Volume II (London, 1747: 586), states that the Galápagos islands stretch 5 degrees north of the Equator.

The island in modern times has been thickly overgrown with jungle. &quot;That the island formerly merited its descriptive name, however, is apparent from the verbal accounts given to Captain Dampier by the contemporary Spanish discoverers. Dampier writes: &#x27;The Island Cocos is so named by the Spaniards, because there are abundances of Coco-Nut Trees growing on it&#x27;...prehistoric planters must have found the location of Cocos Island worthy of the vast amount of labor spent in clearing the natural jungle for the planting of coconuts...make it an ideal port of call for aboriginal merchants trafficking the open sea off Panama.

With the notable exception of the Galápagos Islands, there was a lack of scientific research into oceanic eastern Pacific islands prior to the 20th century. Publication &quot;The American Naturalist&quot; stated in 1891, &quot;we know nothing at all about the fauna and flora of the isolated Clipperton Island and Malpelo; we hardly know anything about Cocos Island, which seems to be in many respects quite different from the others, having a more tropical appearance.&quot;

===Administrative history===

Cocos Island was annexed by Costa Rica in 1832 by decree No. 54 of the Constitutional Assembly of the newly independent country. Whalers stopped regularly at Cocos Island until the mid-19th century, when inexpensive kerosene started to replace whale oil for lighting.

In October 1863, the ship &quot;Adelante&quot; marooned 426 Tongan former slaves on the island when it was discovered that they had contracted smallpox and were a danger to her crew. By the time the vessel &quot;Tumbes&quot; arrived to rescue them one month later, only 38 survivors were found, the rest having perished from smallpox (see ʻAta).

In 1897, the Costa Rican government named the German adventurer and treasure hunter August Gissler the first Governor of Cocos Island and allowed him to establish a short-lived colony there.

On May 12, 1970, the insular territory of Cocos Island was incorporated administratively by means of Executive Decree No. 27, making it the eleventh district of Puntarenas canton of the Puntarenas Province.

As a district, the island has the postal code of 60110.

The island&#x27;s 33 residents, all of them Costa Rican park rangers, were allowed to vote for the first time in Costa Rica&#x27;s February 5, 2006, election. However, the rangers are not considered permanent residents of the district, therefore the census data considers the island to be uninhabited.

===Piracy and hidden treasures===
Cocos Island has featured heavily in many tales of pirate lore and buried treasure. The first claims of treasure buried on the island came from a woman named Mary Welch, who claimed that 350 tons of gold (about $16 billion in today&#x27;s money) raided from Spanish galleons had been buried on the island by Captain Bennett Graham, a naval officer who had become a pirate in 1818. She had been a member of a pirate crew led by Captain Graham, and was transported to an Australian penal colony for her crimes. She possessed a chart showing where Graham&#x27;s treasure was supposed to be hidden. On her release, she returned to the island with an expedition but had no success in finding anything, as the points of reference in the chart had disappeared.

Another pirate supposed to have buried treasure on the island was the Portuguese Benito Bonito, who began terrorizing the west coast of the Americas around 1818. Though Bonito was hunted down and executed, his treasure was never retrieved.

Perhaps the best-known of the treasure legends tied to the island is that of the fabled Treasure of Lima. In 1820, with the army of José de San Martín approaching Lima, Viceroy José de la Serna is supposed to have entrusted treasure from the city to British trader Captain William Thompson for safekeeping until the Spaniards could secure the country. Instead of waiting in the harbor as they were instructed, Thompson and his crew killed the viceroy&#x27;s men and sailed to Cocos, where they allegedly buried the treasure. Shortly afterwards, they were apprehended by a Spanish warship. All of the crew except Thompson and his first mate were executed for piracy. The two said they would show the Spaniards where they had hidden the treasure in return for their lives, but after landing on Cocos, they escaped into the forest and were never recaptured.

Hundreds of attempts to find treasure on the island have failed. Several early expeditions were mounted on the basis of claims by a man named Keating, who was supposed to have befriended Thompson. On one trip, Keating was said to have retrieved gold and jewels from the treasure. German adventurer August Gissler lived on the island for most of the period from 1889 until 1908, hunting the treasure, but only found a few gold coins. British Antarctic explorer Aeneas Mackintosh launched a treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos in 1910, without success.

==In fiction==
The book &quot;Desert Island&quot; proposed the highly detailed theory that Daniel Defoe used the Isla del Coco as an accurate model for his descriptions of the island inhabited by the marooned Robinson Crusoe. However, Defoe placed Crusoe&#x27;s island not in the Pacific, but rather off the coast of Venezuela in the Atlantic Ocean.

Robinson&#x27;s neighbouring &quot;&quot; is shown on the colour map of Joannes Jansson (Amsterdam) depicting the northeastern corner of South America, entitled &quot;Terra Firma et Novum Regnum Granatense et Popayan&quot;. It belongs to the early group of plates printed by Willem Blaeu from 1630 onwards. The property called Terra Firma was the Isthmus of Darien.

The stories of pirates and buried treasure associated with the island are reputed to have been the inspiration for the novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, by Robert Louis Stevenson.

<text>Robert Simpson (September 17, 1834 – December 14, 1897) was the Scottish founder of Simpson&#x27;s department store chain in Canada.

==Life==

He was born in Strathspey, Moray, Scotland in 1834 to Peter Simpson and Jane Christie Parmouth. His father was a general store owner, and Simpson was trained in the drapery trade in Elgin, Moray before immigrating to Newmarket, Province of Canada, at the age of 21 where he worked at his uncle&#x27;s dry goods store. Before long, Simpson started up his own store in Newmarket, Ontario as the Simpson &amp; Trent Groceries, Boots, Shoes and Dry Goods (1858–1870) and later as the Robert Simpson Company from 1870 to 1871. Simpson and his family relocated to Toronto in 1871 and in 1872 he opened a pioneer department store in Toronto that eventually expanded into the major national chain, Simpson&#x27;s.

For decades, Simpson&#x27;s store was in a rivalry with fellow retailer Timothy Eaton on Yonge Street.

Simpson married Mary Anne Botsford and had one daughter, Margaret, who married the grandson of William Hamilton Merritt, William Hamilton Merritt III in 1890. The Merritts did not have any children, thus ending the Simpson lineage.

Robert Simpson died in 1897 and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

==Legacy==
Margaret Simpson, daughter of Robert Simpson, married William Hamilton Merritt in 1890. She is buried with him at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

James Sutherland, his cousin, owned and operated a trading business from 1871 until his death in 1889.

His first store at Main and Timothy Streets in Newmarket is occupied by small retail buildings. As for the Toronto location at 184 Yonge Street, it was later rebuilt by Robert Jameison and later became the F. W. Woolworth Building.

<text>Robert Wilfred Levick Simpson (2 March 1921 – 21 November 1997) was an English composer, as well as a long-serving BBC producer and broadcaster.

He is best known for his orchestral and chamber music (particularly those in the key classical forms: 11 symphonies and 15 string quartets), and for his writings on the music of Beethoven, Bruckner, Nielsen and Sibelius. He studied composition under Herbert Howells. Remarkably for a living contemporary composer, a Robert Simpson Society was formed in 1980 by individuals concerned that Simpson&#x27;s music had been unfairly neglected. The society aims to bring Simpson&#x27;s music to a wider public by sponsoring recordings and live performances of his work, by issuing a journal and other publications, and by maintaining an archive of material relating to the composer. In 2021, he was featured as &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; on BBC Radio 3.

==Biography==
Simpson was born in Leamington, Warwickshire. His father, Robert Warren Simpson, was a descendant of Sir James Young Simpson, the Scottish pioneer of anaesthetics; his mother, Helena Hendrika Govaars, was the daughter of Gerrit Govaars, founder of the , the Dutch arm of the Salvation Army. Simpson studied at Westminster City School. He was intended for a medical career and studied in London for two years before his determination to be a musician gained the upper hand. A conscientious objector in World War II, he served with an ARP mobile surgical unit during the London Blitz, while taking lessons from Herbert Howells. Howells persuaded him to take the Durham University Bachelor of Music degree, and in 1952 he gained the further degree of Doctor of Music from that university, the submitted work being his First Symphony. After the war Simpson lectured extensively and founded the Exploratory Concerts Society; in 1951 he joined the music staff of the BBC and became one of its best-known and most respected music producers, remaining with the corporation for nearly three decades. Simpson was a great champion of Havergal Brian&#x27;s music, and under the BBC&#x27;s auspices he produced many broadcasts featuring Brian&#x27;s works. These included the mammoth &quot;Gothic&quot; Symphony in 1966 under Sir Adrian Boult, and in 1973 the 28th Symphony under Leopold Stokowski who, at the age of 91, was premiering a work written by a 91-year-old composer.

In the latter part of his career as a BBC producer Simpson frequently clashed with the management of the organisation. In the 1970s he was one of those – Hans Keller and Deryck Cooke were others – who started the (unsuccessful) revolt against the report &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; and its plan for &quot;generic broadcasting&quot; (i.e. separate networks for pop, classical and speech). A decade later Simpson was energetic in his opposition to a cost-cutting reorganisation that ultimately proposed the decommissioning of five of the eleven BBC orchestras. During the ensuing musicians&#x27; strike (which caused the cancellation of the first several weeks of the 1980 BBC Promenade Concerts) Simpson chose to disregard BBC staff regulations and discuss the matter with a national newspaper; he then resigned from the corporation, publicly alleging a &quot;degeneration of traditional BBC values in the scramble for ratings&quot;. (Hans Keller later described these criticisms as &quot;demonstrable fact&quot;.) Had Simpson remained silent for a few more months he would have been able to retire with a full pension, but his feeling was that such a course would have compromised his principles. Abominating the ethos of Thatcherite Britain, in 1986 he moved to the Republic of Ireland, settling on Tralee Bay in County Kerry. In 1991, he suffered a severe stroke during an English lecture tour, which caused damage to the thalamus and left him in debilitating pain for the remaining six years of his life. He died in Tralee in 1997, aged 76.

Simpson married Bessie Fraser in 1946; she died in 1981, and the following year he married Angela Musgrave, a fellow BBC employee and relative of composer Thea Musgrave. His other great passions, outside music, were astronomy (he was a member of the British Astronomical Association and – unusually for an amateur – was made a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society) and pacifism, specifically addressed in the title of his Tenth String Quartet, &quot;For Peace&quot;. He was awarded many honours, including the Carl Nielsen Gold Medal, 1956 (for his book &quot;Carl Nielsen, Symphonist&quot;, published in 1952), and the Medal of Honor of the Bruckner Society of America, 1962. He refused appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1980. In his letter of rejection, he wrote: &quot;While I am most appreciative of the intended honour, it could not properly be accepted by a determined republican in whom memory of the British Empire arouses no nostalgia.&quot; Politically, he was a lifelong socialist.

==Music==

Dedicated as he was to renewing the classical tradition of a dynamic musical architecture built on the gravitational power of tonality, Simpson wrote very few small or occasional works and concentrated on large-scale genres. He wrote 11 symphonies as well as concertos for violin, piano, flute and cello. (The Violin Concerto was subsequently withdrawn.) His extensive output of chamber music comprised 15 string quartets, two string quintets, a clarinet quintet, piano trio, clarinet trio, horn trio, violin sonata and a number of non-standard chamber ensemble works as well as works for piano, a sonata for two pianos, and a major organ work entitled (after the famous remark attributed to Galileo). He tended to avoid vocal music but his output includes two motets. Variation form was important to him, and in addition to variation-movements on his own themes he composed orchestral variations on themes of Nielsen and Johann Sebastian Bach, as well as a set of piano variations on a palindromic theme by Haydn to which he returned in his large-scale String Quartet No. 9, which is a series of 32 variations and a fugue on the same Haydn theme. String Quartets Nos. 4–6 can be regarded as variations upon the compositional processes, rather than the themes, of Beethoven&#x27;s three Rasumovsky Quartets, Op. 59.

Two significant features of Simpson&#x27;s oeuvre are his ability to write long works entirely based on a single basic pulse, with faster or slower tempi being suggested by smaller or larger note-values, and the establishment of a dynamic tension between competing tonalities or intervals.

===Symphonies===
&quot;People who write symphonies do it because they feel able to: a lot of those who don&#x27;t tell everyone else the symphony is dead ... The trouble is that the symphony as an abstraction does not exist: there may be exhausted symphonies and exhausted composers, but the response to a challenge to one&#x27;s capacity for large-scale organisation and development – that can be exhausted only in individuals.&quot;

Robert Simpson is said to have written and destroyed four symphonies (one of which even used serial procedures) before his first published symphony. The official, published symphonies include the following:
* Symphony No. 1 (1951), doctorate thesis for the University of Durham
* Symphony No. 2 (1955–1956), dedicated to Anthony Bernard
* Symphony No. 3 (1962), dedicated to Havergal Brian
* Symphony No. 4 (1970–1972), commissioned by the Hallé Orchestra
* Symphony No. 5 (1972), dedicated to the London Symphony Orchestra
* Symphony No. 6 (1977), dedicated to the renowned gynaecologist Ian Craft
* Symphony No. 7 (1977), dedicated to Hans Keller and his wife, the artist Milein Cosman
* Symphony No. 8 (1981), dedicated to the painter Anthony Dorrell
* Symphony No. 9 (1985–1987), dedicated to his wife, Angela
* Symphony No. 10 (1988), dedicated to Vernon Handley
* Symphony No. 11 (1990), dedicated to Matthew Taylor

From 1987 to 1996 Vernon Handley recorded all but one of the symphonies for Hyperion Records, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (in 1, 3, 5 and 8), the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (2, 4 and 9) and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (6, 7 and 10). The cycle was completed in 2003 when No. 11 was recorded by its dedicatee, Matthew Taylor, conducting the City of London Sinfonia.

===Concertos===
; Violin Concerto (1959): A work of some forty minutes, dedicated to the violinist Ernest Element, withdrawn by the composer late in his life. Simpson had considered revising the work, and Matthew Taylor has reworked the composition to fulfil Simpson&#x27;s original intentions. 
; Piano Concerto (1967): A one-movement twenty-minute work, falling into several sections and written for the pianist John Ogdon. The concerto is one of his most big-hearted and instantly accessible scores.
; Flute Concerto (1989): A one movement work of twenty-five minutes duration, commissioned by and dedicated to the flautist Susan Milan. The work embraces a calmness in the manner of Symphony No. 11.
; Cello Concerto (1991): A one-movement variation-form work of twenty-three minutes duration, commissioned by and dedicated to the cellist Raphael Wallfisch. The work begins vigorously and ends in an atmosphere of contemplative mystery.

===Quartets===
Simpson composed 15 numbered string quartets; a quartet preceding this sequence was written as part of his course at Durham University and still exists there. He regarded Quartets Nos. 1–3 as forming a natural sequence, and Nos. 4–6 are a clearly distinct group related to three Beethoven quartets, though they can all be performed as entirely independent compositions. The second movement of No. 8 has the label &quot;Eretmapodites gilletti&quot;, and the quartet is dedicated to two people including the discoverer of the mosquito with that scientific name; the ninth quartet, from 1982, is a one-movement (but subdivided, with slow and scherzando sections) palindromic 32 Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Haydn; Number 10 is entitled &quot;For Peace&quot;. (See the article by Malcolm MacDonald in the External Links.)

In programme notes for a recital consisting of quartets nos. 1–3 at the Arts Council of Great Britain building in London SW1 on 11 February 1955, Simpson wrote that &quot;although they were not consciously designed as a group, they nevertheless seem to fall into a natural sequence&quot;. In construction and tonality there are elements of an overall symmetry encompassing the three works.
; String Quartet No. 1 (1951–52): is in two movements, quick and slow; the second movement is a set of variations on a palindromic theme stated by the viola. There is a power-struggle by the opposed tonal centres of E flat and A: E flat is the focus of the first movement and beats off the challenge of A, the second movement theme starts and ends in E flat with a central climax in A; the variations work round to A major, in which key the work ends. The quartet is dedicated to George Enescu.
; String Quartet No. 2 (1953): is the shortest of all Simpson&#x27;s quartets, playing for about 15 minutes. It is cast in a single movement and a single metronome mark, within which three themes (and three tempi) contest for dominance.
; String Quartet No. 3 (1953–54): is in two movements, slow and quick: an &quot;Adagio&quot; in C major and a pulsing &quot;Allegro deciso&quot; that works round to an affirmative E major. (Simpson made a transcription of this movement as an independent piece for full string orchestra.)

Simpson stated that String Quartets Nos. 4–6, which are on a much larger scale than Nos. 1–3, constituted &quot;a close study of Beethoven&#x27;s three Rasumovsky quartets, Op. 59; that is to say, the attempt to understand those great works resulted in, not a verbal analysis, but music&quot;. The three Simpson quartets offer, in his own idiom, &quot;musical analogies&quot; to the procedures of Beethoven&#x27;s three quartets, but they can be performed without reference to the Beethoven and indeed without reference to each other.
; String Quartet No. 4 (1973)
: is dedicated to Basil Lam. The four movements – an &quot;Allegro&quot;, a &quot;Presto&quot; scherzo, an &quot;Andante sosteunto&quot; slow movement joining on without a break to an &quot;Assai vivace&quot; finale – correspond to the layout of Beethoven&#x27;s op.59 no.1.
; String Quartet No. 5 (1974)
: is dedicated to Angela Musgrave, who became the composer&#x27;s second wife. The four movements – an &quot;Allegro molto&quot; with a written-out literal repeat of the exposition, an &quot;Adagio, sempre semplice&quot;, an &quot;Allegretto vivace&quot; and a whirlwind &quot;Prestissimo&quot; finale – correspond to the layout of Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 59, No. 2.
; String Quartet No. 6 (1975)
: is dedicated to the film-maker Barrie Gavin and his wife Jamila. Of the four movements, the first begins with an &quot;Adagio&quot; introduction exploring an enigmatic harmony, prefacing a large-scale &quot;Vivacissimo&quot;; the second is an intermezzo-like &quot;Con moto; grazioso ed intensivo&quot;, the third a complex Canon marked &quot;Molto tranquillo&quot; with an &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot; middle section, and the finale is marked &quot;Molto rapido&quot; – these correspond to the layout of Beethoven&#x27;s op.59 no.3, which begins with a slow introduction exploring a particular harmony and includes an archaic form (a Minuet) as its third movement.

Quartets Nos. 7 and 8 both explore the possibilities of the perfect fifth in shaping their themes, harmonies and tonalities.
; String Quartet No. 7 (1977)
: is dedicated to the organist Susi Jeans and written in celebration of the birth-centenary of her husband, the astronomer Sir James Jeans. The work is in a single movement and makes much use of the open strings of the instruments, whose tuning Simpson likened to the forces of gravitation. This leads the work to revolve around the circle of fifths. The slow opening &quot;Tranquillo&quot; and closing &quot;Tempo primo&quot; enclose a fast section, &quot;Vivace&quot;, intended to represent the pulsing energy of the universe.
; String Quartet No. 8 (1979)
: is dedicated to the biologist and entomologist J.D. Gillett and his wife. There are four movements, the tonality of each being a fifth higher than that of its predecessor. The first is a large-scale fugue, &quot;Grave, molto intensivo&quot;, the second is a brief scherzo (&quot;Molto vivace&quot;), &#x27;suggesting the formidable delicacy&#x27; of the mosquito &quot;Eretmapodites Gilletti&quot;. The third is an intermezzo, &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot;, played with mutes. The finale is a strenuous &quot;Risoluto e concentrato&quot; to balance the first movement.
; String Quartet No. 9 (1982)
: is subtitled &quot;32 Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Haydn&quot; and was dedicated to the Delmé Quartet, who commissioned it, on their 20th anniversary, which was also the 250th anniversary of the birth of Haydn. At about 57 minutes&#x27; duration, it is one of the longest continuous movements for string quartet ever written. The theme is the palindromic minuet which Haydn used in his Symphony No. 47 and Piano Sonata No.26. Simpson had already composed a set of piano variations on this minuet in 1948, and three of those variations are transcribed as variations I-III of the quartet. The 32 quartet variations take Simpson&#x27;s fascination with formal symmetry to a new extreme, though they are grouped to correspond to first movement, scherzo and slow movement. The free-form fugue forms the finale, gaining energy and speed as it proceeds.
; String Quartet No. 10 (1983)
: bears the title &quot;For Peace&quot; and was composed for the tenth anniversary of the Coull Quartet. Simpson said that the title &quot;refers to its generally pacific character ... The music ... tries to define the condition of peace. This excludes aggression but not strong feeling.&quot; The three movements are a serene &quot;Allegretto&quot;, a very short &quot;Prestissimo&quot; scherzo and a concluding &quot;Molto adagio&quot;, longer than the other two movements combined, which climaxes in a fugue and ends in a peaceful epilogue.
; String Quartet No. 11 (1984)
: was also written for the Coull Quartet and shares some material with No. 10, but is much more turbulent and intense in character: Simpson said he was conscious of the influence of Beethoven&#x27;s F minor Quartet, Op.95 in this work. Quartet No. 11 is in a single large movement and is concerned with salient intervals including the tritone and the major third. An opening &quot;Allegro molto&quot; is followed by a polyphonic &quot;Adagio&quot;, a large-scale Scherzo (&quot;Presto&quot;) and a concluding &quot;Molto adagio&quot; played &quot;pianissimo&quot; throughout.
; String Quartet No. 12 (1987)
: was commissioned for the 1988 Nottingham Festival. This work is in two large movements, a meditative and polyphonic &quot;Adagio&quot; and a &quot;Molto vivace&quot; combining the characters of scherzo and finale.
; String Quartet No. 13 (1989)
: was commissioned for the 1990 Cardiff Festival and was premiered there by the Delmé Quartet. It is dedicated to the BBC producer Graham Melville-Mason and his wife Alex. This is the shortest of Simpson&#x27;s later quartets (only No. 2 is shorter) and is in four concise movements, played without any break, in a fast-slow-fast-slow pattern.
; String Quartet No. 14 (1990)
: is a large-scale work in the traditional four movements. The slow movement has been particularly praised for its meditative beauty.
; String Quartet No. 15 (1991)
: is a shorter work in one movement with three contrasting sections, an Adagio introduction and an Allegretto finale framing a large central scherzo, marked &quot;Severo&quot;. The character of this quartet is turbulent and granitic, rather in the manner of String Quartet No. 11.

===Other chamber music===
; Clarinet Quintet (1968)
: This is a large-scale work in five movements forming an arch shape – a central scherzo of some 800 bars is framed by two slow movements, which themselves are framed by two outer fast movements. The arch shape is completed by a slow introduction and a slow coda. The entire basis of the material for the work is outlined in the opening introduction, with the main theme having some sort of parallel with Beethoven&#x27;s C sharp minor quartet. It is one of Simpson&#x27;s more subtle and enigmatic scores, with an epilogue of almost naive, diatonic fluidity and rising scales.
; Violin Sonata (1984)
: This is a two movement structure, the first movement a vigorous Allegro, and the second combining the characters of a slow movement, scherzo and finale. Throughout there is a conflict between G major and G minor – particularly guided by the intervals of a major third and a minor third, which are often combined and pushed against each other to create strange resonances – for example G to B flat in the low register of the piano, and B natural to D in the upper register.
; String Trio (1987)
: A three movement work. An opening Prelude (Presto) and a concluding Fugue (Volante) are separated by a central Adagio. It is dedicated to Jillian White of BBC Bristol.
; String Quintet No. 1 (1987)
: A long one-movement work alternating slow and fast sections. It contains some of the most peaceful music the composer ever wrote.
; String Quintet No. 2 (1995)
: This was Simpson&#x27;s final work. Most of it was completed in 1991, before Simpson was paralysed with a stroke that left him in permanent pain, but the final coda was dictated to his wife several years later. It is one of Simpson&#x27;s most severe and dark scores, its structure is built on a minimal amount of material and there is an alternation between two tempo types – an austere, lyrical moderato and a knotty allegro. The slow, final coda is one of the darkest endings in all string chamber music literature.

==Books and articles==
As a writer on music (he would have disavowed the title &#x27;musicologist&#x27;), Simpson was guided by his deep admiration for Tovey&#x27;s ability to discuss a composer&#x27;s sophisticated treatment of forms and keys in a manner that was accurate and incisive without ever alienating the non-specialist reader. His earliest published writings were as a reviewer and critic; but before long his focus had shifted towards being an advocate for widely unappreciated or misunderstood composers like Anton Bruckner, Carl Nielsen and Jean Sibelius, as well as to the analysis of better-known figures (such as Beethoven) whenever he felt able to illuminate their work from a composer&#x27;s perspective. His writings can usefully be divided into five categories: (i) books written by Simpson; (ii) books edited by Simpson; (iii) contributions to other books and collections; (iv) posthumous collections of articles; (v) individual articles, programme- and sleeve-notes, etc.

==Work as record producer==
Robert Simpson was also the producer for the first commercially available recordings of Havergal Brian’s music. Symphonies Nos. 10 and 21, conducted by James Loughran and Eric Pinkett respectively, were recorded at the De Montfort Hall, Leicester in 1972. The music was performed by the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra and the LP was released by Unicorn Records to great critical acclaim in 1973. A special edition of the television programme &quot;Aquarius&quot; called &quot;The Unknown Warrior&quot; gave considerable coverage to the recording session and a camera crew also joined Robert Simpson and members of the orchestra during a visit they made to the composer&#x27;s home in Shoreham (see video links below). Following the success of the Unicorn issue, a second Brian album, also produced by Robert Simpson, was recorded by the LSSO in 1974 at Hove Town Hall and Leicester De Montfort Hall with the conducting being shared by László Heltay and Eric Pinkett. This CBS release included the 22nd Symphony, Brian&#x27;s setting of the 23rd Psalm (which clearly belongs to the mainstream British choral tradition of Vaughan Williams and Parry) and the English Suite &quot;Rustic Scenes&quot; which contains some highly original music.

<text>Albert Ayler (; July 13, 1936 – November 25, 1970) was an American avant-garde jazz saxophonist, singer and composer.

After early experience playing Rhythm and blues and bebop, Ayler began recording music during the free jazz era of the 1960s. However, some critics argue that while Ayler&#x27;s style is undeniably original and unorthodox, it does not adhere to the generally accepted critical understanding of free jazz. In fact, Ayler&#x27;s style is difficult to categorize in any way, and it evoked incredibly strong and disparate reactions from critics and fans alike. His innovations have inspired subsequent jazz musicians.

His trio and quartet records of 1964, such as &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot; and &quot;The Hilversum Session&quot;, show him advancing the improvisational notions of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman into abstract realms where whole timbre, and not just mainly harmony with melody, is the music&#x27;s backbone. His ecstatic music of 1965 and 1966, such as &quot;Spirits Rejoice&quot; and &quot;Truth Is Marching In&quot;, has been compared by critics to the sound of a brass band, and involved simple, march-like themes which alternated with wild group improvisations and were regarded as retrieving jazz&#x27;s pre-Louis Armstrong roots.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Shaker Heights, Ayler was first taught alto saxophone by his father Edward, who was a semiprofessional saxophonist and violinist. Edward and Albert played alto saxophone duets in church and often listened to jazz records together, including swing era jazz and then-new bop albums. Ayler&#x27;s upbringing in the church had a great impact on his life and music, and much of his music can be understood as an attempt to express his spirituality, including the aptly titled &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;, and his album of spirituals, &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, which features &quot;meandering&quot; solos that are meant to be treated as meditations on sacred texts, and at some points as &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; with his saxophone. Ayler&#x27;s experience in the church and exposure to swing jazz artists also impacted his sound: his wide vibrato was similar to that of gospel saxophonists, who sought a more vocal-like sound with their instruments, and to that of brass players in New Orleans swing bands.

Ayler attended John Adams High School on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side, and graduated in 1954 at the age of 18. He later studied at Academy Music in Cleveland with jazz saxophonist Benny Miller. Ayler also played the oboe in high school. As a teenager, Ayler&#x27;s understanding of bebop style and mastery of standard repertoire earned him the nickname of &quot;Little Bird&quot;, after Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, in the small Cleveland jazz scene.

In 1952, at the age of 16, Ayler began playing bar-walking, honking, R&amp;B-style tenor with blues singer and harmonica player Little Walter, spending two summer vacations with Walter&#x27;s band. In 1958, after graduating from high school, Ayler joined the United States Army, where he switched from alto to tenor sax and jammed with other enlisted musicians, including tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine. Ayler also played in the regiment band, along with future composer Harold Budd. In 1959 he was stationed in France, where he was further exposed to the martial music that would be a core influence on his later work. After his discharge from the army, Ayler tried to find work in Los Angeles and Cleveland, but his increasingly iconoclastic playing, which had moved away from traditional harmony, was not welcomed by traditionalists.

Ayler relocated to Sweden in 1962, where his recording career began, leading Swedish and Danish groups on radio sessions and jamming as an unpaid member of Cecil Taylor&#x27;s band in the winter of 1962–63. (Long-rumored tapes of Ayler performing with Taylor&#x27;s group were released by Revenant Records in 2004, as part of a 10-CD set.) The album &quot;My Name Is Albert Ayler&quot; is a session of standards recorded for a Copenhagen radio station with local musicians including Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen and drummer Ronnie Gardiner, with Ayler playing tenor and soprano on tracks such as &quot;Summertime&quot;.

===Early recording career===
In 1963, Ayler returned to the US and settled in New York City, where he continued to develop his personal style and occasionally played alongside free jazz pianist Cecil Taylor.
1964 was the most well-documented year of Ayler&#x27;s career, during which he recorded many albums, the first of which was &quot;Spirits&quot; (re-released later as &quot;Witches and Devils&quot;) in March of that year. Ayler also began his rich relationship with ESP-Disk Records in 1964, recording his breakthrough album (and ESP&#x27;s very first jazz album) &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot; for the then-fledgling record label. ESP-Disk came to play an integral role in recording and disseminating free jazz. &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot; featured the trio that Ayler had just assembled that summer, including bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray. The liner notes of &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot; include a brief description of the musicians on that day, July 10, 1964, in the Variety Arts Recording Studio: 
::Just before 1 PM, Sunny Murray arrived, a large, genial walrus...Gary Peacock was next, tall, thin, ascetic looking, and soft spoken...Albert Ayler was last, small, wary, and laconic.

On July 17, 1964, the members of this trio, along with trumpet player Don Cherry, alto saxophonist John Tchicai, and trombonist Roswell Rudd, collaborated in recording &quot;New York Eye and Ear Control&quot;, a freely improvised soundtrack to Canadian artist and filmmaker Michael Snow&#x27;s film of the same name.
During this time, Ayler began to garner some attention from critics, although he was not able to foster much of a fan following. However, later in 1964, Ayler, Peacock, Murray, and Cherry were invited to travel to Europe for a brief Scandinavian tour, which too yielded some new recordings, including &quot;The Copenhagen Tapes&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot; (re-released later as &quot;Vibrations&quot;), and &quot;The Hilversum Session&quot;.

Ayler recorded &quot;Bells&quot; on May 1, 1965. It is a ferociously-paced 20-minute improvisation featuring his signature military-march influenced melodies. &quot;Spirits Rejoice&quot; was recorded on September 23, 1965, at Judson Hall in New York City, and features a much larger band than the sparse trio of his earlier album &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; describes &quot;Spirits Rejoice&quot; as a &quot;riotous, hugely emotional and astonishingly creative celebration of the urge to make noise.&quot; Both albums feature Albert&#x27;s brother, trumpet player Donald Ayler, who translated his brother&#x27;s expansive approach to improvisation to the trumpet. Donald played with Albert until he experienced a debilitating nervous breakdown in 1967.

In 1966 Ayler was signed to Impulse Records at the urging of Coltrane, the label&#x27;s star attraction at that time. But even on Impulse, Ayler&#x27;s radically different music never found a sizable audience. Ayler&#x27;s first set for Impulse was recorded a few weeks before Christmas in 1966, entitled &quot;Albert Ayler in Greenwich Village&quot;. Ayler performed with his brother, Michel Samson, Beaver Harris, Henry Grimes, and Bill Folwell, while Coltrane was in attendance. For a tune titled &quot;For John Coltrane&quot;, Ayler returned to the alto saxophone for the first time in years.

Ayler first sang on a recording in a version of &quot;Ghosts&quot; performed in Paris in 1966, in which his vocal style was similar to that of his saxophone, with an eerie disregard for pitch. Ayler continued to experiment with vocals for the rest of his career (see, for example, the wordless vocalising near the end of &quot;Love Cry&quot; from the album of the same name); however, his singing on later albums such as &quot;New Grass&quot; and &quot;Music Is the Healing Force of the Universe&quot; has been the subject of some derision. Val Wilmer referred to his singing as &quot;tortuous&quot;, and critics have stated that &quot;his words and vocal delivery are truly frightening&quot;, describing him as having &quot;a bellowing, untrained voice that was wavering at its most controlled,&quot; and delivering lyrics in &quot;a manic wail&quot;.

In 1967, John Coltrane died of liver cancer, and Ayler was asked to perform at his funeral. (One of Coltrane&#x27;s last wishes was that Ayler and Ornette Coleman should play at his funeral.) It is said that during his performance, Ayler ripped his saxophone from his mouth at two points: once, to emit a cry of anguish, the other a cry of joy to symbolize his friend and mentor&#x27;s ascension into heaven. Ayler later recalled: &quot;John was like a visitor to this planet. He came in peace and he left in peace; but during his time here, he kept trying to reach new levels of awareness, of peace, of spirituality. That&#x27;s why I regard the music he played as spiritual music - John&#x27;s way of getting closer and closer to the Creator.&quot; In the liner notes for Ayler&#x27;s album &quot;Love Cry&quot;, Frank Kofsky wrote that Ayler said the following concerning Coltrane&#x27;s album &quot;Meditations&quot;: &quot;The father, son, and holy ghost. What Coltrane was talking about there - maybe it was a biblical term: he was the father, Pharoah was the son, and I was the holy ghost. And only he could tell me things like that.&quot;

===Final years and death===
For the next two-and-a-half years Ayler began to move from a mostly improvisatory style to one that focused more closely on compositions. This was largely a result of pressures from Impulse who, unlike ESP-Disk, placed heavier emphasis on accessibility than artistic expression. In 1967 and 1968, Ayler recorded three LPs that featured the lyrics and vocals of his girlfriend Mary Maria Parks and introduced regular chord changes, funky beats, and electronic instruments.

Ayler himself sang on his album &quot;New Grass&quot;, which hearkened back to his roots in R&amp;B as a teenager. However, this album was unsuccessful, scorned by Ayler fans and critics alike. Ayler staunchly asserted that he wanted to move in this R&amp;B and rock-and-roll direction, and that he was not simply succumbing to the pressures of Impulse and the popular music of that day, and it is true that Ayler heavily emphasizes the spirituality that seems to define the bulk of his work. (However, according to Gary Giddins, &quot;In interviews, Ayler left no doubt about who was responsible for &quot;New Grass&quot;: &#x27;They told me to do this. Bob Thiele. You think I would do that? He said, &quot;Look Albert, you gotta get with the young generation now.) &quot;New Grass&quot; begins with the track &quot;Message from Albert&quot;, in which Ayler speaks directly to his listener, explaining that this album was nothing like his ones before it, that was of &quot;a different dimension in [his] life.&quot; He claims that, &quot;through meditation, dreams, and visions, [he has] been made a Universal Man, through the power of the Creator...&quot;

At around this time, there were hints that Ayler was becoming emotionally unstable, blaming himself for his brother&#x27;s breakdown. In 1969, he submitted an impassioned, rambling open letter to &quot;the Cricket&quot; magazine entitled &quot;To Mr. Jones—I Had a Vision&quot;, in which he described startling apocalyptic spiritual visions. He &quot;saw in a vision the new Earth built by God coming out of Heaven,&quot; and implored the readers to share the message of Revelations, insisting that &quot;This is very important. The time is now.&quot; Noah Howard recalled seeing Ayler that summer, wearing gloves and a full-length fur coat despite the heat, his face covered in Vaseline, and saying &quot;Got to protect myself.&quot;

His final album, &quot;Music Is the Healing Force of the Universe&quot;, featured rock musicians such as Henry Vestine of Canned Heat alongside jazz musicians like pianist Bobby Few. This was a return to his blues-roots with very heavy rock influences, but did feature more of Ayler&#x27;s signature timbre variations and energetic solos than the unsuccessful &quot;New Grass&quot;.

In July 1970, Ayler returned to the free jazz idiom for a group of shows in France (including at the Fondation Maeght, documented on &quot;Nuits de la Fondation Maeght&quot;), but the band he was able to assemble (Call Cobbs, bassist Steve Tintweiss and drummer Allen Blairman) was not regarded as being of the caliber of his earlier groups.

Ayler disappeared on November 5, 1970, and he was found dead in New York City&#x27;s East River on November 25, a presumed suicide. For some time afterwards, rumors circulated that Ayler had been murdered, with a long-standing urban legend that the Mafia had tied him to a jukebox.

==Artistry==
Ayler routinely showcased his highly untraditional personal saxophone style in very conventional musical contexts, including children&#x27;s songs, march melodies, and gospel hymns. However, Ayler&#x27;s wild energy and intense improvisations transformed them into something nearly unrecognizable. Ayler took a deconstructive approach to his music, which was characteristic of the free jazz era. Phil Hardy says that Ayler &quot;dismantled&quot; melody and harmony to more deeply explore &quot;the physical properties&quot; of his saxophone. Ayler wished to free himself and his bandmates to improvise, relate to one another, and relate to their instruments on a more raw, &quot;primal&quot; level.

The intensely spiritual aspect of Ayler&#x27;s music was clearly aligned with the beliefs of jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, who was profoundly affected by the &quot;otherworldly&quot; sounds of Ayler&#x27;s music. This effect is especially evident in Coltrane&#x27;s albums &quot;Meditations&quot; and &quot;Stellar Regions&quot;. (Coltrane served as a mentor throughout Ayler&#x27;s life, providing financial and professional support.) This intensity, the extremes to which Ayler took his tenor saxophone, is the most defining aspect of his sound. His style is characterized by timbre variations, including squeaks, honks, and improvisation in very high and very low registers. He possessed a deep blistering tone—achieved by using the stiff plastic Fibrecane no. 4 reeds on his tenor saxophone—and used a broad, pathos-filled vibrato.

Ayler experimented with microtonality in his improvisations, seeking to explore the sounds that fall between the notes in a traditional scale. This technique was best showcased when he played, as he often did, without a piano, backed only by bass and drums. Ayler also resisted the standard swing beat, and instead built momentum through the frenetic speed of his improvisatory lines, which he forcefully overblew from his saxophone.
Jazz historian Ted Gioia describes Ayler as a &quot;virtuoso of the coarse and anomalous&quot;, and claims that Ayler aimed to break away from the constraints of playing notes and instead to &quot;enter into a new realm in which the saxophone created &quot;sound&quot;.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
At no point in his career was Ayler allowed the comfort of a steady audience. Despite largely positive critical reception, he remained poor for his entire life and often sought financial support from his family and fellow musicians, including Coltrane.

However, Ayler&#x27;s influence is still felt, and not only among jazz musicians. His wild sound foreshadowed contemporary hardcore, noise, and experimental rock styles. Albert Ayler is one of the most revered historical figures in the genre of free jazz along with the likes of Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Milford Graves (who drummed with Ayler). To this day his albums are among the best selling in the narrow genre of &quot;free jazz&quot;, along with the aforementioned legends. The so-called &quot;titans&quot; of free jazz in the 21st century who play saxophone, such as Charles Gayle, Ken Vandermark, Peter Brötzmann, and the late David S. Ware, were all heavily influenced by Albert Ayler. Ayler was also a crucial influence on some of his renowned contemporaries such as Frank Lowe, Rev. Frank Wright, Charles Tyler (on Ayler&#x27;s album &quot;Bells&quot;), Marion Brown, and Frank Smith (on ESP-Disk &quot;Burton Greene Quartet&quot;).

Ayler developed a close friendship with John Coltrane, and the two influenced each other&#x27;s playing. Coltrane said that Ayler &quot;filled an area that it seems I hadn&#x27;t got to. I think what he&#x27;s doing, it seems to be moving music into even higher frequencies.&quot; Ayler stated: &quot;when he [Coltrane] started playing, I had to listen just to his tone... To listen to him play was just like he was talking to me, saying, &#x27;Brother, get yourself together &quot;spiritually.&quot; Just one sound - that&#x27;s how profound this man was...&quot; According to Val Wilmer, &quot;the relationship between the two men was a very special one. They talked to each other constantly by telephone and by telegram and Coltrane was heavily influenced by the younger man.&quot; Coltrane first heard Ayler in 1962, after which he told Ayler that &quot;he had heard himself playing like that in a dream once.&quot; In February of the following year, Ayler sat in with Coltrane&#x27;s group for the first time during a gig at the Jazz Temple in Cleveland, Ohio. Beginning that year, &quot;Coltrane and Ayler, when both in New York, were often in the same room. Various recollections have placed Coltrane watching Ayler and Cecil Taylor at the Take 3 Coffeehouse in the West Village in the fall of 1963; watching Ayler and Eric Dolphy together at the Half Note sometime that year; inviting Ayler onstage at the Half Note in March 1964; hearing Ayler&#x27;s group with Rashied Ali at a little performance space at 27 Cooper Square in early 1965.&quot; Following the recording of &quot;Ascension&quot; in June 1965 (after Ayler had sent him copies of his albums &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;), Coltrane &quot;called Ayler and told him, &#x27;I recorded an album and found that I was playing just like you.&#x27; Albert&#x27;s reply: &#x27;No man, don&#x27;t you see, you were playing like yourself. You were just feeling what I feel and were just crying out for spiritual unity.&quot; While in Antibes a month later, Coltrane &quot;remained... in his hotel room, practicing as usual, playing along to a tape of an Ayler concert.&quot;

The Swedish filmmaker Kasper Collin was so inspired by Ayler&#x27;s music and life that he produced a documentary, &quot;My Name Is Albert Ayler&quot;, which includes interviews with ESP-Disk founder Bernard Stollman, along with interviews with Ayler&#x27;s family, girlfriends and bandmates. The film includes footage of Albert Ayler (from 1962, 1964, 1966 and 1970) and is built around his music and recordings of his voice (from interviews made between 1963 and 1970).

On his 1969 album &quot;Folkjokeopus&quot;, English guitarist/singer-songwriter Roy Harper, dedicated the song &quot;One for All&quot; (&quot;One for Al&quot;) to Albert Ayler, &quot;who I knew and loved during my time in Copenhagen&quot;. Harper considered Ayler to be &quot;one of the leading jazzmen of the age&quot;. In the &quot;Folkjokeopus&quot; liner notes, Harper states, &quot;In many ways he [Ayler] was the king&quot;.

Canadian artist Stan Douglas&#x27;s video installation &quot;Hors-champs&quot; (meaning &quot;off-screen&quot;) addresses the political context of free jazz in the 1960s, as an extension of black consciousness. Improvising Ayler&#x27;s &quot;Spirits Rejoice&quot;, four American musicians, George E. Lewis (trombone), Douglas Ewart (saxophone), Kent Carter (bass) and Oliver Johnson (drums), who lived in France during the free jazz period in the 1960s, perform in the installation, a recreation of 1960s French television.

In 1990, pianist Giorgio Gaslini released &quot;Ayler&#x27;s Wings&quot;, a CD consisting entirely of solo interpretations of Ayler&#x27;s compositions. In 1999, John Lurie of the Lounge Lizards released a piece titled &quot;The Resurrection of Albert Ayler&quot;. Composer and guitarist Marc Ribot recorded an album dedicated to Ayler&#x27;s &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot; in 2005 with former Ayler bassist and free jazz leader Henry Grimes.

Ayler&#x27;s tune &quot;Ghosts&quot; has been recorded by a number of musicians, including Gary Lucas, David Moss, Crazy Backwards Alphabet, Lester Bowie, Eugene Chadbourne, and Gary Windo.

Albert Ayler is the titular &#x27;ghost of a jazzman&#x27; in Maurice G. Dantec&#x27;s 2009 science-fiction novel &quot;Comme le fantôme d&#x27;un jazzman dans la station Mir en deroute.&quot;

Starting in 2018, late Chicago saxophonist Mars Williams recorded and released four CDs in a series called &quot;Mars Williams Presents An Ayler Xmas&quot;, documenting annual Christmastime live concerts, recorded in Chicago, Vienna, Krakow, and New York City and featuring intertwined holiday standards and Albert Ayler music.

<text>The Beaufort scale ( ) is an empirical measure that relates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land. Its full name is the Beaufort wind force scale.

==History==

The scale that carries Beaufort&#x27;s name had a long and complex evolution from the previous work of others (including Daniel Defoe the century before). In the 18th century, naval officers made regular weather observations, but there was no standard scale and so they could be very subjective — one man&#x27;s &quot;stiff breeze&quot; might be another&#x27;s &quot;soft breeze&quot;—: Beaufort succeeded in standardising a scale. The scale was devised in 1805 by Francis Beaufort (later Rear Admiral), a hydrographer and a Royal Navy officer, while serving on , and refined until he was Hydrographer of the Navy in the 1830s, when it was adopted officially. It was first used during the 1831-1836 &quot;Darwin voyage&quot; of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; under Captain Robert FitzRoy, who was later to set up the first Meteorological Office in Britain giving regular weather forecasts.

The initial scale of 13 classes (zero to 12) did not reference wind speed numbers, but related qualitative wind conditions to effects on the sails of a frigate, then the main ship of the Royal Navy, from &quot;just sufficient to give steerage&quot; to &quot;that which no canvas sails could withstand&quot;.

The scale was made a standard for ship&#x27;s log entries on Royal Navy vessels in the late 1830s and, in 1853, the Beaufort scale was accepted as generally applicable at the First International Meteorological Conference in Brussels.

In 1916, to accommodate the growth of steam power, the descriptions were changed to how the sea, not the sails, behaved and extended to land observations. Anemometer rotations to scale numbers were standardised only in 1923. George Simpson, CBE (later Sir George Simpson), director of the UK Meteorological Office, was responsible for this and for the addition of the land-based descriptors. The measures were slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for meteorologists. Nowadays, meteorologists typically express wind speed in kilometres or miles per hour or, for maritime and aviation purposes, knots, but Beaufort scale terminology is still sometimes used in weather forecasts for shipping and the severe weather warnings given to the public.
Wind speed on the Beaufort scale is based on the empirical relationship:
* &quot;v&quot; = 0.836 &quot;B&quot;3/2 m/s
* &quot;v&quot; = 1.625 &quot;B&quot;3/2 knots (formula_1)

where &quot;v&quot; is the equivalent wind speed at 10 metres above the sea surface and &quot;B&quot; is Beaufort scale number. For example, &quot;B&quot; = 9.5 is related to 24.5 m/s which is equal to the lower limit of &quot;10 Beaufort&quot;. Using this formula the highest winds in hurricanes would be 23 in the scale. F1 tornadoes on the Fujita scale and T2 TORRO scale also begin roughly at the end of level 12 of the Beaufort scale, but are independent scales, although the TORRO scale wind values are based on the 3/2 power law relating wind velocity to Beaufort force.

Wave heights in the scale are for conditions in the open ocean, not along the shore.

== Modern scale ==
The leftmost column gives the Beaufort scale number, followed by a description, wind speed, wave height, sea conditions, land conditions, photo of the sea, and the associated warning flag.
The Beaufort scale is neither an exact nor an objective scale; it was based on visual and subjective observation of a ship and of the sea. The corresponding integral wind speeds were determined later, but conversions have not been made official.

===Extended scale===
The Beaufort scale was extended in 1946 when forces 13 to 17 were added. However, forces 13 to 17 were intended to apply only to special cases, such as tropical cyclones. Nowadays, the extended scale is used in Taiwan, mainland China and Vietnam, which are often affected by typhoons. Internationally, the World Meteorological Organization Manual on Marine Meteorological Services (2012 edition) defined the Beaufort Scale only up to force 12 and there was no recommendation on the use of the extended scale.

== Use ==
The scale is used in the Shipping Forecasts broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom, and in the Sea Area Forecast from Met Éireann, the Irish Meteorological Service. Met Éireann issues a &quot;Small Craft Warning&quot; if winds of Beaufort force 6 (mean wind speed exceeding 22 knots) are expected up to 10 nautical miles offshore. Other warnings are issued by Met Éireann for Irish coastal waters, which are regarded as extending 30 miles out from the coastline, and the Irish Sea or part thereof: &quot;Gale Warnings&quot; are issued if winds of Beaufort force 8 are expected; &quot;Strong Gale Warnings&quot; are issued if winds of Beaufort force 9 or frequent gusts of at least 52 knots are expected.; &quot;Storm Force Warnings&quot; are issued if Beaufort force 10 or frequent gusts of at least 61 knots are expected; &quot;Violent Storm Force Warnings&quot; are issued if Beaufort force 11 or frequent gusts of at least 69 knots are expected; &quot;Hurricane Force Warnings&quot; are issued if winds of greater than 64 knots are expected.

This scale is also widely used in the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malta, and Macau, although with some differences between them. Taiwan uses the Beaufort scale with the extension to 17 noted above. China also switched to this extended version without prior notice on the morning of 15 May 2006, and the extended scale was immediately put to use for Typhoon Chanchu. Hong Kong and Macau retain force 12 as the maximum.

In the United States of America, winds of force 6 or 7 result in the issuance of a small craft advisory, with force 8 or 9 winds bringing about a gale warning, force 10 or 11 a storm warning (&quot;a tropical storm warning&quot; being issued instead of the latter two if the winds relate to a tropical cyclone), and force 12 a hurricane-force wind warning (or hurricane warning if related to a tropical cyclone). A set of red warning flags (daylight) and red warning lights (night time) is displayed at shore establishments which coincide with the various levels of warning.

In Canada, maritime winds forecast to be in the range of 6 to 7 are designated as &quot;strong&quot;; 8 to 9 &quot;gale force&quot;; 10 to 11 &quot;storm force&quot;; 12 &quot;hurricane force&quot;. Appropriate wind warnings are issued by Environment Canada&#x27;s Meteorological Service of Canada: strong wind warning, gale (force wind) warning, storm (force wind) warning and hurricane-force wind warning. These designations were standardised nationally in 2008, whereas &quot;light wind&quot; can refer to 0 to 12 or 0 to 15 knots and &quot;moderate wind&quot; 12 to 19 or 16 to 19 knots, depending on regional custom, definition or practice. Prior to 2008, a &quot;strong wind warning&quot; would have been referred to as a &quot;small craft warning&quot; by Environment Canada, similar to US terminology. (Canada and the USA have the Great Lakes in common.)

== Weather scale ==

Beaufort&#x27;s name was also attached to the Beaufort scale for weather reporting:

In this scale the weather designations could be combined, and reported, for example, as &quot;s.c.&quot; for snow and detached cloud or &quot;g.r.q.&quot; for dark, rain and squally.

<doc id="155113" wikidata="Q618351" url="?curid=155113" title="Minster (church)">
<text>Minster is an honorific title given to particular churches in England, most notably York Minster in Yorkshire, Westminster Abbey in London and Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire.

The term &quot;minster&quot; is first found in royal foundation charters of the 7th century, when it designated any settlement of clergy living a communal life and endowed by charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer. Widespread in 10th-century England, minsters declined in importance with the systematic introduction of parishes and parish churches from the 11th century onwards. The term continued as a title of dignity in later medieval England, for instances where a cathedral, monastery, collegiate church or parish church had originated with an Anglo-Saxon foundation.

Eventually a minster came to refer more generally to &quot;any large or important church, especially a collegiate or cathedral church&quot;. In the 21st century, the Church of England has designated additional minsters by bestowing the status on certain parish churches. Almost half of the minsters are found in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, with Dorset and Devon as other areas with many historic minsters.

The term also exists in German as &quot;Münster&quot; and is used mainly for Protestant churches. The German term can be used for some Roman Catholic churches, such as the Strasbourg Cathedral.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;minster&quot; (Old English &quot;mynster&quot;) was a rendering of the Latin &quot;monasterium&quot;, from Greek &quot;μοναστήριον&quot; (&quot;monasterion&quot;). In early English sources, &quot;monasterium&quot; and &quot;mynster&quot; were used interchangeably. They were applied to all communities who had devoted their lives to Christian observance, regardless of the gender of the occupants or the activities in which said occupants typically engaged. &quot;Monasterium&quot; was for instance applied equally to a small community of men living away from other secular settlements, to a large community of men and women living in a planned enclosure designed around a church, and to a widow and her unmarried daughters living in seclusion.

The modern English term &quot;monastery&quot; does not express the same connotations as the Latin &quot;monasterium&quot;, from which it derives, or the Old English &quot;mynster&quot;. This is because the term has come to be associated with contemplative regularity, such as that observed by the Benedictine or Cistercian orders, although this does not apply to the situation in Anglo-Saxon England prior to the tenth century.

By the tenth century, a gradual distinction between a &quot;church&quot; and a &quot;mynster&quot; began to emerge. For instance, in the &quot;Leechdoms&quot;, the sixteenth day was propitious for establishing a &quot;mynster&quot;, and the sixth day of the moon for founding a church. This suggests that by the tenth and eleventh centuries, &quot;mynster&quot; was being used to refer to a &quot;superior church&quot; which was regarded as long-established and to which people paid their dues.

An early appearance was in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of the Venerable Bede (731).

The modern German term &quot;&quot;Münster&quot; is the translation for minster. Monastery or cloister is called &quot;Kloster&quot;&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early and mid Anglo-Saxon periods ===
The first minsters in the English-speaking parts of Britain were founded in the century after the mission to the Saxons led by Augustine of Canterbury in 597. The first cases for which documentary evidence has been preserved are Oswy&#x27;s programme of 654/5, in which he endowed 12 small minsters, and a gift from Alhfrith to Wilfrid in around 660 to accompany the foundation of the minster at Ripon. An expansion of monasteries began around 670, with many substantial royal gifts of land. Kings made grants of land to named individuals to found a minster. In 734 Bede wrote a letter to Ecgbert (Archbishop of York), warning that noble families were abusing the privileged legal status accorded to the clergy, by making excessive landed endowments to minsters under their control. This reduced the overall stock of lands carrying the obligations of military service to the Northumbrian state.

Alan Thacker states: 
The word derives from the Old English &quot;mynster&quot;, meaning &quot;monastery&quot;, &quot;nunnery&quot;, &quot;mother church&quot; or &quot;cathedral&quot;, itself derived from the Latin &quot;monasterium&quot; and the Ancient Greek &quot;μοναστήριον&quot;, meaning a group of clergy where the Brothers would cloister themselves to meditate . Thus, &quot;minster&quot; could apply to any church whose clergy followed a formal rule: as for example a monastery or a chapter; or to a church served by a less formal group of clergy living communally. In the earliest days of the English Church, from the 6th to the 8th centuries, minsters, in their various forms, constituted the only form of Christian institution with a permanent site. At the beginning of the period, they were the only form of permanent collective settlement in a culture that had not developed towns or cities. Kings, nobles and bishops were continually on the move, with their respective retinues, from estate to estate.

Minsters were commonly founded by the king or by a royal thegn, receiving a royal charter and a corporate endowment of bookland and other customary agricultural rights and entitlements within a broad territory; as well as exemption from certain forms of customary service (especially military). The superior of the minster was generally from the family of the founder. The minster&#x27;s primary purpose was to support the king and the thegn in the regular worship of the divine office; especially through intercession in times of war. Minsters are also said to have been founded, or extensively endowed, in expiation for royal crimes; as for example Minster-in-Thanet near Ramsgate. Minsters might acquire pastoral and missionary responsibilities, for instance the three minsters of north-east Herefordshire, Leominster, Bromyard and Ledbury, all active in their areas before the towns were founded on episcopal manors; but initially this appear to have been of secondary importance. In the 9th century, almost all English minsters suffered severely from the depredations of Viking invaders; and even when a body of clergy continued, any form of regular monastic life typically ceased. The important role of minsters in the organisation of the early Christian church in Anglo-Saxon England has been called the &quot;Minster hypothesis&quot;.

=== Late Saxon and Norman periods ===
Following the English recovery in the 10th century, surviving minsters were often refounded in accordance with the new types of collective religious bodies then becoming widespread in Western Europe, as monasteries following the reformed Benedictine rule, or as collegiate churches or cathedral chapters following the rule of Chrodegang of Metz. Consequently, by the 11th century, a hierarchy of minsters became apparent; cathedral churches, or &quot;head minsters&quot; having pre-eminence within a diocese; surviving &quot;old minsters&quot; being pre-eminent within an area broadly equivalent to an administrative hundred; while newer &quot;lesser minsters&quot; and &quot;field churches&quot; were increasingly proliferating on local estates; the difference being that lesser minsters had graveyards, where field churches did not. Of particular importance for these developments, was the royal enforcement in this period of tithe as a compulsory religious levy on arable production. This vastly increased the resources available to support clergy; but at the same time strongly motivated local landowners to found their own local churches, so as to retain tithe income within their own estates.

In the 11th and 12th centuries former lesser minsters and field churches, typically served by individual priests, developed into the network of parishes familiar to this day. The &quot;old minsters&quot; mostly then were designated as parish churches. For these parish churches, their former pre-eminence was acknowledged by the occasional retention of the honorific title; and sometimes by the continued recognition of former estate churches within their ancient territories as being, in some degree, of subsidiary status and dignity. Otherwise however, old minsters might continue collective worship as collegiate churches; their clergy initially being designated as &#x27;portioners&#x27;, as each canon was supported by a set portion of the college&#x27;s endowment income. During the 11th and 12th centuries many such former minsters were provided with new statutes by which their endowments were split between their complement of canons, such that each canonry then became a &#x27;prebend&#x27;; but otherwise numbers of former minsters continued as &#x27;portioner&#x27; colleges through the medieval period.

=== Late-20th- and 21st-century additions ===
The Church of England has designated additional minsters in the 20th and 21st centuries, by adding an honorific title to existing parish churches. The practice continues in the 2020s. 

== Current usage in England ==
== Current usage in Wales ==
Wales saw the designation of its first minster church in 2024, as St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Swansea was officially granted minster status by the Church in Wales.

Similarly to Church of England practice, the Welsh anglicans announced that minster status is a title for large or important churches, particularly collegiate churches or cathedrals. The dedication was part of the Church in Wales historic £10 m effort of evangelism throughout Wales, and reflects the importance of the minster to the surrounding area. The dedication was presided over by archbishop of Wales Andrew John, in a special service on February 16, 2025.

== In German-speaking countries==
Some churches have the title &quot;Münster&quot;, and some churches are officially one but do not carry it in their name. Examples include: 
* Basel Minster
* Bern Minster
* Essen Minster
* Freiburg Minster
* Konstanz Minster
* Salem Minster
* Ulm Minster

<doc id="155117" wikidata="Q54795" url="?curid=155117" title="Pubic hair">
<text>Pubic hair (or pubes , ) is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area and pubic region of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs, and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs, even extending down the perineum, and to the anal region. Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum and base of the penile shaft (in males) and on the vulva (in females). Around the pubis bone and the mons pubis that covers it, it is known as a &quot;pubic patch&quot;, which can be styled.

Although fine vellus hair is present in the area during childhood, pubic hair is considered to be the heavier, longer, coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of hormones: androgens in males and estrogens in females. Pubic hair differs from other hair on the body, and is a secondary sex characteristic. 

Many cultures regard pubic hair as erotic, and most cultures associate it with the genitals, which people are expected to keep covered at all times. In some cultures, it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed, especially of females; the practice is regarded as part of personal hygiene. In some cultures, the exposure of pubic hair (for example, when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing, and is therefore trimmed (or otherwise styled) to avoid it being visible. 
==Development==
Pubic hair forms in response to the increasing levels of testosterone in both girls and boys. Those hair follicles that are located and stimulated in androgen sensitive areas develop pubic hair. The Tanner scale describes and quantifies the development of pubic hair. Before the onset of puberty, the genital area of both boys and girls has very fine vellus hair (stage 1). At the onset of puberty, the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones, and in response, the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher, often curlier, hair with a faster growth rate. The onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche.

In females, pubarche is usually the second sign of puberty after thelarche, though sometimes it happens before thelarche.

In males, the first pubic hair appears as a few sparse hairs that are usually thin on the scrotum or at the upper base of the penis (stage 2). Within a year, hairs around the base of the penis are abundant (stage 3). Within 3 to 4 years, hair fills the pubic area (stage 4) and becomes much thicker and darker, and by 5 years extends to the near thighs and upwards on the abdomen toward the umbilicus (stage 5).

Other areas of the skin are similarly, though slightly less, sensitive to androgens and androgenic hair typically appears somewhat later. In rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of androgenic hair are the armpits (axillae), perianal area, upper lip, preauricular areas (sideburns), periareolar areas (nipples), middle of the chest, neck under the chin, remainder of chest and beard area, limbs and shoulders, back, and buttocks. Although generally considered part of the process of puberty, pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of maturation of the gonads that leads to sexual maturation and fertility. Pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and nonfunctional. There is little, if any, difference in the capacity of male and female bodies to grow hair in response to androgens.

Pubic hair and underarm hair can vary in color considerably from the hair of the scalp. In most people, it is darker, although it can also be lighter. In most cases it is most similar in color to a person&#x27;s eyebrows.

Hair texture varies from tightly curled to entirely straight, not necessarily correlating to the texture of the scalp hair. People of East Asian heritage tend to have black, wavy pubic hair.

Pubic hair patterns can vary by race and ethnicity. Patterns of pubic hair, known as the &quot;escutcheon&quot;, vary between both the sexes and individuals. On most females, the pubic patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and mons pubis. On many males, the pubic patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel (see abdominal hair), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle. As with axillary (armpit) hair, pubic hair is associated with a concentration of sebaceous glands in the area.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Pubic lice ===
Pubic hair can become infested with pubic lice (also known as crab lice). Adult pubic lice are in length. The pubic hair can usually host up to a dozen on average. Pubic lice are usually found attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, chest, armpits, etc.). Crab lice attach to pubic hair that is thicker than other body hair because their claws are adapted to the specific diameter of pubic hair. Pubic lice infestations (pthiriasis) are usually spread through sexual contact.
The crab louse can travel up to 10 inches on the body. Pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races and ethnic groups and in all economic levels. Pubic lice are usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. Occasionally pubic lice may be spread by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linens, and towels that have been used by an infested person. Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse. Pubic lice do not transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection can occur from scratching of the skin. They are much broader in comparison to head and body lice. Adults are found only on the human host and require human blood to survive. If adults are forced off the host, they will die within 48 hours without a blood feeding.

Symptoms of a crab louse infection in the pubic area is intense itching, redness and inflammation. These symptoms cause increased circulation to the skin of the pubic region creating a blood-rich environment for the crab louse. Pubic lice infestation can also be diagnosed by identifying the presence of nits or eggs on the pubic hair. In December 2016 NPR reported that &quot;Frequent removal of pubic hair is associated with an increased risk for herpes, syphilis and human papillomavirus&quot;. However, the medical community has also seen a recent increase in folliculitis, or infection around the hair follicle, in women who wax or shave their bikini areas. Some of these infections can develop into more serious abscesses that require incision with a scalpel, drainage of the abscess, and antibiotics. &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is the most common cause of folliculitis. Burns can result when depilatory wax is used, even according to manufacturer instructions.

=== Grooming risks ===
Pubic hair grooming has been associated with injury and infection. It is estimated that about one quarter of the people who groom their pubic hair have had at least one lifetime injury because of the practice. Grooming has also been associated with cutaneous sexually transmitted infections, such as genital warts, syphilis, and herpes.

==Society and culture==

According to John Ruskin&#x27;s biographer Mary Lutyens, the notable author, artist, and art critic was apparently accustomed only to the hairless nudes portrayed unrealistically in art, never having seen a naked woman before his wedding night. He was allegedly so shocked by his discovery of his wife Effie&#x27;s pubic hair that he rejected her, and the marriage was later legally annulled. He is supposed to have thought his wife was freakish and deformed. Later writers have often followed Lutyens and repeated this version of events. For example, Gene Weingarten, writing in his book &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; (2004) states that &quot;Ruskin had [the marriage] annulled because he was horrified to behold upon his bride a thatch of hair, rough and wild, similar to a man&#x27;s. He thought her a monster.&quot; However, there is no proof for this, and some disagree. Peter Fuller in his book &quot;Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace&quot; writes, &quot;It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife&#x27;s pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood.&quot; Ruskin&#x27;s biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also believe that menstruation is the more likely explanation.

At puberty, many girls find the sudden sprouting of pubic hair disturbing, and sometimes as unclean, because in many cases young girls have been screened by their family and by society from the sight of pubic hair. Young boys, on the other hand, tend not to be similarly disturbed by the development of their pubic hair, usually having seen body hair on their fathers.

With the reintroduction of public beaches and pools, bathing in Western Europe and the Mediterranean early in the 20th century, exposure of both sexes&#x27; areas near their pubic hair became more common, and after the progressive reduction in the size of female and male swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and growth in popularity of the bikini after the 1940s, the practice of shaving or bikini waxing of pubic hair off the hem lines also came into vogue.

=== Grooming practices ===


In some Middle Eastern societies, removal of male and female body hair has been considered proper hygiene, mandated by local customs, for many centuries. Muslim teaching (applicable to males and females) includes Islamic hygienical jurisprudence in which pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as Sunnah. Trimming is taught to be considered acceptable.

Women working in pornography typically remove their pubic hair by shaving, a practice that became fashionable in the late 20th century. Shaving is used rather than bikini waxing because it can be performed daily, whereas waxing requires several days of growth before it can be repeated. According to feminist writer Caitlin Moran, the reason for the removal of pubic hair from women in pornography was a matter of &quot;technical considerations of cinematography&quot;. Hair removal progressed to full removal. Because of the popularity of pornography, pubic hair shaving was mimicked by women, and it is among women outside the pornography industry that waxing became common in the late 20th and 21st century.

The presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the style as unnatural. Some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the feel of a hairless crotch.

According to one academic study, as of 2016, approximately 50% of men in the United States practice regular pubic hair grooming, which can include trimming, shaving and removal. The study found that the prevalence of grooming decreases with age. Of males who groom pubic hair, 87% groom the hair above the penis, 66% groom the scrotum and 57% groom the penile shaft.

==== Methods ====

All hair can be removed with wax formulated for that purpose. Some individuals may remove part or all of their pubic hair, axillary hair and facial hair. Pubic hair removal using wax is called bikini waxing. The method of removing hair is called depilation (when removing only the hair above the skin) or epilation (when removing the entire hair). Beauty salons often offer various waxing services. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;pubic topiary&quot;. Sugaring, an alternative to waxing, uses a sugar-based paste, which may include lemon, rather than wax. Sugaring removes fewer skin cells than waxing. Other methods of hair removal include laser hair removal and electrolysis.

Some women modify their pubic hair, either to fit in with societal trends or as an expression of their own style or lifestyle. Styles of pubic hair modification include:
* Triangle or American wax (pubic hair is shortened from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair is hidden while wearing swimwear. The triangle can range from the very edge of the &quot;bikini line&quot; to up to an inch reduction on either side. Remaining hair length can be from an inch and a half to half an inch);
* Landing strip/French wax (pubic hair removed except for a strip of hair extending from the abdomen to the vulva);
* Partial Brazilian wax (pubic hair fully removed except for a small triangular strip); 
* Full Brazilian wax or &quot;sphinx&quot; (complete removal of pubic hair); and
* Freestyle.

There are variations of the Brazilian wax in which a design is formed out of the pubic hair. Stencils for several shapes are available commercially. A controversial Gucci commercial included female pubic hair shaved into a &#x27;G&#x27;.
==== Sexual attraction ====
A woman or man&#x27;s decision to grow or shave their pubic hair can play a role in attracting a partner. A &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; study found that a plurality of respondents, both male and female, preferred partners who shave or at least trim their pubic hair. A smaller percentage of 6% of men and 10% of women preferred their partners to go natural and not shave or trim their pubic hair.

=== In art ===
In ancient Egyptian art, female pubic hair is indicated in the form of painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, pubic hair was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, as was the case with Greek graphic art.

In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo&#x27;s male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair.

In the late 18th century, female pubic hair was openly portrayed in Japanese shunga (erotica), especially in the ukiyo-e tradition. Hokusai&#x27;s picture &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1814), which depicts a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. In Japanese drawings, such as hentai, pubic hair is often omitted, since for a long time the display of pubic hair was not legal. The interpretation of the law has since changed.

 (1866), by the French artist Gustave Courbet, was controversial for its realism, which pushed the limits of what was considered presentable at the time. In contrast to academic painting, which favored smooth, idealized nudes, this painting showed a close-up view of the vulva, with full pubic hair, of a woman lying on a bed with legs spread.

=== In fashion ===
In 1985, four weeks before his death, Rudi Gernreich unveiled the pubikini, a topless bathing suit that exposed the wearer&#x27;s &quot;mons pubis&quot; and pubic hair. It was a thin, V-shaped, thong-style bottom that in the front featured a tiny strip of fabric that exposed the wearer&#x27;s pubic hair. The pubikini was described as a &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; totally freeing the human body.

=== In history ===
Evidence of pubic hair removal in ancient India is thought to date back to 4000 to 3000 BC. According to ethnologist F. Fawcett, writing in 1901, he had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the vulva, as a custom of women from the Hindu Nair caste.

In Western societies, after the spread of Christianity, public exposure of a woman&#x27;s bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally. Upper body exposure due to the use of the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. Many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to be embarrassing. It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene. However, it never came to have a full hold in Western culture in wide tracts of Central Europe, until the encroaching of Protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs.

In the 1450s, British prostitutes shaved their pubic hair for purposes of personal hygiene and the combatting of pubic lice and would don merkins (or pubic wigs) when their line of work required it.

Among the British upper classes during the Georgian era, pubic hair from one&#x27;s lover was frequently collected as a souvenir. The curls were, for instance, worn like cockades in men&#x27;s hats as potency talismans or exchanged among lovers as tokens of affection. The museum of St. Andrews University in Scotland has in its collection a snuffbox full of pubic hair of one of King George IV&#x27;s mistresses (possibly Elizabeth Conyngham), which the notoriously licentious monarch donated to the Fife sex club, The Beggar&#x27;s Benison.

=== In literature ===

In the erotic novel &quot;My Secret Life&quot; the narrator &quot;Walter&quot;, an evident connoisseur of female pubic hair, talks with clear delight of a fine bush of a Scotswoman&#x27;s thick red pubic hair:

The bush was long and thick, twisting and curling in masses half-way up to her navel, and it spread about up her buttocks, gradually getting shorter there.

In another part of his autobiography Walter remarks that he has seen those &quot;bare of hair, those with but hairy stubble, those with bushes six inches long, covering them from bum bone to navel.&quot; And he adds reflectively – &quot;there is not much that I have not seen, felt or tried, with respect to this supreme female article.&quot;

In like vein, in &quot;The Memoirs of Dolly Morton&quot;, an American erotic classic, the attributes of Miss Dean are noted with some surprise – her spot was covered with a &quot;thick forest of glossy dark brown hair,&quot; with locks nearly two inches long. One man remarked:

But Gosh! I&#x27;ve never seen such a fleece between a woman&#x27;s legs in my life. Darn me if she wouldn&#x27;t have to be sheared before man could get into her.

<text>Münster (; ) is an independent city (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is in the northern part of the state and is considered to be the cultural centre of the Westphalia region. It is also a state district capital. Münster was the location of the Anabaptist rebellion during the Protestant Reformation and the site of the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648. Today, it is known as the bicycle capital of Germany.

Münster gained the status of a &quot;Großstadt&quot; (major city) with more than 100,000 inhabitants in 1915. , there are 300,000 people living in the city, with about 61,500 students, only some of whom are recorded in the official population statistics as having their primary residence in Münster. Münster is a part of the international Euregio region with more than 1,000,000 inhabitants (Enschede, Hengelo, Gronau, Osnabrück).

==History==

===Early history===
In 793, Charlemagne sent out Ludger as a missionary to evangelise the Münsterland. In 797, Ludger founded a school that later became the Cathedral School. Gymnasium Paulinum traces its history back to this school. Ludger was ordained as the first bishop of Münster. The first cathedral was completed by 850. The combination of ford and crossroad, market place, episcopal administrative centre, library and school, established Münster as an important centre. In 1040, Heinrich III became the first king of Germany to visit Münster.

===Middle Ages and early modern period===
In the Middle Ages, the Prince-Bishopric of Münster was a leading member of the Hanseatic League.

In 1534, an apocalyptic Anabaptist sect, led by John of Leiden, took power in the Münster rebellion and founded a democratic proto-socialistic state. They claimed all property, burned all books except the Bible, and called it the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;. John of Leiden believed he would lead the elect from Münster to capture the entire world and purify it of evil with the sword in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ and the beginning of the Millennium. They went so far as to require all citizens to be naked as preparation for the Second Coming. However, the town was recaptured in 1535; the Anabaptists were tortured to death and their corpses were exhibited in metal baskets, which can still be seen hanging from the tower of St. Lambert&#x27;s Church.

Part of the signing of the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 was held in Münster. This ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Eighty Years&#x27; War. It also guaranteed the future of the prince-bishop and the diocese; the area was to be exclusively Roman Catholic.

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===
The last outstanding palace of the German baroque period, the Schloss Münster, was created according to plans by Johann Conrad Schlaun. The University of Münster (called &quot;Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster&quot;, WWU, between 1907 and 2023) was established in 1780. It is now a major European centre for excellence in education and research with large faculties in the arts, humanities, theology, sciences, business and law. Currently there are about 40,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled. In 1802 Münster was conquered by Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars. It was also part of the Grand Duchy of Berg between 1806 and 1811 and the Lippe department of the First French Empire between 1811 and 1813, before returning to Prussian rule. It became the capital of the Prussian province of Westphalia. In 1899 the city&#x27;s harbour started operations when the city was linked to the Dortmund-Ems Canal.

===World War II===

In the 1940s the Bishop of Münster, Cardinal Clemens August Graf von Galen, was one of the most prominent critics of the Nazi government. In retaliation for his success (&quot;The New York Times&quot; described Bishop von Galen as &quot;the most obstinate opponent of the National Socialist anti-Christian program&quot;), Münster was heavily garrisoned during World War II, and five large complexes of barracks are still a feature of the city. Münster was the headquarters (Hauptsitz) for the 6th Military District (Wehrkreis) of the German Wehrmacht, under the command of Infantry General (General der Infanterie) Gerhard Glokke. Originally made up of Westphalia and the Rhineland, after the Battle of France it was expanded to include the Eupen – Malmedy district of Belgium. The headquarters controlled military operations in Münster, Essen, Düsseldorf, Wuppertal, Bielefeld, Coesfeld, Paderborn, Herford, Minden, Detmold, Lingen, Osnabrück, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, and Cologne.

Münster was the home station for the VI and XXIII Infantry Corps (Armeekorps), as well as the XXXIII and LVI Panzerkorps. Münster was also the home of the 6th, 16th and 25th Panzer Division; the 16th Panzergrenadier Division; and the 6th, 26th, 69th, 86th, 106th, 126th, 196th, 199th, 211th, 227th, 253rd, 254th, 264th, 306th, 326th, 329th, 336th, 371st, 385th, and 716th Infantry Divisions (Infanterie-division).

Münster was the location of the Oflag VI-D prisoner-of-war camp mostly for French, but also some Polish and Soviet officers, and a Nazi prison with several forced labour subcamps in the city and other localities.

The city was hit in one of the 1st “City Busting” Missions of the U.S. 8th Air Force on October 10, 1943. Much of the city center and the railway yard was heavily damaged in the raid but heavy casualties were inflicted against the American heavy bombers with the 100th Bomb Group losing 13 of the 14 B-17s that took part in the raid.

A secondary target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, Münster was bombed on 25 October 1944 by 34 diverted B-24 Liberator bombers, during a mission to a nearby primary target, the Scholven/Buer synthetic oil plant at Gelsenkirchen. About 63 per cent of the city including 91 per cent of the Old City was destroyed by Allied air raids. The US 17th Airborne Division, fighting as infantry, attacked Münster with the British 6th Guards Tank Brigade on 2 April 1945 and fought its way into the city centre, which was captured in house-to-house fighting on the following day.

===Postwar period===
From 1946 to 1998, there was a Latvian secondary school in Münster, and in 1947, one of the largest of about 93 Latvian libraries in the West was established in Münster. In the 1950s the Old City was rebuilt to match its pre-war state, though many of the surrounding buildings were replaced with cheaper modern structures. It was also for several decades a garrison town for the British forces stationed in West Germany.

===Post-reunification===
In 2004, Münster won an honourable distinction: the LivCom-Award for the most livable city in the world with a population between 200,000 and 750,000. Münster is famous and liked for its bicycle friendliness and for the student character of the city that is due to the influence of its university, the University of Münster.

==Geography==

===Geographic position===

Münster is situated on the river Aa, approximately south of its confluence with the Ems in the so-called Westphalian Bight, a landscape studded with dispersed settlements and farms – the &quot;Münsterland&quot;. The Wolstonian sediments of the mountain ridge called &quot;Münsterländer Kiessandzug&quot; cross the city from north to south. The highest elevation is the Mühlenberg in the northwest of Münster, 97 metres above sea level. The lowest elevation is at the Ems, 44 m above sea level. The city centre is 60 m above sea level, measured at the Prinzipalmarkt in front of the historic city hall.

The Dutch city of Enschede lies about northwest of Münster. Other major cities nearby include Osnabrück, about to the north, Dortmund, about to the south, and Bielefeld, about to the east.

Münster is one of the 42 agglomeration areas and one of Germany&#x27;s biggest cities in terms of area. But it includes substantial sparsely-populated rural districts which were formerly separate local government authorities until they were amalgamated in 1975. Thus nearly half the city&#x27;s area is agricultural, resulting in a low population-density of approximately 900 inhabitants per km2.

===Population density===
The city&#x27;s built-up area is quite extensive. There are no skyscrapers and few high-rise buildings but very many detached houses and mansions. Still the population density reaches about 15,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city centre. Calculating the population density based on the actual populated area results in approximately 2890 inhabitants per km2.

Münster&#x27;s urban area of is distributed into covered with buildings while are used for maintenance and for traffic areas, for agriculture and recreation, are covered by water, is forested and is used otherwise. The perimeter has a length of , the largest extend of the urban area in north–south direction is , in east–west direction .

===Climate===
A well-known saying in Münster is &quot;Entweder es regnet oder es läuten die Glocken. Und wenn beides zusammen fällt, dann ist Sonntag&quot; (&quot;Either it rains or the church bells ring. And if both occur at the same time, it&#x27;s Sunday.&quot;), but in reality the rainfall with approximately per year is close to the average rainfall in Germany. The perception of Münster as a rain-laden city isn&#x27;t caused by the absolute amount of rainfall but by the above-average number of rainy days with relatively small amounts of rainfall. The average temperature is with approximately 1500 sun hours per year. Consequently, Münster is in the bottom fifth in comparison with other German cities. The winter in Münster is fairly mild and snowfall is unusual. The temperature during summertime meets the average in Germany. The highest daily rainfall was registered on 28 July 2014: One weather station of the MeteoGroup reported a rainfall of ; the State Environment Agency registered at one of its stations during seven hours. The record rainfall led to severe flooding throughout the city and the nearby Greven.

===Adjacent cities and districts===
Münster borders on the following cities and municipalities, named clockwise and beginning in the northwest: Altenberge and Greven (District of Steinfurt), Telgte, Everswinkel, Sendenhorst and Drensteinfurt (District of Warendorf), as well as Ascheberg, Senden and Havixbeck (District of Coesfeld).

===City boroughs===
The city is divided into six administrative districts or Stadtbezirke: &quot;Mitte&quot; (Middle), &quot;Nord&quot; (North), &quot;Ost&quot; (East), &quot;West&quot;, &quot;Süd-Ost&quot; (South-East) and &quot;Hiltrup&quot;. Each district is represented by a council of 19 representatives elected in local elections. Heading each council is the district mayor, or &quot;Bezirksvorsteher&quot;. Every district is subdivided into residential quarters (&quot;Wohnbereiche&quot;). This official term, however, is not used in common speech, as there are no discrete definitions of the individual quarters. The term &quot;Stadtteil&quot; is used instead, mainly referring to the incorporated communities. The districts are also divided into 45 statistical districts.

The following list names each district with its residential and additional quarters. These are the official names, which partly differ from the usage in common speech.

*Mitte:
**Kernbereich (Centre)
*Nord:
**Münster-Coerde|Coerde
**Kinderhaus
**Sprakel with Sandrup
*Ost:
**Dyckburg, consisting of Mariendorf and Sudmühle
**Gelmer with Gittrup
**Handorf with Kasewinkel, Kreuzbach, Laer, Dorbaum and Verth on the left bank of the Ems and Werse
**Mauritz-Ost and Mondstraße, combined better known as St. Mauritz
*West:
**Albachten
**Gievenbeck
**Mecklenbeck
**Nienberge with Häger, Schönebeck and Uhlenbrock
**Roxel with Altenroxel and Oberort
**Sentruper Höhe

**Angelmodde with Hofkamp
**Gremmendorf with Loddenheide
**Wolbeck
*Hiltrup:
**Amelsbüren with Sudhoff, Loevelingloh and Wilbrenning
**Berg Fidel

*Aaseestadt
*Erphoviertel
*Geistviertel
*Hansaviertel
*Herz-Jesu-Viertel
*Kreuzviertel
*Kuhviertel
*Mauritzviertel
*Neutor
*Pluggendorf
*Rumphorst
*Schlossviertel

=== Representation ===
Münster forms its own Electoral district (No. 129) for elections on a national level. Due to Germany&#x27;s mixture of a direct and a proportional electoral system Münster sends a directly elected member into the Bundestag as well as other politicians have the chance to qualify via their party&#x27;s state-wide list. As for the 2021 German federal election health politician Maria Klein-Schmeink (The Greens) won the districts seat in the Bundestag with 32.3% of the personal vote. Defeated candidates, former member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia Stefan Nacke (CDU/26.2%) and former environment minister Svenja Schulze (SPD/24.1%) both became members of the 20th Bundestag via their parties&#x27; lists. Svenja Schulze entered the new Scholz cabinet regaining a position as minister, this time in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.

On the state level Münster was divided into two constituencies up until the 2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election. The election system of state elections mirrors that of national elections. During the legislative period of Laschet cabinet redistricting resulted in Münster now being split up into three constituencies, two of which now also include some surrounding municipalities. The 2017 election saw both CDU candidates Stefan Nacke and Simone Wendland winning their seat via the constituency. Via party lists Svenja Schulze (SPD) and Josefine Paul (The Greens) entered the Landtag. After Nacke and Schulze both changed into federal politics, Münster is left with only two representatives in the Landtag.

==Economy==
Greater Münster is home to many industries such as those of public authorities, consulting companies, insurance companies, banks, computer centres, publishing houses, advertising and design. The service sector has created several thousand jobs. Retailers have approximately 1.9 billion euro turnover. The city still has traditional merchants&#x27; townhouses as well as modern outlets.

==Entrepreneurship==
Münster&#x27;s wealth was underpinned by wealthy merchant families such as the Merfelders, Rüschkamps, and Berens.
Berens Bank was founded in 1630 in Münster, Germany, by Hermann Berens. Berens was a successful merchant and banker, and he founded the bank to provide financial services to other businesses and individuals in the city.
The Berens family lived in a large house on Roggenmarkt, known as the Berenshof. The Berens interests included textiles and grain.

The job market situation in Münster is &quot;comparatively good&quot;. Of the approximately 130,000 employees subject to social insurance contribution more than 80% work in the tertiary sector, about 17% work in the secondary sector and 1% work in the primary sector.

<doc id="155129" wikidata="Q505125" url="?curid=155129" title="Russenorsk">
<text>Russenorsk (; , ; English: Russo-Norwegian) is an extinct dual-source &quot;restricted pidgin&quot; language formerly used in the Arctic, which combined elements of Russian and Norwegian. Russenorsk originated from Russian traders from Kola (north-western Russia) and Norwegian fishermen from Tromsø (northern Norway). It was used extensively in Northern Norway for about 150 years in the Pomor trade. Russenorsk is important as a test case for theories concerning pidgin languages since it was used far away from most of the other documented pidgins of the world.

As is common in the development of pidgins and trade languages, the interaction of fishermen and traders with no common language necessitated the creation of some minimal form of communication. Like all pidgins, Russenorsk had a rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary, mostly composed of words essential to Arctic fishing and trade (fish, weather, etc.); however, Russenorsk was used outside of fishing and trade context during the off-season as it was not uncommon for Russians to remain in Norway during the winter.

==History==
Barter existed between Russians and Norwegians for 150 years in Troms and Finnmark counties. This barter was supported by the Norwegian government, and King Christian VII conferred city status to several settlements, such as Tromsø, to facilitate it. Norwegians mainly traded fish for flour and wheat from Russians. The trading went on throughout the sunny months of the year and was beneficial to both sides; Norwegians had access to cheap fish in the summer, whilst Russians had surplus wheat. Traders came from the areas near Murmansk and the White Sea, most often to the towns of Vardø, Hammerfest, and Tromsø, occasionally further south to the Lofoten islands.

The earliest recorded instance of Russenorsk was in 1785. It is one of the most studied northern pidgins; many linguists, for example, Olaf Broch, studied it. Unlike equatorial pidgins, it was formed from only two languages, Norwegian and Russian. Furthermore, these languages are not from the same branch of Indo-European languages. Also unlike equatorial pidgins, Russenorsk was formed from one social class.

Until 1850, Russenorsk was socially acceptable for all social classes. In 1850, Russenorsk became more limited to Norwegian fishermen, whereas Norwegian traders learnt Russian through exposure in Archangelsk and Russian trade centers, often formally studying the language to the extent that they could communicate in rudimentary Russian. This increase in Russian study caused the devaluation of Russenorsk in terms of social status.

In 1917, Finland&#x27;s declaration of independence from Russia caused the Russian–Norwegian border to decrease significantly. In 1919, the border disappeared completely. Furthermore, the Soviet Union limited international contact significantly, decreasing the need for the common language between Norwegians and Russians. The last such Norwegian–Russian trade occurred in 1923.

==Phonology==
Russenorsk uses many of the phonemes common to both Norwegian and Russian, altering phonemes only used in one. Pronunciation depended on the language background of the speaker.
*, absent in Norwegian, became : (, &#x27;how many?&#x27;) → .
*, absent in Norwegian, became : (, &#x27;good&#x27;) → .
*, absent in Russian, became : (&#x27;half&#x27;) → .
*final voiced consonants, absent in Russian, became unvoiced: (&#x27;sea&#x27;) → 

More is known about the Norwegian variety of Russenorsk due to the fact that most of the texts in Russenorsk were written by Norwegians. In the few Russian records of the language, there are examples of both and in the words (, &#x27;to give&#x27;) and (, &#x27;captain&#x27;), for which the Norwegians used . The Russian affricate in words such as (, &#x27;tea&#x27;) was substituted by the Norwegians with the fricative .
==Vocabulary==
Corpora of Russenorsk consist of lists of individual words and phrases as well as records of dialogues compiled by linguists such as Just Knud Qvigstad. The corpora include c. 400 words, about half of which only appear once in the records (so-called hapax legomena); therefore, the vocabulary contained only 150–200 core words.

The origin of its vocabulary is generally held to be approximately 40% Russian and 50% Norwegian, with the remaining 10% from Dutch, Low German, French, English, Sami, and Swedish. 

Many words in Russenorsk have a synonym from the other primary language.
*, (halibut)
*, (man)
*, (this)
*, (not)
Some words can be etymologically traced to both Norwegian and Russian, for example, (Norwegian) and (Russian). Some words have an unclear etymology; for example, or could have come from Russian, Swedish, or Finnish.

Some Russenorsk words survive in the dialect of Vardø:
* (Russenorsk: , , &#x27;to steal&#x27;)
* (, &#x27;bread&#x27;)

==Grammar==
One of the characteristics differentiating the pidgin from jargon is its grammar; however, Russenorsk did not go through tertiary hybridization. Russenorsk is mainly influenced by Norwegian grammar, leading some to conclude that it is a variant of Norwegian with some Russian influence.

A lack of metalinguistic awareness amongst Russenorsk speakers may have led them to believe they were speaking the language of their interlocutor; that is, that Russians believed they were speaking Norwegian and vice versa.

There are no clear verb conjugations. The main indication of a verb is the suffix , for example, (the captain is asleep in his cabin). Nominative nouns usually end with . Conjunctions used to make compound sentences or dependent clauses are , , and . is used as an interrogative word. The general word order is SVO, with some alterations for questions and sentences with adverbs.

 is used as the only preposition for the oblique case:
*For possession: (&#x27;your watch&#x27;)
*For location: (&#x27;little money in the pocket&#x27;), and (&#x27;Is the captain aboard the ship?&#x27;)
*For temporal relation: (&#x27;tomorrow&#x27;), (&#x27;last year&#x27;).
*For direction: (&#x27;I will throw you in the water&#x27;), (&#x27;How many days did you travel from here [to get] to Arkhangelsk?&#x27;), (&#x27;go to Arkhangelsk&#x27;).

===Morphology===
Russenorsk does not have extensive morphology, but has some unique characteristics. The ending does not come from Russian nor Norwegian, but it may come from Solombala English. The ending , from Norwegian, is used to indicate nationality or profession, for example (&#x27;Russian&#x27;), (&#x27;Norwegian&#x27;), or (&#x27;trader&#x27;). Other morphological features are reduplication, such as (&#x27;after tomorrow&#x27;), and compounding, such as (&#x27;cow&#x27;) and (&#x27;shirt&#x27;) to (&#x27;cowhide&#x27;).

===Syntax===
One characteristic syntactical attribute of Russenorsk is the tendency to move the verb to the final position when the sentence has adverbs. This is found in neither Russian nor Norwegian. Another is that the negator (, ) precedes the verb, but can be separated from the verb. This is unlike negation in either Russian or Norwegian, but it may have come from Finnish, in which this syntax was probable. Moreover, the use of barter-focused language established frequent use of interrogative speech in sentences.

<doc id="155131" wikidata="Q994942" url="?curid=155131" title="Bruxism">
<text>Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. It is an oral parafunctional activity; i.e., it is unrelated to normal function such as eating or talking. Bruxism is a common behavior; the global prevalence of bruxism (both sleep and awake) is 22.22%. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including aching jaw muscles, headaches, hypersensitive teeth, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings). Symptoms may be minimal, without patient awareness of the condition. If nothing is done, after a while many teeth start wearing down until the whole tooth is gone.

There are two main types of bruxism: one occurs during sleep (nocturnal bruxism) and one during wakefulness (awake bruxism). Dental damage may be similar in both types, but the symptoms of sleep bruxism tend to be worse on waking and improve during the course of the day, and the symptoms of awake bruxism may not be present at all on waking, and then worsen over the day.

The causes of bruxism are not completely understood, but probably involve multiple factors. Awake bruxism is more common in women, whereas men and women are affected in equal proportions by sleep bruxism. Awake bruxism is thought to have different causes from sleep bruxism. Several treatments are in use, although there is little evidence of robust efficacy for any particular treatment.
==Epidemiology==
There is a wide variation in reported epidemiologic data for bruxism, and this is largely due to differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism are not aware of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.

The ICSD-R states that 85–90% of the general population grind their teeth to a degree at some point during their life, although only 5% will develop a clinical condition. Some studies have reported that awake bruxism affects females more commonly than males, while in sleep bruxism, males and females are affected equally.

Children are reported to brux as commonly as adults. It is possible for sleep bruxism to occur as early as the first year of life, after the first teeth (deciduous incisors) erupt into the mouth, and the overall prevalence in children is about 14–20%. The ICSD-R states that sleep bruxism may occur in over 50% of normal infants. Often sleep bruxism develops during adolescence, and the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-olds is about 13%. The overall prevalence in adults is reported to be 8%, and people over the age of 60 are less likely to be affected, with the prevalence dropping to about 3% in this group.

According to a meta-analysis conducted in 2024, the global prevalence of bruxism (both sleep and awake) is 22.22%. The global prevalence of sleep bruxism is 21%, while the prevalence of awake bruxism is 23%. The occurrence of sleep bruxism, based on polysomnography, was estimated at 43%. The highest prevalence of sleep bruxism was observed in North America at 31%, followed by South America at 23%, Europe at 21%, and Asia at 19%. The prevalence of awake bruxism was highest in South America at 30%, followed by Asia at 25% and Europe at 18%. The review also concluded that overall, bruxism affects males and females equally, and affects elderly people less commonly.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people who brux are unaware of the problem, either because there are no symptoms, or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem. The symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking, and then slowly abate, and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day, and may not be present on waking. Bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms, including:

* A grinding or tapping noise during sleep, sometimes detected by a partner or a parent. This noise can be surprisingly loud and unpleasant, and can wake a sleeping partner. Noises are rarely associated with awake bruxism.
* Other parafunctional activity which may occur together with bruxism: cheek biting (which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum or linea alba), or lip biting.
* A burning sensation on the tongue (see: glossodynia), possibly related to a coexistent &quot;tongue thrusting&quot; parafunctional activity.
* Indentations of the teeth in the tongue (&quot;crenated tongue&quot; or &quot;scalloped tongue&quot;).
* Hypertrophy of the muscles of mastication (increase in the size of the muscles that move the jaw), particularly the masseter muscle.
* Tenderness, pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication, which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement.
* Trismus (restricted mouth opening).
* Pain or tenderness of the temporomandibular joints, which may manifest as preauricular pain (in front of the ear), or pain referred to the ear (otalgia).
* Clicking of the temporomandibular joints.
* Headaches, particularly pain in the temples, caused by muscle pain associated with the temporalis muscle.
* Excessive tooth wear, particularly attrition, which flattens the occlusal (biting) surface, but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction, where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline.
* Tooth fractures, and repeated failure of dental restorations (fillings, crowns, etc.).
* Hypersensitive teeth, (e.g. dental pain when drinking a cold liquid) caused by wearing away of the thickness of insulating layers of dentin and enamel around the dental pulp.
* Inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth, which may make them sore to bite on, and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth.
Bruxism is usually detected because of the effects of the process (most commonly tooth wear and pain), rather than the process itself. The large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system, namely the teeth, the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull (the temporomandibular joints). The muscles of mastication that act to move the jaw can also be affected since they are being utilized over and above of normal function.

===Pain===
Most people with bruxism will experience no pain. The presence or degree of pain does not necessarily correlate with the severity of grinding or clenching. The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise. The pain may be felt over the angle of the jaw (masseter) or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt just in front of the ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.

The relationship of bruxism with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, or temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome) is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD. Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism. Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism. A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower. In severe, chronic cases, bruxism can lead to myofascial pain and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints.

===Tooth wear===
Many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism. Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III incisal relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.

Abfraction is another type of tooth wear that is postulated to occur with bruxism, although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality. Abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth, in the cervical region as V-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces. It is argued that similar lesions can be caused by long-term forceful toothbrushing. However, the fact that the cavities are V-shaped does not suggest that the damage is caused by toothbrush abrasion, and that some abfraction cavities occur below the level of the gumline, i.e., in an area shielded from toothbrush abrasion, supports the validity of this mechanism of tooth wear. In addition to attrition, erosion is said to synergistically contribute to tooth wear in some bruxists, according to some sources.

===Tooth mobility===
The view that occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a causative factor in gingivitis and periodontitis is not widely accepted. It is thought that the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.

==Causes==

The muscles of mastication (the temporalis muscle, masseter muscle, medial pterygoid muscle and lateral pterygoid muscle) are paired on either side and work together to move the mandible, which hinges and slides around its dual articulation with the skull at the temporomandibular joints. Some of the muscles work to elevate the mandible (close the mouth), and others also are involved in lateral (side to side), protrusive or retractive movements. Mastication (chewing) is a complex neuromuscular activity that can be controlled either by subconscious processes or by conscious processes. In individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities, during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact, except while speaking, swallowing or chewing. It is estimated that the teeth are in contact for less than 20 minutes per day, mostly during chewing and swallowing. Normally during sleep, the voluntary muscles are inactive due to physiologic motor paralysis, and the jaw is usually open.

Ankyloglossia is suspected as a cause of bruxism.

Some bruxism activity is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths of a second (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. Bruxism can also be regarded as a disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the masseter muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.

===Multiple causes===
The cause of bruxism is largely unknown, but it is generally accepted to have multiple possible causes. Bruxism is a parafunctional activity, but it is debated whether this represents a subconscious habit or is entirely involuntary. The relative importance of the various identified possible causative factors is also debated.

Awake bruxism is thought to be usually semivoluntary, and often associated with stress caused by family responsibilities or work pressures. Some suggest that in children, bruxism may occasionally represent a response to earache or teething. Awake bruxism usually involves clenching (sometimes the term &quot;awake clenching&quot; is used instead of awake bruxism), but also possibly grinding, and is often associated with other semivoluntary oral habits such as cheek biting, nail biting, chewing on a pen or pencil absent mindedly, or tongue thrusting (where the tongue is pushed against the front teeth forcefully).

There is evidence that sleep bruxism is caused by mechanisms related to the central nervous system, involving sleep arousal and neurotransmitter abnormalities. Underlying these factors may be psychosocial factors including daytime stress which is disrupting peaceful sleep. Sleep bruxism is mainly characterized by &quot;rhythmic masticatory muscle activity&quot; (RMMA) at a frequency of about once per second, and also with occasional tooth grinding. It has been shown that the majority (86%) of sleep bruxism episodes occur during periods of sleep arousal. One study reported that sleep arousals which were experimentally induced with sensory stimulation in sleeping bruxists triggered episodes of sleep bruxism. Sleep arousals are a sudden change in the depth of the sleep stage, and may also be accompanied by increased heart rate, respiratory changes and muscular activity, such as leg movements. Initial reports have suggested that episodes of sleep bruxism may be accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux, decreased esophageal pH (acidity), swallowing, and decreased salivary flow. Another report suggested a link between episodes of sleep bruxism and a supine sleeping position (lying face up).

Disturbance of the dopaminergic system in the central nervous system has also been suggested to be involved in the etiology of bruxism. Evidence for this comes from observations of the modifying effect of medications which alter dopamine release on bruxing activity, such as levodopa, amphetamines or nicotine. Nicotine stimulates release of dopamine, which is postulated to explain why bruxism is twice as common in smokers compared to non-smokers.

===Historical focus===
Historically, many believed that problems with the bite were the sole cause for bruxism. It was often claimed that a person would grind at the interfering area in a subconscious, instinctive attempt to wear this down and &quot;self equiliberate&quot; their occlusion. However, occlusal interferences are extremely common and usually do not cause any problems. It is unclear whether people with bruxism tend to notice problems with the bite because of their clenching and grinding habit, or whether these act as a causative factor in the development of the condition. In sleep bruxism especially, there is no evidence that removal of occlusal interferences has any impact on the condition. People with no teeth at all who wear dentures can still have bruxism, although dentures also often change the original bite. Most modern sources state that there is no relationship, or at most a minimal relationship, between bruxism and occlusal factors. The findings of one study, which used self-reported tooth grinding rather than clinical examination to detect bruxism, suggested that there may be more of a relationship between occlusal factors and bruxism in children. However, the role of occlusal factors in bruxism cannot be completely discounted due to insufficient evidence and problems with the design of studies. A minority of researchers continue to claim that various adjustments to the mechanics of the bite are capable of curing bruxism (see Occlusal adjustment/reorganization).

===Psychosocial factors===
Many studies have reported significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress and anxiety to be the main triggering factors. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism are more likely to be single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrically shocked lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrical shocking of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.

===Genetic factors===
Some research suggests that there may be a degree of inherited susceptibility to develop sleep bruxism. 21–50% of people with sleep bruxism have a direct family member who had sleep bruxism during childhood, suggesting that there are genetic factors involved, although no genetic markers have yet been identified. Offspring of people who have sleep bruxism are more likely to also have sleep bruxism than children of people who do not have bruxism, or people with awake bruxism rather than sleep bruxism.

===Medications===
Certain stimulant drugs, including both prescribed and recreational drugs, are thought by some to cause the development of bruxism. However, others argue that there is insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Examples may include dopamine agonists, dopamine antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alcohol, cocaine, and amphetamines (including those taken for medical reasons). In some reported cases where bruxism is thought to have been initiated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, decreasing the dose resolved the side effect. Other sources state that reports of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors causing bruxism are rare, or only occur with long-term use.

Specific examples include levodopa (when used in the long term, as in Parkinson&#x27;s disease), fluoxetine, metoclopramide, lithium, cocaine, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate (used in attention deficit hyperactive disorder), and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-inducing analogues such as phenibut. Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) has been reported to be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.

===Occlusal factors===
Occlusion is defined most simply as &quot;contacts between teeth&quot;, and is the meeting of teeth during biting and chewing. The term does not imply any disease. Malocclusion is a medical term referring to less than ideal positioning of the upper teeth relative to the lower teeth, which can occur both when the upper jaw is ideally proportioned to the lower jaw, or where there is a discrepancy between the size of the upper jaw relative to the lower jaw. Malocclusion of some sort is so common that the concept of an &quot;ideal occlusion&quot; is called into question, and it can be considered &quot;normal to be abnormal&quot;. An occlusal interference may refer to a problem which interferes with the normal path of the bite, and is usually used to describe a localized problem with the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. A &quot;premature contact&quot; is one part of the bite meeting sooner than other parts, meaning that the rest of the teeth meet later or are held open, e.g., a new dental restoration on a tooth (e.g., a crown) which has a slightly different shape or position to the original tooth may contact too soon in the bite. A &quot;deflective contact/interference&quot; is an interference with the bite that changes the normal path of the bite. A common example of a deflective interference is an over-erupted upper wisdom tooth, often because the lower wisdom tooth has been removed or is impacted. In this example, when the jaws are brought together, the lower back teeth contact the prominent upper wisdom tooth before the other teeth, and the lower jaw has to move forward to allow the rest of the teeth to meet. The difference between a premature contact and a deflective interference is that the latter implies a dynamic abnormality in the bite.

===Possible associations===
Several associations between bruxism and other conditions, usually neurological or psychiatric disorders, have rarely been reported, with varying degrees of evidence (often in the form of case reports). Examples include:
* Acrodynia
* Atypical facial pain
* Autism
* Cerebral palsy
* Disturbed sleep patterns and other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, snoring, moderate daytime sleepiness, and insomnia
* Down syndrome
* Dyskinesias
* Epilepsy
* Eustachian tube dysfunction
* Infarction in the basal ganglia
* Intellectual disability, particularly in children
* Leigh disease
* Meningococcal septicaemia
* Multiple system atrophy
* Oromandibular dystonia
* Parkinson&#x27;s diseases, (possibly due to long-term therapy with levodopa causing dopaminergic dysfunction)
* Rett syndrome
* Torus mandibularis and buccal exostosis 
* Trauma, e.g. brain injury or coma
==Diagnosis==
Early diagnosis of bruxism is advantageous, but difficult. Early diagnosis can prevent damage that may be incurred and the detrimental effect on quality of life. A diagnosis of bruxism is usually made clinically, and is mainly based on the person&#x27;s history (e.g. reports of grinding noises) and the presence of typical signs and symptoms, including tooth mobility, tooth wear, masseteric hypertrophy, indentations on the tongue, hypersensitive teeth (which may be misdiagnosed as reversible pulpitis), pain in the muscles of mastication, and clicking or locking of the temporomandibular joints. Questionnaires can be used to screen for bruxism in both the clinical and research settings.

For tooth grinders who live in a household with other people, diagnosis of grinding is straightforward: Housemates or family members would advise a bruxer of recurrent grinding. Grinders who live alone can likewise resort to a sound-activated tape recorder. To confirm the condition of clenching, on the other hand, bruxers may rely on such devices as the Bruxchecker, Bruxcore, or a beeswax-bearing biteplate.

The Individual (personal) Tooth-Wear Index was developed to objectively quantify the degree of tooth wear in an individual, without being affected by the number of missing teeth. Bruxism is not the only cause of tooth wear. Another possible cause of tooth wear is acid erosion, which may occur in people who drink a lot of acidic liquids such as concentrated fruit juice, or in people who frequently vomit or regurgitate stomach acid, which itself can occur for various reasons. People also demonstrate a normal level of tooth wear, associated with normal function. The presence of tooth wear only indicates that it had occurred at some point in the past, and does not necessarily indicate that the loss of tooth substance is ongoing. People who clench and perform minimal grinding will also not show much tooth wear. Occlusal splints are usually employed as a treatment for bruxism, but they can also be of diagnostic use, e.g. to observe the presence or absence of wear on the splint after a certain period of wearing it at night.

The most usual trigger in sleep bruxism that leads a person to seek medical or dental advice is being informed by a sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It may be useful to help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.

Tooth wear may be brought to the person&#x27;s attention during routine dental examination. With awake bruxism, most people will often initially deny clenching and grinding because they are unaware of the habit. Often, the person may re-attend soon after the first visit and report that they have now become aware of such a habit.

Several devices have been developed that aim to objectively measure bruxism activity, either in terms of muscular activity or bite forces. They have been criticized for introducing a possible change in the bruxing habit, whether increasing or decreasing it, and are therefore poorly representative to the native bruxing activity. These are mostly of relevance to research, and are rarely used in the routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism. Examples include the &quot;Bruxcore Bruxism-Monitoring Device&quot; (BBMD, &quot;Bruxcore Plate&quot;), the &quot;intra-splint force detector&quot; (ISFD), and electromyographic devices to measure masseter or temporalis muscle activity (e.g. the &quot;BiteStrip&quot;, and the &quot;Grindcare&quot;).

===ICSD-R diagnostic criteria===
The ICSD-R listed diagnostic criteria for sleep bruxism. The minimal criteria include both of the following:
* A. symptom of tooth-grinding or tooth-clenching during sleep, and
* B. One or more of the following:
** Abnormal tooth wear
** Grinding sounds
** Discomfort of the jaw muscles

With the following criteria supporting the diagnosis:
* C. polysomnography shows both:
** Activity of jaw muscles during sleep
** No associated epileptic activity
* D. No other medical or mental disorders (e.g., sleep-related epilepsy, which may cause abnormal movement during sleep).
* E. The presence of other sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea syndrome).

===Definition examples===
&quot;Bruxism&quot; is derived from the Greek word (&quot;brykein&quot;) &quot;to bite, &quot;or&quot; to gnash, grind the teeth&quot;. People with bruxism are called &quot;bruxists&quot; or &quot;bruxers&quot; and the verb itself is &quot;to brux&quot;. There is no widely accepted definition of bruxism. Examples of definitions include:

===Classification by temporal pattern===

Bruxism can be subdivided into two types based upon when the parafunctional activity occurs – during sleep (&quot;sleep bruxism&quot;), or while awake (&quot;awake bruxism&quot;). This is the most widely used classification since sleep bruxism generally has different causes to awake bruxism, although the effects on the condition on the teeth may be the same. The treatment is also often dependent upon whether the bruxism happens during sleep or while awake, e.g., an occlusal splint worn during sleep in a person who only bruxes when awake will probably have no benefit. Some have even suggested that sleep bruxism is an entirely different disorder and is not associated with awake bruxism. Awake bruxism is sometimes abbreviated to AB, and is also termed &quot;diurnal bruxism&quot;, DB, or &quot;daytime bruxing&quot;. Sleep bruxism is sometimes abbreviated to SB, and is also termed &quot;sleep-related bruxism&quot;, &quot;nocturnal bruxism&quot;, or &quot;nocturnal tooth grinding&quot;. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders revised edition (ICSD-R), the term &quot;sleep bruxism&quot; is the most appropriate since this type occurs during sleep specifically rather than being associated with a particular time of day, i.e., if a person with sleep bruxism were to sleep during the day and stay awake at night then the condition would not occur during the night but during the day. The ICDS-R defined sleep bruxism as &quot;a stereotyped movement disorder characterized by grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep&quot;, classifying it as a parasomnia. The second edition (ICSD-2) however reclassified bruxism to a &quot;sleep related movement disorder&quot; rather than a parasomnia.

===Classification by cause===
Alternatively, bruxism can be divided into &quot;primary bruxism&quot; (also termed &quot;idiopathic bruxism&quot;), where the disorder is not related to any other medical condition, or &quot;secondary bruxism&quot;, where the disorder is associated with other medical conditions. Secondary bruxism includes iatrogenic causes, such as the side effect of prescribed medications. Another source divides the causes of bruxism into three groups, namely central or pathophysiological factors, psychosocial factors and peripheral factors. The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases 10th revision does not have an entry called bruxism, instead listing &quot;tooth grinding&quot; under somatoform disorders. To describe bruxism as a purely somatoform disorder does not reflect the mainstream, modern view of this condition (see causes).

===Classification by severity===
The ICSD-R described three different severities of sleep bruxism, defining mild as occurring less than nightly, with no damage to teeth or psychosocial impairment; moderate as occurring nightly, with mild impairment of psychosocial functioning; and severe as occurring nightly, and with damage to the teeth, temporomandibular disorders and other physical injuries, and severe psychosocial impairment.

===Classification by duration===
The ICSD-R also described three different types of sleep bruxism according to the duration the condition is present, namely acute, which lasts for less than one week; subacute, which lasts for more than a week and less than one month; and chronic which lasts for over a month.

==Management==
Treatment for bruxism revolves around repairing the damage to teeth that has already occurred, and also often, via one or more of several available methods, attempting to prevent further damage and manage symptoms, but there is no widely accepted, best treatment. Since bruxism is not life-threatening, and there is little evidence of the efficacy of any treatment, it has been recommended that only conservative treatment which is reversible and that carries low risk of morbidity should be used. The main treatments that have been described in awake and sleep bruxism are described below.

===Psychosocial interventions===
Given the strong association between awake bruxism and psychosocial factors (the relationship between sleep bruxism and psychosocial factors being unclear), the role of psychosocial interventions could be argued to be central to the management. The most simple form of treatment is therefore reassurance that the condition does not represent a serious disease, which may act to alleviate contributing stress.

Sleep hygiene education should be provided by the clinician, as well as a clear and short explanation of bruxism (definition, causes and treatment options). Relaxation and tension-reduction have not been found to reduce bruxism symptoms, but have given patients a sense of well-being. One study has reported less grinding and reduction of EMG activity after hypnotherapy.

Other interventions include relaxation techniques, stress management, behavioural modification, habit reversal and hypnosis (self hypnosis or with a hypnotherapist). Cognitive behavioral therapy has been recommended by some for treatment of bruxism. In many cases awake bruxism can be reduced by using reminder techniques. Combined with a protocol sheet this can also help to evaluate in which situations bruxism is most prevalent.

===Medication===
Many different medications have been used to treat bruxism, including benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, dopamine agents, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and others. However, there is little, if any, evidence for their respective and comparative efficacies with each other and when compared to a placebo. A multiyear systematic review to investigate the evidence for drug treatments in sleep bruxism published in 2014 (&quot;Pharmacotherapy for Sleep Bruxism&quot;. Macedo, et al.) found &quot;insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of sleep bruxism.&quot;

Specific drugs that have been studied in sleep bruxism are clonazepam, levodopa, amitriptyline, bromocriptine, pergolide, clonidine, propranolol, and l-tryptophan, with some showing no effect and others appear to have promising initial results; however, it has been suggested that further safety testing is required before any evidence-based clinical recommendations can be made. When bruxism is related to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression, adding buspirone has been reported to resolve the side effect. Tricyclic antidepressants have also been suggested to be preferable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in people with bruxism, and may help with the pain.

===Prevention of dental damage===
Bruxism can cause significant tooth wear if it is severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with bruxism very simple and only carry it out when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants, dental ceramics such as Emax crowns and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, the strength of the restoration becomes more important, sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a full coverage gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for esthetics rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.

Occlusal splints (also termed dental guards) are commonly prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, as a treatment for bruxism. Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep bruxism as well as bruxism overall.
Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.

Occlusal splints are divided into partial or full-coverage splints according to whether they fit over some or all of the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.

Splints may also reduce muscle strain by allowing the upper and lower jaw to move easily with respect to each other. Treatment goals include: constraining the bruxing pattern to avoid damage to the temporomandibular joints; stabilizing the occlusion by minimizing gradual changes to the positions of the teeth, preventing tooth damage and revealing the extent and patterns of bruxism through examination of the markings on the splint&#x27;s surface. A dental guard is typically worn during every night&#x27;s sleep on a long-term basis. However, a meta-analysis of occlusal splints (dental guards) used for this purpose concluded &quot;There is not enough evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism.&quot;

A &quot;repositioning splint&quot; is designed to change the patient&#x27;s occlusion, or bite. The efficacy of such devices is debated. Some writers propose that irreversible complications can result from the long-term use of mouthguards and repositioning splints. Random controlled trials with these type devices generally show no benefit over other therapies.
Another partial splint is the nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system (NTI-TSS) dental guard. This splint snaps onto the front teeth only. It is theorized to prevent tissue damages primarily by reducing the bite force from attempts to close the jaw normally into a forward twisting of the lower front teeth. The intent is for the brain to interpret the nerve sensations as undesirable, automatically and subconsciously reducing clenching force. However, there may be potential for the NTI-TSS device to act as a Dahl appliance, holding the posterior teeth out of occlusion and leading to their over-eruption, deranging the occlusion (i.e. it may cause the teeth to move position). This is far more likely if the appliance is worn for excessive periods of time, which is why NTI type appliances are designed for night time use only, and ongoing follow-ups are recommended.

A mandibular advancement device (normally used for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea) may reduce sleep bruxism, although its use may be associated with discomfort.

===Botulinum toxin===
Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is used as a treatment for bruxism. A 2020 overview of systematic reviews found that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) showed a significant pain and sleep bruxism frequency reduction when compared to placebo or conventional treatment (behavioral therapy, occlusal splints, and drugs), after 6 and 12 months.

Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis/atrophy by inhibition of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions. BoNT injections are used in bruxism on the theory that a dilute solution of the toxin will partially paralyze the muscles and lessen their ability to forcefully clench and grind the jaw, while aiming to retain enough muscular function to enable normal activities such as talking and eating. This treatment typically involves five or six injections into the masseter and temporalis muscles, and less often into the lateral pterygoids (given the possible risk of decreasing the ability to swallow) taking a few minutes per side. The effects may be noticeable by the next day, and they may last for about three months. Occasionally, adverse effects may occur, such as bruising, but this is quite rare. The dose of toxin used depends upon the person, and a higher dose may be needed in people with stronger muscles of mastication. With the temporary and partial muscle paralysis, atrophy of disuse may occur, meaning that the future required dose may be smaller or the length of time the effects last may be increased.

===Biofeedback=== 
Biofeedback is a process or device that allows an individual to become aware of, and alter physiological activity with the aim of improving health. Although the evidence of biofeedback has not been tested for awake bruxism, there is recent evidence for the efficacy of biofeedback in the management of nocturnal bruxism in small control groups. Electromyographic monitoring devices of the associated muscle groups tied with automatic alerting during periods of clenching and grinding have been prescribed for awake bruxism. Dental appliances with capsules that break and release a taste stimulus when enough force is applied have also been described in sleep bruxism, which would wake the person from sleep in an attempt to prevent bruxism episodes. &quot;Large scale, double-blind, experiment confirming the effectiveness of this approach have yet to be carried out.&quot;

===Occlusal adjustment/reorganization===
As an alternative to simply reactively repairing the damage to teeth and conforming to the existing occlusal scheme, occasionally some dentists will attempt to reorganize the occlusion in the belief that this may redistribute the forces and reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the dentition. Sometimes termed &quot;occlusal rehabilitation&quot; or &quot;occlusal equilibration&quot;, this can be a complex procedure, and there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the goals. It may involve orthodontics, restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism.

==History==
Two thousand years ago, &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; by Xu Shen documented the definition of Chinese character &quot;齘&quot; (bruxism) as &quot;the clenching of teeth&quot; (齒相切也).
In 610, &quot;Zhubing yuanhou lun&quot; by Chao Yuanfang documented the definition of bruxism (齘齒) as &quot;the clenching of teeth during sleep&quot; and explained that it was caused by Qi deficiency and blood stasis. In 978, &quot;Taiping Shenghuifang&quot; by &quot;Wang Huaiyin&quot; gave a similar explanation and three prescriptions for treatment.

&quot;La bruxomanie&quot; (a French term, translates to &quot;bruxomania&quot;) was suggested by Marie Pietkiewics in 1907. In 1931, Frohman first coined the term bruxism. Occasionally recent medical publications will use the word bruxomania with bruxism, to denote specifically bruxism that occurs while awake; however, this term can be considered historical and the modern equivalent would be awake bruxism or diurnal bruxism. It has been shown that the type of research into bruxism has changed over time. Overall between 1966 and 2007, most of the research published was focused on occlusal adjustments and oral splints. Behavioral approaches in research declined from over 60% of publications in the period 1966–86 to about 10% in the period 1997–2007. In the 1960s, a periodontist named Sigurd Peder Ramfjord championed the theory that occlusal factors were responsible for bruxism. Generations of dentists were educated by this ideology in the prominent textbook on occlusion of the time, however therapy centered around removal of occlusal interference remained unsatisfactory. The belief among dentists that occlusion and bruxism are strongly related is still widespread, however the majority of researchers now disfavor malocclusion as the main etiologic factor in favor of a more multifactorial, biopsychosocial model of bruxism.

==Society and culture==

Clenching the teeth is generally displayed by humans and other animals as a display of anger, hostility or frustration. It is thought that in humans, clenching the teeth may be an evolutionary instinct to display teeth as weapons, thereby threatening a rival or a predator. The phrase &quot;to grit one&#x27;s teeth&quot; is the grinding or clenching of the teeth in anger, or to accept a difficult or unpleasant situation and deal with it in a determined way.

In the Bible there are several references to &quot;gnashing of teeth&quot; in both the Old Testament, and the New Testament, where the phrase &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot; appears no less than 7 times in Matthew alone.

A Chinese proverb has linked bruxism with psychosocial factors. &quot;If a boy clenches, he hates his family for not being prosperous; if a girl clenches, she hates her mother for not being dead.&quot;(男孩咬牙，恨家不起；女孩咬牙，恨妈不死。)

In David Lynch&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, Henry Spencer&#x27;s partner (&quot;Mary X&quot;) is shown tossing and turning in her sleep, and snapping her jaws together violently and noisily, depicting sleep bruxism. In Stephen King&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, the sister of central character Bobbi Anderson also had bruxism. In the 2000 film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, the character of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) begins taking an amphetamine-based diet pill and develops bruxism. In the 2005 film &quot;Beowulf &amp; Grendel&quot;, a modern reworking of the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Selma the witch tells Beowulf that the troll&#x27;s name Grendel means &quot;grinder of teeth&quot;, stating that &quot;he has bad dreams&quot;, a possible allusion to Grendel traumatically witnessing the death of his father as a child, at the hands of King Hrothgar. The Geats (the warriors who hunt the troll) alternatively translate the name as &quot;grinder of men&#x27;s bones&quot; to demonize their prey. In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, King Stannis Baratheon grinds his teeth regularly, so loudly it can be heard &quot;half a castle away&quot;.

In rave culture, recreational use of ecstasy is often reported to cause bruxism. Among people who have taken ecstasy, while dancing it is common to use pacifiers, lollipops or chewing gum in an attempt to reduce the damage to the teeth and to prevent jaw pain. Bruxism is thought to be one of the contributing factors in &quot;meth mouth&quot;, a condition potentially associated with long term methamphetamine use.
