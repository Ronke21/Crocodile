<text>Sir Lenworth George Henry (born 29 August 1958) is a British Jamaican comedian, actor and writer. He gained success as a stand-up comedian and impressionist in the late 1970s and early 1980s, culminating in &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot; in 1984. He was the most prominent black British comedian of the time and much of his material served to celebrate and parody his African-Caribbean roots.

In 1985, he co-founded the charity Comic Relief with the comedy screenwriter Richard Curtis. He has appeared in numerous other TV programmes, including children&#x27;s entertainment show &quot;Tiswas&quot;, sitcom &quot;Chef!&quot; and &quot;The Magicians&quot; for BBC One, and in his later years has transitioned toward acting roles on stage and screen. He appears in the Amazon Prime series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;.

Henry was the chancellor of Birmingham City University. In February 2024, he announced his planned retirement from the position at the end of the 202324 academic year after eight years in the post.

==Early life==
Lenworth George Henry was born at Burton Road Hospital in Dudley, on 29 August 1958, and named after the doctor who delivered him to Winston Jervis Henry (1910–1978) and Winifred Louise Henry (1922–1998), who had emigrated to Britain from Jamaica. The fifth of seven children, Henry was the first child of the family to be born in the United Kingdom. When Henry was 10 years old, he began spending time with the man who was later revealed to be his biological father, Albert Augustus &quot;Bertie&quot; Green (1927–2004), another Jamaican immigrant with whom his mother had a brief relationship when she first arrived in England from their native Jamaica.

Henry attended St John&#x27;s Primary School and later The Blue Coat School in Dudley, before completing his schooling at W.R. Tuson College in Preston, Lancashire.

==Career==

===Early career===
Henry&#x27;s formative years in comedy were spent in working men&#x27;s clubs, where he impersonated mainly white characters, such as the &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; character Frank Spencer. His earliest television appearance was on the &quot;New Faces&quot; talent show in 1975, aged 16, which he won with impersonations of Frank Spencer, Stevie Wonder and others.

His first manager was Robert Luff, who signed him in 1975 and gave him the opportunity, between the ages of 16 and 21, to perform as a comedian as part of the Luff-produced touring stage version of &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;. In July 2009, Lenny Henry stated he was contractually obligated to perform and regretted his part in the show, telling &quot;The Times&quot; in 2015 that his appearance on the show led to a profound &quot;wormhole of depression&quot;, and he regretted his family not intervening.

In 1976, Henry appeared with Norman Beaton in LWT&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Fosters&quot;, Britain&#x27;s first comedy series featuring a predominantly black cast. Henry also made guest appearances on television programmes including &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, &quot;Seaside Special&quot; and &quot;The Ronnie Corbett Show&quot;.

===1980s===

In 1980, Henry performed in Summer Season in Blackpool with Cannon and Ball. He has since said that &quot;the summer season was the first time [he] felt that [his] act had received a proper response from an audience&quot;. Around the same time, he co-hosted the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Tiswas&quot; from 1978 until 1981 playing such characters as Rastafarian Algernon Razzmatazz, David Bellamy and Trevor McDoughnut (a parody of Trevor McDonald), and subsequently performed in and wrote for the show &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;.

Also in 1980, he teamed up with alternative-comedy collective The Comic Strip. While involved with the group, he met his wife, comedian Dawn French. She encouraged him to move over to the fledgling alternative comedy scene, where he established a career as a stand-up comedy performer and character comedian.

He introduced characters who both mocked and celebrated African Caribbean British culture, such as Brixton pirate radio disc jockey DJ Delbert Wilkins. His stand-up material, which sold well on LP, owed much to the writing abilities of Kim Fuller. During this time, he also spent three years as a DJ on BBC Radio 1, playing soul and electro tracks and introducing some of the characters that he would later popularise on television. He made a guest appearance in the final episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; as The Postman, in 1984.

The first series of &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot; appeared on the BBC in 1984. The show featured stand up, spoofs like his send-up of Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller video, and many of the characters he had developed during Summer Season, including Theophilus P. Wildebeeste (based on Teddy Pendergrass) and Delbert Wilkins. A principal scriptwriter for his television and stage shows during the 1990s was Jon Canter. &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot; ran periodically for a further 19 years in various incarnations. Across the incarnations, he performed impressions of several iconic American celebrities such as Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Tina Turner, Prince, Michael Jackson (the two men shared a date of birth), Stevie Wonder, Run-DMC, Cee Lo Green, Denzel Washington, Idris Elba and Wesley Snipes.

It was in 1985 that Henry co-founded the British Comic Relief charity organisation, and 1988 when the first-ever Red Nose Day was celebrated. Over 150 celebrities and comedians, including Henry, took part in an evening-long BBC broadcast, which was watched by 30 million viewers and raised over £15 million.

Prior to the 1987 general election, Henry lent his support to Red Wedge by participating in a comedy tour organised by the campaign.

In 1987, he appeared in a TV film, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;. It was a comedy thriller with John Shea about two DJs with a shared passion for Motown music being chased across Britain. The film has a strong following, but contractual problems have prevented it from being distributed on video or DVD.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Henry starred in the Hollywood film &quot;True Identity&quot;, in which his character pretended to be a white person (using make-up, prostheses, and a wig) to avoid the mob. The film was not commercially successful. In 1991, he starred in a BBC drama alongside Robbie Coltrane called &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, in which he played a heroin addict, which was based on a true story.

Also in 1991, he starred in the Christmas comedy &quot;Bernard and the Genie&quot; alongside Alan Cumming and Rowan Atkinson. Moreover, Henry is known as the choleric chef Gareth Blackstock from the 1990s television comedy series &quot;Chef!&quot;, and from his 1999 straight-acting lead role in the BBC drama &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;. He was co-creator with Neil Gaiman and producer of the 1996 BBC drama serial &quot;Neverwhere&quot;.

Henry appeared as a backing singer on Kate Bush&#x27;s album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1993) for the song &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; on which Prince played guitar. He also performed, backed by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, at Amnesty International&#x27;s Big 3-0 fund raising concert. Henry returned to the BBC to do &quot;Lenny Henry in Pieces&quot;, a character-based comedy sketch show which was followed by &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;, in which he combined stand-up, character sketches and song parodies.

In 1994, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; reported that Henry was set to star in a biographical film of Billy Strachan&#x27;s life titled &quot;A Wing and a Prayer&quot;, however the script was never turned into a movie. Peter Frost, a journalist for the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, believes that Strachan&#x27;s communist beliefs were somewhat responsible for the movie not being created.

===2000s===

In 2003, Henry was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the fifty funniest acts in British comedy. He was the voice of the British speaking clock for two weeks in March 2003 in aid of Comic Relief.

Henry voiced Dre Head, the &quot;shrunken head&quot; on the Knight Bus, in the 2004 Alfonso Cuarón movie &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, and read the audiobook version of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Anansi Boys&quot;. He also voiced Sporty on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Little Robots&quot;. Henry appeared in advertisements for butter products in New Zealand, commissioned by the company now known as Fonterra, as well as portraying Saint Peter in the Virgin Mobile advertising campaign in South Africa. In the UK, he used his character of Theophilus P. Wildebeeste to advertise Alpen muesli, and promoted the non-alcoholic lager Kaliber.

In June 2000, for a BBC documentary, he sailed a trimaran from Plymouth to Antigua with yachtsman Tony Bullimore. In 2005, he appeared in Birmingham, as an act for &quot;Jasper Carrott&#x27;s Rock with Laughter&quot;. He appeared alongside performers such as Bill Bailey, Jasper Carrott, Bonnie Tyler, Bobby Davro and the &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; troupe. In 2006, Henry starred in the BBC programme &quot;Berry&#x27;s Way&quot;. On 16 March 2007, Henry made a cameo appearance as himself in a sketch with Catherine Tate, who appeared in the guise of her character Geordie Georgie from &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. The sketch was made for the BBC Red Nose Day fundraising programme of 2007.

On 16 June 2007, Lenny appeared with Chris Tarrant and Sally James to present a 25th anniversary episode of &quot;Tiswas&quot;. The show lasted 90 minutes and featured celebrities discussing their enjoyment of &quot;Tiswas&quot; as children, as well as appearances from kids and people who had appeared on the original show. In the summer of 2007, he presented &quot;Lenny&#x27;s Britain&quot;, a comedy documentary tour made with the Open University on BBC One on Tuesday nights. In late 2007, he hosted a stand-up comedy tour of the UK.

In early 2008, Henry&#x27;s series &quot;lennyhenry.tv&quot; was broadcast on BBC One. The programme has an accompanying website of the same name and broadcasts strange, weird and generally amusing online videos and CCTV clips. He starred in the Radio 4 show &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rare Records&quot;. On 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2009, he appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s &quot;Hootenanny&quot; on BBC Two, singing part of the song &quot;Mercy&quot; along with singer Duffy. In January 2009, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Live at The Apollo&quot;, in which he played host for the night, introducing Andy Parsons and Ed Byrne, where he referred to Wikipedia as &quot;Wrongopedia&quot; for containing incorrect information about his life.

In October 2009, Henry reprised his role of Deakus to feature in comedy shorts about story writing alongside Nina Wadia, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Stephen K. Amos. He also offers his own writing tips and amusing anecdotes in the writing tips video clip on BBC raw words – story writing. He supplied the voices of both Big and Small in the BBC CBeebies children&#x27;s programme &quot;Big &amp; Small&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010, Henry produced and starred in a five-part web series for the BBC Comedy website, &quot;Conversations with my Wife&quot;, about a fictional couple conversing over Skype while the wife is away on business leaving the husband (played by Henry) to hold the fort at home.

In 2008, he became the face of budget hotel operator Premier Inn. One of the 2010 adverts caused controversy and was banned from children&#x27;s programming hours as it parodied a well-known scene from the film &quot;The Shining&quot;, with Lenny Henry spoofing the scene originally starring Jack Nicholson, smashing a door with an axe and then thrusting his head through the door saying: &quot;Here&#x27;s Lenny.&quot;

In 2011, Henry presented a Saturday night magic series called &quot;The Magicians&quot; on BBC One. The show returned in 2012; however, Henry was replaced by Darren McMullen.

In March 2011, he appeared with Angela Rippon, Samantha Womack and Reggie Yates in the BBC fundraising documentary for Comic Relief called &quot;Famous, Rich and in the Slums&quot;, wherein the four celebrities were sent to Kibera in Kenya, the African continent&#x27;s largest slum.

Henry was criticised for his opening sketch for the 2011 Comic Relief, during which he spoofed the film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; and grew impatient with Colin Firth&#x27;s portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech. &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as &quot;a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else&#x27;s misfortune&quot;.

In 2014, Henry appeared in and produced a play based on his radio show &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rare Records&quot;, which played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre before moving on to a run in London.

Henry wrote &quot;Danny and the Human Zoo&quot;, a ninety-minute television film shown on BBC One in 2015. Directed by Destiny Ekaragha, it was a fictionalised account of Henry&#x27;s life as a teenager in 1970s Dudley. Henry played Samson Fearon, a character based on Henry&#x27;s own father Winston.

In 2017, Henry appeared in a recurring role in the third series of &quot;Broadchurch&quot;.

In November 2019, it was announced that Henry would guest star in &quot;Spyfall&quot;, the two-part opening episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s twelfth revived series, which broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Day and 4 January 2020. Henry played technology billionaire Daniel Barton.

In December 2020, Henry was announced as a cast member of Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. It premiered on 1 September 2022.

In 2021, Henry appeared as a contestant on the second series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Blob&quot;. He finished in 6th place.

On 6 November 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published &quot;Black British culture matters&quot;, curated by Henry and Marcus Ryder for its Saturday Culture Issue No7.

On 31 January 2024, Henry announced that he would be hosting Comic Relief for the final time when the fundraiser returned on 15 March.

In 2024, Henry voiced Mr. Convenience in &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;.

==Shakespeare==
Henry was introduced to the works of Shakespeare when he made the 2006 Radio 4 series &quot;Lenny and Will&quot;, which saw him going &quot;in search of the magic of Shakespeare in performance&quot;. In February 2009, he appeared in the title role in the Northern Broadsides production of &quot;Othello&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Before the production opened the director Barrie Rutter said of the decision to cast him: &quot;knives might be out at me or at Lenny. I don&#x27;t care. This has come about from a completely genuine desire to do a piece of theatrical work. Bloody hell, how long has the Donmar had Hollywood stars going there for £200? He&#x27;s six-foot five. He&#x27;s beautifully black. And he&#x27;s Othello.&quot;

Henry received widespread critical acclaim in the role. Charles Spencer in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said &quot;This is one of the most astonishing debuts in Shakespeare I have ever seen. It is impossible to praise too highly Henry&#x27;s courage in taking on so demanding and exposed a role, and then performing it with such authority and feeling.&quot; Michael Billington in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted &quot;Henry&#x27;s voice may not always measure up to the rhetorical music of the verse, but there is a simple dignity to his performance that touches one&quot;. Lynne Walker of &quot;The Independent&quot; said of Henry that his &quot;emotional dynamism is in no doubt. The frenzy within his imagination explodes into rage and, finally, wretchedness. It&#x27;s not a subtle reading but it works powerfully in this context.&quot;

Henry has said that he saw parallels between himself and Othello. &quot;I&#x27;m used to being the only black person wherever I go...There was never a black or Asian director when I went to the BBC. Eventually I thought &#x27;where are they all?&#x27; I spent a lot of time on my own. Things have changed a bit, but rarely at the BBC do I meet anyone of colour in a position of power.&quot;

The production was scheduled to transfer to the West End of London from 11 September to 12 December 2009, to be performed at the Trafalgar Studios in Whitehall.

In November 2011, Henry made his debut at the Royal National Theatre in London in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, directed by Dominic Cooke, in which he played the character of Antipholus of Syracuse. The production was selected to be broadcast live to selected cinemas worldwide in March 2012 as part of the National Theatre Live programme. Henry&#x27;s performance gained positive reviews. Paul Taylor in &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that &quot;Henry beautifully conveys the tragicomic plight of an innocent abroad.&quot;

==Other work==
===Music===
In 2015, Henry was asked by Sky Arts to produce a show for them, &quot;Lenny Henry&#x27;s Got The Blues&quot;. He worked with a group of musicians including Jakko Jakszyk, lead singer of King Crimson, to produce the album &quot;New Millennium Blues&quot;. The album consists of both covers of blues classics, as well as original tracks co-written by Lenny. Henry later released &quot;hard-hitting animated blues video&quot; directed by Iranian filmmaker, Sam Chegini titled &quot;The Cops Don&#x27;t Know&quot; which was premiered by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine on 20 April 2016.

===Writing===
Henry has published four books: two autobiographies and two young adult fantasies.

One work, &quot;Who Am I, Again?&quot; (2019), is a memoir that covers his formative years, starting with the arrival of his parents in Dudley, and ending when he began to experience success in the late 1970s.

Another is &quot;Rising to the Surface&quot;; it continues his memoirs from the point his first set ended. &quot;Rising...&quot; covers his rise to fame. Henry begins with his children&#x27;s show &quot;Tiswas&quot; and continues through his &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;, which was broadcast for 20 years, though not continuously.

Henry&#x27;s two young adult books were written to address his belief that the lack of non-white characters in fantasy was harmful to young adult non-white readers. &quot;The Boy With Wings&quot; tells the story of a boy who sprouts wings and learns to fly. He and his friends must save the world. &quot;The Book of Legends&quot; features two black siblings, Bran and Fran, who live with their mother in a small Midlands town. When their mother goes missing, their hunt for her leads them to another world.

==Personal life==
Henry met Dawn French on the alternative comedy circuit. They married on 20 October 1984 in Covent Garden, London and have one child, an adopted daughter named Billie. On 6 April 2010, French and Henry announced they were &quot;amicably&quot; separating after 25 years of marriage. Their divorce was finalised in 2010.

Since 2010, Henry has been in a relationship with Casting Director and Theatre Producer Lisa Makin.

Henry obtained a BA Hons degree in English Literature from the Open University in 2007 and an MA in Screenwriting for TV and Film from Royal Holloway, University of London in 2010. He subsequently studied at the latter institution for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree on the role of black people in the media. In July 2018, Henry was awarded a PhD in media arts for a thesis titled &quot;Does the Coach Have to be Black? The Sports Film, Screenwriting and Diversity: A Practice-Based Enquiry&quot;. Henry was later awarded an additional honorary doctorate from Royal Holloway in 2024.

Henry has been an open critic of British television&#x27;s lack of ethnic diversity in its programmes. During a speech at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in March 2014, he called the lack of minorities &quot;appalling&quot; and he has continued to raise the issue publicly.

In March 2021, Henry wrote an open letter urging everyone to get a COVID-19 vaccination. Henry stated people ought to, &quot;trust the facts&quot; and distrust misinformation. Henry also wrote, &quot;Because we love you – we want you to be safe and we don&#x27;t want you to be left out or left behind. While other communities are rushing to get the vaccine and millions have already been vaccinated, some Black people in our community are being more cautious.&quot; The letter encourages black UK adults to take an informed decision over the vaccine and get vaccinated so as to protect themselves and those they care for.

Henry is a lifelong supporter of West Bromwich Albion Football Club.

==Honours==
Henry was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 New Year Honours. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the British Comedy Awards in 2003. He was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s 2015 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity. In July 2016, Henry became the chancellor of Birmingham City University citing his passion to give life changing opportunities to young people from a wide range of backgrounds. In February 2024, Henry announced that he is stepping down from the role of Chancellor by the end of the year. Henry has also been listed in the &quot;Powerlist&quot; of the 100 most influential Black Britons, including ranking fourth in 2016.

In 2016, Henry was made a fellow of the Royal Television Society. Henry was awarded the Alan Clarke Award at the BAFTA TV Awards. Also in 2016, Henry was awarded an honorary doctorate from Nottingham Trent University in recognition of his significant contribution to British comedy and drama, along with his achievements in international charity work.

In 2022, Henry won the Special Recognition award at the 27th National Television Awards.

<text>John Francis Junkin (29 January 1930 – 7 March 2006) was an English actor and scriptwriter who had a long career in radio, television and film, specialising in comedy.

==Early life==

Born in Ealing, Middlesex, the son of a policeman, Junkin and his parents subsequently moved to Forest Gate so that he could attend St Bonaventure&#x27;s Catholic School there, before qualifying as a teacher at St Mary&#x27;s College, Strawberry Hill. He worked as a primary school teacher in the East End for three years before becoming a professional actor and scriptwriter.

==Career==
In 1960, Junkin joined Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Stratford East Theatre Workshop and played the lead in the original production of &quot;Sparrers Can&#x27;t Sing&quot;. A few years later, he joined the Royal Court Theatre company, and was the foil to Tony Hancock in some of Hancock&#x27;s last work for British television. Junkin played a diverse range of roles on the small screen; however, he is best remembered for his comedy roles and his appearances as a television quiz master. To international audiences, he may be best remembered for playing Shake, the assistant to Norman Rossington, in the Beatles film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. In comedy roles, Junkin was rarely short of work, on account of his ability to play the stony-faced symbol of low level, petty-minded and unquestioning authority, whether the army sergeant, police constable or site foreman.

In 1964 Junkin recorded a number of radio programmes on land for the fledgling ship-based pirate radio station Radio Caroline. His announcements did not include any topical references, and the music was played in by studio engineers. When the programmes were broadcast, the onboard DJs occasionally cut in to give live time checks .

One of his rare leading roles was in the BBC series &quot;The Rough with the Smooth&quot;, in which he and Tim Brooke-Taylor played comedy writers (with both actors contributing scripts to the series as well). He also hosted his own afternoon television series in the mid-1970s. Titled simply &quot;Junkin&quot;, it was produced by Southern Television for the ITV network.

Junkin has an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the voice of Mr Shifter, one of the chimps in the PG Tips tea advertisement, the longest-running series of commercials on television.

With Barry Cryer, Junkin wrote for Morecambe and Wise from 1978 to 1983, in addition to two Christmas specials in 1972 and 1976.

==Personal life and death==
Junkin lived in Wendover, Buckinghamshire. He married public relations executive Jenny Claybourn in 1977 and had a daughter, Annabel. Junkin and his wife separated in 1992. He died from lung cancer on 7 March 2006 in the Florence Nightingale House, Aylesbury, several miles from his home. A heavy smoker, he had also been suffering from emphysema and asthma. His life and work were honoured at the British Academy Television Awards in 2006.

<text>Authorization or authorisation (see spelling differences) is the function of specifying rights/privileges for accessing resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to IAM (Identity and Access Management) in particular. More formally, &quot;to authorize&quot; is to define an access policy during the configuration of systems and user accounts. For example, user accounts for human resources staff are typically configured with authorization for accessing employee records, and this policy gets formalized as access control rules in a computer system. Authorization must not be confused with access control. During usage, access control enforces the authorization policy by deciding whether access requests to resources from (authenticated) consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources include individual files or an item&#x27;s data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer.

==Overview==
IAM consists the following two phases: the configuration phase where a user account is created and its corresponding access authorization policy is defined, and the usage phase where user authentication takes place followed by access control to ensure that the user/consumer only gets access to resources for which they are authorized. Hence, access control in computer systems and networks relies on access authorization specified during configuration. 

Most modern, multi-user operating systems include role-based access control (RBAC) where authorization is implicitly defined by the roles. User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of consumers. When an authenticated consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of &quot;policy definition application&quot;, e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, or a policy administration point e.g. XACML. On the basis of the &quot;principle of least privilege&quot;: consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.

&quot;Anonymous consumers&quot; or &quot;guests&quot;, are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys, certificates and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.

Trusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. &quot;Partially trusted&quot; and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.

Even when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user&#x27;s authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.

==Related interpretations==
===Public policy===
In public policy, authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control.

===Banking===
In banking, an authorization is a hold placed on a customer&#x27;s account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card.

===Publishing===

In publishing, sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author. These are called unauthorized texts. An example is the 2002 &quot; &#x27;The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe&#x27; &quot;, which was collected from Stephen Hawking&#x27;s lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law.

<text>The River Avon, also known as the River Aune, is a river in the county of Devon in the southwest of England. It rises in the southern half of Dartmoor National Park in an area of bog to the west of Ryder&#x27;s Hill. Close to where the river leaves Dartmoor a dam was built in 1957 to form the Avon reservoir (see Dartmoor reservoirs). After leaving the moor it passes through South Brent and then Avonwick and Aveton Gifford and flows into the sea at Bigbury-on-Sea. Near Loddiswell the valley flows through Fosse Copse a woodland owned and managed by the Woodland Trust.

The estuary lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is part of the South Devon Heritage Coast.

From 1893 until its closure in 1963, the Kingsbridge branch line railway line ran along the valley of the Avon between Kingsbridge and South Brent.

<text>The River Avon ( or ) in central England flows generally southwestwards and is a major left-bank and easternmost tributary of the River Severn. It is also known as the Warwickshire Avon or Shakespeare&#x27;s Avon, to distinguish it from several other rivers of the same name in the United Kingdom.

Beginning in Northamptonshire, the river flows through or adjoining the counties of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, near the Cotswold Hills area. Notable towns it flows through include Rugby, Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, Evesham, Pershore and Tewkesbury, where it joins the Severn. It has traditionally been divided since 1719 into the Lower Avon, below Evesham, and the Upper Avon, from Evesham to above Stratford-upon-Avon.

Improvements to aid navigation began in 1635, and a series of locks and weirs made it possible to reach Stratford, and to within of Warwick. The Upper Avon was tortuous and prone to flooding, and was abandoned as a means of navigation in 1877. The Lower Avon struggled on, and never really closed, although by 1945 it was only navigable below Pershore. Restoration of the lower river as a navigable waterway began in 1950, and was completed in 1962. The upper river was a more daunting task, as most of the locks and weirs were no longer extant. Work began in 1965 on the construction of nine new locks and of river, using mainly volunteer labour, and was completed in 1974 when it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

The Avon connects with the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal in the centre of Stratford, and is used primarily by leisure craft. Plans to extend the navigable river to provide a link with the Grand Union Canal at either Warwick or Leamington Spa have met with some opposition.

==Etymology==

&quot;Avon&quot; derives from the British language , &quot;river&quot;, which also survives as a number of other English and Scottish river names, and as modern Welsh and Cornish &quot;avon&quot;, &quot;river&quot;. This makes &quot;River Avon&quot; an example of a tautological place name.

==Course==
The source of the Avon is from a spring near the village of Naseby in Northamptonshire. For the first few miles of its length from the village of Welford it forms the border between Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, on this section, it has been dammed to create Stanford Reservoir. Upon reaching Dow Bridge on Watling Street it enters Warwickshire. It then flows in a generally west-southwesterly direction, passing through the towns and villages of Rugby, Wolston, (bordering Leamington Spa), Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, Welford-on-Avon, Bidford-on-Avon, Evesham and Pershore, before it joins the River Severn at Tewkesbury.

The river has a total length of and a catchment size of . The Avon&#x27;s tributaries include the Rivers Swift, Leam, Stour, Sowe, Dene, Arrow, Isbourne and Swilgate as well as many minor streams and brooks.

A long distance footpath has been created which follows the river from its source to the River Severn at Tewkesbury. The route is marketed as Shakespeare&#x27;s Avon Way, and is long. It uses existing footpaths and tracks to stay as close to the river as is reasonably possible.

==Prehistory==
Before the last Ice Age about 50,000 years ago, the Warwickshire Avon was a small river which drained northwards to the River Trent. During the Wolstonian glacial period, ice advanced into the Midlands from the north, east and west blocking the flow of the Avon to its former confluence with the Trent. The waters were thus trapped: on the north, east and west by the glacier, and by the Cotswolds to the south, resulting in the formation of a large glacial lake, which has been called Lake Harrison. At its maximum, it is considered that this glacial lake covered the whole of Warwickshire and was over deep. After about 10,000 years, when the glacier finally retreated, the water was able to cut through the previous watershed and to escape to the southwest, so forming the present day route of the river.

==Navigation==
From Alveston weir, which is upstream of Stratford-upon-Avon, downstream to Tewkesbury and the River Severn, the river has been rendered navigable by the construction of locks and weirs. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal links to the Avon through a lock in the park in front of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. The River Avon can be used by boats with a maximum length of , beam of , height of and draught of from Tewkesbury to Evesham. Above Evesham, beam is restricted to and draught to .

The river is crossed by two manually operated pedestrian chain ferries, these being the Hampton Ferry in Evesham and the Stratford-upon-Avon Ferry in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Traffic is now exclusively leisure-oriented. Overnight moorings are available at Stratford-upon-Avon, Luddington, Welford-on-Avon, Barton, Bidford-on-Avon, Harvington, Offenham, Evesham, Craycombe, Wyre, Pershore, Defford, Comberton, Birlingham, Eckington, Strensham and Tewkesbury. There are boatyards at Stratford-upon-Avon, Welford-on-Avon, Barton, Bidford-on-Avon, Evesham, and Tewkesbury.

The river forms part of the Avon Ring, a circular cruising route which is long, and includes 129 locks. From Tewkesbury it follows the course of the River Severn, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal to arrive back at the Avon at Stratford-upon-Avon.

==History==
The navigation works on the Avon were originally authorised by an Order in Council and Letters Patent of Charles I in 1635, which named William Sandys as the grantee, with powers to improve both this river and the River Teme. He had already bought a number of mills on the river, but there were few objections from millers at those he did not own, for he built pound locks with two sets of gates, to enable vessels to pass by without the large loss of water associated with flash locks. The only objections were from Sir William Russell, who owned Strensham mill, and whose grievance was about land purchase, rather than the navigation works. By 1641 it was reported that the river was navigable to within of Warwick.

After a period of decline, navigation rights along the river were confirmed by a clause in the Rivers Stour and Salwarpe Navigation Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. &quot;14&quot;). Further improvements were made to the river above Evesham from 1664 by a syndicate led by Andrew Yarranton. He was working for Lord Windsor and others, and the work included the construction of three navigation weirs, which were a type of flash lock with a single barrier. These were used to enable boats to pass over shoals, and with the exception of the one at Pensham, were not built adjacent to mills. The Pensham watergate did at times hinder the proper operation of the mill, when the water levels rose above the gate. Once Yarranton&#x27;s work was completed, barges of 30 tonnes could navigate to Stratford.

Ownership of the navigation was formally divided into the Upper and Lower Avon in 1717, with Evesham being the dividing point. The Lower Avon Navigation between Evesham and the River Severn was leased by George Perrott in 1758, who spent over £4,000 upgrading the locks and weirs to enable 40-ton barges to navigate the river. The work was completed by 1768. Perrott then intended to sell the navigation, but when the Stratford Canal was being promoted, he had a clause inserted into the Bill to force the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to make payments to him in view of the expected drop in tolls that the Navigation would experience. Once the Stratford Canal was completed, there was fierce competition between the Upper and Lower Avon companies, with coal from the Worcester and Birmingham coming up-river to Evesham, and coal coming down-river from Stratford. As the tolls dropped, Perrott leased the Lower river to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal company from 1830 until 1851.
Meanwhile, the Upper Avon Navigation between Stratford and Evesham was owned by relatives of Lord Windsor, who had died in 1758, and its condition gradually deteriorated. Because of the sinuous course of the upper river, it was never really considered as a through navigation, except for a brief period when William James thought it could become a through route. He bought all of the shares in the Upper Avon company in 1813, and persuaded the Stratford Canal shareholders that there should be a junction between their canal and the river at Stratford, which was opened on 24 June 1816. In 1822, he spent £6,000 repairing the locks on the upper river, and became bankrupt. The navigation was taken over by seven men, all connected with the Stratford Canal, who turned Lucy&#x27;s lock at Stratford into a two-rise staircase lock, constructed three new locks, and improved the river by dredging. Most of the subsequent traffic was local, competing with the Lower Avon for the delivery of coal to Evesham. The Upper Avon was leased to the Stratford Canal from 1842, but there was little traffic, and the lease was not renewed in 1847. The arrival of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway at Stratford sealed its fate, and when the company failed to sell the navigation to local landowners for £150, they effectively abandoned it in 1857. John Broughton, who was the railway manager at Stratford, was persuaded to buy the navigation for £300 by local traders, but the venture was short-lived. Broughton was succeeded, and the railway, now called the West Midland Railway, became part of the Great Western Railway. In 1875, the GWR decided it would no longer maintain the river, and an appeal to the Railway Commissioners in 1877 ruled that they were not obliged to do so.

The Lower Avon Navigation never quite fell into total disuse. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal renewed their lease in 1851 for a further 21 years, but traffic was severely hit by the opening of a railway link from Ashchurch to Evesham in 1864. Receipts had dropped to £139 in 1872, and the canal company did not renew their lease again. Somehow the navigation remained open, and as the commercial traffic declined, there was a gradual increase in pleasure usage. By the end of the Second World War only one barge was plying the stretch between Tewkesbury and Pershore, and the river above Pershore became unnavigable.

==Restoration==
The first moves to return the waterway to a navigable condition occurred in March 1949, when the &quot;Evesham Journal&quot; published an article on its history and decline. Robert Aickman started a correspondence with the editor of the article, suggesting that the river could be restored. C. Douglas Barwell sought legal advice on how best the proposal could be managed, out of which the &quot;Lower Avon Navigation Trust Ltd&quot; (&quot;LANT&quot;) was constituted as a charity in 1950, and the BBC broadcast news of the proposals in April 1950. By May 1952, despite being in a period of great austerity, LANT had raised over £4,000 towards the work, and the involvement of the Royal Engineers, who helped with the reconstruction of Chadbury Lock as a training exercise, increased public awareness, and enabled further public appeals for funds to be made. By 1962, LANT had raised over £50,000, the 7 locks from Tewkesbury to Evesham were restored to working order, re-opening the Lower Avon, and plans were already being made to rebuild Evesham Town Lock and press on towards Stratford. Mrs Barwell, the wife of Douglas Barwell, formally opened the waterway in June 1962. Mr. Barwell received an OBE for his work on the navigation.

An anonymous benefactor was about to give £80,000 in 1963 towards the restoration on the Upper Avon, while a donation of £5,000 enabled Evesham lock to be rebuilt and opened on 11 June 1964. Collins Brothers, who owned the lock site, with the main dam, sluice and weir, donated them to the Lower Avon Navigation Trust in 1966, extending the jurisdiction of the Lower Avon above its historical limits. The other waterway to Stratford, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, had been restored by the National Trust and was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother exactly a month later, and her involvement caught the public&#x27;s imagination. Although the Upper Avon was in a much worse condition than the Lower Avon, the &quot;Upper Avon Navigation Trust Ltd&quot; (&quot;UANT&quot;) was constituted in 1965 to rebuild it. The project was led by David Hutchings, fresh from completing the Stratford Canal restoration, who obtained permission to build a new lock at Stratford in early 1966, and launched an appeal for £6,000 to fund it. Work began on 19 July 1966, once half the cost had been raised.
The concept of building new locks and weirs, with most of the work being undertaken by volunteers, was new. Negotiation with the Severn River Authority led to an agreement that such works could be constructed, which was eventually formalised when a private Bill was put before parliament, which became the Upper Avon Navigation Act 1972. Further funding came from an Inland Waterways Association national restoration fund, launched in 1969. Work continued, with phase one, covering the section from Evesham to Bidford Bridge, being declared open on 12 June 1971, during an IWA boat rally at Bidford. The estimated cost for the complete restoration was £250,000, all of which was raised by public subscriptions, with the exception of a grant for £25,000 from the Department of the Environment, which was made at the time of the phase 1 opening. The project, which involved the construction of nine new locks, reopening a navigation which had been derelict for over 100 years, was completed on 1 June 1974, when Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother returned to Stratford to declare it open. It was the largest project of its type to that date, and Hutchings was awarded an MBE for his leadership.

==Proposed extension==
There have been proposals to extend the navigation upstream from Alveston to a link with the Grand Union Canal at either Warwick or Leamington Spa. This was first considered by the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974, who conducted a survey, the cost of which was partly funded by the Inland Waterways Association. This would open up a stretch of river that has never previously been navigable, but the proposal has not been universally welcomed. Landowners at Warwick Castle and Charlecote Park have attempted to claim the river as private property, although the 1636 Orders of Council state that the river was free to Coventry. Despite much local support, there is still some opposition to the scheme.

==Commercial traffic==

Commercial traffic returned to the Avon in May 2010, as part of a scheme to build flood defences at the town of Pershore, following flooding in 2007, which caused damage to a number of properties. Clay banks were constructed, with most of the material coming from Birlingham, further downstream. Some 15,000 tonnes of clay was excavated and transported by barge to the construction works. At Birlingham, the excavation was managed to create a wetland reserve for wildlife, with of wet grassland and of open water and reed beds. Worcestershire Wildlife Trust worked with the landowner to create the reserve, which is called the John Bennett Reserve. The use of barges to transport the clay was estimated to save 3,000 lorry trips between the two sites.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Avon was as follows in 2022.
Reasons for the water quality being less than good include run off from agricultural land and discharge from sewage treatment plants, both private and public, while the lower river is also affected by physical modification of the channel. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

== Sporting achievements ==

At 01:18 on Sunday 18 July 2021, 41 year old Craig Openshaw from Tewkesbury became the first person in the world to swim the entire length of the 47.1 mile Navigable River Avon; known as the &#x27;Swim The Avon&#x27; project. Craig was supported by a four man land and boat crew consisting of Robert Stringer, Bob Bain, Joe Bawdon and Phil Leibrandt.

Despite being an ex-competitive pool swimmer, Craig had never taken part in open water swimming previously and the crew had never embarked on any similar challenges.

The team set off from Alveston Weir in Stratford-Upon-Avon at 20:00 on Friday 16 July 2021 and swam through the day and night to complete the 47.1 mile swim. The challenge was completed in 29 hours and 18 minutes.

Bob Bain also rowed the entire course as lead kayak, in memory of his late wife Gail Bain.

The swim captured the imagination of local communities along the river, with hundreds of spectators turning out to encourage the team.

Craig finished the world first swim following an intensive 3 month long training programme and completed all of his training in the river Avon. Permission to complete the swim was granted by the Avon Navigation Trust who verified the swim had never been previously completed.

The team raised a total of £17,800 for Cancer Research UK, with the challenge featuring on various news outlets such as BBC News.

<text>The River Avon ( ) is in the south of England, rising in Wiltshire, flowing through that county&#x27;s city of Salisbury and then west Hampshire, before reaching the English Channel through Christchurch Harbour in the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole conurbation of Dorset.

It is sometimes known as the Salisbury Avon or the Hampshire Avon to distinguish it from namesakes across Great Britain. It is one of the rivers in Britain in which the phenomenon of anchor ice has been observed. The Avon is thought to contain more species of fish than any other river in Britain. Long-farmed pastures and planted, arable fields line much of the valley; an indication of the wealth these brought to landowners is in ten large listed houses with statutorily recognised and protected parks. Many prehistoric sites and broader &quot;landscapes&quot; are found on either side of the river, the largest being the World Heritage Site zone of Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, followed by the Old Sarum knoll fortification and the Thornham Down prehistoric and medieval landscape.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name is a tautology: &quot;Avon&quot; is the Proto-Brythonic word meaning &quot;river&quot;.

==Course==

The Avon begins as two separate bodies of water. The western arm rises to the east of Devizes, draining the Vale of Pewsey, and is joined by Etchilhampton Water which rises in the Bishops Cannings area and flows south past Etchilhampton and through Patney. The eastern arm rises at Easton Royal, east of Pewsey, and is joined by the Woodborough Stream which rises at Alton Priors and flows south through Woodborough and North Newnton.

The two branches merge at Upavon, flowing southwards across Salisbury Plain through Durrington, Amesbury and Salisbury. To the south of Salisbury the river enters the Hampshire Basin, flowing along the western edge of the New Forest through Fordingbridge and Ringwood, meeting up with the River Stour at Christchurch, to flow into Christchurch Harbour. The harbour opens into the English Channel past a cluster of small mouths of brooks from the New Forest and a broad sandbank, which is all built up as the Mudeford part of the harbour.

All the significant direct and indirect tributaries of the Avon, including the Nadder, Wylye, Bourne and Ebble, converge within a short distance around Salisbury.

A short distance north from the river&#x27;s western source is Morgan&#x27;s Hill, which marks the hydrological triple divide of Great Britain, where rainfall drains into the English Channel (via this River Avon), the Atlantic Ocean (via the Bristol Avon and Severn Estuary) and the North Sea (via the Kennet and Thames).

About half of the river is in Wiltshire; the rest is split between Hampshire and (since the 1974 boundary changes) Dorset.

As two Avons drain parts of Wiltshire, the river is popularly known as the Hampshire Avon or the Salisbury Avon (and the other as the Bristol Avon).

== 17th-century navigation ==

Construction of a navigation from Salisbury to Christchurch was authorised by the River Avon Navigation (Christchurch to New Sarum) Act 1664 (16 &amp; 17 Cha. 2. c. 12). Work began in 1675 and the route was completed in 1684, but it fell out of use around 1715. Canalised channels were dug to straighten sections of the river, including one through Britford parish just below Salisbury; a lock survives on this section near Longford Castle, having been rebuilt in brick as a pound lock soon after the original flash lock was damaged by flooding in the early 18th century.

==Path==
The Avon Valley Path follows the river between Salisbury and Christchurch.

==Rights of way==
Canoeists seeking lawful passage as high as Salisbury have attempted to invoke the 1644 Navigation Act in their favour. However, the Act was subject to enabling works, most of which were never completed, hence the right is disputed. Responsibility for delivery was given to private undertakers in the names of Hodges, Bennett and Dennett, who were to fund the canalisation between the places. They were allowed to charge their investment at 10% interest rate and could take full commercial advantage, which tripartite agreements from 1684 and 1685 evidence. The House of Commons Journal of 31 January 1699 records that the freeholders, inhabitants and residents of Ibsley and Fordingbridge petitioned the House on the fact that they could not comply with the 1664 Act and were never likely to do so. The House sided with them and effectively declared its view of the law, the finality of which, lacking royal assent, the law of rights of way is unclear on but makes more likely the view that the Act became voidable as the works to canalise the Avon were never implemented. Indecisive court cases were brought in 1737 and 1772 to enforce the alleged but not exercised right (to benefit barge owners).

==Landowner&#x27;s houses with parkland==

The valley from north to south has the following houses with large parks and gardens, significantly funded in their original form by the rich, mixed agriculture from the little-wooded upper valley plains and sides:
*Conock Manor, Chirton
*Amesbury Abbey
*Lake House, Wilsford
*Heale House, Middle Woodford
*Wilton House (including orangery, loggietta, whispering seat, classical bridges, follies, columns, Holbein porch, James Wyatt architecture)
*Longford Castle (including two listed bridges over the river, parterre, statues of fame and Diana)
*Trafalgar Park, Downton (including chapel)
*Hale Park (includes lodge, barns and granaries)
*Breamore House (includes tower, and museum cottage)
* Somerley (includes salmon huts, farmhouses and extensive water meadows)
*Avon Tyrrell House, Sopley (includes lodge and gazebo)

==Scheduled monument landscapes==

The largest of this type is England&#x27;s main World Heritage Site of this category, which includes Stonehenge.

Others include massive earthworks at Old Sarum, and across the larger, separate Thornham Down area.

== Designations ==
In 1993 the Avon valley in Hampshire between Bickton (downstream of Fordingbridge) and Christchurch was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

In 1996 almost the entire river, from Patney (Wiltshire) to Christchurch, together with its tributaries the Wylye, Nadder, Bourne and Dockens Water, was designated as the River Avon System SSSI.

==Conservation initiatives in the 2000s==
A four-year project called STREAM began in September 2005. This £1 million project was designed to benefit the habitats of species such as water-crowfoot, Atlantic salmon, brook lamprey, sea lamprey, bullhead, Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail, gadwall and &quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot; (Berwick&#x27;s swan). A sister project called Living River ran from 2006 to 2010, aiming to providing better access and recreation, as well as aid biodiversity. Both these projects were shortlisted for the 2009 Thiess International Riverprize, competing against four other projects: the Yellow River in China, Lake Simcoe in Canada, the Polochic Basin in Guatemala and the Lower Owens River in the USA. The prize for 2009 was awarded to Lake Simcoe.

<text>The River Avon ( ) is a river in the southwest of England. To distinguish it from a number of other rivers of the same name, it is often called the Bristol Avon. The name &#x27;Avon&#x27; is loaned from an ancestor of the Welsh word , meaning &#x27;river&#x27;.

The Avon rises just north of the village of Acton Turville in South Gloucestershire, before flowing through Wiltshire into Somerset. In its lower reaches from Bath (where it meets the Kennet and Avon Canal) to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth near Bristol, the river is navigable and is known as the Avon Navigation.

The Avon is the 19th longest river in the United Kingdom, at , although there are just as the crow flies between the source and its mouth in the Severn Estuary. The catchment area is .

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Avon&quot; is loaned from the Common Brittonic , &quot;river&quot;, which survives in the Welsh word &quot;afon&quot; . &quot;River Avon&quot;, therefore, literally means &quot;river river&quot;; several other English and Scottish rivers share the name. The County of Avon that existed from 1974 to 1996 was named after the river, and covered Bristol, Bath, and the lower Avon valley.

== Course ==
The Avon rises on the southern edge of the Cotswold hills, at Didmarton in Gloucestershire; at Joyce&#x27;s Pool a plaque marks the source. It flows south-east into Wiltshire to Sherston, where it is joined by the Luckington Brook which drains an area west of Luckington that includes the Badminton House estate.

From Sherston the river flows east to Malmesbury, where it is joined by its first major tributary, the Tetbury Avon, which rises just east of Tetbury in Gloucestershire. This is known locally as the Ingleburn, which in Old English means &#x27;English river&#x27;. The two rivers flow north and south of a rocky outcrop, almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on. Upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;River Avon (Sherston branch)&#x27; to distinguish it from the Tetbury branch.

After the two rivers merge, the Avon turns southeast away from the Cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale is now known as the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford-on-Avon, where the centre of the town grew up around a ford, hence the origin of the town&#x27;s name (&quot;Broad-Ford&quot;). This was supplemented in Norman times by the Grade I listed bridge that still stands today; originally a packhorse bridge, it was widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the downstream side.

The Avon Valley between Bradford-on-Avon and Bath is an example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found: road, rail, river, canal. The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts which carry the Kennet and Avon Canal, and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome. Avoncliff Aqueduct was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801. The aqueduct consists of three arches and is long with a central elliptical arch of span with two side arches each semicircular and across, all with V-jointed arch stones. The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry, and rock-faced blocks. The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times. The Dundas Aqueduct was built by the same team between 1797 and 1801 and completed in 1805. James McIlquham was appointed contractor. The aqueduct is long with three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. The central semicircular arch spans ; the two oval side arches span . It is a Grade I listed structure, and was the first canal structure to be designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1951. The stretch of river below and above the aqueduct, where it is joined by Midford Brook, has been used by rowing crews from Monkton Combe School since at least the beginning of the 1900s.

It then flows past Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon by Warleigh Weir into the canal, using power from the flow of the river. The pumping station is located in a pump house built of Bath Stone, located at river level. Water is diverted from the river by Warleigh Weir, about upstream. The water flows down a leat to the pumping station, where it powers a water wheel, wide and in diameter, with 48 wooden slats. At full power the wheel uses 2 tons (2 tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives gearing which increases the speed to 16 rpm. From here, cranks drive vertical connecting rods which transfer the energy to two long cast iron rocking beams. Each rocking beam in turn drives an 18 in (0.5 m) diameter lift pump, which also take their supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises of water to the canal. In 1981, British Waterways installed two electric pumps just upstream from the station.

The Avon then flows through Bathford, where it is joined by the Bybrook River, and Bathampton where it passes under the Bathampton Toll Bridge. It is joined by the Lam Brook at Lambridge in Bath and then passes under Cleveland and Pulteney Bridges and over the weir.

Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine, owner of the Coalbrookdale Ironworks, with Henry Goodridge as the architect, on the site of a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further development of Georgian Bath to take place on the south side of the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using Bath Stone and a cast iron arched span.

Pulteney Bridge was completed in 1773 and is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed structure. The bridge was designed by Robert Adam, and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It is named after Frances Pulteney, heiress in 1767 of the Bathwick estate across the river from Bath. Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. It was rebuilt by John Pinch the Elder, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam&#x27;s design. Bath and North East Somerset council have discussed plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone, but it remains open to buses and taxis.

Some 700 metres below Pulteney weir, the river is joined by the Kennet and Avon Canal which connects through Bath Locks. Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, this provides a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point downstream the river is known as the Avon Navigation.

=== Navigation ===

The Avon above Bath remains navigable as far as Bathampton where there is the remains of a flash lock. However, the lock past the weir below Pulteney Bridge was demolished when the weir was reconstructed, so passage between the sections is only possible for dinghies and canoes using the roller slipway on the side of the weir.

Beyond its junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal, the Avon flows through Keynsham towards Bristol. For much of its course after leaving Wiltshire, it marks the traditional boundary between Somerset and Gloucestershire. For most of this distance the navigation makes use of the natural riverbed, with six locks overcoming a rise of . From Bath to Netham Lock where it divides into the New Cut and the Floating Harbour is . The stretch is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs.

In the centre of Bath it passes under various bridges, including the Midland Bridge which was built by the Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park terminus station. In November 2011, the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston Lock on the outskirts of Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge area. Weston Cut is a man made channel, opened in 1727, for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock; the island created between the cut and the river weir became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.

Kelston Lock and weir have permanent moorings above and below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by the remains of the Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a Grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859, Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around Swineford Lock, served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. The river is joined by the Siston Brook at Londonderry Wharf, terminus of the dramway which brought coal from Coalpit Heath. The final river lock, Hanham Lock, is on the edge of the Bristol built-up area; below here the river is affected by high tides which overtop Netham Weir. Above the weir, in the St Anne&#x27;s area of Bristol, the river is joined by Brislington Brook.

Netham Lock is the point at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the Avon gain access to Bristol&#x27;s floating harbour. Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut, where it is joined by the River Malago, and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system designed and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. Access to the harbour is only possible during the day, when the lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is above or below the level of the harbour. Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol&#x27;s flood defence mechanisms.


In central Bristol, where the river is tidal, it is diverted from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 at a cost of £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the floating harbour, since it enables ships to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide ebbs. The harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop&#x27;s locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributary, the River Frome, and is intimately entwined with Bristol&#x27;s city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the floating harbour is one of the more successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water heavily used by leisure craft. Downstream of central Bristol, the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge: the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but dries to a steep-sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the floating harbour as commercial docks, and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.

Before reaching its mouth, the Avon is joined by the River Trym at Sea Mills which was the site of &quot;Portus Abonae&quot;, a Roman port. Shortly after, it passes the village of Pill on the south bank where the Pill Hobblers were based in order to tow ships up the river to Bristol and where yachts and other boats still have moorings in Chapel Pill and Crockerne Pill. It then passes under the Avonmouth Bridge which carries the M5 motorway. The main span is long, and the bridge is long, with an air draught above mean high water level of . The river then serves two major dock areas. The Royal Portbury Dock is on the southern side of the mouth of the river. The deepwater dock was constructed between 1972 and 1977, and is now a major port for the import of motor vehicles. The Royal Portbury Dock has the largest entrance lock into any UK port, accommodating vessels up to beam, length and draft. The Avonmouth Docks are on the north side of the river and are one of the UK&#x27;s major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. The first dock at Avonmouth, Avonmouth Old Dock, was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884. In 1907, a much larger dock, the Royal Edward Dock, was opened. The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company. Pilotage is provided by Bristol Pilots LLP who supply authorised pilots for the River Avon and Bristol City docks, as well as the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel; they are based at Avonmouth Docks.

== Hydrology and water quality ==

At Great Somerford the Avon has a mean flow rate of , and a typical river level range between and with a highest level of . At Melksham the Avon has a mean flow rate of . December 2013 was the highest level recorded at Bradford on Avon when the level reached with a normal range at the monitoring station being to . At Bathford the highest river level was also in December 2013 when it reached while the normal range is and , with a flow rate of .

In Bath at St James, which is upstream of Pultney Weir the mean flow is , with a similar flow () downstream of the weir. At the Destructor Bridge in Bath the typical height range is to with a high of also in December 2013.

At Saltford, the range is to , with a highest recording of on 24 December 2013. At Keynsham, the typical range is between and ; the highest was on 25 December 2013 when it reached . At Netham Weir, where the New Cut carries the flow away from Bristol Harbour, the typical range for the depth of the river is to , with the highest ever recorded being .

For the purpose of water quality monitoring and improvement, the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area, 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderate and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area, one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 per cent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 per cent good for chemical status and 31 per cent good for biological status.

== Conservation areas ==
The river is important for its dragonfly communities, with a strong population of scarce chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of white-legged damselfly. red-eyed damselfly is also found. The river is also important for aquatic plants, including Loddon pondweed.

The Kellaways – West Tytherton Site of Special Scientific Interest, north east of Chippenham, is of geological interest as the river bank exposes Callovian highly-fossiliferous sandstone which contains well-preserved bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, belemnites and ammonites. Further downstream at Newton St Loe the Newton St Loe SSSI is another Geological Conservation Review SSSI. It represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, it has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England. The bodies of mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus&quot;) and horses (&quot;Equus&quot;) have been found at the site.

The Avon Gorge has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts&#x27;s whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock-cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood, Cleeve Wood, Hanham for its large population of Bath asparagus (&quot;Ornithogalum pyrenaicum&quot;). Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least of Pleistocene terrace-gravels, consisting of limestone clasts mainly, but also with Millstone Grit, Pennant Sandstone, flint and chert clasts. The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area, and of the terrace stratigraphy, particularly as it is one of only two accessible terrace deposits in this part of the Avon valley. Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England.

At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton the wooded cliff and a narrow salt marsh are supported by rocks of Devonian age Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone, overlain by with Triassic dolomitic conglomerate. The site&#x27;s principal interest and the reason for its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the true service-tree (&quot;Sorbus domestica&quot;) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of &quot;Sorbus&quot; here are the whitebeams &quot;Sorbus eminens&quot; and &quot;Sorbus anglica&quot;, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce large-leaved lime (&quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot;) also occurs, and herbs include field garlic (&quot;Allium oleraceum&quot;) and pale St. John&#x27;s-wort (&quot;Hypericum montanum&quot;). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies at the base of the cliff, is predominantly made up of sea aster (&quot;Aster tripolium&quot;) and English scurvygrass (&quot;Cochlearia anglica&quot;). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well – slender hare&#x27;s-ear (&quot;Bupleurum tenuissimum&quot;) and long-stalked orache (&quot;Atriplex longipes&quot;).

The tidal reaches of the River Avon provide habitat for waterbirds, with 64 species having been recorded up to 2004, including 21 species of shorebird, and 13 species of gull.

== Authorities ==
A catchment board for the Avon was created by the Land Drainage Act 1930 and became the Bristol Avon River Board under the River Boards Act 1948; the board was in turn replaced by the Bristol Avon River Authority under the Water Resources Act 1963. Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority&#x27;s jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974, under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new regional body, the Wessex Water Authority. Privatisation saw responsibility for the catchment pass to the National Rivers Authority on its formation on 1 September 1989. In 1996 the authority became part of the Environment Agency.

Navigation conservancy in the lower river from Avonmouth to the lock at Hotwells is the responsibility of The Bristol Port Company as both statutory and competent harbour authority. Navigation within Bristol&#x27;s floating harbour is retained by Bristol City Council as statutory and competent harbour authority.

== History ==

The distribution of archaeological finds suggests that the western end of the river between Bath and Avonmouth formed a border between the Dobunni and Durotriges during the late Iron Age, prior to the Roman conquest of Britain. Further east, between Bath and what is now Wiltshire, it may also have formed a border of the territory ruled by the Belgae. After the Roman occupation the river formed a boundary between the lands of the Hwicce (which became Mercia) and the kingdom of Wessex.

The river Avon had been navigable from Bristol to Bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure. The floodplain of the Avon, on which the city centre of Bath is built, has an altitude of about above sea level. The river, once an unnavigable series of braided streams broken up by swamps and ponds, has been managed by weirs into a single channel. Periodic flooding, which shortened the life of many buildings in the lowest part of the city, was normal until major flood control works were completed in the 1970s.

The Bristol Avon Navigation, which runs the from the Kennet and Avon Canal at Hanham Lock to the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth, was constructed between 1724 and 1727, following legislation passed by Queen Anne, by a company of proprietors and the engineer John Hore of Newbury. The first cargo of &#x27;Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal&#x27; arrived in Bath in December 1727. It is now administered by the Canal &amp; River Trust.
Throughout Bristol&#x27;s history the Avon Gorge has been an important transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. The Bristol Channel has a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the &quot;SS Demerara&quot; soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner &quot;Gipsy&quot; in 1878, the steam tug &quot;Black Eagle&quot; in 1861 and the &quot;Llandaff City&quot;.

In 1877, Halfpenny Bridge, a pedestrian toll bridge crossing the river from Bath Spa railway station to Widcombe, collapsed with the loss of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the Bath and West Agricultural show.

The Avon has flooded several times in its recorded history. These floods include the one in 1799/1800 damaging Pulteney Bridge. Various points along the river including the valley around Freshford are at risk of fluvial flooding, as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel. To help cope with this some areas on the banks of the river are designated as a functional floodplain to cope with increased flow volumes. The potential changes to weather patterns as a result of climate change suggest that further measures are likely to be needed to protect the population from flooding risk. A tidal surge, combined with high water levels from the flooding of the surrounding area caused flooding in the city of Bristol.

<text>A glossary (from , &quot;glossa&quot;; language, speech, wording), also known as a vocabulary or clavis, is an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms. Traditionally, a glossary appears at the end of a book and includes terms within that book that are either newly introduced, uncommon, or specialized. While glossaries are most commonly associated with non-fiction books, in some cases, fiction novels sometimes include a glossary for unfamiliar terms.

A bilingual glossary is a list of terms in one language defined in a second language or glossed by synonyms (or at least near-synonyms) in another language.

In a general sense, a glossary contains explanations of concepts relevant to a certain field of study or action. In this sense, the term is related to the notion of ontology. Automatic methods have been also provided that transform a glossary into an ontology or a computational lexicon.

== Core glossary ==
A &quot;core glossary&quot; is a simple glossary or explanatory dictionary that enables definition of other concepts, especially for newcomers to a language or field of study. It contains a small working vocabulary and definitions for important or frequently encountered concepts, usually including idioms or metaphors useful in a culture.

== Automatic extraction of glossaries ==
Computational approaches to the automated extraction of glossaries from corpora or the Web have been developed in the recent years. These methods typically start from domain terminology and extract one or more glosses for each term of interest. Glosses can then be analyzed to extract hypernyms of the defined term and other lexical and semantic relations.

<text>The Kennet and Avon Canal is a waterway in southern England with an overall length of , made up of two lengths of navigable river linked by a canal. The name is used to refer to the entire length of the navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From Bristol to Bath the waterway follows the natural course of the River Avon before the canal links it to the River Kennet at Newbury, and from there to Reading on the River Thames. In all, the waterway incorporates 105 locks.

The two river stretches were made navigable in the early 18th century, and the canal section was constructed between 1794 and 1810. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the canal gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the Great Western Railway. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored in stages, largely by volunteers. After decades of dereliction and much restoration work, it was fully reopened in 1990. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been developed as a popular heritage tourism destination for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling, and is also important for wildlife conservation.

==History==

===Early plans===
The idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern England was first mentioned in Elizabethan times, between 1558 and 1603, to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers Avon and Thames, only apart at their closest. Later, around 1626, Henry Briggs made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig. He proposed a canal to connect them, but following his death in 1630 the plan was dropped. After the English Civil War four bills were presented to parliament, but all failed after opposition from gentry, farmers and traders worried about cheaper water transport reducing the value of fees on turnpike roads they controlled, and cheaper produce from Wales undercutting locally produced food.

The main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between Bristol and London was a hazardous sea route through the English Channel. The small coastal sailing ships of the day were often damaged by Atlantic storms, and risked being attacked by warships of the French Navy and privateers during a succession of conflicts with France.

===River navigations===

Plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century. However, in 1715, work was authorised to make the River Kennet navigable from Reading to Newbury. Work commenced in 1718, under the supervision of surveyor and engineer John Hore of Newbury. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened, comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts.

The River Avon had historically been navigable from Bristol to Bath, but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure. In 1727, navigation was restored, with the construction of six locks, again under the supervision of John Hore. The first cargo of &quot;Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal&quot; reached Bath in December.

The two river navigations were built independently of one another, in order to meet local needs, but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route.

===Closing the gap===
====Proposals====
In 1788 a &quot;Western Canal&quot; was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as Hungerford, Marlborough, Calne, Chippenham and Melksham. The following year the engineers Barns, Simcock and Weston submitted a proposed route for this canal, although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. The name was changed from Western Canal to Kennet and Avon Canal to avoid confusion with the Grand Western Canal, which was being proposed at the same time. This came in the midst of the Canal Mania period, with shares oversubscribed and reports of riotous crowds gathering outside meetings.

In 1793 a further survey was conducted by John Rennie, and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by Charles Dundas, and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the Savernake Forest.

====Organisation====

On 17 April 1794 the (34 Geo. 3. c. 90) received royal assent and construction began.

Responsibility for construction was divided across three committees: the Western District, the central Wiltshire District (which was later absorbed into the Western in 1802), and the Eastern District. These awarded contracts and had delegated financial powers. Problems with contractors occurred on multiple occasions, sometimes being overenthusiastic about tendering for multiple sections of work, failing to survey ground conditions thoroughly and encountering difficulties such as rock or natural springs.

Construction began at Bradford-on-Avon in the west, and Newbury in the east, in October 1794.

====Western section: Bath to Foxhangers====
The first sod for the Kennet and Avon Canal was turned in Bradford-on-Avon, and soon there were wharves above and below Bradford Lock. The canal was complete from Bath to Foxhangers (a farm at the western foot of Caen Hill, below Devizes) 6.5 years after construction started, in May 1801.

====Eastern section: Newbury to Devizes====
In 1796, completion of the eastern end of the new canal from Newbury to Great Bedwyn was anticipated within 12 months; but by July of that year, inflationary effects of the French Revolutionary Wars led labourers to take up more lucrative harvest work, and 23% of shareholders had fallen into arrears. Water springs encountered between Newbury and Crofton also caused delays.

On 12 June 1797, the first section from Newbury to Kintbury was opened, with a band from the 15th Regiment of Dragoons playing aboard the first barge to travel upstream, and chairman Charles Dundas joining the return passage back to Newbury. Construction continued uphill towards Hungerford, where seven houses in the path of the canal were demolished and a new road bridge provided. On 9 October 1798, the first cargo barge arrived in Hungerford, carrying a Portland stone staircase and Russian tallow – about in all. By 2 July 1799, the canal was open as far west as Great Bedwyn. The summit beyond Great Bedwyn, and subsequent gentle descent to Devizes, remained incomplete as late as 1803.

====Completion====
The final engineering task was the completion of the Caen Hill Locks at Devizes. While the lock flight was under construction, a horse-drawn railway provided a link between Foxhangers at the bottom of the flight and Devizes at the top, the remains of which can be seen under the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal.

The canal opened to through-traffic in 1810, after 16 years of construction. As well as Caen Hill Locks, other major structures included the Dundas and Avoncliff aqueducts, the Bruce Tunnel near Savernake Forest, and the pumping stations at Claverton and Crofton, needed to overcome water supply difficulties.

===Operation===

In 1801, trade along the canal commenced; goods initially had to be unloaded at Foxhangers at the bottom of what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn tramway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £2 9s 6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £6 3s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the (53 Geo. 3. c. cxix), which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.

By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal, the majority of the tonnage being coal and stone travelling via the Somerset Coal Canal. The journey from Bath to Newbury took an average of three and a half days. By 1832, 300,000 tons of freight was being carried each year and, between 1825 and 1834, the company had an annual revenue of around £45,000.

A link connecting the Kennet &amp; Avon to the Basingstoke Canal at its Basingstoke terminus was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810, and a route was even surveyed by John Rennie the Younger in 1824, but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by Parliament in 1824 and 1826.

===Decline===
The opening of the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal&#x27;s traffic, even though the canal company lowered tariffs. In 1852 the railway company took over the canal&#x27;s operation, levying high tolls at every toll point and reducing the amount spent on maintenance. Ice-breaking was stopped in 1857, and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal. In 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night, and, in 1865, boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss. By 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360,610 in 1848 to 210,567. In the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near Fobney Lock followed the regulations introduced in the Reading Local Board Waterworks, Sewerage, Drainage and Improvements Act of 1870, and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal. Several wharves and stretches of towpath were closed. In 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit.

The Somerset Coal Canal and Wilts &amp; Berks Canal, which each supplied some of the trade from the Somerset Coalfield to the Kennet and Avon, closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following a loss of £18,041 the previous year, the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal. Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal.
During the Second World War a large number of concrete pillboxes were built as part of the GHQ Line - Blue to defend against an expected German invasion; many of these are still visible along the banks of the canal. They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act 1947 transferred control of the canal to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct. The last through passage was made in 1951 by &quot;nb Queen&quot;.

===Closure avoided===

A group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the Inland Waterways Association, with which it was subsequently merged. In 1955 John Gould, a trader on the eastern section of the waterway, successfully petitioned against the commission&#x27;s failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business. In March 1956 a clause in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was presented to Parliament that would have removed the right of navigation between Reading and Bath. The Act was opposed by Gould and by the local authorities along the canal. They were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the Queen, brought to London from Bristol by water; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe. This campaign led to an inquiry by a Parliamentary Select Committee. The committee supported the suspension of the right of navigation, and the Bill passed through the House of Commons but was amended by the House of Lords to include a clause to enforce &quot;no further deterioration&quot;. In July 1958, the Bowes Committee published their &quot;Inquiry into Inland Waterways&quot; which specifically mentioned the Kennet and Avon finding &quot;no justification for restoring the section from Reading to Bath&quot;.

A government white paper followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that were no longer able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.

===Restoration===

Restoration work involved a collaboration between staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 Sulhamstead Lock was rebuilt and the re-puddling of the dry section at Limpley Stoke was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the Bath Locks and Burghfield Lock. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from to by girders added to the underside of the bridge. This was replaced with a new bridge, enabling craft to pass more easily. The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974. Re-puddling was a long process, so experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken. The Avoncliff Aqueduct was lined with a concrete &quot;cradle&quot; and made water-tight in 1980.

Further works continued during the 1980s. Berkshire County Council, supported by local councils, estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges. In Wiltshire, concerns over the limited water supply to the summit pound indicated that back-pumping would be required, which increased the estimated cost for the county to £761,560. The Wilton Water reservoir was estimated to produce less than per day, and the Seend feeder only . Wessex Water Authority agreed to the extraction of per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the costs of the pumps was £175,000.

Various fund-raising schemes, along with some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the Manpower Services Commission, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of Aldermaston Lock, its adjacent wharf, and Widmead Lock. The restoration of Dundas Aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders sponsored a workshop, which opened in Shrivenham in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of Woolhampton Lock was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frouds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of Midgham Lock had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds was carried out in 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided Monkey Marsh Lock proved difficult because of its status as a scheduled monument, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.
The stretch between Reading and Newbury was completed on 17 July 1990; at a ceremony held at Monkey Marsh Lock several boats competed to be the first craft through. Concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when Elizabeth II formally reopened the canal on 8 August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust&#x27;s boat, &quot;The Rose of Hungerford&quot;, through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them. The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29 locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of £1 million. The pumps raise water at a rate of per hour (380 litres per second). In October 1996, the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single National Lottery grant awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, £25 million towards a £29 million project, to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations. The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites. The restoration&#x27;s completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from Prince Charles, but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004, Dundas Aqueduct – which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct – was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the Great Western Railway with Bath stone to match the original work.

On 1 December 2004, two men died when the Ford tractor in which they were reversing along part of the towpath between Bridge 111 and Bridge 110 toppled into the water. British Waterways was found guilty of failing to adequately assess risk and fined £100,000. A subsequent dispute with their insurers gave rise to legal consideration of the meaning of certain terminology in their insurance policy concerned with liability &quot;arising out of&quot; the operation of a tractor.

In 2011 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs designated the canal a national &quot;cruiseway&quot; as defined by the Transport Act 1968. The listing imposes a legal requirement on British Waterways to maintain the canal to a standard that ensures cruising craft can safely navigate the entire length of the waterway. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge.

==Route==
===Bristol to Bath===
The River Avon was navigable from Bristol to Bath during the early years of the 13th century, until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure.
The modern Avon is navigable from its mouth at Avonmouth, through the Floating Harbour in Bristol, as far as Pulteney Weir in the centre of Bath and just beyond the start of the canal. Beyond Pulteney Weir the Avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old &quot;flash lock&quot; at Bathampton but the lock at Pulteney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes. The stretch from Bristol to Bath is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs at Hanham, Keynsham, Swineford, Saltford, Kelston and Weston, which together overcome a rise of within .
Lock number one on the Kennet and Avon Canal is Hanham Lock, first opened as part of the Avon Navigation in 1727. It is the first lock east of Netham, the upstream limit of the Floating Harbour, beyond the suburbs of the city of Bristol. A colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock, but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century. The river below Hanham Lock is considered to be tidal, as high tides often pass over the weir at Netham. Some spring tides pass over the weir at Hanham, making the river tidal up to Keynsham Lock. Heading east, the river passes the Somerdale Factory, on its southern bank, which was a chocolate production factory for Cadbury – originally built by the Fry family in the 1920s and 1930s. On the northern bank is Cleeve Wood, the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of Bath asparagus (&quot;Ornithogalum pyrenaicum&quot;).
A public house has been built on the island between Keynsham Lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew.
The river then passes through Avon Valley Country Park and past Stidham Farm, another SSSI that contains Pleistocene terrace-gravels of the river. A depth of at least of sandy gravels are recorded, consisting mainly of limestone clasts, but also with Millstone Grit, Pennant Sandstone, flint, and chert clasts. The river passes under the old railway line that now forms the Avon Valley Railway, a heritage railway, before reaching Swineford Lock. Here, between 1709 and 1859, there was an active brass and copper industry served by the river, which also provided water power for the cloth industry. The remains of Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925, are next to Saltford Lock. The lock was opened in 1727 but destroyed by rival coal dealers in 1738, to prevent the river being used for transportation.

The Bristol and Bath Railway Path crosses the navigation several times before reaching the suburb of Newbridge on the outskirts of Bath. Here the A4 crosses close to the Newton St Loe SSSI, which is designated an SSSI because it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels containing the remains of mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus&quot;) and horses (&quot;Equus&quot;) along the river, and has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation in South West England. The final lock before entering Bath is Weston Lock, opened in 1727. Its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.

===Bath to Devizes===
The restored Bath Bottom Lock marks the divergence of the River Avon and the canal. It is situated south of Pulteney Bridge. Just upstream of the Bottom Lock are a side pound and a pumping station that pumps water &quot;upstream&quot; of the locks, to replace that used each time a boat passes through. The next of the six Bath Locks is Bath Deep Lock, numbered 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in 1976. The new chamber has a depth of , making it the UK&#x27;s second-deepest canal lock. Just above the Deep Lock is another side pound as a reservoir for refilling the lock, followed by Wash House Lock. After a slightly longer pound is Abbey View Lock, beside which there is another pumping station and then, in quick succession, Pulteney Lock and Bath Top Lock.

Above the Top Lock the canal passes through Sydney Gardens via two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800. Cleveland Tunnel is long and runs under Cleveland House, the former headquarters of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company and now a Grade II* listed building. A trap-door in the tunnel roof connects the canal with Cleveland House. It is often stated that was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and bargees below, although it is possible that the hatch was a refuse chute. Many of the bridges over the canal are listed buildings.
On the eastern outskirts of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links Bathampton to Batheaston, on the north bank of the canal. When the A4 Batheaston by-pass was built, the Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive to a number of migrants; wading birds such as dunlin, ringed and little ringed plover, and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. Sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included yellow wagtail, whinchat and hobby. The canal turns south into a valley between Bathampton Wood and Bathford Hill which includes Brown&#x27;s Folly, a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

In the Avon Valley to the east of Bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, once used for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.

On the eastern bank Warleigh Wood and Inwood are ash-wych elm and ash-maple dry woodland, which comes right down to the canal.

The canal then crosses over the river and the Wessex Main Line railway at the Dundas Aqueduct, past Conkwell Wood, before recrossing the river and railway at the Avoncliff Aqueduct. At the western end of the Dundas Aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the Somerset Coal Canal, a short stretch of which has been restored to create the Brassknocker Basin. Excavations of the old stop lock showed that it was originally a broad lock that at some point was narrowed to by moving the lock wall. The Somerset Coal Canal was built around 1800 from basins at Paulton and Timsbury, giving access to London from the Somerset Coalfield, which at its peak contained 80 collieries.

After the Avoncliff Aqueduct the canal passes through Barton Farm Country Park, past Gripwood Quarry and a 14th-century Grade II* listed tithe barn, long and wide, on its way into Bradford-on-Avon.
Further east, an aqueduct carries the canal over the River Biss. There are locks at Semington and Seend, where water flows into the canal from the Summerham Brook, otherwise known as the Seend Feeder. In the village of Semington the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal joined the canal, linking the Kennet and Avon to the River Thames at Abingdon. The North Wilts Canal merged with it to become a branch to the Thames and Severn Canal at Latton near Cricklade. The canal was opened in 1810, but abandoned in 1914 – a fate hastened by the collapse of Stanley Aqueduct in 1901. In 1977 the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Amenity Group was formed with the aim of fully restoring the canal to re-connect the Kennet and Avon to the upper reaches of the Thames.

Caen Hill Locks, at Devizes, provides an insight into the engineering needed to build and maintain the canal. The main flight of 16 locks, which take 5–6 hours to navigate in a boat, is part of a longer series of 29 locks built in three groups: seven at Foxhangers, sixteen at Caen Hill, and six at the town end of the flight. The total rise is in or a 1 in 30 gradient. The locks were the last part of the route of the canal to be completed. The steepness of the terrain meant that there was no space to use the normal arrangement of water pounds between the locks. As a result, the 16 locks utilise unusually large side ponds to store the water needed for their operation. Because a large volume of water is needed a back pump was installed at Foxhangers in 1996, capable of returning of water per day to the top of the flight, equivalent to one lockful every 11 minutes. From 1829 until 1843 the flight, which includes the narrowest lock on the canal, Lock 41, was illuminated by gas lights.

At the top of the flight is Devizes Wharf, home to the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal Museum, which has a range of exhibits on the conception, design, usage, and eventual commercial decline of the Kennet and Avon Canal, as well as its subsequent restoration. It is operated by the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust, which has its headquarters and a shop within the Canal Centre. The Wharf Theatre is in an old warehouse on the same site. Devizes wharf is the starting point for the Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon, which has been held since 1948.

===Devizes to Newbury===

Heading east from Devizes the canal passes through the Wiltshire countryside and a series of locks and swing bridges before another flight of locks at Crofton.

At Honeystreet is the remains of a wharf that was the home of boat builders Robbins, Lane and Pinnegar, which served as the boat building headquarters of the Canal Company. They built many of the boats used on the canals of southern England before closing in about 1950. Next to the wharf is the Barge Inn, a substantial public house once known as the George Inn. It was roughly half-way along the canal and served as a bakehouse, slaughterhouse and shop for provisions for those living and working on the canal. The building was destroyed by fire in 1858 and rebuilt within six months. It was built just within the parish boundary of Stanton St Bernard to &quot;serve the Honey Street wharf in Alton parish, which refused to allow drinking establishments&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s Mill is a area of fen vegetation, scrub and woodland lying along the headwaters of the Salisbury Avon northeast of Pewsey. It has been designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest because it is &quot;the best known example of a calcareous valley mire in Wiltshire&quot;.

The four locks at Wootton Rivers mark the end of the climb from the Avon. Between Wootton Top Lock and Crofton is the summit pound of the canal at above sea level, stretching for about and including the Bruce Tunnel. The tunnel is named after the local land owner, Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729–1814), who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has red brick portals, capped with Bath stone, each with a decorative plaque of Pennant stone. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with English bond brickwork and has a wide bore to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk across the top of the hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls. The Berks &amp; Hants Extension Railway subsequently built Savernake Low Level railway station in a shallow cutting above the canal tunnel between 1847 and 1862, which closed in 1966, but the trackbed is still in use today.

The Crofton Locks flight marks the start of the descent from the summit to the Thames; the nine locks have a total rise/fall of . When the canal was built there were no reliable water sources available to fill the summit by normal gravitational means. A number of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound, and about below it, and arrangements were made for them to feed the pound below lock 60 at Crofton. Some years later the Wilton Water reservoir was created to enhance the supply to this pound using the springs and the River Dun.
Water is pumped to the summit at the western end of the locks, from Wilton Water, by the restored Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.

Near Crofton is Savernake Forest and the remains of a railway bridge that carried the Midland and South Western Junction Railway over the canal. Mill Bridge at Great Bedwyn is unusual in being a skew arch; on its completion in 1796 it was the first of its kind. From there to Hungerford the canal follows the valley of the River Dun through Freeman&#x27;s Marsh, which consists of unimproved meadows, marsh and reedbed. It is an important site for overwintering, migratory and breeding birds, and supports many varieties of flora scarce in Southern England. It was cited by English Nature in 1986, and forms part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There are plans to construct a marina and hotel complex adjacent to the site, but the potential environmental impacts (particularly to water voles) of such a development on Freeman&#x27;s Marsh have led to local opposition. To the north of the canal are seven separate small areas, four in the Kennet Valley and three in the Lambourn Valley, which make up the Kennet and Lambourn Floodplain SSSI. Occupying a total of , it supports particularly large populations of Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail.
There are several locks and bridges in Hungerford, including one which carries the A338. Hungerford Marsh Lock is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal in that it has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.

Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to the north of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest remaining fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods – the Wilderness and part of Ryott&#x27;s Plantation – which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;); though ash is abundant in places and there is occasional oak and wych elm. In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes &quot;Radula complanata&quot;, &quot;Zygodon viridissimus&quot; and &quot;Orthotrichum affine&quot;. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog&#x27;s mercury, with abundant herb paris, toothwort, Solomon&#x27;s seal, common twayblade and early-purple orchids and, locally, wild daffodil.

A wooden bridge was built over the Kennet at Newbury in 1726, replaced in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and now known as the Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.

===Newbury to Reading===
The River Kennet is navigable from Newbury downstream to the confluence with the River Thames at Kennet Mouth, in Reading.

The stretch from Newbury to High Bridge in Reading is an improved river navigation known as the &quot;Kennet Navigation&quot;, opened in 1723. Throughout this navigation stretches of natural riverbed alternate with of artificial lock cuts and a series of locks that overcome a fall of .

East of Newbury town centre the Kennet passes through the Thatcham Reed Beds a Site of Special Scientific Interest, nationally important for its extensive reedbed, and species-rich alder woodland and fen habitats. The latter supports Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail (&quot;Vertigo moulinsiana&quot;), which is of national and European importance. A large assemblage of breeding birds such as Cetti&#x27;s warbler make use of the reedbed, fen and open water habitats found at Thatcham Reed Beds. Thatcham&#x27;s network of gravel pits, reed bed, woodland, hedges and grassland is rich in wildlife and has been made into The Nature Discovery Centre by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Monkey Marsh Lock at Thatcham is one of only two remaining working examples of turf-sided locks on the canal today. It is listed as a scheduled monument by English Heritage.

Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham the river leaves behind the built-up area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It passes through the Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler, a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.

Aldermaston Gravel Pits consist of mature flooded gravel workings surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording a variety of habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline with islands, promontories, sheltered eutrophic pools and narrow lagoons, provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds, including surface-feeding ducks such as teal and shoveler. The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of warblers, water rails, kingfishers and an important breeding colony of nightingales. In 2002 English Nature bought Aldermaston Gravel Pits from the mineral extraction company Grundon and it is managed as a nature reserve by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The River Kennet itself, from near its sources west of Marlborough down to Woolhampton, has been designated as a SSSI primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to chalk watercourses.
The village of Woolhampton and the canal settlement of Aldermaston Wharf are the only significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading&#x27;s suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In this stretch is Garston Lock, the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.

Shortly after passing Fobney Lock and the associated water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility and the difficulty of boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading&#x27;s The Oracle shopping centre.
Immediately after The Oracle the river flows under the arched High Bridge, which forms a historical and administrative divide on the river. The last of the River Kennet in Reading below the bridge has been navigable since at least the 13th century. Because there is no wide floodplain, wharves could be built during the Middle Ages that allowed Reading to establish itself as a river port. Originally this short stretch of river, which includes Blake&#x27;s Lock, was under the control of Reading Abbey, but today it is administered by the Environment Agency as if it were part of the River Thames. The Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet Mouth was built as a railway bridge in 1839, and the timber-clad iron-truss accommodation bridge was added in 1892.

==Canal today==


The canal today is a heritage tourism destination. Boating, with narrowboats and cruisers, is a popular tourist attraction particularly in the summer months. It is a favourite haunt of several famous canal enthusiasts including canal boat veterans and original Kennet and Avon restoration supporters, Prunella Scales and Timothy West.
Privately owned craft and hire boats from the range of marinas are much in evidence, and there are numerous canoe clubs along its length. The annual Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon starts from Devizes Wharf, the site of the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal Museum, at first light on Good Friday each year and the competitors have to negotiate 77 locks in the route between Devizes and the finish at Westminster. The winning time is usually around hours.

Cycling is permitted along the towpath except for a section near Woolhampton, and some sections have been improved and widened to make them more suitable for cyclists and disabled users. Under a partnership arrangement involving British Waterways, Sustrans, and the riparian local authorities, two main sections of the canal have been improved, and, with a few short diversions, run from Reading to Marsh Benham and from Devizes to Bath as part of the National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 4. Fishing for bream, tench, roach, rudd, perch, gudgeon, pike and carp is permitted throughout the year from the towpath of the canal, but almost its whole length is leased to angling associations or fishing clubs. There are a variety of riverside public houses, shops and tea rooms. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust operates shops and tearooms at Aldermaston Lock, Newbury Wharf, Crofton Pumping Station, Devizes, and Bradford-on-Avon.

===Ecology===
The canal and its environs are important for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman&#x27;s Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100 different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over the length of the canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron, reed bunting and kingfisher. Fourteen species have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins, which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. Common reed is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new &quot;vole-friendly&quot; techniques of bank protection have been developed.

<text>The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal is a canal in the south Midlands of England. The canal, which was built between 1793 and 1816, runs for in total, and consists of two sections. The dividing line is at Kingswood Junction, which gives access to the Grand Union Canal. Following acquisition by a railway company in 1856, it gradually declined, the southern section being un-navigable by 1945, and the northern section little better.

The northern section was the setting for a high-profile campaign by the fledgling Inland Waterways Association in 1947, involving the right of navigation under Tunnel Lane bridge, which required the Great Western Railway to jack it up in order to allow boats to pass. These actions saved the section from closure. The southern section was managed by the National Trust from 1959, and restored by David Hutchings and the Stratford Canal Society between 1961 and 1964, after an attempt to close it was thwarted. The revived canal was re-opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and responsibility for it was transferred to British Waterways in 1988.

==Route==

The Stratford-upon-Avon canal connects the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at Kings Norton to the River Avon at Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. It consists of two sections, divided by a junction which connects it to the Grand Union Canal. The northern section from Kings Norton in the suburbs of Birmingham to Lapworth is level for the first , following the Birmingham Level, but then descends quite rapidly through the Lapworth flight of 18 locks, to reach the junction. There is a choice of route to reach the Grand Union, as there are two locks side by side, one on the main line of the canal, and one on the branch, but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks. The junction is almost exactly halfway along the canal.

The southern section continues the descent with the final seven of the Lapworth locks, passing under the M40 motorway just before the final one. The locks are closely spaced until those at Preston Bagot are reached, after which there is a section with just one lock in the middle. This nearly-level section includes two of the canal&#x27;s three iron aqueducts. The easy cruising is interrupted by the Wilmcote flight of eleven locks in just over a mile (1.6 km), soon after which the canal reaches Stratford-upon-Avon.

Along the route of the canal, there are a total of 54 narrow locks. Near King&#x27;s Norton Junction there is a disused stop lock, which used to prevent the canal taking water from the Worcester and Birmingham Canal when they were separately owned, but is now left permanently open. It is unusual in that it has two guillotine gates which are made of wood. When operational, they moved vertically in iron frames, and were counterbalanced by weights. A barge lock connects the terminal basin (Bancroft Basin) with the River Avon.

Earlswood Lakes in Earlswood are feeder reservoirs to the canal. The three lakes were built between 1821 and 1822 and have a total capacity of 210 million gallons (950 megalitres (Ml)). The lakes consist of three separate pools; Terry&#x27;s, Engine and Windmill Pool. They are retained by earth embankment. Until 1936 the water was pumped into the feeder by a beam engine, whose engine house can still be seen. The feeder was navigable for coal boats to reach the engine house and is now used for moorings.

==Features==

From Kings Norton Junction at the northern end the canal immediately passes through the unusual King&#x27;s Norton Stop Lock, the only guillotine-gated stop-lock on a canal.

After 3/4 mile is the only tunnel on the canal, at Brandwood. It is long, and like many canal tunnels it has no towpath; horses were walked over the hill and barges were pulled through the tunnel using a handrail on the wall of the tunnel, parts of which can still be seen.

On the outskirts of Shirley the brick-built Major&#x27;s Green Aqueduct carries the canal 10m above Aqueduct Road and the River Cole.

 further south is the electrically operated Shirley Draw Bridge which carries Drawbridge Road over the canal. It is normally closed and can be opened using a British Waterways key. The northern section also has a swing bridge (no.2, normally left open), a lift bridge (no.28), and another drawbridge (no. 26), all operated manually.
On the southern section interesting features of the canal include the unique barrel-roofed lock keeper&#x27;s cottages to be found south of Kingswood Junction. All but two have been swamped by large modern extensions, but those at locks 28 and 31 are still in something like their original state, neither of them have either electricity supply or mains water.

Many of the accommodation bridges south of Kingswood Junction are split bridges of cast iron, with a central slot to accommodate the tow rope of horse-drawn boats.
The southern section of the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts, unusual in that the towpaths are at the level of the canal bottom.

Travelling south from Kingswood Junction, the first aqueduct is the modest Yarningale Aqueduct which carries the canal over a small stream near Preston Bagot, Warwickshire. This cast iron aqueduct was built in 1834 to replace the original wooden structure which was washed away when the stream flooded that year.

The second is the Wootton Wawen Aqueduct, just outside Wootton Wawen, where the canal crosses the A3400 main road.
The third is the Edstone Aqueduct (also known as Bearley) which at , is the longest in England. The aqueduct crosses a minor road, the Birmingham and North Warwickshire railway and also the trackbed of the former Alcester Railway. There was once a pipe from the side of the canal that enabled locomotives to draw water to fill the locomotives&#x27; tanks.

==History==



The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was conceived as part of a network of canals which would allow coal from the Dudley Canal and the Stourbridge Canal to reach Oxford and London, without having to use the Birmingham canals, the management of which was seen as high-handed. An act, the &#x27; (33 Geo. 3. c. 112), was passed on 28 March 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in Kings Norton to Stratford-upon-Avon. The canal company was empowered to raise £120,000 by issuing shares and an additional £60,000 if required. The route would take it close to Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Lapworth, but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it, or with the River Avon at Stratford. Negotiations started with the Warwick and Birmingham, and to second act, the &#x27; (35 Geo. 3. c. 72) was obtained on 19 May 1795, to allow a connecting link to be built, despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company.

Josiah Clowes was employed as the engineer, and construction began in November 1793, starting at the Kings Norton end. He was also working on the Dudley Canal&#x27;s extension, and another four canal schemes at the same time, and was the first great tunnel engineer. He died in December of the following year, but work continued until the main line reached Hockley Heath in May 1796, one mile (1.6 km) short of the first lock at Lapworth. At this point, cutting ceased through lack of money, as the capital raised had all been spent. The Dudley Canal extension through the Lappal tunnel was opened in early 1798, and with progress being made on the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, the company obtained a third act of Parliament on 21 June 1799, which allowed it to raise more money, and included a diversion of the route further to the east near Lapworth, so that the length of the connecting link to the Warwick and Birmingham was only about . Work restarted in 1799 under a new engineer called Samuel Porter, a former assistant of Clowes. He continued as far as Kingswood Junction, which was formally opened on 24 May 1802, after which cutting again ceased.

===Southern section===

Construction only recommenced in 1812, under the leadership of William James of Stratford. James, who had owned shares in the Company since 1793, had a wide interest in turnpike roads and railways, and following a tour of the north of England between 1802 and 1804, on which he investigated railways and canals, he expanded his business interests to include coal mining. He rose to become chairman of the Canal Company, and personally bought the Upper Avon Navigation in 1813. He wanted to create a through route between the River Severn and the Midlands, and so the canal company obtained a further act of Parliament, the (55 Geo. 3. c. xxxix), on 12 May 1815, which authorised a connection between the canal and the Avon at Stratford, as well as enabling them to build reservoirs at Earlswood. The canal reached Stratford in June 1816 and a connection with the River Avon was made. The total cost of the canal had been around £297,000.

The southern section of the canal never realised James&#x27; ambitions, as the Upper Avon was too tortuous and prone to floods to be a reliable through route. He spent some £6,000 on improvements to the Upper Avon locks in 1822, but over-reached himself, and was declared bankrupt shortly afterwards. For a while the upper river was managed by a syndicate of seven people, all connected with the canal, and the Canal Company took out a lease of it from 1842 for five years. Trade was mainly coal, which was conveyed from Stratford to Evesham.

Traffic steadily built up, although tolls were low, to offset the costs imposed on goods passing through Kingswood Junction to the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. On the southern section, coal was taken to Stratford, from where it was sold, or passed along the Upper Avon or the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. Modest dividends were paid to shareholders from 1824, and the total traffic carried in 1838 was 181,708 tons, on which profits of £6,835 were made. In 1845, the company agreed to sell the canal to the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, who were also keen to purchase the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. It was not until January 1856 that the transaction was finally completed, and another year before the railway company took over day-to-day running. Another change of ownership occurred in 1863, when the railway company was absorbed by the Great Western Railway. Traffic gradually decreased, but the fall in receipts was faster than the fall in tonnage, as the railway took the long-distance loads.

===Decline and restoration===
By the late 1930s the southern section had become derelict, although a water supply was maintained, which the GWR used to supply its engine shed in Stratford. The northern section was never officially closed, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1939. It was blocked when bridge no. 2, the Tunnel Lane lift bridge at Lifford, became faulty, and was replaced by the GWR with a fixed bridge which left insufficient height for a boat to pass.
After Lord Methuen raised the issue in the House of Lords in 1947, and was assured that the bridge &quot;would be lifted at any time on notice of intended passage being given&quot;, Tom Rolt of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) announced that he intended to pass under the bridge on 20 May 1947. Despite difficulties with the state of the canal, and the fact that the accompanying boat provided by the GWR got stuck, the bridge was reached. It had been jacked up and was resting on heavy timbers. Robert Aickman, another of the founders of the IWA, had organised press coverage, and the story was reported in the national newspapers. IWA members were then encouraged to use the route. Eric de Mare repeated the exercise in 1948, using a converted army pontoon. A horse-drawn ice breaker was used to create a channel through the weed on this occasion, and the following year, Peter Scott asked for the bridge to be lifted. In 1950, the bridge, which had become known as Lifford Bridge, or Lifford Lane Bridge, was replaced with a working swing bridge. The northern section of the canal was saved from dereliction by such pioneering efforts. The bridge has now been removed altogether.
By the 1950s, the southern section was un-navigable by canal boats, as several of the locks could not be operated, and some of the small pounds between the locks of the Wilmcote flight were dry. Problems with a bridge also began the process of restoring this section. Warwickshire County Council sought to obtain legal abandonment of the canal in 1958, as they wished to replace bridge 59 at Wilmcote without the expense of providing navigable headroom. A campaign against closure was mounted by the Inland Waterways Association and local activists. Two canoeists, who had used the canal recently, produced a dated toll ticket for their journey, which was offered as proof that the canal was not disused. Retention of the canal was announced on 22 May 1959, and by 16 October, the British Transport Commission and the National Trust reported that they had agreed on the terms of a lease, under which the National Trust would be responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the southern section. The transfer of responsibility took place on 29 September 1960, and work began in March 1961. Although the Transport Commission made a contribution towards the cost, the National Trust raised most of the £42,000 required to put it back into good order. The project was managed by David Hutchings, who pioneered the use of voluntary labour, which would be used on many subsequent restorations, and assistance was also given by prisoners from Winson Green prison, the Army and the RAF Airfield Construction Branch. The canal was fully navigable by mid-1964, and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother officially re-opened it on 11 July. Its restoration was a turning point for the waterways movement in Britain.

The National Trust charged a private toll fee for navigation. Ten years after the re-opening, the Queen Mother performed the same ceremony for the Upper Avon Navigation, which had been derelict for more than a century, and the canal became part of a through route to the River Severn once more. In 1986, the National Trust indicated that they would like to hand control of the canal back to the British Waterways Board, and held discussions on 7 October 1986. The canal was transferred on 1 April 1988, authorised by an order of the Secretary of State, which provided £1.5 million, phased over five years, to enable the canal to be brought up to standard.

<doc id="151636" wikidata="Q3824759" url="?curid=151636" title="Trent's Last Case (novel)">
<text>Trent&#x27;s Last Case is a detective novel written by E. C. Bentley and first published in 1913. Despite the title, it is in fact the first work in which its central character, the artist and amateur detective Philip Trent, appears: he subsequently reappeared in the novel &quot;Trent&#x27;s Own Case&quot; (1936), and the short-story collection &quot;Trent Intervenes&quot; (1938).

The novel is a whodunit with a place in detective fiction history because it is the first major send-up of that genre. Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects – usually considered off-limits – he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions.

The novel was published as The Woman in Black in the United States, later in 1913.

==Plot summary==
Sigsbee Manderson, a wealthy American plutocrat, is found shot dead in the grounds of his English country house. Philip Trent, an artist, freelance journalist, and amateur detective, is commissioned by Sir James Molloy, a Fleet Street press magnate, to investigate and report on the case. Trent receives the co-operation of the police – the investigating officer, Inspector Murch of Scotland Yard, is an old acquaintance – and is able to view the body, examine the house and grounds, and interview those involved. Other members of the household include Manderson&#x27;s wife, Mabel; his two secretaries, Calvin Bunner, an American, and John Marlowe, an Englishman; Martin, a manservant; and Célestine, a lady&#x27;s maid. Nathaniel Cupples, Mabel&#x27;s uncle-by-marriage and another old friend of Trent, is staying at a hotel in the village.

Trent pursues his enquiries, and learns that the Mandersons&#x27; marriage was in difficulties and that the couple had grown distant from each other. In the course of his investigation, he falls in love with Mabel Manderson. The coroner&#x27;s inquest finds that Manderson was killed by a person or persons unknown: the suggestion is that he was the victim of a business vendetta. Trent, however, concludes that Manderson was shot by Marlowe, who then returned to the house wearing some of Manderson&#x27;s outer clothing in order to give the impression that Manderson was at that point still alive, before driving to Southampton to provide himself with an alibi. Trent believes that Marlowe&#x27;s motive was his own love for Mabel, but is unclear as to how far she may have reciprocated in these feelings. He writes down his ideas in the form of a dispatch for Molloy, but before sending it presents it to Mabel and asks whether there had been anything between her and Marlowe. Her reaction persuades him that there had been, and he leaves the dispatch unsent.

Six months later Trent re-establishes contact with Mabel in London and finally extracts her version of events. She tells him that there had never been any sort of intimacy between her and Marlowe, but that her husband&#x27;s suspicions had been the cause of their marital rift, and that in his jealousy he may have plotted an act of revenge. Trent sends Marlowe his original dispatch and arranges a meeting at which Cupples is also present. At the meeting, Marlowe explains that Manderson fabricated a web of incriminating evidence to implicate Marlowe in his apparent &quot;murder&quot; and then shot himself. Having realised what was happening, and having discovered Manderson&#x27;s body, Marlowe had attempted to cover his tracks and give himself an alibi – this much of Trent&#x27;s analysis had been correct.

Following this meeting, Trent and Cupples have dinner together, and Cupples reveals that while the majority of Marlowe&#x27;s story had been accurate, it was in fact he who had fired the fatal shot. He had chanced upon Manderson pointing a pistol at himself, probably meaning only to cause a self-inflicted wound. Suspecting a suicide attempt, Cupples had intervened, and in the ensuing struggle had accidentally shot Manderson in the face.

The book ends with Trent vowing that he will never again attempt to dabble in crime detection.

==Reception==

G. K. Chesterton, author of the Father Brown mysteries, felt that this novel was &quot;The finest detective story of modern times&quot;. (Bentley and Chesterton were close personal friends, and Bentley dedicated the book to Chesterton.) The book was influential in the postwar &quot;Golden Age&quot; of detective stories: Agatha Christie called &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; &quot;One of the three best detective stories ever written&quot;. Dorothy L. Sayers wrote that &quot;It shook the little world of the mystery novel like a revolution ... Every detective writer of today owes something, consciously or unconsciously, to its liberating and inspiring influence.&quot; It was still admired in the second half of the century; literary critic Jacques Barzun, co-author of &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot; (1971), included it in his top ten mystery novels, as did mystery novelists Reginald Hill and Peter Straub. 

In his critique of the mystery genre, &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;, Raymond Chandler said that it was frequently called &quot;the perfect story&quot; before ridiculing some plot points that he considered preposterous: &quot;I have known relatively few international financiers, but I rather think the author of this novel has (if possible) known fewer.&quot;

According to Aaron Marc Stein in his introduction to the 1977 edition, published by University Extension of UCSD: &quot;At the risk of bringing down on his memory the wrath of the Baker Street Irregulars it must be recorded that Bentley had reservations about even the Conan Doyle originals. He deplored the great detective&#x27;s lack of humor and he was irritated by the Sherlockian eccentricities... Bentley had the idea of doing a detective who would be a human being and who would know how to laugh.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The novel was adapted into a silent film directed by Richard Garrick in 1920. A second adaptation (released in both a silent version and a sound version) was made by Howard Hawks in 1929.

A third film adaptation was directed by Herbert Wilcox in 1952. It starred Michael Wilding as Trent, Orson Welles as Sigsbee Manderson, and Margaret Lockwood as Margaret Manderson.

An excerpt of the book is recited in the film &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; (1984). The only part the audience hears is the opening line: &quot;Chapter 1. Bad News. Between what matters and what seems to matter, how shall the world we know judge wisely?&quot;

===Television===
The novel was adapted as an episode of the BBC anthology TV series &quot;Detective&quot; in April 1964, introduced by Rupert Davies as Maigret. It starred Michael Gwynn as Trent, Carleton Hobbs as Cupples, Bill Nagy as Bunner, Penelope Horner as Mabel Manderson, Kenneth Fortescue as Marlowe, and Peter Williams as Sigsbee Manderson.

===Stage===
The novel was adapted into a stage production by John Arden McClure, which premiered in January 2013 at the Broadway Onstage Live Theatre in Eastpointe, Michigan. It starred McClure as Trent, Daniel Woitulewicz as Cupples, Elizabeth Rager as Bunner, Stella Rothe as Mabel Manderson, Patrick John Sharpe as Marlowe, and Jack Abella as Sigsbee Manderson.

===Radio===
The novel was adapted for the BBC National Programme in January 1934. It was later serialised in 1950; and a further dramatisation was broadcast for the Home Service in 1963, starring Richard Hurndall. Another radio adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 1986 with Martin Jarvis in the title role.

A radio adaptation starring Ronald Colman was aired on 7 December 1953 on the American radio show &quot;Suspense&quot;.

<doc id="151637" wikidata="Q2078595" url="?curid=151637" title="Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)">
<text>The Walt Disney Studios, located in Burbank, California, United States, serves as the corporate headquarters for the Walt Disney Company. The 51-acre (20.6 ha) studio lot also contains several sound stages, a backlot, and other filmmaking production facilities for Walt Disney Studios&#x27;s motion picture production. The complex also houses the offices for many of the company&#x27;s units, including the film studios Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Marvel Studios.

Walt Disney used the earnings from the successful release of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; to finance the construction of the Burbank studio. Disney is the only major film studio out of the Big Five that does not currently offer regular tours of their studio lot to the general public. Since the mid-2000s, Adventures by Disney has offered tours of the studio, but only as an integral component of their Southern California tour package. The other way to tour the studio is to join the official Disney D23 fan club, which offers tours to members every few months. The studio used to open to the public once a year in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving for its annual Magical Holiday Faire craft sale, but stopped hosting the Faire around 2003. As an aid to visitors, many buildings on the Disney lot are currently marked with identifying signs that include historical information and trivia about each site.

The Studio&#x27;s production services are managed by Walt Disney Studios&#x27;s Disney Studio Services unit – along with Golden Oak Ranch, The Prospect Studios, and KABC-7 Studio B. Disney has a secondary location at Grand Central Creative Campus, where Walt Disney Imagineering and some other units are located. Disney Imagineering manages the studio.

== Background ==

Prior to the official opening of the Burbank lot in 1940, the Walt Disney Studios was situated at several different locations in Los Angeles. During summer 1923, Walt Disney created &quot;The Disney Bros. Cartoon Studio&quot; in his uncle Robert Disney&#x27;s garage, which was located at 4406 Kingswell Avenue, in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles (just east of Hollywood). This garage has been on display at the Stanley Ranch Museum in Garden Grove since the 1980s, several blocks away from Disneyland. His brother Roy O. Disney was also in Los Angeles at the time. In October 1923, the brothers leased office space on the rear side of a real estate agency&#x27;s office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. On October 16, 1923, Walt Disney accepted an offer from Margaret Winkler of Universal Studios to distribute the new Alice Comedies starring Virginia Davis. It was also at this site where on January 14, 1924, Walt Disney met his future wife Lillian Bounds, an &quot;ink and paint&quot; girl whom he personally hired. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to an office of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. The late Robert Disney&#x27;s residence and the small office building that is home to 4649 and 4651 Kingswell Avenue have survived to the present and are still in use.

In 1925, Walt Disney placed a deposit on a new, considerably larger lot at 2719 Hyperion Avenue, and the studio moved there in January 1926. It was here where, after a train journey with his wife Lillian, Walt created the character of Mickey Mouse in 1928. Here, too, the first three-strip Technicolor animated film, the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, and the first animated cartoon using Disney&#x27;s multiplane camera, &quot;The Old Mill&quot;, were created. In 1937, the Hyperion studio produced Disney&#x27;s first full-length animated feature film, &quot;&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Disney&#x27;s staff began to grow to a substantial size at the Hyperion Studio, and Disney Legends such as Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men began their careers there. The Hyperion studio site was sold in 1940 and divided between two different industrial manufacturers, and in 1966 a subsequent owner demolished what was left of the studio complex and replaced it with the supermarket and shopping center that stand there today. To honor the company&#x27;s former headquarters from 1926 to 1940, the name &#x27;Hyperion&#x27; has been reused over the years by the Walt Disney Company for multiple divisions and attractions, including Hyperion Books and the Hyperion Theater at Disney California Adventure. The current management team consists of Susan Arnold (Chairwoman) Bob Iger
(CEO), John Nallen COO, Viet Dinh CLO, Tommy Lee CFO, at PBS (now part of Disney) Susan Arnold CFO, John Gelke VP Global Operations, J Young SVP Growth, Gerard Devan Group Executive APAC, Stephanie Gruber Group Executive Television, Christopher Greavu Vice President of Sales

== History ==
The current Walt Disney Studios, located at 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, was made possible by the revenue from the 1937 release of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Walt Disney and his staff began the move from the old studio at Hyperion Avenue in Silver Lake from December 1939 to January 1940. Designed primarily by Kem Weber under the supervision of Walt Disney and his brother Roy, the Burbank Disney Studio buildings are the only studios that have been owned by the Walt Disney Company to survive from the Golden Age of filming. A bungalow, the Shorts building and other small buildings that were located at the Hyperion Avenue location were moved to Burbank.

Disney purposely planned his new Burbank studio around the animation process. The large Animation Building stood in the center of the campus, while adjacent outlying buildings were constructed for the ink-and-paint departments, the camera and editing departments, and the other various functions of the studio. Tunnels linked some of the buildings (to allow movement of animation materials without exposing them to the outside elements), and the lot also included a movie theatre, a sound stage, and a commissary. The 1941 Disney feature &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, which combined live action with animated sequences and starred Robert Benchley, served as a tour of the then-new studio. It was later frequently seen and toured on various Disney television programs.

The attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7, 1941, brought America into World War II. 500 United States Army soldiers of the 121st Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) Gun Battalion occupied Walt Disney Studios the day after the attack for eight months in the period of the West Coast invasion scare, earning Disney as the only Hollywood studio to come under military occupation in history. During the war, Disney regularly produced propaganda and training films for the U.S. government including its armed forces to increase morale among Americans that the fight against the Axis powers was waged for a just cause.

In the years after the war, the studio began regular work on live-action features, as they needed the money. Though their first films were shot in England, the necessity to build live-action facilities still arose. Lacking the capital to do it themselves, Jack Webb offered to put up some of the money to build live-action soundstages in exchange for the right to use them (Webb used them to shoot much of the &quot;Dragnet&quot; TV series). During this time, backlots for exterior shots were also built and remained standing at the studios until after a major change in management in 1984.

In 1986, after the corporate restructuring of Walt Disney Productions into the Walt Disney Company, the studio lot was remodeled to accommodate more live-action production space and administrative offices. The studio lot is now home to multiple offices and administration buildings and seven soundstages. It is bounded by South Buena Vista Street on the west, West Alameda Street on the north, South Keystone Street on the east, and West Riverside Drive on the south. It sits in an area of Burbank where the street grid is offset at a diagonal, but most of the original buildings and roads within the campus itself were laid out in alignment with the cardinal directions.

Disney chairman Michael Eisner had the Team Disney building constructed in 1990. In 1992, Disney had gained city approval for its expansion master plan, which included the Riverside Building. The Riverside Building, located next to Feature Animation Building at 2300 Riverside Drive, opened in 2000 for ABC executives and employees.

In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its offices from Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus to the studio&#x27;s Frank G. Wells Building second floor.

== Facilities ==
=== Team Disney – The Michael D. Eisner Building ===
Formerly known as the Team Disney Burbank building, Team Disney – The Michael D. Eisner Building is the main building located at the Walt Disney Studios. Completed in 1990 and designed by Michael Graves, the Team Disney Burbank building contains the office of CEO Robert A. Iger as well as the boardroom for the board of directors. It also houses offices for members of Senior Management, such as Alan Bergman, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Prior to the opening of the Team Disney Burbank building in 1990, Disney executives were located in the old Animation building and the Roy O. Disney Building; the animators had been forced to relocate in 1985 into a series of warehouses, trailers, and hangars in nearby Glendale.

The Team Disney structure is sometimes called the &quot;Seven Dwarfs Building&quot;. It has large sculpted caryatids of the Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof of the eastern façade, an homage to the animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which provided Walt Disney with the revenue to purchase the Burbank lot. Each statue is tall, with the exception of the 2/3-sized Dopey at top. The building is located opposite the Frank G. Wells building, named for Eisner&#x27;s former colleague, and president of the Walt Disney Company from 1984 to 1994. In 1996, the building was featured in Hollywood Pictures film &quot;Spy Hard.&quot; On January 23, 2006, in honor of Michael Eisner&#x27;s 21-year leadership of the company, the Team Disney building was rededicated as Team Disney – The Michael D. Eisner Building.

=== Disney Legends Plaza ===

Disney Legends Plaza, located between the Team Disney: The Michael D. Eisner building and the Frank G. Wells building, is the central hub for the Disney Legends award and pays homage to its recipients. Dedicated on October 18, 1998, the plaza features the &quot;Partners&quot; statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse, designed by Imagineer Blaine Gibson, along with a replica statue of Roy O. Disney and Minnie Mouse which can also be found at the Magic Kingdom park.

Located on the pillars in the plaza are bronze plaques featuring receivers of the Disney Legends award. The plaques feature the recipient&#x27;s name, reason for gaining the award, and the person&#x27;s handprints and signature if they were alive at the time they received the award. Most famously, Legendary Animator and Imagineer, Ward Kimball&#x27;s plaque features an extra finger, a reminder of Kimball&#x27;s sense of humor. If, however, the award was presented posthumously, an image of the Disney Legends statue is engraved instead of the traditional handprints and signature.

The plaza formerly featured a small fountain to honor the Legends, but that was since removed due to water leakage.

=== Frank G. Wells Building ===

This building is dedicated to the former president of the Walt Disney Company from 1984 to 1994, Frank G. Wells. The building opened in 1998 and was dedicated by Wells&#x27;s widow Luanne Wells, and company CEO Michael Eisner.

The five-story building has a usable area of with three underground parking levels, accommodating 600 parking spaces. The construction was completed in two phases: phase I in August 1997 and phase II in July 1998. The Frank G. Wells building was specifically designed for Walt Disney Television Animation, and the division formerly had offices located on the third floor. The division has since moved to the Grand Central Creative Campus in nearby Glendale, California.

It is distinctly recognizable through its giant movie reel and film strip on the building&#x27;s exterior. The building is currently home to the Walt Disney Archives, studio mail center, Marvel Studios, the Disney Music Group, a screening room, various multipurpose rooms, and one of the three extant multiplane cameras (which is on display in the lobby). It was formerly home to Walt Disney Television, various management offices, and the human resources department.

The Archives are located on the ground floor and are open to all cast members; they also have additional storage and restricted areas on other floors. The Studio&#x27;s Starbucks Coffee shop is also located on the ground floor.

=== Animation Building ===

The three-story former main building for Walt Disney Animation Studios was completed in 1940, based on a Streamline Moderne design by industrial designer and architect Kem Weber. It is considered the jewel of the original studio buildings. Walt Disney personally supervised the eight-wing &quot;double H&quot; design, ensuring as many rooms as possible had windows, which allowed natural light into the building to help the animators while working. Many Disney animated features were drawn here, including &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981). The animation for &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985) was the last to be completed at the site.

The Animation Building initially served as the creative and administrative nucleus for the entire studio. Walt&#x27;s brother Roy O. Disney, who ran the company&#x27;s financial operations, shared a wing with the accounting and legal departments on the first floor, which was where the animators, in-betweeners and clean-up artists worked. The D-Wing&#x27;s ground floor was the longtime domain of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, and over the years other prominent animators and artists such as Bill Tytla, Fred Moore, Norm Ferguson, Preston Blair, Eyvind Earle, Tyrus Wong, Mary Blair, Andreas Deja, Floyd Norman, John Lasseter, Glen Keane, John Musker and Ron Clements worked in the building. On the second floor were office suites for the directors and studios for the background and layout artists. The story department was located on the third floor, along with offices and a rehearsal room for Disney&#x27;s composers and arrangers.

Suite 3H, on the third floor of the Animation Building&#x27;s H-Wing, was Walt&#x27;s headquarters. The five-room space included his two adjacent offices: a &quot;formal&quot; corner office for signing contracts and meeting with important visitors, and a &quot;working office&quot; where he huddled with key staff to develop ideas for his films, television shows and theme parks. The latter had a kitchenette hidden behind wood paneling that retracted at the touch of a button, as Walt often ate lunch at his desk. Also in the suite was his secretary&#x27;s office, featuring displays of his numerous awards, and a lounge area where Walt would relax after 5:00 pm with a drink (Scotch Mist was his cocktail of choice) and a back massage from the studio nurse before going home. Walt&#x27;s suite was closed after his death in 1966 and not reused until 1970, after his personal items had been carefully archived. Over the years these items were used in museum exhibits recreating his offices, primarily at Disney resorts. In 2015, under the auspices of the Walt Disney Archives, Suite 3H was restored as closely as possible to the condition in which Walt left it, with many of the original furnishings and objects. Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger dedicated the restoration on December 7 of that year. In 2016 it was opened for viewing by studio employees, special guests, and gold members of the Disney fan club D23.

A little-known feature of the Animation Building was its private rooftop annex, The Penthouse Club, a perk for male employees who could afford its membership fees. It had a gymnasium run by a full-time athletic instructor, a bar, a barber shop, steam baths, massage tables, pool and poker tables, and an outdoor patio which members tended to use for nude sunbathing. The entrance displayed a mural painted by animator Fred Moore depicting a bevy of nude or semi-nude women, surrounding a drunken single man bearing a certain resemblance to Moore himself. By the early 1960s the gym activities had ceased and it became a casual lounge for studio veterans. The Penthouse space has been shuttered for years and the Fred Moore mural removed to an unknown location.

The basement housed the Test Camera Department, which shot test loops of animation drawings in progress. Animators and directors would view these loops on Moviola machines to check the work before submitting it to Ink and Paint.

A utility tunnel linked the Animation Building with the neighboring Ink and Paint Building and the Camera and Cutting departments. It was built to ensure that the original animation drawings and painted cels could be safely transported from one location to another without being exposed to bad weather or other outside elements. The tunnel is still maintained and a length of it is open to D23 tours.

A popular point of interest for studio visitors is &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Corner&quot;, outside the Animation Building&#x27;s A-Wing at the southwestern end of the block. There one can see three paw prints embedded in the street, curbside beneath a fire hydrant. A hind paw print is missing, humorously suggesting that Pluto used the hydrant to mark his territory. Nearby is the often-photographed signpost indicating the site&#x27;s location at the corner of Mickey Avenue and Dopey Drive, with directions to various studio departments as they existed in Walt&#x27;s era. (Today only the street names remain the same). According to longtime Disney archivist Dave Smith, the street sign – the only one of its kind on the Disney lot – was installed as a temporary prop for the &quot;Studio Tour&quot; segment of the Disney feature &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941) and never removed.

Starting on February 1, 1985, during the production of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (released in 1986), Disney&#x27;s Animation Department was moved off the Burbank lot into a cluster of old hangars, warehouses, and trailers located about two miles east (3.2 km) in Glendale, at the former site of the Grand Central Airport. Prior to the opening of the Team Disney Burbank building in 1990, Disney executives used the Animation Building as corporate offices. In 1995, animation production moved back to Burbank across the street from the main studios with the opening of the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building. Today, the original Animation Building is used primarily to house offices for various film and television producers who have distribution deals with Disney. Its exterior was a primary location for the 2013 film &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;, though the interiors (including Walt&#x27;s offices) were recreated at an outside studio.

=== Water Tower ===
Completed in 1939 at a cost of $300,000, the Water Tower was one of the first structures to emerge at the new Disney studio. It stands high and originally held 150,000 gallons of water. Towers such as these provided an emergency water supply in case of fire and were a standard feature of major Hollywood studios of the era, examples of which can still be seen at the Warner Bros., Paramount and Sony Pictures Studios (formerly MGM) lots. Roy Disney, however, insisted that the Disney Studio&#x27;s water tower be built with six legs instead of the usual four, claiming it was more aesthetically pleasing.

The tower is no longer used for water storage and stands as an identifying symbol of Disney&#x27;s Burbank studio. In 1984 the top portion of the holding tank was painted white and, for the first time, emblazoned with the image of Mickey Mouse, the official mascot of the Walt Disney Company. It was the model for the Earffel Tower which stood at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park near Orlando, Florida from 1989 to 2016, and the replica at Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris (2002 to the present), though the original has never been decorated with Mickey Mouse ears on top.

=== The Roy O. Disney Building ===

The Roy O. Disney building is located next to the animation building and held the office of Roy O. Disney to whom the building is dedicated. The building used to be the main administration building on the studio lot prior to the opening of the Team Disney – The Michael D. Eisner building. Today, it is home to Disney&#x27;s legal department.

=== The Annette Funicello Stage, Stage 1 ===
Stage 1 was completed between 1939 and 1940 and is the original Disney soundstage on the Burbank lot. The soundstage was designed to replace a smaller stage at the former Hyperion Avenue Studio. Although Walt Disney Studios predominantly made animated films, the soundstage was built in order to film Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s segments in the 1940 film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. During World War II, the stage was used for repairing army vehicles. The soundstage was formerly dedicated to &quot;Fantasia&quot;, for it being the first motion picture that was filmed in the building. The stage is the smallest on the lot at 11,000 sq ft. It features a 2400 sq ft underwater tank and is still in active use. On June 24, 2013, it was dedicated to Mousketeer Annette Funicello as it was the original shooting stage for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

=== The Julie Andrews Stage, Stage 2 ===
Constructed from 1947 and opening in April 1949, Stage 2 is the second oldest soundstage on the Walt Disney Studios lot, and at , one of the largest in Los Angeles. It was built and financed by a joint agreement between Walt Disney and director Jack Webb, who used the stage for the filming of the television series &quot;Dragnet&quot;. In October 1955, Stage 2 began production on the first series of The Mickey Mouse Club. From 1954 to 1955 and prior to the opening of the facilities at Glendale California, WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) occupied soundstage 2 to build multiple attractions for Disneyland, including the Mark Twain Riverboat. Since then, Stage 2 has been used for the filming of multiple attractions for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

During the filming of &quot;Armageddon&quot; the filmmakers discovered the 40 feet high tall stage was not tall enough to hold one of the &quot;asteroid&quot; seen in the film. The floor was removed and an additional 20 feet was dug down to accommodate the 360-degree set for the scene. In 2001, soundstage 2 was dedicated to English actress Julie Andrews, because parts of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and parts of the then-current filming of &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; took place inside this particular soundstage.

=== Stage 3 ===
Stage 3 was completed in 1953 and designed especially for the film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;. The stage is 19,000 sq ft and contains an operational 3600 sq ft water tank that is divided into two parts for underwater and special effects filming.

The tank area was also used heavily beginning in the 1960s as Disney pioneered the use of the sodium screen process. In the 1970s, stage 3 was equipped with the first computerized motion control system. The ACES (Animated Camera Effects System) was designed by Disney engineers and broke new ground with technology which has become one of the foundations of current special effects photography.

=== Stages 4 and 5 ===
Stage 4, which was completed in 1958, was first used for &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;. Upon completing 30 years of service in 1998, Stage 4 was divided into two new television studios, creating the new Stage 4 and Stage 5. Stage 4 is known as the &quot;&quot;Home Improvement&quot; stage&quot;, as that series was filmed here from 1991 to 1999.

=== Stages 6 and 7 ===
Stages 6 and 7, built in 1997 are the newest soundstages at the Walt Disney Studios. These audience-rated stages provide comprehensive production support with computer-controlled access, high-volume air-conditioning, and adjoining production support building. They are built on the former back-lot and are located behind the Frank G. Wells Building. Both stages are each and are in frequent use at the studios. Popular productions here have included, &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, &quot;The Muppets&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Geena Davis Show&quot;, and &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;.

=== The Hyperion Bungalow ===
The Bungalow was built in 1935 as the original home of the Disney Publicity and Comic Strip Departments. It was constructed at the Disney Studios on Hyperion Avenue in Hollywood and moved to the Burbank location as part of the construction process in 1939–1940. At the Disney Burbank lot, the building housed many support services over the years. Payroll, Publicity Support, Traffic and finally the Post Office were located in the building. The structure is the last remaining example of the &quot;California Bungalow&quot; type architecture that remains from the Hyperion studio facility. Its attractive style and utility, dating back to the early years of the company, give it a special place in the history of the Disney lot.

=== Main Theater ===
The 419-seat Theater, another original building on the Burbank lot, shows first-run Disney films for studio employees and guests. It has plush stadium seating and has been upgraded over the years to keep pace with new technology in the exhibition of films. Food and drink are not allowed inside. 
Throughout its history, the theater has also been used for post-production sound mixing. According to the Disney production services website, &quot;The Main Theater is a state-of-the-art digital sound dubbing and screening facility that was first used to mix the sound for &quot;Fantasia&quot; [in 1940]. Sound mixers blend dialogue, music, and sound effects tracks to the various levels appropriate for a movie theater. The acoustics are designed to simulate a theater that is three-quarters full. Although the theater is empty during the mixing session, extra padding in the seats and specially designed walls absorb and reflect the sound. This helps the sound mixers to know what the final product will sound like when it is released to the public.&quot;

The signage above the entrance says simply &quot;Theatre&quot;. The name &quot;Main Theater&quot; is used to distinguish the venue from several smaller screening rooms situated throughout the studio. In Walt&#x27;s era, these were called &quot;sweatboxes&quot;, where animation test reels and the daily rushes of his live-action features were shown for his approval.

=== Ink and Paint Building ===
The 1940 Ink and Paint Building was where animators&#x27; drawings were inked onto transparent cels and then the cels were painted. It was built with high ceilings and a sophisticated central ventilation system so that the staff members would not be overcome by toxic paint fumes. One section was used as a special paint-mixing laboratory to provide Disney cartoons with the widest possible spectrum of colors. Three interior courtyards provided northern light for the artists and also served as outdoor break areas. It was a self-contained structure with its own cafeteria, lounge, and rooftop sundeck.

The sequestered layout reflected workplace attitudes of the era. As was common in the American animation industry of Disney&#x27;s day, the Ink and Paint departments were staffed exclusively by women. In the early 1940s, Disney employed over 100 &quot;ink and paint girls&quot; at a starting salary of $18 a week, as opposed to $300 a week for experienced animators. A Disney employment brochure of the time stated: &quot;Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men...The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with India ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with paint according to directions.&quot; Men and women at the Disney studio were not encouraged to fraternize, and the cloistered atmosphere of the Ink and Paint Building led wags on the lot to call it &quot;The Nunnery&quot;.

The basement of the Ink and Paint Building was the location of Disney&#x27;s famous &quot;Morgue&quot;, where artwork from the studio&#x27;s films was stored for possible future use. In a 1957 episode of his &quot;Disneyland&quot; TV series, Walt took viewers into the Morgue and, after some ghoulish fun on the room&#x27;s name, explained its real function. In 1989, this archival material was moved to its current location at the Disney Animation Research Library in Glendale, California.

Technological advances in animation, such as the advent of Xerography in the early 1960s and the development of CAPS in the late 1980s, ultimately made traditional ink and paint techniques obsolete at the Disney studio. The last Disney animated feature to fully employ inked and painted cels was &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). Today the Ink and Paint Building is primarily used for office space, though its original paint-mixing lab has been preserved and is used for the creation of limited edition Disney artwork created on-site.

=== Camera Building ===
The Camera Building, built in 1940, was where animation backgrounds and cels were traditionally photographed onto film. Unique original features were the &quot;de-dusting chambers&quot; that personnel, painted cels and other materials had to pass through before entering, so no trace of dust or lint would show up in the photography. In 1941 it housed two multiplane cameras, each standing high and occupying its own room, and two conventional camera set-ups. A third multiplane camera was subsequently constructed.

Since 1990 the Camera Building has been occupied by what is now Buena Vista Imaging, which provides photo-optical and digital imaging services for films and television.

=== Cutting Building ===
Another original site on the Burbank lot, it is the longtime home of Disney&#x27;s editing facilities. The building&#x27;s name derives from the traditional method of physically cutting and splicing films shot on nitrate and (after 1952) safety stock. Today it employs video editing techniques.

=== Shorts Building ===
The two-story Shorts Building is one of the most significant remnants of Disney&#x27;s former Hyperion studio. It originally consisted of two buildings, constructed in 1934 and 1937, to accommodate the company&#x27;s rapidly expanding animation department. The 1934 structure was called the &quot;Animation Building No. 2&quot; and Walt and Roy Disney had their offices there prior to the move to Burbank. The animation for scores of Disney shorts of the 1930s, including &quot;The Band Concert&quot; (1935) and the Oscar-winning &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937), was created in this complex, and it was here that Walt hatched his risky idea for America&#x27;s first full-length animated feature, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937).

In 1939 the two buildings were disassembled, transported to Disney&#x27;s new Burbank lot, and reconstructed as a single T-shaped edifice, with the addition of a loading dock. (The window of Walt&#x27;s old second-floor office can be seen directly above the dock). The colloquial name &quot;Shorts Building&quot; was apparently a nod to its historical past, as no further animation would be done on the premises. Since its relocation, the building has served the studio in support capacities, housing the publicity, comic strip, foreign relations, hair and makeup, and wardrobe fitting departments. The lot&#x27;s Studio Operations department is now located here.

=== The Roy E. Disney Animation Building ===
Formerly known as the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building, the Roy E. Disney building is the current home of Walt Disney Animation Studios, which sits to the south across Riverside Drive. It was designed by the firm Robert A.M. Stern Architects. Construction was completed in 1994.

As noted above, in 1985, Disney Animation was moved out of the studio lot and into a cluster of old buildings in Glendale. During Michael Eisner&#x27;s 1986 restructuring of the Walt Disney Company, the studio&#x27;s animation division was spun off to officially create Walt Disney Feature Animation as a separate subsidiary of the company, and in 1995 it came back to Burbank when its new home opened.

The new studio is a colorful architectural landmark, adorned by a 122-foot-tall version of the &quot;Fantasia&quot; Sorcerer&#x27;s hat, which once housed the office of Roy Disney, former head of Walt Disney Animation Studios. It also displays the word &quot;ANIMATION&quot; on giant letters on its south side to passersby on the Ventura Freeway.

In 2009, following the death of Roy Disney, the building was renamed and rededicated in his honor by Disney president and CEO, Bob Iger.

=== ABC Building ===
After Disney&#x27;s purchase of ABC in 1996, a new West Coast headquarters for the television network was constructed across Riverside Drive next to the Animation Building. The ABC building was designed by Aldo Rossi and is connected to the lot by a blue serpentine bridge that crosses over Riverside Drive.

=== Digital Studio Center ===
A two-story 17,000 square foot facility dedicated to post-production utilities and other, similar technical services. Opened in December 2012, the center is the home of Disney Digital Studio Services.

=== Original Commissary ===
This private cafeteria and grill opened in 1940 as Walt Disney&#x27;s Studio Restaurant and is now named the Buena Vista Café. Along with Stage 1, the Cutting Building, and the Main Theater, it is one of the few original buildings on the Burbank lot still serving its initial purpose. The commissary offers breakfast and lunch for studio employees and guests, with indoor and outdoor seating. It once had an executive dining area called the Coral Room where Walt Disney occasionally lunched. The site was extensively remodeled in 2011, but Walt&#x27;s favorite dish, chili served with crackers, remains on the menu.

A second, newer commissary is located inside the ABC Building, across from the main Disney lot on Riverside Drive in Burbank.

<text>The Aire and Calder Navigation is the canalised section of the Rivers Aire and Calder in West Yorkshire, England. The first improvements to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826. The New Junction Canal was constructed in 1905, to link the system to the River Don Navigation, by then part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.

Steam tugs were introduced in 1831. In the 1860s, compartment boats were introduced, later called Tom Puddings, from which coal was unloaded into ships by large hydraulic hoists. This system enabled the canal to carry at its peak more than 1.5 million tons of coal per year, and was not abandoned until 1986. To handle trains of compartments, many of the locks were lengthened to .

Although much of the upper reaches are now designated as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, although most of the traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.

==Route==
The Aire and Calder is a canalisation of the River Calder from Wakefield to Castleford, where it joins the branch from Leeds, which follows the River Aire. The Aire continues to flow eastwards to Bank Dole Junction, then continues in a north-easterly direction to Haddlesey, from where it follows a winding course to join the River Ouse at Airmyn. The section below Haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation, as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river. Instead, the Selby Canal flows northwards from Haddlesey to the Ouse at Selby. Below Dole Bank Junction, the Knottingley and Goole Canal flows eastwards to join the Ouse at Goole. From just before Newbridge, where the modern A614 road crosses the waterway, this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the Dutch River, an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by Cornelius Vermuyden&#x27;s original diversion of the River Don northwards to the River Aire in 1628.
The Aire and Calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly. More recent canals now also make the Navigation a vital link in the English and Welsh connected inland waterway network. Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which connects to the Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal connects to the Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, which can be reached via the New Junction Canal, forms a link with Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the south west, and the tidal River Trent at Keadby to the east.

==History==

In the early 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats carrying up to 30 tons traded on the river, which was tidal up to this point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill had a lot of support, it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.
The parliamentary bill was hotly contested, and the House of Lords asked Trinity House to produce a report on the three rivers. This favoured the scheme, and in May 1699 the (10 Will. 3. c. 25) was granted. It named 18 undertakers, nine from the Corporation of Leeds, and nine &quot;gentlemen of Wakefield&quot;, who would oversee the improvements to the River Aire (from the River Ouse at Airmyn via Castleford to Leeds) and the River Calder (from Castleford to Wakefield). The act gave them powers which included the creation of weirs bypassed by short &quot;cuts&quot; equipped with locks, the creation of a towpath, and the right to buy and demolish mills and weirs. John Hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately, and by 1704 the original work was completed, including 12 locks on the Aire between Haddesley and Leeds and 4 on the Calder. The locks were long by wide with depths over the sills.

Capital to fund the scheme had been raised separately by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718, and the navigation was leased to various groups, who would be responsible for collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of the previous five years had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool and corn from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.

===Development===
Some development of the navigation occurred. In 1744, the undertakers bought some land at Airmyn, and developed warehousing and wharfage there, as a more convenient point than Rawcliffe, where the water was shallower. In the 1760s, £13,000 was spent on improvements and maintenance, with several weirs being rebuilt to improve the depth of water. There was a long-running dispute with Arthur Ingram, who owned Knottingley mill, which started in 1731, and was not finally resolved until 1776, when the company bought both of Ingram&#x27;s mills. Despite this, the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development. They asked John Smeaton to suggest improvements in 1771, but the subsequent attempt to authorise such improvements was disputed in Parliament on the basis that the present navigation was totally inadequate. The recently finished Calder and Hebble Navigation proposed to build a canal from Wakefield to the Dutch River, which would bypass the Calder completely, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal supported a Leeds to Selby canal, which would bypass the Aire. During 1772, they asked Smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower Aire, but his assistant, William Jessop actually carried out the work. He proposed a canal from Haddlesey lock to the Ouse at Newland. With Parliament not reaching a decision, they reworked their plan, which was now for a canal from Haddlesey to Selby, with a new cut from Ferrybridge to Beal, and improvements above Castleford. In 1774 the Leeds to Selby bill was rejected by Parliament, but the Aire and Calder bill was passed as the Aire and Calder Navigation Act 1774 (14 Geo. 3. c. 96) with a few amendments.

Construction of the Selby Canal began in 1775, and it was opened on 29 April 1778. The new cut at Castleford opened in spring 1775, while those at Knostrop and Hunslet were finished in 1779. Methley cut was completed, but Woodlesford was not, as the company bought the mill there instead. All locks were replaced, and the total cost was over £60,000, of which around £20,000 was for the Selby Canal. The navigation remained profitable, paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775, which had risen to £32,000 by 1791. Most traffic now used the Selby route, and the transhipment facilities at Airmyn were closed in 1779.

Selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time, and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal. Canal boats were limited to about 60 tons, whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach Selby. By 1800, it was handling some 369,780 tons of goods, and the support industries of ropemaking, sailmaking and shipbuilding were expanding.

===Knottingley to Goole===
In 1817, there was a proposal for an Aire and Don Canal, to connect Knottingley to the Dutch River at Newbridge, with a branch to Doncaster, and another for a Went and Wakefield Canal, to connect Cold Hiendley on the Barnsley Canal to Newbridge on the Don. With revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818, which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid, the company was in a healthy state, and proposed their own route from Haddlesey to the Dutch River. The destination was then changed to Goole, and John Rennie was asked to survey the route. Those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the Aire to Airmyn and the Selby Canal would be maintained. In July 1821, Rennie proposed the construction of docks at Goole, rather than a lock into the river, and the company proposed that of water should be available. Rennie died in late 1821, and George Leather took over as engineer. Construction at Goole started on 28 September 1822, and the company eventually built much of the new town as well as the docks.

The canal and docks opened on 20 July 1826. A barge lock, and a ship lock, , capable of taking vessels up to 400 tons, connected the extensive docks to the Ouse. The new section was long, with locks at Ferrybridge, Whitley, Pollington and Goole. The connection to the Aire and the Selby canal was maintained by the lock at Bank Dole. Goole became an official port in 1827, when it gained its own Customs facilities. The scheme had cost £361,484, of which £221,350 had been borrowed, while the rest came from company resources.
Faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from Wakefield to Ferrybridge, the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both Leeds and Wakefield. Thomas Telford surveyed both routes, and it became the basis for an act of Parliament, the (9 Geo. 4. c. xcviii), which was passed in June 1828. It included a clause to ensure that the Selby Canal was maintained with a depth of water of , and made provision for extensions to Goole docks. Work started on a new cut at Castleford and on the line to Leeds, but legal action over the Selby Canal meant that it had to be made deeper and wider in 1832 and 1833. The Leeds line was completed in April 1835, somewhat later than anticipated, as the banks were made more substantial, to cope with steam tugs, which would be introduced in due course. The seven locks above Castelford were all wide. Improvements to the Calder to Wakefield took longer, as there were problems with floods filling the workings, difficulty with constructing foundations for an aqueduct which would carry the navigation over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry, and then in transporting the castings for the aqueduct to the site. The cost of the improvements ran to around £510,000.

===Modernisation===
The Aire and Calder tried to work with the railways when they arrived in the 1840s, by making traffic agreements, but still suffered a significant drop in trade. Receipts dropped by one-third between 1851 and 1856. Thomas Hammond Bartholomew, the chief engineer, had been experimenting with steam power since 1813, and steam paddle tugs had been operating on the system since 1831. When he died in late 1852, two-thirds of the traffic was pulled by steam tugs. His son, William Hammond Bartholomew, replaced him and introduced tugs with propellers soon afterwards. These could tow ten keels, carrying 700 tons, but were held up at locks, as the keels had to be worked through one at a time. Between 1860 and 1867, the locks from Goole to Castleford were extended to to alleviate this.

In 1861, Bartholomew met with the chairman, Warde-Aldam, to propose a system of sectional boats, each consisting of six compartments, with a bow and stern section. The compartments or tubs would be unloaded into ships by a hydraulic hoist at Goole, which would lift them from the water and tip them over. Warde-Aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year, and £13,382 was allocated for three train boats, a hoist, and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks. By late 1864, the prototypes were operational, with the stern section replaced by a pusher tug. Soon afterwards, extra compartments were ordered, as experience showed that a tug and seven compartments could fit into the larger locks. In 1874, Warde-Aldam noted that &quot;...the people now call them &#x27;Tom Puddings&#x27; from their wobbling gait.&quot; The length of the trains increased to ten or eleven tubs, but such a train was difficult to steer from the rear, and so the tugs moved to the front and pulled the assembly. In 1880 they carried 151,860 tons, and by 1913 there were 18 tugs, 1,010 compartments, and 1,560,006 tons were carried, 33 times Warde-Aldam&#x27;s original estimate.

Around 1864, the Aire and Calder dabbled in owning its own railways, purchasing the Silkstone Waggonway from the Barnsley Canal. But this proved a poor investment; in 1866 the waggonway carried just 3,246 tons of coal down from a peak of over 32,000 in 1851, and in 1870 no coal was carried at all. In August 1872, it was reported that &quot;the rails have been pulled up and sold&quot;.
After the First World War, another programme of improvements to the locks was carried out, extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly. Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train to pass through the locks meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.

The 20th century saw two major phases of improvement. In 1905, the New Junction Canal connected the Aire and Calder to the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation near Stainforth. It was funded by the Aire and Calder, with the Don Navigation eventually meeting half the cost. During the 1960s, the navigation underwent another modernisation scheme, in which the locks from Goole to Leeds were upgraded and enlarged to accommodate vessels conforming to the 600-tonne Euro-barge standard. There is some variation in lock sizes, with the smallest being at Knostrop, which is with a water depth of over the lock cill. Euro barges are , and when fully loaded with 600 tonnes of cargo, have a draught of . Locks on the Wakefield section can accommodate vessels which are with a draught of , though rigid vessels are constrained to 141 ft to enable turning at Wakefield while the locks below Castleford have three sets of gates, so that a section can be used, rather than the full required by the compartment boats.

The main problem with upgrading the Wakefield branch was the dimensions of George Leather&#x27;s cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used.

Although coal mining was one of the main reasons for the success of the navigation, it has also brought problems, caused by subsidence. In March 1988, the bank near Lemonroyd lock collapsed into St Aidan&#x27;s opencast mine, which then flooded. A significant factor was the presence of excavations below the opencast workings where lower coal seams had previously been mined. The failure resulted in some of material, including the banks of the river and the canal, slipping into the workings, which then flooded to a depth of , creating a lake which covered . An act of Parliament was obtained to allow of new waterway to be constructed. The original locks at Kippax and Lemonroyd were replaced by a single lock at Lemonroyd. Opencast mining finally resumed ten years later, after the site had been pumped out, but the coal reserves are now exhausted, and the site forms a nature reserve, with wet grasslands, reedbeds and open water covering .

==Traffic==
A 20th-century modification of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge &quot;C&quot; power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried on top of the coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan&#x27;s opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.

British Waterways introduced a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and which would be loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because they believed that the system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.

==Leisure boating==
The Aire and Calder was built for commercial freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section and much of the Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.

Much of the ex-industrial (western) part of the Navigation now has the appearance of a tree-lined, gently-twisting river. The eastern part of the Navigation, sometimes known as the Knottingley and Goole Canal, is rather different: it has long straight stretches, but mainly through flat land that has always been agricultural. Between Wakefield and Leeds, via Castleford, the Navigation is part of a circular cruising route or &quot;ring&quot;, formed by the Leeds &amp; Liverpool and the Huddersfield or Rochdale canals. The Outer Pennine Ring utilises the Huddersfield Canal, while the North Pennine Ring uses the Rochdale Canal for the southern crossing of the Pennines. Beyond Castleford, boaters can travel on to Selby, York, Goole, Sheffield, and Keadby. With the possible restoration of the Barnsley Canal and the Dearne and Dove Canal, the section between Wakefield and the New Junction Canal might become part of a new &quot;Yorkshire Ring&quot;.

==Incidents==
On 10 May 2021, an articulated lorry crashed off a bridge from the M62 and into the navigation. The tractor unit landed on the bank and the driver suffered minor injuries, while the trailer floated away.

<doc id="151641" wikidata="Q1718195" url="?curid=151641" title="Line drawing algorithm">
<text>In computer graphics, a line drawing algorithm is an algorithm for approximating a line segment on discrete graphical media, such as pixel-based displays and printers. On such media, line drawing requires an approximation (in nontrivial cases). Basic algorithms rasterize lines in one color. A better representation with multiple color gradations requires an advanced process, spatial anti-aliasing.

On continuous media, by contrast, no algorithm is necessary to draw a line. For example, cathode-ray oscilloscopes use analog phenomena to draw lines and curves.

== Single color line drawing algorithms ==

Single color line drawing algorithms involve drawing lines in a single foreground color onto a background. They are well-suited for usage with monochromatic displays.

The starting point and end point of the desired line are usually given in integer coordinates, so that they lie directly on the points considered by the algorithm. Because of this, most algorithms are formulated only for such starting points and end points.

=== Simple Methods ===
The simplest method of drawing a line involves directly calculating pixel positions from a line equation. Given a starting point formula_1 and an end point formula_2, points on the line fulfill the equation formula_3, with formula_4 being the slope of the line. The line can then be drawn by evaluating this
equation via a simple loop, as shown in the following pseudocode:

 dx = x2 − x1
 dy = y2 − y1
 m = dy/dx
 for x from x1 to x2 do
 y = m × (x − x1) + y1
 plot(x, y)

Here, the points have already been ordered so that formula_5.

This algorithm is unnecessarily slow because the loop involves a multiplication, which is significantly slower than addition or subtraction on most devices. A faster method can be achieved by viewing the Difference between two consecutive steps:

Therefore, it is enough to simply start at the point formula_1 and then increase formula_7 by formula_8 once on every iteration of the loop. This algorithm is known as a Digital differential analyzer.

Because rounding formula_7 to the nearest whole number is equivalent to rounding formula_10 down, rounding can be avoided by using an additional control variable that is initialized with the value 0.5. formula_8 is added to this variable on every iteration. Then, if this variable exceeds 1.0, formula_7 is incremented by 1 and the control variable is decremented by 1. This allows the algorithm to avoid rounding and only use integer operations. However, for short lines, this faster loop does not make up for the expensive division formula_4, which is still necessary at the beginning.

These algorithm works just fine when formula_14 (i.e., slope is less than or equal to 1), but if formula_15 (i.e., slope greater than 1), the line becomes quite sparse with many gaps, and in the limiting case of formula_16, a division by zero exception will occur.

=== Issues ===
In certain situations, single color line drawing algorithms run into issues:

==== Inconsistent brightness ====
When drawing lines of the same length with differing slopes, different numbers of pixels are drawn. This leads to steeper lines being made up of fewer pixels than flatter lines of the same length, which leads to the steeper line appearing brighter than the flat line. This problem is unavoidable on monochromatic devices.

==== Clipping ====
Clipping is an operation that limits rasterisation to a limited, usually rectangular, area. This is done by moving the start- and end points of the given line to the borders of this area if they lie outside of it. Generally, this leads to the coordinates of these points no longer being integer numbers. If these coordinates are simply rounded, the resulting line will have a different slope than intended. For this issue to be avoided, additional tests are necessary after clipping.

== Antialiasing ==
The biggest issue of single color line drawing algorithms is that they lead to lines with a rough, jagged appearance. On devices capable of displaying multiple levels of brightness, this issue can be avoided through antialiasing. For this, lines are usually viewed in a two-dimensional form, generally as a rectangle with a desired thickness. To draw these lines, points lying near this rectangle have to be considered.

=== Gupta and Sproull algorithm ===
The Gupta-Sproull algorithm is based on Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm but adds antialiasing.

An optimized variant of the Gupta-Sproull algorithm can be written in pseudocode as follows:

 DrawLine(x1, x2, y1, y2) {
 x = x1;
 y = y1;
 dx = x2 − x1;
 dy = y2 − y1;
 d = 2 * dy − dx; // discriminator

 // Euclidean distance of point (x,y) from line (signed)
 D = 0; 

 // Euclidean distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
 length = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy); 

 sin = dx / length;
 cos = dy / length;
 while (x &lt;= x2) {
 IntensifyPixels(x, y − 1, D + cos);
 IntensifyPixels(x, y, D);
 IntensifyPixels(x, y + 1, D − cos);
 x = x + 1
 if (d &lt;= 0) {
 D = D + sin;
 d = d + 2 * dy;
 } else {
 D = D + sin − cos;
 d = d + 2 * (dy − dx);
 y = y + 1;
 }

The IntensifyPixels(x,y,r) function takes a radial line transformation and sets the intensity of the pixel (x,y) with the value of a cubic polynomial that depends on the pixel&#x27;s distance r from the line.

== Optimizations ==
Line drawing algorithms can be made more efficient through approximate methods, through usage of direct hardware implementations, and through parallelization. Such optimizations become necessary when rendering a large number of lines in real time.

=== Approximate methods ===
Boyer and Bourdin introduced an approximation algorithm that colors pixels lying directly under the ideal line. A line rendered in this way exhibits some special properties that may be taken advantage of. For example, in cases like this, sections of the line are periodical. This results in an algorithm which is significantly faster than precise variants, especially for longer lines. A worsening in quality is only visible on lines with very low steepness.

=== Parallelization ===
A simple way to parallelize single-color line rasterization is to let multiple line-drawing algorithms draw offset pixels of a certain distance from each other. Another method involves dividing the line into multiple sections of approximately equal length, which are then assigned to different processors for rasterization. The main problem is finding the correct start points and end points of these sections. 

Algorithms for massively parallel processor architectures with thousands of processors also exist. In these, every pixel out of a grid of pixels is assigned to a single processor, which then decides whether the given pixel should be colored or not.

Special memory hierarchies have been developed to accelerate memory access during rasterization. These may, for example, divide memory into multiple cells, which then each render a section of the line independently.
Rasterization involving Antialiasing can be supported by dedicated Hardware as well.

== Related Problems ==
Lines may not only be drawn 8-connected, but also 4-connected, meaning that only horizontal and vertical steps are allowed, while diagonal steps are prohibited. Given a raster of square pixels, this leads to every square containing a part of the line being colored. A generalization of 4-connected line drawing methods to three dimensions is used when dealing with voxel grids, for example in optimized ray tracing, where it can determine the voxels that a given ray crosses.

Line drawing algorithms distribute diagonal steps approximately evenly. Thus, line drawing algorithms may also be used to evenly distribute points with integer coordinates in a given interval. 
Possible applications of this method include linear interpolation or downsampling in signal processing. There are also parallels to the Euclidean algorithm, as well as Farey sequences and a number of related mathematical constructs.

<doc id="151646" wikidata="Q2936042" url="?curid=151646" title="Wilts &amp; Berks Canal">
<text>The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal is a canal in the historic counties of Wiltshire and Berkshire, England, linking the Kennet and Avon Canal at Semington near Melksham, to the River Thames at Abingdon. The North Wilts Canal merged with it to become a branch to the Thames and Severn Canal at Latton near Cricklade. Among professional trades boatmen, the canal was nicknamed the Ippey Cut, possibly short for Chippenham.

The canal was opened in 1810, but abandoned in 1914 – a fate hastened by a breach at Stanley aqueduct in 1901. Much of the canal subsequently became unnavigable: many of the structures were deliberately damaged by army demolition exercises; parts of the route were filled in and in some cases built over. In 1977 the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Amenity Group was formed with a view to full restoration of the canal. Several locks and bridges have since been restored, and over of the canal have been rewatered.

==Name==
The official name of the canal is the &quot;Wilts &amp; Berks Canal&quot; as cited in the local acts of Parliament that authorised its building and abandonment. The &quot;Wiltshire and Berkshire Canal&quot; is incorrect. Neither is it correct to refer to the &quot;North Wilts Canal&quot; as the &quot;North Wiltshire Canal&quot;.

The canal&#x27;s original name is retained for historical reasons despite local council boundary changes in 1973 that transferred part of Berkshire through which the canal passes (mostly the Vale of White Horse) to Oxfordshire.

==History==
The idea for the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal grew from a proposal to construct a canal between Lechlade on the Thames and Severn Canal and Abingdon-on-Thames on the River Thames. A meeting was held at Abingdon in 1784, and the proposal gained support among local landowners. Subsequently, Frederick Page suggested a canal suitable for Thames barges to run between a junction with the Thames and Severn at Kempsford and Wantage, passing through Highworth near Swindon and Longcot. At Wantage, it would split into two, with one branch going to Abingdon and the other to Wallingford, further downstream on the Thames. The Kennet and Avon Canal had also surveyed a route through Calne and Chippenham, which had been discarded in favour of the route through Bradford-on-Avon and Devizes. A meeting to promote the ideas was held at Swindon on 12 November 1793, but presentation of a bill to Parliament was postponed until the plans were more mature.

James Black, representing the Thames and Severn Canal, asked William Whitworth the engineer for his canal to survey the route, including a link to his canal. By 22 February 1794, plans were sufficiently advanced that they were approved by a committee meeting at Swindon. The Earl of Peterborough chaired the meeting, which also heard that agreement had been reached with the Kennet and Avon Canal, although the junction with the Thames was still not finalised. By the meeting held on 16 May, Abingdon had been chosen as the connection to the Thames.

A bill for a canal from Trowbridge on the Kennet and Avon Canal, running through Melksham, Dauntsey, Wootton Bassett, Swindon, Shrivenham, and Charlow to terminate on the Thames at Abingdon, was submitted to Parliament. It faced opposition from the city of Oxford, who maintained that trade on the Thames above Abingdon and to the city would be considerably damaged, but despite their stance, the bill passed into law on 30 April 1795, when the (35 Geo. 3. c. 52) received royal assent. The length of the canal was initially , but provision was made for developments at the Trowbridge end. The Kennet and Avon Canal were proposing to alter their route, and the Act allowed the proprietors to give the section from Trowbridge to Semington to the Kennet and Avon Company if their new route was authorised within three years and built within seven. The deviation was authorised, and the Kennet and Avon built the length from Trowbridge to Semington, from where their main line continued on to Devizes. The length of the Wilts &amp; Berks was thus reduced to .

As well as the main line, the Act authorised three branch canals, to Calne, Chippenham and Wantage. It allowed the company to raise £111,900 through 1,119 shares at a cost of £100 each for the construction of the canal, with powers to raise an extra £150,000 if required. Although the plans submitted to Parliament had been signed by both Robert Whitworth Snr. and his son William, the younger Whitworth worked with John Ralph on costings for the work. This was estimated at £103,603 for the original main line and £8,350 for the branches. Robert Whitworth was contracted as engineer for the construction, on a similar basis as he had worked for the Ashby Canal. He would be responsible for design work and setting out, and would arrange to be on site for around three months each year. His son William would be on site as resident engineer, handling the day-to-day supervision of the project.

Work started at the westen end, in the hope that once the canal reached Chippenham and Calne, they could generate revenue from the transport of coal, although this depended on the Somerset Coal Canal and the western end of the Kennet and Avon being completed. There were problems with cash flow, as the sale of shares had only raised £61,512 by 1801, all of which had been spent, leaving a shortfall of £85,199. They could not use the powers of the 1795 Act to borrow money until all of the original shares had been bought, and so another Act of Parliament, the (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. lxviii), was obtained allowing the company to raise a further £200,000 from shares to complete the canal. Having failed to sell all the £100 shares, new shares were issued at steadily decreasing values, to attract new classes of investors. The shares were issued at £65, £60, £40, £25 and finally £12 10s. A total of 7,436 shares were eventually sold, raising £224,393. This was supplemented by £22,200 from optional notes and by the company running up debts.

The canal was cut during the years 1796 to 1810. Robert Whitworth Snr. remained as an engineer on the canal from 1796 until he died in 1799, making regular progress reports to the company. William Whitworth was resident engineer during this period and subsequently became engineer until the canal&#x27;s completion. The company hoped that construction would be completed in 1805, but it was not, and the canal opened in stages as it was finished. Swindon was reached in June 1804, South Marston in July 1805, and it opened to near Longcot in December 1805. A branch to Longcot was constructed in 1807, although it was not authorised, and this was resolved by an addition to an act obtained in 1835. Abingdon was reached on 22 September 1810. A boat carrying the proprietors passed through the final lock into the Thames at 2:30pm, who then departed to the Council Chamber for a celebration that went on late into the evening. The final cost of the project was £255,262.


The main canal was long, with branches totalling a little over to Chippenham, Calne, Wantage and Longcot. Although initial plans were for a canal suitable for Thames barges, it was cut as a narrow canal to take narrowboats long and wide. From Semington, the canal passed through 24 locks, which raised the level by to the summit pound between Wootton Bassett and South Marston. A further 18 locks enabled the canal to descend to Abingdon. There were also three locks on the Calne branch. There were three short tunnels.

==Expansion==
Before the canal was completed, the proprietors were already thinking about how the canal could become part of a larger network. In 1809, they proposed a Western Junction canal, which would have crossed the Thames on an aqueduct and continued for a further by way of Thame and Aylesbury to join the Grand Junction Canal at Marsworth. Both canal companies agreed to contribute £100,000 to fund the project, but opposition from the Thames Commissioners, the Kennet and Avon Canal, the Oxford Canal and the Warwick and Napton Canal resulted in the bill being defeated in Parliament on 25 February 1811. A branch from the Grand Junction to Aylesbury was completed in 1815, and the two canals looked again at completing the link between Aylesbury and Abingdon in 1813 and 1817. They made a joint survey for the route in 1819, and the plan was reconsidered in 1828, but no further action occurred.

Their next plan was for a Bristol Junction Canal in 1810, running from Wootton Bassett via the Gloucestershire coalfield to Bristol. An initial survey was made by William Whitworth, and a bill presented to Parliament in 1811, but it was withdrawn amidst opposition from the Thames Commissioners, landowners and the Oxford Canal. A Central Junction Canal was the next proposal, running over from Abingdon to the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. John Rennie oversaw a survey of its route, and the cost was estimated at £470,000, but no further action ensued when there was opposition from the Grand Junction Canal, the Oxford Canal and the Warwick and Napton Canal.

Throughout construction of their own canal, the Wilts &amp; Berks company had considered a link to the Thames and Severn Canal, and in 1810 they wrote to the Thames and Severn to say that William Whitworth had surveyed a route from Wootton Bassett to Yeoing (now known as Ewen), near Kemble in Gloucestershire. The project, named the Severn Junction Canal, was altered to run from Swindon to Latton junction on the Thames and Severn, and was presented to Parliament in early 1811, but was withdrawn because it would probably have been defeated. By 1812, it had become the North Wilts Canal, and authority to build it was obtained in 1813. Of the many plans, this was the only one to reach completion when it opened on 2 April 1819.

The North Wilts Canal was originally formed as a separate company. The branch was long and included 11 locks, an aqueduct over the River Thames and a small tunnel near Crichlade. Having borrowed £!5,000 from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners to help finance its construction, the company could not meet Government demands for repayment of that loan, and after only two years of independence, proposed that it should merge with the Wilts &amp; Berks, whose shareholders had also contributed £15,000 to its construction costs. The merger was authorised by the passing of the (2 Geo. 4. c. xcvii). The Wilts &amp; Berks took over the debt with the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission, North Wilts shareholders received £100 shares in the parent company for their existing shares, and the act also consolidated all of the previous legislation for both companies, with earlier acts being repealed.

==Operation==
Following completion, further acts were obtained. The &#x27; (50 Geo. 3. c. cxlviii) contained a small number of clauses concerning money, and a much more important clause altering conditions for the carriage of coal on the River Thames. When the 1795 Act was passed, there had been opposition from merchants who brought coal by sea to London, and they had instigated a clause in the Act banning the carriage of coal which had been conveyed by canal boats below Reading. The new Act repealed this ban, moving the City coal limits to Staines, despite serious opposition from ship owners and the proprietors of collieries in the north-east of England. The &#x27; (53 Geo. 3. c. cxx), sought to resolve issues with water supply. When the canal opened, the main water supply was a deep well near Swindon, but this could not supply sufficient water for the canal&#x27;s operation. The proprietors had constructed a feeder from the Ashbury Brook, but this had caused consternation among landowners, and the Act was passed to prevent them extracting water from the Beckett Estate at Shrivenham, and to ensure that the feeder was filled in. A third act, the (55 Geo. 3. c. vi), was passed in 1815 to allow the company to raise £100,000, which they used to pay off debts collected during the construction of the canal and to construct a reservoir. The Act also allowed them to invest in the North Wilts Canal.

Outgoing traffic consisted of corn and agricultural products, collected from the rural communities bordering the canal and taken westwards to Bristol and Bath via the Kennet and Avon Canal. This amounted to in 1843. In the reverse direction, coal came from the Radstock and Paulton mines in the Somerset coalfield by way of the Somersetshire Coal Canal, which joined the Kennet and Avon Canal near the Dundas Aqueduct. In 1837, of coal were transported via the Wilts &amp; Berks from the Somerset coalfield, with being handled at Abingdon wharf. The Wilts &amp; Berks thus became a link in the chain of canals providing a transport route between the West Country and the Midlands. Water supply was always a problem and a reservoir was constructed near Swindon to supply the canal, now known as Coate Water. From the reservoir, a feeder meandered northwards and eastwards, to feed water into the canal near Marston Locks.

Income from tolls rose from £5,523 for the first year of operation to £12,877 in 1837, after which they were affected by railway building. The company paid a dividend to shareholders in 1812, but decided to forego any further payments until debts had been repaid, improvements made, and issues with water supply resolved. This was achieved by 1831, when dividend payments resumed. A total of £7,000 in dividends was paid in 1837, which only represented a return of about two per cent for the shareholders. Other major outgoings were repayments to the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners, for money borrowed to finance the construction of the North Wilts Canal. The final payment was made in 1839. Income rose significantly after 1838, as they canal carried materials for building railways, but decreased again from 1842 onwards. The company used the unexpected windfall to build hoses, buy a wharf at Oxford, construct Tockenham Reservoir, pay off loans, and retained the rest as reserves.

==Decline==
Although the canal company had initially been dismissive of the threat from railway competition, and had benefitted from carrying materials for its construction, the Great Western Railway ran close to the canal from Abingdon to Swindon and Chippenham. When the railway opened in 1841, traffic fell sharply, apart from coal from the Somerset Coal Canal. Coal traffic on the western end of the canal rose between 1837 and 1847, but declined on the canal to the east of Swindon. Further rail competition occurred from 1848 with the opening of Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, which affected traffic on the western half of the canal. Traffic on the North Wilts branch also declined. A final dividend of £561 was paid in 1870, and in 1873 the canal made a loss; by that time all traffic to the east of Wantage had ceased. The Great Western Railway owned the Kennet and Avon Canal, and increased tolls for traffic to and from the Wilts and Berks, increasing the cost of coal carried on the canal. The company failed to interest the railway in buying the canal, and decided to close it.

Despite the decline, a group of shareholders were optimistic that matters could improve, and called a meeting on 4 September 1874. The meeting decided that closure was the best option, and drew up a bill in November to close or sell the canal. Bristol Chamber of Commerce objected to the proposal, and in late 1875 seven merchants formed a new company to buy the canal. The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Co Ltd obtained an Act of Parliament in June 1876, and paid £13,466 for the canal. They took control in early 1877, but in 1882 leased the canal to another group of merchants from Bristol for £1,250 per year. They experimented with sectional boats – similar to the Tom Pudding boats used on the Aire and Calder Canal – but they found them too difficult to manage, and narrow boats continued to be used. The new group failed to make a profit and in 1887 forfeited their lease. The 1876 company made another attempt at operating the canal.
Another group, the United Commercial Syndicate, took over the canal in 1891, and by 1896 had spent £16,000 putting the canal back into order. They decided that it could not be made profitable, and with support from the Swindon Traders Association, who thought the canal was an eyesore, attempted to abandon it. The Thames and Severn Canal were keen to take over the North Wilts branch, to allow them to access Swindon. There was opposition from landowners for whom the canal supplied water for cattle, and the abandonment failed on a technicality. A second attempt at abandonment was made in 1900, but an enquiry at Swindon by the Board of Trade resulted in the proposal being withdrawn. In 1901, one arch of Stanley Aqueduct, which carried the canal over the River Marden, collapsed, severing the canal. Swindon Corporation attempted to obtain an act to cut off the water supply to Coate Reservoir in 1904, but this failed. There was no traffic on the canal after 1906, and Swindon finally obtained an act to close the canal in 1914.
The (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. cviii) enabled the corporation to take over Coate Reservoir, now known as Coate Water, for recreational purposes, as it had been used for recreation since the 1870s, and they also obtained land for public purposes. They paid £8,000 to the canal company, who also sold what land they could to meet their debts.

From the early 1930s, much of the canal was filled in and generally used for dumping rubbish. Chippenham Wharf, once home to Brinkworth&#x27;s Coal Depot, was used by residents as a refuse tip, and council minutes from 1926 show a decision to dump pig offal in the disused waterway. A bus station was built on the site, the buried wharf being uncovered briefly during redevelopment in 2006.

During the Second World War, many of the locks and other canal structures were used for army exercises and damaged by explosives.

Very little of the old canal survived in usable form, but long rural stretches are clearly delineated.

==Restoration==

In 1977 the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Amenity Group was formed to protect what remained of the canal, and to restore short sections for their amenity value. Their first projects included the clearing of sections at Kingshill, Shrivenham, Dauntsey and Wootton Bassett. Between 1977 and 1987, there was a significant increase in public awareness of derelict canals and enthusiasm for their restoration. The aims of the Amenity Group therefore changed, from limited conservation to full restoration of the canal.

The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Trust was formed in 1997 as a partnership between the Amenity Group and the district and county councils covering the route of the canal, namely the district councils of North Wilts, West Wilts and Vale of White Horse, the county councils of Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, and Swindon Borough Council. The aims of the trust were to protect, conserve and improve the canal and its branches, with the ultimate aim of restoring the whole canal to navigable status. However, the legal structure of the group was unsuitable for accessing some of the grants available for canal restoration, and so it was reformed into the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Partnership in 2001. In 2012 it was renamed as The Wiltshire, Swindon and Oxfordshire Canal Partnership, to reflect the local authority areas through which the canal runs.

While much of the line of the canal is still traceable in the rural areas, significant sections of it have been built over where it passed through towns. With all of the local authorities participating in the Wiltshire, Swindon and Oxfordshire Canal Partnership, the &quot;line&quot; of the canal has been preserved in Local Development Plans, ensuring that no new building or development should take place on the former route. Following closure, large sections of the route have passed into private ownership with no rights of public access.

Since 1988, the trust have worked on restoring small sections of the route as access has become available, or permissive access has been granted by landowners. A significant event was the organisation of a &quot;Big Dig&quot; in 1991 by the Waterway Recovery Group to celebrate their twenty-first year of involvement in canal restoration. Over 1,000 navvies arrived for a weekend of work, and they cleared nearly two miles of canal bed near Wantage, raising local awareness of plans for the canal. One of the first sections to be rewatered was at Templars Firs on the southern edge of Royal Wootton Bassett, where a section was restored in 1995; the reopened section was used for a trail boat festival in 1996. Further progress was hampered by a sewage pipe crossing the waterway, which was re-routed below the canal in 1988 by Wessex Water. The pound was extended to and another trail boat festival in 1988 was attended by 50 boats. East of here, after a short unrestored section where the towpath is a public right of way but the canal bed is owned by a farmer, the Studley Grange section was opened in 2018 after agreement was reached with Biffa, the waste disposal company, who agreed to a 125-year lease. Funding to remove the refuse from the canal came from a Town and Country Planning Act 1990 section 106 agreement.

The connection of the canal with the River Thames at Abingdon had been lost to development. A new connection with the river further downstream near Culham Lock was created on 30 August 2006, when Jubilee Junction was completed. The cut initially runs for about to a winding hole, but will eventually link to the historic route of the canal to the west of Abingdon. Final decisions on the route in this area have not been made, pending a decision on whether or not a new water-supply reservoir will be built near Abingdon, which would cover further sections of the original route to the south west of the town.
On 26 May 2009, Double Bridge and a short section of rewatered canal to the south of Pewsham was officially opened by the Trust&#x27;s patron, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. With a grant from the Gannett Foundation and voluntary labour, working parties extended this section to the foot of Pewsham Locks in 2012.

At Swindon the canal used to run northwards to the town centre, where the North Wilts Canal continued running northwards and the main line ran eastwards towards Shrivenham. The route to the east has been built over, and a new route which runs parallel to the M4 motorway along the southern edge of Swindon and then turns northwards along its eastern edge has been proposed. The council have found a route for the North Wilts branch which runs close to or re-uses the original route. In 2007, a feasibility study suggested that the proposal to construct a canal through Swindon would cost £50m. Despite some objections, Swindon Borough Council gave approval in 2008 for further investigation of the scheme. The Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group also welcomed the project &quot;as a key element in transforming Swindon&#x27;s town centre into a leisure and visitor attraction, disposing of its dreary reputation.&quot;

 of land between the town and the M4 motorway were designated as the site of a new housing development in 2006, and the project to build some 4,500 homes known collectively as Wichelstowe is a joint venture between the council, Barrett Homes and David Wilson Homes. The architect for the whole scheme was John Simpson, who also worked on Poundbury near Dorchester. The first stage at East Wichel, providing some 800 houses as well as a new lock and length of canal, was completed in 2009. A second length of canal known as the Rushey Platt section, restored in the 1990s, is part of the canalside development. It runs southwards from Cross Kingshill Road, part of the A4289 near the centre of Swindon, to a Waitrose supermarket and a waterways-themed Hall &amp; Woodhouse pub, the interior of which was designed by the archaeologist Mark Horton. In addition to building housing and the canal, the developers by 2024 had planted 376 trees in urban streets and 34,336 in open areas. They had also installed 307 bird boxes and 89 bat boxes.
There were problems with leakage on the East Wichel section, which were largely resolved in 2022, but work was ongoing in 2023 to locate the final leaks. Planning permission for further development in Middle Wichel and West Wichel was granted in late 2022. This included the construction of another length of canal to join the Rushey Platt and East Wichel sections. It will include a swing bridge to carry the towpath from the west side of the Rushey Platt section to the north side of the section to East Wichel. Progress southwards from the swing bridge junction is blocked by the M4 motorway, but spurred on by the award of £4 million to the Stroudwater Navigation for two bridges under the A38 road from Highways England, the Partnership applied to Highways England, and were awarded £42,000 for a Stage 1 feasibility study. They were hopeful that this would lead to full funding for a new bridge under the motorway further to the west, to link up with the Studley Grange section, but were notified in November 2022 that they had not been awarded a Stage 2 grant of £870,000 to fund a detailed feasibility study and planning permission application.

Swindon is also expanding to the east, in a development called the New Eastern Villages. The planned new route of the canal runs through the development area, and it is probable that creation of further sections of the canal will be included in the project. Elsewhere, in the early 1990s, the Wilts and Berks Canal Company was formed and bought two miles of the canal spanning Dauntsey Lock. Their primary objective was to refurbish a row of derelict cottages beside the canal, which they did, but they also restored the canal and the lock, helped by volunteers from the Canal Trust. In 2017, the Wessex Waterways Restoration Trust was formed, with similar aims to the Canal Trust. They aim to complement the Canal Trust, working on parts of the canal restoration where the Canal Trust are not active.

In Melksham, where much of the route has been lost to housing, Melksham Town Council agreed in 2012 to support plans to route the canal through the River Avon in the centre of town, involving construction of of new waterway, with a towpath and cycleway which would create recreational opportunities. The plans were submitted to Wiltshire Council in August 2012, but the Trust were required to produce supporting documentation. The environmental statement ran to 350,000 words and was published in five volumes in 2015, but the Environment Agency required further information, and supplementary reports were produced in March 2018 and January 2019. After delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, communication with the Environment Agency resumed, and agreement on the final two obstacles to the plan was reached. Details were submitted for planning approval in early 2022.

==Restoration issues==
There is some controversy about the restoration of the canal, in particular the felling of trees and the corresponding short-term disruption of wildlife habitats that have evolved in the 100 or so years since the canal was abandoned, and this has been addressed in the North Wiltshire Local Plan. For the Melksham link, planning documents indicate that there will be a net gain in habitat, including standing water, marginal wetland habitat and the planting of new lengths of hedgerow. Where trees have to be removed, new trees will be planted to replace them.

Objections to a canal route through Swindon town centre prior to 2010 were believed to arise from a misconception that canals contained &quot;stagnant water&quot;. However canals are permanently moving water slowly downstream, and are thus not stagnant. The passage of boats keeps the water stirred up making it muddy-looking, but this is required to prevent the growth of weeds. In January 2008 Swindon Council considered a report, prepared by their consultants, on the feasibility and implications of restoring the town centre route. They endorsed the proposal, and set up a task group to make further progress.

There was concern in south Oxfordshire about the risk of flooding, and it can be argued that the canal will act as a drainage system, helping to take excess water and move it away to the Thames. The Environment Agency expressed concerns about the proposed route of the canal at Melksham, and its effect on the floodplain, and there were calls from local landowners to ensure that a town-centre route was re-established.

<text>The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is an astronomical facility operated since 1998 by the European Southern Observatory, located on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. It consists of four individual telescopes, each equipped with a primary mirror that measures in diameter. These optical telescopes, named &quot;Antu&quot;, &quot;Kueyen&quot;, &quot;Melipal&quot;, and &quot;Yepun&quot; (all words for astronomical objects in the Mapuche language), are generally used separately but can be combined to achieve a very high angular resolution. The VLT array is also complemented by four movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) with apertures.

The VLT is capable of observing both visible and infrared wavelengths. Each individual telescope can detect objects that are roughly four billion times fainter than what can be seen with the naked eye. When all the telescopes are combined, the facility can achieve an angular resolution of approximately 0.002 arcsecond. In single telescope mode, the angular resolution is about 0.05 arcseconds.

The VLT is one of the most productive facilities for astronomy, second only to the Hubble Space Telescope in terms of the number of scientific papers produced from facilities operating at visible wavelengths. Some of the pioneering observations made using the VLT include the first direct image of an exoplanet, the tracking of stars orbiting around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, and observations of the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.

== General information ==
The VLT consists of an arrangement of four large, diameter telescopes (called Unit Telescopes or UTs) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer (VLTI), which is used to resolve small objects. The interferometer also includes a set of four diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations. The first of the UTs started operating in May 1998 and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999. The other telescopes became operational in 1999 and 2000, enabling multi-telescope VLT capability. Four 1.8-metre Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) have been added to the VLTI to make it available when the UTs are being used for other projects. These ATs were installed and became operational between 2004 and 2007.

The VLT&#x27;s 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes:
* as a set of four independent telescopes (this is the primary mode of operation).
* as a single large coherent interferometric instrument (the VLT Interferometer or VLTI), for extra resolution. This mode is used for observations of relatively bright sources with a small angular extent.
* as a single large incoherent instrument, for extra light-gathering capacity. The instrumentation required to obtain a combined incoherent focus was not originally built. In 2009, new instrumentation proposals were put forward to potentially make that observing mode available. Multiple telescopes are sometimes independently pointed at the same object, either to increase the total light-gathering power or to provide simultaneous observations with complementary instruments.

=== Unit telescopes ===
The UTs are equipped with a large set of instruments permitting observations to be performed from the near-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared (i.e. a large fraction of the light wavelengths accessible from the surface of the Earth), with the full range of techniques including high-resolution spectroscopy, multi-object spectroscopy, imaging, and high-resolution imaging. In particular, the VLT has several adaptive optics systems, which correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence, providing images almost as sharp as if the telescope were in space. In the near-infrared, the adaptive optics images of the VLT are up to three times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the spectroscopic resolution is many times better than Hubble. The VLTs are noted for their high level of observing efficiency and automation.

The primary mirrors of the UTs are in diameter but, in practice, the pupil of the telescopes is defined by their secondary mirrors, effectively reducing the usable diameter to at the Nasmyth focus and at the Cassegrain focus.

The 8.2-metre-diameter telescopes are housed in compact, thermally controlled buildings, which rotate synchronously with the telescopes. This design minimises any adverse effects on the observing conditions, for instance from air turbulence in the telescope tube, which might otherwise occur due to variations in the temperature and wind flow.

The principal role of the main VLT telescopes is to operate as four independent telescopes. The interferometry (combining light from multiple telescopes) is used about 20 percent of the time for very high-resolution on bright objects, for example, on Betelgeuse. This mode allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than with individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI using a complex system of mirrors in tunnels where the light paths must be kept equal within differences of less than 1 μm over a light path of a hundred metres. With this kind of precision, the VLTI can reconstruct images with an angular resolution of milliarcseconds.

==== Mapuche names for the Unit Telescopes ====
It had long been ESO&#x27;s intention to provide &quot;real&quot; names to the four VLT Unit Telescopes, to replace the original technical designations of UT1 to UT4. In March 1999, at the time of the Paranal inauguration, four meaningful names of objects in the sky in the Mapuche language were chosen. These indigenous people live mostly south of Santiago de Chile.

An essay contest was arranged in this connection among schoolchildren of the Chilean II Region of which Antofagasta is the capital to write about the implications of these names. It drew many entries dealing with the cultural heritage of ESO&#x27;s host country.

The winning essay was submitted by 17-year-old Jorssy Albanez Castilla from Chuquicamata near the city of Calama. She received the prize, an amateur telescope, during the inauguration of the Paranal site.

Unit Telescopes 1–4 are since known as &quot;Antu&quot; (Sun), &quot;Kueyen&quot; (Moon), &quot;Melipal&quot; (Southern Cross), and &quot;Yepun&quot; (Evening Star), respectively. Originally there was some confusion as to whether &quot;Yepun&quot; actually stands for the evening star Venus, because a Spanish-Mapuche dictionary from the 1940s wrongly translated &quot;Yepun&quot; as &quot;Sirius&quot;.

=== Auxiliary telescopes ===
Although the four 8.2-metre Unit Telescopes can be combined in the VLTI, their observation time is spent mostly on individual observations, and are used for interferometric observations for a limited number of nights every year. However, the four smaller 1.8-metre ATs are available and dedicated to interferometry to allow the VLTI to operate every night.

The top part of each AT is a round enclosure, made from two sets of three segments, which open and close. Its job is to protect the delicate 1.8-metre telescope from desert conditions. The enclosure is supported by the boxy transporter section, which also contains electronics cabinets, liquid cooling systems, air-conditioning units, power supplies, and more. During astronomical observations the enclosure and transporter are mechanically isolated from the telescope, to ensure that no vibrations compromise the data collected.

The transporter section runs on tracks, so the ATs can be moved to 30 different observing locations. As the VLTI acts rather like a single telescope as large as the group of telescopes combined, changing the positions of the ATs means that the VLTI can be adjusted according to the needs of the observing project. The reconfigurable nature of the VLTI is similar to that of the Very Large Array.

== Scientific results ==

Results from the VLT have led to the publication of an average of more than one peer-reviewed scientific paper per day. For instance in 2017, over 600 refereed scientific papers were published based on VLT data. The telescope&#x27;s scientific discoveries include direct imaging of Beta Pictoris b, the first extrasolar planet so imaged, tracking individual stars moving around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, and observing the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.

In 2018, the VLT helped to perform the first successful test of Albert Einstein&#x27;s General Relativity on the motion of a star passing through the extreme gravitational field near the supermassive black hole, that is the gravitational redshift. In fact, the observation has been conducted for over 26 years with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments in the VLT while the new approach in 2018 also used the beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. The Galactic Centre team at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) used these observations to reveal these effects for the first time.

Other discoveries with VLT&#x27;s signature include the detection of carbon monoxide molecules in a galaxy located almost 11 billion light-years away for the first time, a feat that had remained elusive for 25 years. This has allowed astronomers to obtain the most precise measurement of the cosmic temperature at such a remote epoch. Another important study was that of the violent flares from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. The VLT and APEX teamed up to reveal material being stretched out as it orbits in the intense gravity close to the central black hole.

Using the VLT, astronomers have also estimated the age of extremely old stars in the NGC 6397 cluster. Based on stellar evolution models, two stars were found to be 13.4 ± 0.8 billion years old, that is, they are from the earliest era of star formation in the Universe. They have also analysed the atmosphere around a super-Earth exoplanet for the first time using the VLT. The planet, which is known as GJ 1214b, was studied as it passed in front of its parent star and some of the starlight passed through the planet&#x27;s atmosphere.

In all, of the top 10 discoveries done at ESO&#x27;s observatories, seven made use of the VLT.

== Technical details ==

=== Telescopes ===

Each Unit Telescope is a Ritchey-Chretien Cassegrain telescope with a 22-tonne 8.2-metre Zerodur primary mirror of 14.4-metre focal length, and a 1.1-metre lightweight beryllium secondary mirror. A flat tertiary mirror diverts the light to one of two instruments at the f/15 Nasmyth foci on either side, with a system focal length of 120 metres, or the tertiary tilts aside to allow light through the primary mirror central hole to a third instrument at the Cassegrain focus. This allows switching between any of the three instruments within five minutes, to match observing conditions. Additional mirrors can send the light via tunnels to the central VLTI beam-combiners. The maximum field-of-view (at Nasmyth foci) is around 27 arcminutes in diameter, slightly smaller than the full moon, though most instruments view a narrower field.

Each telescope has an alt-azimuth mount with total mass around 350 tonnes, and uses active optics with 150 supports on the back of the primary mirror to control the shape of the thin (177 mm thick) mirror by computers.

=== Instruments ===

The VLT instrumentation programme is the most ambitious programme ever conceived for a single observatory. It includes large-field imagers, adaptive optics corrected cameras and spectrographs, as well as high-resolution and multi-object spectrographs and covers a broad spectral region, from deep ultraviolet (300 nm) to mid-infrared (24 μm) wavelengths.

In addition to these, GRAVITY and MATISSE are currently installed in the VLTI lab, along with ESPRESSO fed via fibre-optics (not interferometric). 

; AMBER (VLTI)
: The astronomical multi-beam recombiner instrument combines three telescopes of the VLT at the same time, dispersing the light in a spectrograph to analyse the composition and shape of the observed object. AMBER is notably the &quot;most-productive interferometric instrument ever&quot;. It has been decommissioned. 
; CRIRES and CRIRES+
: The cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph is an adaptive optics assisted echelle spectrograph. It provides a resolving power of up to 100,000 in the infrared spectral range from 1 to 5 micrometres. From 2014 to 2020 it underwent a major upgrade to CRIRES+ to provide ten times larger simultaneous wavelength coverage. A new detector focal plane array of three Hawaii 2RG detectors with a 5.3 μm cut-off wavelength replaced the existing detectors, a new spectropolarimetric unit is added, and the calibration system is enhanced. One of the scientific objectives of CRIRES+ is in-transit spectroscopy of exoplanets, which currently provides us with the only means of studying exoplanetary atmospheres. Transiting planets are almost always close-in planets that are hot and radiate most of their light in the infrared (IR). Furthermore, the IR is a spectral region where lines of molecular gases like carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4), etc. are expected from the exoplanetary atmosphere. This important wavelength region is covered by CRIRES+, which will additionally allow tracking multiple absorption lines simultaneously.
; ERIS
: The enhanced resolution imager and spectrograph is the newest VLT instrument, which started science operation in 2023. It is an adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared imager (with coronagraph option) and integral-field spectrograph. It replaces the former NACO and SINFONI instruments with improved capability. 
; ESPRESSO
: The echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanet and stable spectroscopic observations) is a high-resolution, fiber-fed and cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph for the visible wavelength range, capable of operating in 1-UT mode (using one of the four telescopes) and in 4-UT mode (using all four), for the search for rocky extra-solar planets in the habitable zone of their host stars. Its main feature is the spectroscopic stability and the radial-velocity precision. The requirement is to reach 10 cm/s, but the aimed goal is to obtain a precision level of few cm/s. ESPRESSO was installed and commissioned at the VLT in 2017–2018.
; FLAMES
: The fibre large array multi-element spectrograph is a multi-object fibre feed unit for UVES and GIRAFFE, the latter allowing the capability for simultaneously studying hundreds of individual stars in nearby galaxies at moderate spectral resolution in the visible.
; FORS1/FORS2
: The focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph is a visible light camera and Multi Object Spectrograph with a 6.8 arcminute field of view. FORS2 is an upgraded version over FORS1 and includes further multi-object spectroscopy capabilities. FORS1 was retired in 2009 to make space for X-SHOOTER; FORS2 continues to operate as of 2021.
; GRAVITY (VLTI)
: GRAVITY is an adaptive optics assisted, near-infrared (NIR) instrument for micro-arcsecond precision narrow-angle astrometry and interferometric phase referenced imaging of faint celestial objects. This instrument interferometrically combines NIR light collected by four telescopes at the VLTI.
; HAWK-I
: The high acuity wide field K-band imager is a near-infrared imager with a relatively large field of view, about 8x8 arcminutes.
; ISAAC
: The infrared spectrometer and array camera was a near infrared imager and spectrograph; it operated successfully from 2000 to 2013 and was then retired to make way for SPHERE, since most of its capabilities can now be delivered by the newer HAWK-I or KMOS.
; KMOS
: KMOS (K-band Multi Object Spectrograph) is a cryogenic near-infrared multi-object spectrometer, observing 24 objects simultaneously, intended primarily for the study of distant galaxies.
; MATISSE (VLTI)
: The multi aperture mid-infrared spectroscopic experiment is an infrared spectro-interferometer of the VLT-Interferometer, which potentially combines the beams of all four Unit Telescopes (UTs) and four Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs). The instrument is used for image reconstruction. After 12 years of development It saw its first light at the telescope in Paranal in March 2018.
; MIDI (VLTI)
: MIDI is an instrument combining two telescopes of the VLT in the mid-infrared, dispersing the light in a spectrograph to analyse the dust composition and shape of the observed object. MIDI is notably the second most-productive interferometric instrument ever (surpassed by AMBER recently). MIDI was retired in March 2015 to prepare the VLTI for the arrival of GRAVITY and MATISSE.
; MUSE
: MUSE is a huge &quot;3-dimensional&quot; spectroscopic explorer which will provide complete visible spectra of all objects contained in &quot;pencil beams&quot; through the Universe.
; NACO
: NAOS-CONICA, NAOS meaning Nasmyth adaptive optics system and CONICA, meaning Coude near infrared camera) is an adaptive optics facility which produces infrared images as sharp as if taken in space and includes spectroscopic, polarimetric and coronagraphic capabilities.
; PIONIER (VLTI) 
: Is an instrument to combine the light of all 8-metre telescopes, allowing to pick up details about 16 times finer than can be seen with one UT.
; SINFONI
: The spectrograph for integral field observations in the near infrared) was a medium resolution, near-infrared (1 to 2.5 micrometres) integral field spectrograph fed by an adaptive optics module. It operated from 2003, then retired in June 2019 to make space for the future ERIS.
; SPHERE
: The spectro-polarimetric high-contrast exoplanet research, a high-contrast adaptive optics system dedicated to the discovery and study of exoplanets.
; ULTRACAM
: ULTRACAM is a visitor instrument for ultra-high-speed photometry of variable objects. ULTRACAM provides three simultaneous bands of optical photometry.
; UVES
: The ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph is a high-resolution ultraviolet and visible light echelle spectrograph.
; VIMOS
: The visible multi-object spectrograph delivered visible images and spectra of up to 1,000 galaxies at a time in a 14 × 14 arcmin field of view. It was mainly used for several large redshift surveys of distant galaxies, including VVDS, zCOSMOS and VIPERS. It was retired in 2018 to make space for the return of CRIRES+.
; VINCI (VLTI) 
: VINCI was a test instrument combining two telescopes of the VLT. It was the first-light instrument of the VLTI and is no longer in use.
; VISIR
: The VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared provides diffraction-limited imaging and spectroscopy at a range of resolutions in the 10 and 20 micrometre mid-infrared (MIR) atmospheric windows. VISIR hosts the NEAR science demonstration, where NEAR is new earths in the alpha centauri region.
; X-Shooter
: X-Shooter is the first second-generation instrument, operating since 2009. It is a very wide-band [UV to near infrared] single-object spectrometer designed to explore the properties of rare, unusual or unidentified sources.

=== Interferometry ===

In its interferometric operating mode, the light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory. In the year 2001, during commissioning, the VLTI successfully measured the angular diameters of four red dwarfs including Proxima Centauri. During this operation it achieved an angular resolution of ±0.08 milli-arc-seconds (0.388 nano-radians). This is comparable to the resolution achieved using other arrays such as the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer and the CHARA array. Unlike many earlier optical and infrared interferometers, the Astronomical Multi-Beam Recombiner (AMBER) instrument on VLTI was initially designed to perform coherent integration (which requires signal-to-noise greater than one in each atmospheric coherence time). Using the big telescopes and coherent integration, the faintest object the VLTI can observe is magnitude 7 in the near infrared for broadband observations, similar to many other near infrared / optical interferometers without fringe tracking. In 2011, an incoherent integration mode was introduced called AMBER &quot;blind mode&quot;, which is more similar to the observation mode used at earlier interferometer arrays such as COAST, IOTA and CHARA. In this &quot;blind mode&quot;, AMBER can observe sources as faint as K=10 in medium spectral resolution. At more challenging mid-infrared wavelengths, the VLTI can reach magnitude 4.5, significantly fainter than the Infrared Spatial Interferometer. When fringe tracking is introduced, the limiting magnitude of the VLTI is expected to improve by a factor of almost 1000, reaching a magnitude of about 14. This is similar to what is expected for other fringe tracking interferometers. In spectroscopic mode, the VLTI can currently reach a magnitude of 1.5. The VLTI can work in a fully integrated way, so that interferometric observations are actually quite simple to prepare and execute. The VLTI has become worldwide the first general user optical/infrared interferometric facility offered with this kind of service to the astronomical community.

Because of the many mirrors involved in the optical train, about 95% of the light is lost before reaching the instruments at a wavelength of 1 μm, 90% at 2 μm and 75% at 10 μm. This refers to reflection off 32 surfaces including the Coudé train, the star separator, the main delay line, beam compressor and feeding optics. Additionally, the interferometric technique is such that it is very efficient only for objects that are small enough that all their light is concentrated.

For instance, an object with a relatively low surface brightness such as the moon cannot be observed, because its light is too diluted. Only targets which are at temperatures of more than have a surface brightness high enough to be observed in the mid-infrared, and objects must be at several thousands of degrees Celsius for near-infrared observations using the VLTI. This includes most of the stars in the solar neighborhood and many extragalactic objects such as bright active galactic nuclei, but this sensitivity limit rules out interferometric observations of most solar-system objects. Although the use of large telescope diameters and adaptive optics correction can improve the sensitivity, this cannot extend the reach of optical interferometry beyond nearby stars and the brightest active galactic nuclei.

Because the Unit Telescopes are used most of the time independently, they are used in the interferometric mode mostly during bright time (that is, close to full moon). At other times, interferometry is done using 1.8-metre Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), which are dedicated to full-time interferometric measurements. The first observations using a pair of ATs were conducted in February 2005, and all the four ATs have now been commissioned. For interferometric observations on the brightest objects, there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8-metre telescopes.

The first two instruments at the VLTI were VINCI (a test instrument used to set up the system, now decommissioned) and MIDI, which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time. With the installation of the three-telescope AMBER closure-phase instrument in 2005, the first imaging observations from the VLTI are expected soon.

Deployment of the Phase Referenced Imaging and Microarcsecond Astrometry (PRIMA) instrument started 2008 with the aim to allow phase-referenced measurements in either an astrometric two-beam mode or as a fringe-tracker successor to VINCI, operated concurrent with one of the other instruments.

After falling drastically behind schedule and failing to meet some specifications, in December 2004 the VLT Interferometer became the target of a second ESO &quot;recovery plan&quot;. This involves additional effort concentrated on improvements to fringe tracking and the performance of the main delay lines. Note that this only applies to the interferometer and not other instruments on Paranal. In 2005, the VLTI was routinely producing observations, although with a brighter limiting magnitude and poorer observing efficiency than expected.

, the VLTI had already led to the publication of 89 peer-reviewed publications and had published a first-ever image of the inner structure of the mysterious Eta Carinae. In March 2011, the PIONIER instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four Unit Telescopes, potentially making VLTI the biggest optical telescope in the world. However, this attempt was not really a success. The first successful attempt was in February 2012, with four telescopes combined into a 130-metre diameter mirror.

In March 2019, ESO astronomers, employing the GRAVITY instrument on their Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), announced the first direct detection of an exoplanet, HR 8799 e, using optical interferometry.

== In popular culture ==

One of the large mirrors of the telescopes was the subject of an episode of the National Geographic Channel&#x27;s reality series &quot;World&#x27;s Toughest Fixes&quot;, where a crew of engineers removed and transported the mirror to be cleaned and re-coated with aluminium. The job required battling strong winds, fixing a broken pump in a giant washing machine and resolving a rigging issue. The procedure is part of routine scheduled maintenance.

The area surrounding the Very Large Telescope was featured in the 2008 film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. The ESO Hotel, the Residencia, served as a backdrop for part of the James Bond movie. Producer Michael G. Wilson said: &quot;The Residencia of Paranal Observatory caught the attention of our director, Marc Forster and production designer, Dennis Gassner, both for its exceptional design and its remote location in the Atacama desert. It is a true oasis and the perfect hide out for Dominic Greene, our villain, whom 007 is tracking in our new James Bond film.&quot;

<doc id="151651" wikidata="Q13169" url="?curid=151651" title="Fomalhaut">
<text>Fomalhaut (, ) is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish, and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation Alpha Piscis Austrini, which is an alternative form of α Piscis Austrini, and is abbreviated Alpha PsA or α PsA. This is a class A star on the main sequence approximately from the Sun as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

It is classified as a Vega-like star that emits excess infrared radiation, indicating it is surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Fomalhaut, K-type main-sequence star TW Piscis Austrini, and M-type, red dwarf star LP 876-10 constitute a triple system, even though the companions are separated by approximately 8 degrees.

Fomalhaut was the first stellar system with an extrasolar planet candidate imaged at visible wavelengths, designated Fomalhaut b. However, analyses in 2019 and 2023 of existing and new observations indicate that Fomalhaut b is not a planet, but rather an expanding region of debris from a massive planetesimal collision.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;α Piscis Austrini&quot;, or &quot;Alpha Piscis Austrini&quot;, is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. It also bears the Flamsteed designation of &quot;24 Piscis Austrini&quot;. The classical astronomer Ptolemy included it in the constellation of Aquarius, along with the rest of Piscis Austrinus. In the 17th century, Johann Bayer firmly planted it in the primary position of Piscis Austrinus. Following Ptolemy, John Flamsteed in 1725 additionally denoted it &quot;79 Aquarii&quot;. The current designation reflects modern consensus on Bayer&#x27;s decision, that the star belongs in Piscis Austrinus. Under the rules for naming objects in multiple-star systems, the three components – Fomalhaut, TW Piscis Austrini and LP 876-10 – are designated A, B and C, respectively.

The star&#x27;s traditional name derives from &quot;Fom al-Haut&quot; from scientific Arabic &quot;&quot; &quot;the mouth of the [Southern] Fish&quot; (literally, &quot;mouth of the whale&quot;), a translation of how Ptolemy labeled it.
&quot;Fam&quot; in Arabic means &quot;mouth&quot;, &quot;al&quot; &quot;the&quot;, and &quot;ḥūt&quot; &quot;fish&quot;
or &quot;whale&quot;.
In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included the name &quot;Fomalhaut&quot; for this star.

In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced &quot;Dagon&quot; as the winning name for Fomalhaut b. The winning name was proposed by Todd Vaccaro and forwarded by the St. Cloud State University Planetarium of St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States of America, to the IAU for consideration. Dagon was a Semitic deity, often represented as half-man, half-fish.

==Fomalhaut A==
At a declination of −29.6°, Fomalhaut is located south of the celestial equator, and hence is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. However, its southerly declination is not as great as that of stars such as Acrux, Alpha Centauri and Canopus, meaning that, unlike them, Fomalhaut is visible from a large part of the Northern Hemisphere as well, being best seen in autumn. Its declination is greater than that of Sirius and similar to that of Antares. At 40°N, Fomalhaut rises above the horizon for eight hours and reaches only 20° above the horizon, while Capella, which rises at approximately the same time, will stay above the horizon for twenty hours. Fomalhaut can be located in northern latitudes by the fact that the western (right-hand) side of the Square of Pegasus points to it. Continuing the line from Beta to Alpha Pegasi towards the southern horizon, Fomalhaut is about 45˚ south of Alpha Pegasi, with no bright stars in between.

===Properties===
Fomalhaut is a young star, for many years thought to be only 100 to 300 million years old, with a potential lifespan of a billion years. A 2012 study gave a slightly higher age of . The surface temperature of the star is around . Fomalhaut&#x27;s mass is about 1.92 times that of the Sun, its luminosity is about 16.6 times greater, and its diameter is roughly 1.84 times as large.

Fomalhaut is slightly metal-deficient compared to the Sun, which means it is composed of a smaller percentage of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The metallicity is typically determined by measuring the abundance of iron in the photosphere relative to the abundance of hydrogen. A 1997 spectroscopic study measured a value equal to 93% of the Sun&#x27;s abundance of iron. A second 1997 study deduced a value of 78%, by assuming Fomalhaut has the same metallicity as the neighboring star TW Piscis Austrini, which has since been argued to be a physical companion. In 2004, a stellar evolutionary model of Fomalhaut yielded a metallicity of 79%. Finally, in 2008, a spectroscopic measurement gave a significantly lower value of 46%.

Fomalhaut has been claimed to be one of approximately 16 stars belonging to the Castor Moving Group. This is an association of stars which share a common motion through space, and have been claimed to be physically associated. Other members of this group include Castor and Vega. The moving group has an estimated age of and originated from the same location. More recent work has found that purported members of the Castor Moving Group appear to not only have a wide range of ages, but their velocities are too different to have been possibly associated with one another in the distant past. Hence, &quot;membership&quot; in this dynamical group has no bearing on the age of the Fomalhaut system.

===Debris disks and suspected planets===


Fomalhaut is surrounded by several debris disks.

The inner disk is a high-carbon small-grain (10–300 nm) ash disk, clustering at 0.1 AU from the star. Next is a disk of larger particles, with inner edge 0.4-1 AU of the star. The innermost disk is unexplained as yet.

The outermost disk is at a radial distance of , in a toroidal shape with a very sharp inner edge, all inclined 24 degrees from edge-on. The dust is distributed in a belt about 25 AU wide. The geometric center of the disk is offset by about from Fomalhaut. The disk is sometimes referred to as &quot;Fomalhaut&#x27;s Kuiper belt&quot;. Fomalhaut&#x27;s dusty disk is believed to be protoplanetary, and emits considerable infrared radiation. Measurements of Fomalhaut&#x27;s rotation indicate that the disk is located in the star&#x27;s equatorial plane, as expected from theories of star and planet formation.

Herschel Space Observatory images of Fomalhaut, analysed in 2012, reveal that a large amount of fluffy micrometer-sized dust is present in the outer dust belt. Because such dust is expected to be blown out of the system by stellar radiation pressure on short timescales, its presence indicates a constant replenishment by collisions of planetesimals. The fluffy morphology of the grains suggests a cometary origin. The collision rate is estimated to be approximately 2000 kilometre-sized comets per day. Observations of this outer dust ring by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array also suggested the possible existence of two planets in the system. If there are additional planets from 4 to 10 AU, they must be under ; if from 2.5 outward, then .

On November 13, 2008, astronomers announced an extrasolar planet candidate, orbiting just inside the outer debris ring. This was the first extrasolar orbiting object candidate to be directly imaged in visible light, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. The mass of the tentative planet, Fomalhaut b, was estimated to be less than three times the mass of Jupiter, and at least the mass of Neptune. However, M-band images taken from the MMT Observatory put strong limits on the existence of gas giants within 40 AU of the star, and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging suggested that the object Fomalhaut b was more likely to be a dust cloud. A later 2019 synthesis of new and existing direct observations of the object confirmed that it is expanding, losing brightness, has not enough mass to detectably perturb the outer ring while crossing it, and is probably a dispersing cloud of debris from a massive planetesimal collision on a hyperbolic orbit destined to leave the Fomalhaut A system. Further 2022 observations with the James Webb Space Telescope in mid-infrared failed to resolve the object in the MIRI wideband filter wavelength range, reported by the same team to be consistent with the previous result.

The same 2022 JWST imaging data discovered another apparent feature in the outer disk, dubbed the &quot;Great Dust Cloud&quot;. However, another team&#x27;s analysis, which included other existing data, preferred its interpretation as a coincident background object, not part of the outer ring. Another 2023 study detected 10 point sources around Fomalhaut; all but one of these are background objects, including the &quot;Great Dust Cloud&quot;, but the nature of the last is unclear. It may be a background object, or a planetary companion to Fomalhaut.

==Fomalhaut B (TW Piscis Austrini)==

Fomalhaut forms a binary star with the K4-type star TW Piscis Austrini (TW PsA), which lies away from Fomalhaut, and its space velocity agrees with that of Fomalhaut within , consistent with being a bound companion. A recent age estimate for TW PsA () agrees very well with the isochronal age for Fomalhaut (), further arguing for the two stars forming a physical binary.

The designation TW Piscis Austrini is astronomical nomenclature for a variable star. Fomalhaut B is a flare star of the type known as a BY Draconis variable. It varies slightly in apparent magnitude, ranging from 6.44 to 6.49 over a 10.3 day period. While smaller than the Sun, it is relatively large for a flare star. Most flare stars are red M-type dwarfs.

In 2019, a team of researchers analyzing the astrometry, radial velocity measurements, and images of Fomalhaut B suggested the existence of a planet orbiting the star with a mass of Jupiter masses, and a poorly defined orbital period with an estimate loosely centering around 25 years.

==Fomalhaut C (LP 876-10)==

LP 876-10 is also associated with the Fomalhaut system, making it a trinary star. In October 2013, Eric Mamajek and collaborators from the RECONS consortium announced that the previously known high-proper-motion star LP 876-10 had a distance, velocity, and color-magnitude position consistent with being another member of the Fomalhaut system. LP 876-10 was originally catalogued as a high-proper-motion star by Willem Luyten in his 1979 NLTT catalogue; however, a precise trigonometric parallax and radial velocity was only measured quite recently. LP 876-10 is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V, and located even farther from Fomalhaut A than TW PsA—about 5.7° away from Fomalhaut A in the sky, in the neighbouring constellation Aquarius, whereas both Fomalhaut A and TW PsA are located in constellation Piscis Austrinus. Its current separation from Fomalhaut A is about , and it is currently located away from TW PsA (Fomalhaut B). LP 876-10 is located well within the tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system, which is . Although LP 876-10 is itself catalogued as a binary star in the Washington Double Star Catalog (called &quot;WSI 138&quot;), there was no sign of a close-in stellar companion in the imaging, spectral, or astrometric data in the Mamajek et al. study. In December 2013, Kennedy et al. reported the discovery of a cold dusty debris disk associated with Fomalhaut C, using infrared images from the Herschel Space Observatory. Multiple-star systems hosting multiple debris disks are exceedingly rare.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
Fomalhaut has had various names ascribed to it through time, and has been recognized by many cultures of the northern hemisphere, including the Arabs, Persians, and Chinese. It marked the solstice in 2500 BC. It was also a marker for the worship of Demeter in Eleusis.
* It is considered to be one of the four &quot;royal stars&quot; of the Persians.
* The Latin names are &quot;&quot; &quot;the mouth of the Southern Fish&quot;.
* A folk name among the early Arabs was &quot;Difdi&#x27; al Awwal&quot; ( &quot;&quot;) &quot;the first frog&quot; (the second frog is Beta Ceti).
* The Chinese name (Mandarin: Běiluòshīmén), meaning &quot;North Gate of the Military Camp&quot;, because this star is marking itself and stands alone in &quot;North Gate of the Military Camp&quot; asterism, Encampment mansion (see: Chinese constellations). (Běiluòshīmén), westernized into &quot;Pi Lo Sze Mun&quot; by R.H. Allen.
* To the Moporr Aboriginal people of South Australia, it is a male being called &quot;Buunjill&quot;. The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory called Fomalhaut &quot;Menggen&quot; —white cockatoo.

Fomalhaut-Earthwork B, in Mounds State Park near Anderson, Indiana, lines up with the rising of the star Fomalhaut in the fall months, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. In 1980, astronomer Jack Robinson proposed that the rising azimuth of Fomalhaut was marked by cairn placements at both the Bighorn medicine wheel in Wyoming, USA, and the Moose Mountain medicine wheel in Saskatchewan, Canada.

&quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine termed it the &quot;Great Eye of Sauron&quot;, comparing its shape and debris ring to the aforementioned &quot;eye&quot; in the Peter Jackson &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films.

USS &quot;Fomalhaut&quot; (AK-22) was a United States navy amphibious cargo ship.

<text>Coney Island is a neighborhood and entertainment area in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is bounded by Brighton Beach to its east, Lower New York Bay to the south and west, and Gravesend to the north and includes the subsection of Sea Gate on its west. More broadly, the Coney Island peninsula consists of Coney Island proper, Brighton Beach, and Manhattan Beach. This was formerly the westernmost of the Outer Barrier islands on the southern shore of Long Island, but in the early 20th century it became connected to the rest of Long Island by land fill.

The origin of Coney Island&#x27;s name is disputed, but the area was originally part of the colonial town of Gravesend. By the mid-19th century it had become a seaside resort, and by the late 19th century, amusement parks had also been built at the location. The attractions reached a historical peak during the first half of the 20th century. However, they declined in popularity after World War II and, following years of neglect, several structures were torn down. Various redevelopment projects were proposed for Coney Island in the 1970s through the 2000s, though most of these were not carried out. The area was revitalized with the opening of the venue now known as Maimonides Park in 2001 and several amusement rides starting in the 2010s.

Coney Island had around 32,000 residents as of the 2020 United States Census. The neighborhood is ethnically diverse, and the neighborhood&#x27;s poverty rate of 27% is slightly higher than that of the city as a whole.

Coney Island is part of Brooklyn Community District 13, and its primary ZIP Code is 11224. It is patrolled by the 60th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine 245/Ladder 161/Battalion 43 and Engine 318/Ladder 166. Politically, Coney Island is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 47th District. The area is well served by the New York City Subway and local bus routes, and contains several public elementary and middle schools.

== Geography and climate ==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; considers the area west of Ocean Parkway (including Sea Gate and Nortons Point Light) to be part of the Coney Island neighborhood. The neighborhood is situated on the western portion of the Coney Island peninsula, located on the western end of Long Island lying to the west of the Outer Barrier islands along Long Island&#x27;s southern shore. The peninsula is about long and wide. It extends into Lower New York Bay with Sheepshead Bay to its northeast, Gravesend Bay and Coney Island Creek to its northwest, and the main part of Brooklyn to its north. At its highest it is above sea level. Coney Island was formerly an actual island, separated from greater Brooklyn by Coney Island Creek, and was the westernmost of the Outer Barrier islands. A large section of the creek was filled in the 1920s and 1930s, turning the island into a peninsula.

The perimeter of Coney Island features manmade structures designed to maintain its current shape. The beaches are currently not a natural feature; the sand that is naturally supposed to replenish Coney Island is cut off by the jetty at Breezy Point, Queens. Sand has been redeposited on the beaches via beach nourishment since the construction of Riegelmann Boardwalk in 1922–1923, and is held in place by around two dozen groynes. A large sand-replenishing project along Coney Island and Brighton Beach took place in the 1990s. Sheepshead Bay at the peninsula&#x27;s northeast corner is, for the most part, enclosed in bulkheads. Two major parks, Kaiser Park and Coney Island Creek Park, are located on the northwest side of the peninsula along Coney Island Creek. A 2023 study found that Coney Island was sinking at a rate of about per year, making it among the fastest-sinking locations in New York City; this is mainly because parts of the neighborhood were created by land reclamation.

Coney Island has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and the hardiness zone is 7b.

== Name ==
The original Native American inhabitants of the region, the Lenape, called this area , possibly meaning &quot;land without shadows&quot; or &quot;always in light&quot; in reference to its sunlit south-facing beaches. A second possible meaning is &quot;point&quot; or &quot;corner of land&quot;. The &quot;island&quot; was originally several smaller historical islands, each being given a name by Dutch settlers, with the westernmost sand spit or point being given named &quot;Conyne Eylandt&quot; in early-17th-century Dutch maps, starting with the 1639 Manatus Map.

There is no clear historical consensus on how the island got the name &quot;Coney Island&quot;, in regular use in the first half of the 19th century with the advent of regular ferry service to the island, but several theories have been put forward. One possible etymology is from a Native American tribe, the Konoh or Konoi (the &quot;Bear Band&quot;), who once inhabited the island. A second theory suggests that it was distortion of the name of Henry Hudson&#x27;s second mate on the &quot;Halve Maen&quot;, John Colman, who was slain by natives on the 1609 expedition. A third posits that late 18th century Irish captain Peter O&#x27;Connor named it after Coney Island in County Sligo, Ireland, which has a rabbit population. In Irish &#x27;coinín&#x27; (kun een) is the word used for a rabbit. Yet other theories suggest a Dutch etymology: one theory holds that the name had come from Conyn, the surname of a family of Dutch settlers who lived there, and another suggests that it came from the Dutch word for rabbit, &quot;konijn&quot;, derived from a purported large population of wild rabbits on the island&quot;.

There is little evidence for each origin theory, and there are conflicts between the pieces of evidence that do exist. The most popular idea is the translation of the Dutch word for &quot;rabbit&quot; into the English word &quot;&quot;, but that has its detractors and counter explanations. In 1816 politician and U.S. Founding Father Egbert Benson presented a treatise on New York place names and said it was &quot;Conyn&#x27;s Island&quot;, after the Dutch surname, and noted &quot;there are already symptoms of the beginning of a tradition that it once abounded in Rabbits&quot;. Other historians claim that rabbits were introduced to the island only after it was settled. The 19th century also saw the heavily Irish New York Tammany Hall political machine controlling development of the island, and they may have gotten the name from the island in County Sligo rather than any tale of a rabbit population.

== History ==
=== Early settlement ===
Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European explorer to sight the island of Narrioch during his expeditions to the area in 1527 and 1529. He was subsequently followed by Henry Hudson. Anthony Janszoon van Salee was the first New Netherland settler to acquire land adjacent to Coney Island, in 1639. The Native American population in the area dwindled as the Dutch settlement grew and the entire southern tier of present-day Brooklyn, from Gowanus Creek to Coney Island to Gerritsen Creek, was purchased in 1645 from the Native Americans in exchange for goods. The goods were not recorded in the deed, but later accounts mention a gun, a blanket, and a kettle.

In 1644, a colonist named Guysbert Op Dyck was given a land patent for 88 acres of land in what became the town of Gravesend, on the southwestern shore of Brooklyn. The land patent included Conyne Island, an island just off the southwestern shore of the town of Gravesend, as well as Conyne Hook, a peninsula just east of the island. Both became part of Gravesend when its first town charter was granted a year later, in 1645. East of Conyne Hook was the largest section of island called Gysbert&#x27;s, Guysbert&#x27;s, or Guisbert&#x27;s Island (also called Johnson Island), containing most of the arable land and extending east through today&#x27;s Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach. This was officially the first official real estate transaction for the island.
Op Dyck never occupied his land, and in 1661 he sold it off to Dick De Wolf. The land&#x27;s new owner banned Gravesend residents from using Guisbert&#x27;s Island and built a salt-works on the land, provoking outrage among Gravesend livestock herders. New Amsterdam was transferred to the English in 1664, and four years later, the English Governor created a new charter for Gravesend that excluded Coney Island. Subsequently, Guisbert&#x27;s Island was divided into plots meted out to several dozen settlers. However, in 1685, the island became part of Gravesend again as a result of a new charter with the Native Americans.

At the time of European settlement, the land that makes up the present-day Coney Island was divided across several separate islands. All of these islands were part of the outer barrier on the southern shore of Long Island, and their land areas and boundaries changed frequently. Only the westernmost island was called Coney Island; it currently makes up part of Sea Gate. At the time, it was a 1.25-mile shifting sandspit with a detached island at its western end extending into Lower New York Bay. In a 1679–1680 journal, Jasper Danckaerts and Peter Sluyter noted that &quot;Conijnen Eylandt&quot; was fully separated from the rest of Brooklyn. The explorers observed that &quot;Nobody lives upon it, but it is used in winter for keeping cattle, horses, oxen, hogs and others.&quot;

By the early 18th century, the town of Gravesend was periodically granting seven-year-long leases to freeholders, who would then have the exclusive use of Coney Hook and Coney Island. In 1734, a road to Coney Hook was laid out. Thomas Stillwell, a prominent Gravesend resident who was the freeholder for Coney Island and Coney Hook at the time, proposed to build a ditch through Coney Hook so it would be easier for his cattle to graze. He convinced several friends in the nearby town of Jamaica to help him in this effort, telling them that the creation of such a ditch would allow them to ship goods from Jamaica Bay to New York Harbor without having to venture out into the ocean. In 1750, the &quot;Jamaica Ditch&quot; was dug through Coney Hook from Brown&#x27;s Creek in the west to Hubbard&#x27;s Creek in the east. The creation of the canal turned Coney Hook into a detached island called Pine Island, so named due to the woods on it.

Each island was separated by an inlet that could only be crossed at low tide. By the end of the 18th century, the ongoing shifting of sand along the barrier islands had closed up the inlets to the point that residents began filling them in and joining them as one island. Development of Coney Island was slow until the 19th century due to land disputes, the American Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. Coney Island was so remote that Herman Melville wrote &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; on the island in 1849, and Henry Clay and Daniel Webster discussed the Missouri Compromise at the island the next year.

=== Resort development ===

In 1824, the Gravesend and Coney Island Road and Bridge Company built the first bridge across Jamaica Ditch (by now known as Coney Island Creek), connecting the island with the mainland. The company also built a shell road across the island to the beaches. In 1829, the company also built the first hotel on the island: the Coney Island House, near present-day Sea Gate.

Due to Coney Island&#x27;s proximity to Manhattan and other boroughs, and its simultaneous relative distance from the city of Brooklyn to provide the illusion of a proper vacation, it began attracting vacationers in the 1830s and 1840s, assisted by carriage roads and steamship service that reduced travel time from a formerly half-day journey to two hours. Most of the vacationers were wealthy and went by carriage. Inventor Samuel Colt built an observation tower on the peninsula in 1845, but he abandoned the project soon after. In 1847, the middle class started going to Coney Island upon the introduction of a ferry line to Norton&#x27;s Point—named during the mid-1870s after hotel owner Michael Norton—at the western portion of the peninsula. Gang activity started as well, with one 1870s writer noting that going to Coney Island could result in losing money and even lives. The Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad became the first railroad to reach Coney Island when it opened in 1864, and it was completed in 1867. Over the next 13 years, four more railroads were built specifically to transport visitors to Coney Island; this was part of a larger national trend toward trolley park development.

In 1868, William A. Engeman built a resort in the area. The resort was given the name &quot;Brighton Beach&quot; in 1878 by Henry C. Murphy and a group of businessmen, who chose the name as an allusion to the English resort city of Brighton. With the help of Gravesend&#x27;s surveyor William Stillwell, Engeman acquired all 39 lots for the relatively low cost of $20,000. This hotel, with rooms for up to 5,000 people nightly and meals for up to 20,000 people daily, was close to the then-rundown western Coney Island, so it was mostly the upper middle class that went to this hotel. The , double-decker Brighton Beach Bathing Pavilion was also built nearby and opened in 1878, with the capacity for 1,200 bathers. Hotel Brighton, also known as the Brighton Beach Hotel, was situated on the beach at what is now the foot of Coney Island Avenue. The Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway, the predecessor to the New York City Subway&#x27;s present-day Brighton Line, opened on July 2, 1878, and provided access to the hotel.

Simultaneously, wealthy banker Austin Corbin was developing adjacent Manhattan Beach after being interested in the area during a trip to the beach to heal his sick son. Corbin, who worked on Wall Street and had many railroad investments, built the New York and Manhattan Beach Railway for his two luxury shoreline hotels. These hotels were used by the wealthy upper class, who would not go to Brighton Beach because of its proximity to Coney Island. The 150-room Manhattan Beach Hotel—which was designed by J. Pickering Putnam and contained restaurants, ballrooms, and shops—was opened for business in July 1877 at a ceremony presided over by President Ulysses S. Grant. The similarly prodigal Oriental Hotel, which hosted rooms for wealthy families staying for extended periods, was opened in August 1880.

Andrew R. Culver, president of the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad, had built the Culver Line steam railway to West Brighton in 1875, before Corbin and Engeman had even built their railroads. For 35 cents, one could ride the Prospect Park &amp; Coney Island Railroad to the Culver Depot terminal at Surf Avenue. Across the street from the terminal, the Iron Tower (also known as the Centennial Observatory), bought from the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, provided patrons with a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the coast. The nearby &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; similarly used mirrors and lens to provide a panoramic view of the area. Coney Island became a major resort destination after the Civil War as excursion railroads and the Coney Island &amp; Brooklyn Railroad streetcar line reached the area in the 1860s and 1870s, followed by the Iron Steamboat Company ferry to Manhattan in 1881.

The 150-suite Cable Hotel was built nearby in 1875. Next to it, on a piece of land leased by James Voorhies, maitre d&#x27; Paul Bauer built the western peninsula&#x27;s largest hotel, which opened in 1876. By the turn of the century, Victorian hotels, private bathhouses, and vaudeville theaters were a common sight on Coney Island. The three resort areas—Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach and West Brighton—competed with each other for clientele. By the early 1900s, West Brighton had gradually become the most popular destination, and as such, became associated with the lively amusement area of Coney Island.

In the 1890s, Norton&#x27;s Point on the western side of Coney Island was developed into Sea Gate, a gated summer community that catered mainly to the wealthy. A private yacht carried visitors directly from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan Island. Notable tenants within the community included the Atlantic Yacht Club, which built a colonial style house along the waterfront.

=== Amusement park era ===

Between about 1880 and World War II, Coney Island was the largest amusement area in the United States, attracting several million visitors per year. Its development as an amusement area was concurrent with the erection of urban amusement parks elsewhere in the United States, which changed amusement from a passive to an active concept. Of these amusement areas, Coney Island was the largest. At its height, it contained three competing major amusement parks—Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park—as well as many independent amusements. The area was also the center of new technological events and innovations including electric lights, roller coasters, and baby incubators. By the first decade of the 20th century, Coney Island was seen as a top getaway and &quot;a symbol of Americans&#x27; increasing pride&quot;.

==== 19th century ====
By the late 1870s, Coney Island&#x27;s hotels had drawn people from many different social classes, and attractions were being built. When the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company electrified the steam railroads and connected Brooklyn to Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge at the beginning of the 20th century, Coney Island turned rapidly from a resort to an accessible location for day-trippers seeking to escape the summer heat in New York City&#x27;s tenements. Charles I. D. Looff, a Danish woodcarver, built the first carousel and amusement ride at Coney Island in 1876, at Lucy Vandeveer&#x27;s bath-house complex at West 6th Street and Surf Avenue. Looff personally hand-carved the designs into the carousel. Looff subsequently commissioned another carousel at Feltman&#x27;s Ocean Pavilion in 1880. Another early attraction was the Seaside Aquarium, which operated from 1877 to 1887 and included aquatic exhibits, aviaries, zoo attractions, and various sideshows. The earliest rides, including Looff&#x27;s first carousel and the Seaside Aquarium, were located at the Centennial Observatory&#x27;s site. The first sideshows and fireworks displays came to Coney Island in 1883, and combined with constant musical performances, brought increased excitement to the area.

The very first roller coaster at Coney Island was the Switchback Railway, a gravity coaster installed by LaMarcus Adna Thompson at West 10th Street in 1884. Nearby was the Elephantine Colossus, a seven-story building (including a brothel) in the shape of an elephant, which opened the following year. Until its demolition in 1896, the elephant was the first sight to greet immigrants arriving in New York, who would see it before they saw the Statue of Liberty. Next to be developed were horse-racing tracks, and by 1890, Coney Island had three tracks: Sheepshead Bay Race Track, Brighton Beach Race Course, and Gravesend Race Track. Julian Ralph described Coney Island in 1896 as &quot;the first made-to-order resort in America&quot;, with many businesses having &quot;leaped from nothing into full fledged perfection&quot;. However, crime and corruption in Coney Island were prevalent. The main leader of this corruption was John Y. McKane, who ran prizefighting rings behind the elephant until he was arrested and sentenced in 1894.

The development of amusement rides in Coney Island intensified in the 1890s with the opening of amusement parks. The first such park was Sea Lion Park, which operated from 1895 to 1902 and was the first amusement park to charge entry fees. Sea Lion Park&#x27;s opening spurred the construction of George C. Tilyou&#x27;s Steeplechase Park, which opened in 1897. The Coney Island &quot;Funny Face&quot; logo, which is still extant, dates to the early days of Steeplechase Park.

==== Early 20th century ====

The first decade of the 20th century saw two more large amusement parks. Luna Park opened in 1903 on the site of Sea Lion Park, which had closed the previous year. The park contained a variety of attractions and exotic landscaping, lit by electricity at night; its flagship ride was A Trip to the Moon, an attraction based on Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. The following year saw the opening of Dreamland, which reproduced many attractions at Luna Park, but at a grander scale, with a large central tower and lagoon, a sunken plaza, and one million electric lights. Additionally, the City of New York made efforts to condemn all buildings and piers built south of Surf Avenue in an effort to reclaim the beach and create a boardwalk, though the local amusement community opposed the move. Eventually, the city government and the community reached an agreement mandating that the beach did not begin until south of Surf Avenue and that the territory would be marked by a city-owned boardwalk. In return, the city would demolish any structures built upon public streets to reclaim beach access.

The original resorts lost patronage after horse racing in New York state was outlawed in 1909, but the amusement areas still saw significant patronage. In 1915, the Sea Beach Line was upgraded to a subway line, followed by the other former excursion roads, and the opening of the Stillwell Avenue station in 1919 ushered in Coney Island&#x27;s busiest era. On the busiest summer days, over a million people would travel to Coney Island. This created tensions between longtime New York City residents and more recent immigrants who liked to patronize Coney Island. One of the entrepreneurs who took advantage of the increased visitor counts was Nathan Handwerker, who in 1916 started selling hot dogs at Coney Island for a nickel each, and eventually expanded his enterprise into the Nathan&#x27;s Famous hot dog chain.

Coney Island&#x27;s development as an amusement area continued through the end of World War II. The opening of the Wonder Wheel in 1920; the Riegelmann Boardwalk in 1923; the Shore Theater in 1925; several roller coasters in the 1920s including the Tornado, Thunderbolt, and Coney Island Cyclone; and the Parachute Jump in 1941 contributed to the area&#x27;s quality as an amusement destination. In particular, the Riegelmann Boardwalk enabled the crowds to be dispersed away from Surf Avenue, the main west–east avenue in the area. Despite staff shortages during World War II, Coney Island retained its popularity and was frequented by military personnel.

The era was also marked by frequent fires, and those at the beginning of the 20th century were particularly destructive. A 1907 fire at Steeplechase Park resulted in the park having to be completely rebuilt. Dreamland burned down in 1911 and was never rebuilt. One of the largest conflagrations at Coney Island, which occurred in 1932, left at least a thousand people homeless.

The early 20th century additionally saw the infilling of a portion of the Coney Island Creek, thereby connecting Coney Island to the rest of Brooklyn. In the previous decades, there had been plans to dredge and straighten the creek as a ship canal, which were later abandoned. By 1924, local landowners and the city had filled a portion of the creek. A major section of the creek was further filled in to allow construction of the Belt Parkway in the 1930s, and the western and eastern ends of the island became peninsulas. More fill was added in 1962 during the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

=== Residential development and decline ===
==== Robert Moses era ====

In 1937, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses published a report about the possible redevelopment of Coney Island, which would have entailed the addition of parking lots and reconstruction of part of the boardwalk. The city purchased a strip of land along the shoreline, which would allow the boardwalk to be moved inland. At this point, Coney Island was so crowded on summer weekends that, according to Moses, a coffin would provide more space per person. Though ride construction was delayed due to material shortages caused by the onset of World War II, two new rides were constructed in 1946 at the end of the war.

In August 1944, Luna Park was destroyed by a fire. Two years later, it was closed permanently and sold to a company who wanted to tear down the park&#x27;s remnants and build Quonset huts for military veterans and their families. Moses asked the city to transfer Luna Park&#x27;s land along the Coney Island waterfront to the Parks Department, a request that was granted in 1949. Moses then had the land rezoned for residential use, with plans to demolish &quot;about a third&quot; of attractions along Surf Avenue, one block north of the beach, and replace these with housing. Moses moved the boardwalk back from the beach several yards, demolishing many structures, including the city&#x27;s municipal bath house, as well as several blocks of amusements. He claimed that fewer amusement-seekers were going to Coney Island every year, because they preferred places where they could bathe outdoors, such as Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, rather than the &quot;mechanical gadget&quot; attractions of Coney Island. Moses also announced that the Steeplechase Pier would be closed for a year so it could be renovated.

In 1953, Moses proposed that most of the peninsula be rezoned for various uses, claiming that it would be an &quot;upgrade&quot; over the various business and unrestricted zones that existed at the time. Steeplechase Park would be allowed to remain open, but much of the shorefront amusements and concessions would be replaced by residential developments. After many complaints from the public and from concession operators, the Estimate Board reinstated the area between West 22nd and West Eighth Streets as an amusement-only zone, with the zone extending inland from the shoreline. Moses&#x27;s subsequent proposal to extend the Coney Island boardwalk east to Manhattan Beach was denied in 1955. A proposal to make the Quonset hut development into a permanent housing structure was also rejected.

A new building for the New York Aquarium was approved for construction in the neighborhood in 1953. Construction started on the aquarium in 1954. The development of the new New York Aquarium was expected to revitalize Coney Island. By 1955, the area still included four children&#x27;s amusement areas, five roller coasters, several flat and dark rides, and various other attractions such as the Wonder Wheel. The New York Aquarium&#x27;s new site opened in June 1957. At this point, there were still several dozen rides in Coney Island.

==== Fred Trump era ====
During the summers of 1964 and 1965, there was a large decrease in the number of visitors to Coney Island because of the 1964/1965 World&#x27;s Fair at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens. Crime increases, insufficient parking facilities, bad weather, and the post-World War II automotive boom were also cited as contributing factors in the visitor decrease. During the summer of 1964, concessionaires saw their lowest profits in a quarter-century. Ride operators reported that they had 30% to 90% fewer visitors in 1964 compared to the previous year.

A small amusement park called Astroland was announced for the boardwalk in 1962, to open the following year. Steeplechase Park, the last remaining large amusement park in Coney Island, closed permanently after the 1964 season. The surrounding blocks were filled with amusement rides and concessions that were closed or about to close. The rides at Steeplechase Park were auctioned off, and the property was sold to developer Fred Trump, who in 1965 announced that he wanted to build luxury apartments on the old Steeplechase property. At the time, residential developments in Coney Island in general were being built at a rapid rate. The peninsula, which had 34,000 residents in 1961, was expected to have more than double that number by the end of 1964. Many of the new residents moved into middle-income co-operative housing developments such as Trump Village, Warbasse Houses, and Luna Park Apartments; these replaced what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a rundown sprawl of rickety houses&quot;. Developers were spending millions of dollars on new housing developments, and by 1966, the peninsula housed almost 100,000 people.

During 1966, developers tried to revitalize the Coney Island boardwalk as an amusement area. Trump destroyed Steeplechase Park&#x27;s Pavilion of Fun during a highly publicized ceremony that September. In its stead, Trump proposed building a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center, a plan supported by Brooklyn borough president Abe Stark. The next month, the city announced its plans to acquire the of the former Steeplechase Park, a move that many residents supported but that Trump considered to be &quot;wasteful&quot;. In January 1968, New York City parks commissioner August Heckscher II proposed that the New York state government build an &quot;open-space&quot; state park on the Steeplechase site, and that May, the New York City Board of Estimate voted in favor of funding to buy the land from Trump. Condemnation of the site started in 1969. The city ultimately purchased the proposed park&#x27;s site for $4 million, with a stipulation blocking Trump from developing the site as apartments.

Trump filed a series of court cases related to the proposed residential rezoning, and ultimately won a $1.3 million judgment. The Steeplechase Park site lay empty for several years. Trump started subleasing the property to Norman Kaufman, who ran a small collection of fairground amusements called &quot;Steeplechase Park&quot; on part of the site. The city also leased the boardwalk and parking lot sites at extremely low rates, which resulted in a $1 million loss of revenue over the following seven years. Since the city wanted to build the state park on the site of Kaufman&#x27;s Steeplechase Park, it attempted to evict him by refusing to grant a lease extension.

==== Late-1970s attempts at restoration ====

The 1970s brought along further renewal plans, such as proposals to construct public housing, though the community was beset by social issues such as high crime and a drug epidemic. By 1975, the city was considering demolishing the Coney Island Cyclone in favor of an extension of the adjacent New York Aquarium. The proposed demolition was controversial, and after a refurbishment by Astroland, the Cyclone reopened for the summer 1975 season. The abandoned Parachute Jump was left in situ, and the New York City Board of Estimate planned to tear down the structure. In the meanwhile, Coney Island was still affected by a perception of crime and deterioration of old rides, but by the mid-1970s, middle-class families started returning to Coney Island following the implementation of a unified admission ticket to Coney Island&#x27;s amusement areas.

The city continued to pursue litigation over the site occupied by Norman Kaufman, but for over a decade, was unsuccessful. It had no plan for the proposed state park, and in 1975 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development nearly withdrew a proposed grant of $2 million to fund the proposed park. The city ultimately accepted the grant, though different city agencies still disagreed over whether to return the funds. Kaufman continued to operate the site until the end of summer 1980. The following June, the city paid Kaufman a million dollars for the rides, effectively evicting him, even though the amusements were estimated to be worth much less.

In 1979, the state announced that it would be conducting a report on the feasibility of legalizing gambling in New York State. Mayor Ed Koch proposed that the state open casinos in New York City to revitalize the area&#x27;s economy. Residents and politicians supported the idea of building casinos at Coney Island, which they felt would alleviate its poverty, crime, and property vacancy rates. However, there was substantial controversy over the plans to place a gambling site in Coney Island. The state&#x27;s interest in legalizing gambling had subsided by 1981, and the New York state legislature failed to take action on such proposal.

In an effort to reduce crime, the city also began demolishing abandoned bungalows in Coney Island. By 1982, the area was filled with vacant lots, though several residential developments were being planned for Coney Island. Having finally acquired Kaufman&#x27;s rides, the New York City government began advertising for developers to redevelop the former amusement park area that November. The Mermaid-Neptune Development Corporation constructed three residential developments at the neighborhood&#x27;s western edge, with a combined total of 430 units. These developments were completed through the mid-1980s. Even so, the area still suffered from drug-related killings and other crimes, especially west of West 20th Street. Former amusement structures such as the Parachute Jump lay unused, and prostitutes roamed around the neighborhood at night. Through the 1980s, prostitution and drug use in Coney Island increased, as did the area&#x27;s murder and felony crime rate. By the late 1980s, deadly shootings were common, particularly in the low-income housing developments inside Coney Island. Commercial activity also decreased, and by 1990, storefronts on Mermaid Avenue had decreased by 90%, from over 400 stores before the urban renewal to 39 stores afterward.

=== Revival ===
==== Bullard deal, Sportsplex, and KeySpan Park ====

In the mid-1980s, restaurant mogul Horace Bullard proposed rebuilding Steeplechase Park. On the site bounded by West 15th and 19th Streets between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk, Bullard wanted to build a $55 million amusement park based on the originals. The city agreed, and the project was approved in 1985. Bullard planned to open the park by mid-1986 to coincide with the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s centennial. However, the project was delayed while the New York City Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. By early 1987, the cost of the amusement park nearly doubled, to $100 million.

Concurrently, in December 1986, the New York State Urban Development Corporation formally proposed a 17,000-seat minor-league baseball stadium north of the boardwalk between West 19th and West 22nd Streets as well as 15,000-seat indoor arena north of the Abe Stark Rink. Negotiations were ongoing with the Mets and Yankees to ensure their support for the minor-league stadium. State senator Thomas Bartosiewicz attempted to block Bullard&#x27;s plan, as he was part of a foundation that had promised another developer, Sportsplex, the right to build an amateur sports arena on the site. Construction was held up for another four years, and by 1989, Bullard and the city were ready to sign a contract that would allow the developer to construct a 60-ride amusement park on a waterfront strip, which would be completed by 2002. Other proposals for the area included a $7.9 million restoration of the boardwalk, as well as a new high-school and college sports stadium.

Some of Coney Island&#x27;s iconic rides were designated as official city landmarks during the late 1980s. In 1988, the Cyclone roller coaster was made a New York City designated landmark. This was followed by the Parachute Jump and the Wonder Wheel in 1989. The neighborhood&#x27;s high crime rate had reversed slightly by the 1990s. However, Coney Island&#x27;s relative isolation from the rest of New York City, along with its ethnic diversity, deprived the area of significant political power, and to a greater extent money.

After Rudy Giuliani took office as New York City mayor in 1994, he negated the Bullard deal by approving the construction of a minor-league baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. Giuliani had wanted to build Sportsplex in order to improve sports facilities in the area, and to create a professional baseball team in Brooklyn. By the late 1990s, some $67 million had been secured for the development of Sportsplex. In 1997, developer Bruce Ratner proposed constructing a $100 million entertainment complex between West 9th and West 15th Streets, with a &quot;virtual-reality amusement park&quot; as well as a movie theater multiplex. Concurrently, a four-phase, 873-unit housing development in Coney Island was completed in 1996.

In 1998, Giuliani canceled Sportsplex and the entertainment complex, and instead unveiled another plan where only the parking lot would be built. The Sports Foundation had prepared another proposal that would allow a scaled-down Sportsplex to be built next to the minor-league baseball stadium. The minor league team was called the Brooklyn Cyclones, though naming rights to the stadium were sold to Keyspan Energy. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park, but it was demolished instead. In 2000, the city approved the $31 million project to construct Keyspan Park using the funds from the canceled Sportsplex, and the minor-league baseball stadium opened the following year. Other major projects at the time included the reconstruction of Coney Island&#x27;s sewers and the refurbishment of the Stillwell Avenue subway station, the latter of which was completed in 2005.

==== Thor Equities ownership and rezoning proposals ====
In 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg took an interest in revitalizing Coney Island as a possible site for the New York City bid of the 2012 Summer Olympics. A plan was developed by the Astella Development Corporation. When the city lost the Olympic bid, the plans were passed to the Coney Island Development Corporation (CIDC), which made modified plans. Shortly before the CIDC&#x27;s plans were to be publicly released, a development company named Thor Equities purchased all of Bullard&#x27;s western property for $13 million, later selling the property to Taconic Investment Partners for over $90 million. Taconic now had , on which it planned to build 2,000 apartment units. Thor then went about using much of its $77 million profit to purchase property on Stillwell Avenue for well over market value, and offered to buy out every piece of property inside the traditional amusement area.

In September 2005, Thor&#x27;s founder, Joe Sitt, unveiled his new plans for a large Bellagio-style hotel resort with a timeshare development, surrounded by rides and amusements. The CIDC report suggested adding year-round commercial and amusement area, and recommended that property north of Surf Avenue and west of Abe Stark Rink could be rezoned for other uses, including residential. Sitt, a resident of the area, spent more than $100 million to buy land in Coney Island. Astroland owner Carol Hill Albert, whose husband&#x27;s family had owned the park since its 1962 opening, sold the site to Thor in November 2006. Two months later, Thor released renderings for a $1.5 billion amusement park, entertainment complex, and indoor water park called Coney Island Park.

In 2007, the DCP started circulating a rezoning plan that would cover of Coney Island. The city would spend $120 million to redevelop into an amusement park surrounded by around 5,000 new housing units. The Aquarium was also planning a renovation in conjunction with the rezoning. The city&#x27;s and Sitt&#x27;s proposals directly conflicted: Sitt wanted to build housing inside the amusement park, while the city&#x27;s rezoning would create a special amusement district where residential development was forbidden. In April 2008, because of objections from land owners, residents, and developers, the city revised its rezoning proposal. Only 9 acres would be used as an amusement park, while private owners and developers could build on the rest of the land as long as they followed the DCP&#x27;s general master plan. While the city negotiated with Thor, Sitt evicted several amusement operators on his land, including Astroland, in the expectation that he would soon be able to redevelop it.
The DCP certified the rezoning plan in January 2009, which allowed the city to create a amusement district. At the time, Thor Equities said it hoped to complete the project by 2011. In June 2009, the city&#x27;s planning commission approved the construction of 4,500 units of housing, including 900 affordable units, and promised to preserve affordable housing already in the neighborhood. Subsequently, the city government paid Sitt $95.6 million for of land. The nonprofit civic group Municipal Art Society wanted the city-operated park to be larger, though the city was reluctant to spend so much money.

==== Progress on expansion ====
The Zipper and Spider on West 12th Street were closed permanently and dismantled in 2006. The next year, plans to restore Coney Island&#x27;s historic B&amp;B Carousell were revealed. After Astroland closed in 2008, it was replaced by a new Dreamland in 2009 and by a new Luna Park in 2010. In April 2011, the first new roller coasters to be built at Coney Island in eighty years were opened as part of efforts to reverse the decline of the amusement area. The B&amp;B Carousell reopened in 2013 at Luna Park. The Thunderbolt steel roller coaster, named after the original wooden coaster on the site, was opened in June 2014. Furthermore, a live performance venue, the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island, opened on the boardwalk in 2016.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused major damage to the Coney Island amusement parks, the Aquarium, and businesses. Despite this, the Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest was held the following summer, as usual. Luna Park at Coney Island reopened as scheduled on March 24, 2013. Rebuilding of the aquarium started in early 2013, and a major expansion of the aquarium opened in 2018. That August, the NYCEDC and NYC Parks announced that Luna Park would be expanded between West 15th and West 16th Streets, next to the Thunderbolt. There would be 3 public plazas and an amusement arcade within the newly expanded amusement area. The same month, it was also announced that a 50-room boutique hotel was being planned for Coney Island within the former Shore Theater on Surf and Stillwell Avenues. The city also expressed its intent to demolish the Abe Stark Rink and redevelop the site, as per the 2009 rezoning, though residents wanted NYC Parks to retain control over the site rather than sell it off to a private developer. 

Many of these construction projects were placed on hold in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. That year, the businesses and amusement parks at Coney Island either operated in a sharply reduced capacity or did not open at all. The parks reopened for the 2021 season, and Luna Park&#x27;s expansion commenced in October 2021. The addition of new amusements coincided with the development of over 2,000 new residential units on empty lots through the early 2020s. These included a 1,000-unit mega-development and a three-tower, 499-unit mixed-use complex. The new housing units were built despite the fact that the neighborhood was among the areas in New York City that were most vulnerable to flooding due to increases in sea levels. 

==== The Coney casino proposal ====

In November 2022, Sitt proposed constructing a casino at Coney Island to attract tourists. This proposal followed an announcement by New York state officials in April 2022 that they would issue three casino licenses in Downstate New York. Although the nearby Brooklyn Community Board 11 voted in early 2024 to allow Coney Island to be rezoned for casino use, some residents opposed the planned casino, which would be known as the Coney. Thor Equities, Legends Hospitality, Saratoga Casino Holdings, and the Chickasaw Nation would be the developers. If the Coney were built, the structure would include a 32-story hotel with 500 rooms, of convention space, of retail and dining space, and a 2,500-seat concert venue.

=== Oral history archive ===
In 2004, the Coney Island History Project began collecting stories of Coney Island from longtime residents. The CIHP records, archives, and shares oral history interviews about Coney Island. The organizations conducts interviews in English, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CIHP continued to record interviews via phone or Skype. over 370 interviews were available online via the Coney Island History Project Oral History Archive.

== Amusement parks and attractions ==

Coney Island has two amusement parks, Luna Park and Deno&#x27;s Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, as well as several rides that are not incorporated into either amusement park. These are owned and managed by several different companies and operate independently of each other. Coney Island also has several other visitor attractions such as skeeball and ball tossing, as well as a sideshow, that contains shooting, throwing, and tossing skills. The area hosts renowned events as well. Coney Island&#x27;s amusement area is one of a few in the United States that is not mostly owned by any one entity.

=== Rides ===
==== Current rides ====

Coney Island contains three rides with landmark status. One is a New York City designated landmark, another is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and a third is both a city landmark and a NRHP-listed landmark.

The Wonder Wheel, opened in 1920, is a steel Ferris wheel with both stationary cars and rocking cars that slide along a track. It holds 144 riders, stands tall, weighs over , and is located at Deno&#x27;s Wonder Wheel Amusement Park. The Wonder Wheel was made a city landmark in 1989.

The B&amp;B Carousell (as spelled by the frame&#x27;s builder, William F. Mangels) is Coney Island&#x27;s last traditional carousel, near the old entrance to Luna Park. The carousel was built circa 1906–1909 with a traditional roll-operated fairground organ. It was relocated multiple times, most recently to Luna Park&#x27;s Steeplechase Plaza in 2013, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

The Coney Island Cyclone, opened in 1927, is one of the United States&#x27; oldest wooden roller coasters still in operation. The Cyclone includes an , 58-degree drop. It is owned by the City of New York, and is operated by Luna Park under a franchise agreement. The Cyclone was made a city landmark in 1988 and was listed on the NRHP in 1991. The Cyclone is New York City&#x27;s only remaining wooden coaster and is considered &quot;irreplaceable&quot;, since timber-supported coasters can no longer be built under modern city building codes.

There are also multiple other rides in Coney Island. In March 2014, construction started on the new Thunderbolt, a steel roller coaster that was manufactured by Zamperla at a cost of $10 million. The ride features of track, a height of , and a top speed of , as well as four inversions. The Thunderbolt opened in June 2014. Several bumper car rides in Coney Island are all operated separately. , these include an attraction in Deno&#x27;s Wonder Wheel Park, as well as Eldorado Auto Skooter on Surf Avenue. Historically, the earliest bumper car rides were located in Coney Island. Furthermore, two traditional dark ride haunted houses operate at Coney Island: Spook-a-Rama at Deno&#x27;s, and Ghost Hole on West 12th Street adjacent to Deno&#x27;s.

==== Former rides ====
Coney Island has had three major amusement parks in its past—Steeplechase Park (1897–1964), Luna Park (1903–1944), and Dreamland (1904–1911)—as well as several standalone attractions. In addition, Astroland operated at the site of the current Luna Park from 1962 to 2008, while a second Dreamland operated at that site for only the 2009 season.

In addition to the rides in Coney Island&#x27;s former amusement parks, there were also several dozen roller coasters that are now defunct. The Comet, next to the Cyclone&#x27;s current site, was built in 1921 and destroyed in 1945. Another coaster, the Oriental Scenic Railway, was created by LaMarcus Adna Thompson in 1887, and was demolished in 1955 to be replaced with a &quot;hot rod&quot; amusement ride. The steeplechase roller coaster, created by Steeplechase Park operator George C. Tilyou in 1897, consisted of people riding wooden horses around the park on a steel track. The original wooden Thunderbolt coaster, located between West 15th and West 16th Streets, was constructed in 1925, closed in 1983, and torn down in 2000 during the construction of nearby Keyspan Park. Nearby was Tornado, a wooden coaster constructed in 1926, and destroyed by arson in 1977.

Coney Island also contains one defunct ride that is still standing, the Parachute Jump. Originally built as the Life Savers Parachute Jump at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, this was the first ride of its kind. Patrons were hoisted in the air before being allowed to drop using guy-wired parachutes. The Parachute Jump was closed in the 1960s, but was officially preserved, having been listed on the NRHP in 1980 and made a city landmark in 1989.

=== Beaches ===

There is a broad public sand beach that starts at Sea Gate at West 37th Street, through the central Coney Island area and Brighton Beach, to the beginning of the community of Manhattan Beach, a distance of approximately . The beach is continuous and is served for its entire length by the broad Riegelmann Boardwalk. Numerous amusements, as well as the aquarium and a variety of food shops and arcades, are directly accessible from the landward side of the boardwalk. The boardwalk in Manhattan Beach, located within Manhattan Beach Park, is not connected with the Riegelmann Boardwalk.

The beaches in Coney Island used to be private until 1923 when the city bought all the land on the waterfront and created the Riegelmann Boardwalk and Beach. Today, only the sand beach inside Sea Gate is private; it is accessible solely to residents of that community.

The public beaches are maintained on a regular basis by the city. Because sand no longer naturally deposits on the beach, it is replenished in regular beach nourishment projects using dredged sand. The public beaches are open and free to use, though the boardwalk is closed during nights from 1 to 5 a.m. The beach area is divided into several sections by rock groynes that were built in the 1920s to prevent erosion.

<doc id="151664" wikidata="Q838185" url="?curid=151664" title="Communities, regions, and language areas of Belgium">
<text>Belgium is a federal state comprising three communities and three regions that are based on four language areas. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap.

The language areas were established by the Second Gilson Act, which entered into force on 2 August 1963. The division into language areas was included in the Belgian Constitution in 1970. Through constitutional reforms in the 1970s and 1980s, regionalisation of the unitary state led to a three-tiered federation: federal, regional, and community governments were created, a compromise designed to minimize linguistic, cultural, social, and economic tensions.

== Schematic overview ==
This is a schematic overview of the basic federal structure of Belgium as defined by Title I of the Belgian Constitution.

Each of the entities either have their own parliament and government (for the federal state, the communities and the regions) or their own council and executive college (for provinces and municipalities). The entities in &quot;italics&quot; do not have their own institutions—arrondissements because they are purely administrative; language areas because they merely define the linguistic regime of a municipality; and the Flemish Region because its powers are exercised by the Flemish Community.

== Country subdivisions ==
The three communities are:

* the (Dutch-speaking) Flemish Community ()
* the French Community ()
* the German-speaking Community (, DG)

The three regions are:

* the Brussels-Capital Region (Brussels; , )
* the Flemish Region (Flanders; )
* the Walloon Region (Wallonia, , )

The four language areas (as in Dutch and in German), occasionally referred to as linguistic regions (from French ), are:

* the Dutch language area
* the French language area
* the German language area
* the bilingual Brussels-Capital area

All these entities have geographical boundaries. The language areas have no offices or powers and exist de facto as geographical circumscriptions, serving only to delineate the empowered subdivisions. The institutional communities are thus equally geographically determined. Belgian Communities do &quot;not&quot; officially refer directly to groups of people but rather to specific political, linguistic and cultural competencies of the country.

All Communities thus have a precise and legally established area where they can exercise their competencies: the Flemish Community has legal authority (for its Community competencies) only within the Dutch language area (which coincides with the Flemish Region) and bilingual Brussels-Capital language area (which coincides with the Region by that name); the French Community analogously has powers only within the French language area of the Walloon Region and in the Brussels-Capital Region, and the German Community in the German language area, which is a small part of the province of Liège in the Walloon region, and borders Germany.

The constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the institutions empowered for specific matters:

Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to officially merge the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community, with one parliament, one government and one administration, exercising both regional and community competencies, although Flemish parliamentarians from the Brussels-Capital Region cannot vote on competencies of the Flemish Region; thus in the Dutch language area a single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters. While the Walloon Region and the French Community have separate parliaments and governments, the Parliament of the French Community draws its members from the French-speaking members of the Walloon Parliament and the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and ministers of the Walloon Government often serve as ministers in the Government of the French Community as well.

===Subordinate divisions===
The Flemish Region and the Walloon Region each comprise five provinces. The Brussels-Capital Region is not a province, nor does it contain any. The three regions are further subdivided into 581 municipalities, which in general consist of several sub-municipalities. These sub-municipalities were independent municipalities in the past, but no longer serve an official purpose.

Lesser subnational entities include the intra-municipal districts (which currently only exist in the city of Antwerp), the administrative, the electoral and the judicial arrondissements, police districts, as well as the new inter-municipal police zones (lower level than the police districts).

== Competences ==
The Federal State retains a considerable &quot;common heritage&quot;. This includes justice, defence (armed forces), federal police, social security, public debt and other aspects of public finances, nuclear energy, and state-owned companies (such as the Belgian Railways which is in fact an exception on regionalized transport; the Post Office was federal as well, but is being privatised). The State is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs.

Communities exercise competences only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a community&#x27;s language: culture (including audiovisual media), education, the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly attributed to the language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)

Regions have authority in fields connected with their territory in the widest meaning of the term, thus relating to the economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specificities. On education for instance, the autonomy of the communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor sets minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters. Each level can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers.

== Communities == 

Communities were created in 1970 as &quot;cultural communities&quot; with limited power. In 1980, more power was transferred from the federal state to these entities and they became simply &quot;communities&quot;.

Both the Flemish and French Community have jurisdiction over the area of the Brussels-Capital Region. Consequently, they do not have a defined number of inhabitants. The German-speaking Community is the only community with an area over which they have sole jurisdiction as a community. It is located within the Walloon Region, which has even transferred some regional powers to the German-speaking Community with regards to its area.

== Regions == 
=== Flemish Region ===
The Flemish Region or Flanders ( or ) occupies the northern part of Belgium. It has a surface area of , or 44.4% of Belgium, and is divided into 5 provinces which contain a total of 300 municipalities.

The official language is Dutch. French can be used for certain administrative purposes in a dozen particular &quot;municipalities with language facilities&quot; around the Brussels-Capital Region and at the border with the Walloon Region.

The Flemish Region has no institutions on its own. Upon the creation of the provisional regions in 1974, a provisional Flemish Regional Council was installed with Mechelen as seat. However, with the definitive regions in 1980, its competencies were transferred to the Flemish Community in order to have unified Flemish institutions that combine both regional and community competencies, namely the Flemish Parliament and Flemish Government and its administration. Regional laws (called decrees) do however need to mention whether they are applicable to the community, the region or both.

Since the capital of the Flemish Community is Brussels and its institutions have their seats there, it also indirectly serves as seat of government of the Flemish Region, even though the city is not part of it. Additionally, the city of Mechelen still has a relation to the Flemish Region as seat; it serves as the location for head office during European (and formerly Senate) elections.

Flanders contains five provinces: West Flanders, East Flanders, Antwerp, Flemish Brabant and Limburg.

=== Brussels-Capital Region ===
The Brussels-Capital Region (, , ) or Brussels Region is centrally located and completely surrounded by the province of Flemish Brabant and thus by the Flemish Region. With a surface area of , or 0.53% of Belgium, it is the smallest of the three regions. It contains the City of Brussels, which acts both as federal and regional capital, and 18 other municipalities. Its official languages are both Dutch and French. In the region ~75% speak French at home and ~25% speak Dutch, although a significant number of people combine these two languages. The Brussels Capital Region contains only one administrative arrondissement, the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital. However, for juridical purposes, it forms an arrondissement with surrounding Flemish areas, the arrondissement of Brussels (equivalent in area to the former electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde).

Within Brussels, the two Communities have their own institutions that act as &quot;intermediary levels&quot; of government and public service, sitting below the Community institutions, and above the municipal institutions:
* Flemish Community Commission (, VGC) and its administration;
* French Community Commission (, COCOF) and its executive commission and its administration.
In addition to these two, a Common Community Commission exists which is the entity when the Brussels-Capital Region exercises community powers. In these cases, there are more requirements for the legislative process in order to safeguard the interests of both linguistic communities (de facto the Flemish community).

Since the splitting of the Province of Brabant in 1995 (into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant), the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the provinces. Within the Region, most of the provincial competencies are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Additionally, there is a governor of Brussels-Capital, analogously to provinces.

=== Walloon Region ===
The Walloon Region or Wallonia ( or ) occupies the southern part of Belgium. It has a surface area of , or 55.1% of Belgium, and is also divided into 5 provinces which contain a total of 262 municipalities. Its capital is Namur.

The official languages are French and, only in the nine eastern municipalities that form the German-speaking Community near the German border, German. Dutch however, may be used for administrative purposes in the four &quot;municipalities with language facilities&quot; at the border with Flanders, and German in two such municipalities near the German-speaking Community.

The Walloon Region contains five provinces: Hainaut, Walloon Brabant, Namur, Liège and Luxembourg.

<doc id="151674" wikidata="Q280894" url="?curid=151674" title="I, Libertine">
<text>I, Libertine is a historical novel that began as a practical joke by late-night radio raconteur Jean Shepherd who aimed to lampoon the process of determining best-selling books. After generating substantial attention for a novel that did not actually exist, Shepherd approved a 1956 edition of the book written mainly by Theodore Sturgeon—which was later claimed to have become an actual best-seller, with all profits donated to charity.

== Creation ==
Shepherd was annoyed at the way bestseller lists were compiled in the mid-1950s. These lists were determined from sales figures and from the number of requests for new and upcoming books at bookstores. Shepherd urged his listeners to enter bookstores and ask for a non-existent book. He fabricated the author (Frederick R. Ewing) of this imaginary novel, concocted a title (&quot;I, Libertine&quot;), and outlined a basic plot for his listeners to use on bookstore clerks. Fans of the show took it further, planting references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to unsupported claims of its inclusion on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== Publication ==
Bookstores became interested in carrying Ewing&#x27;s novel, which allegedly had been banned in Boston. When publisher Ian Ballantine, novelist Theodore Sturgeon, and Shepherd met for lunch, Ballantine hired Sturgeon to write a novel based on Shepherd&#x27;s outline. Betty Ballantine completed the final chapter after Sturgeon fell asleep, exhausted, on the Ballantines&#x27; couch, having tried to meet the deadline in one marathon typing session.

On September 13, 1956, Ballantine Books published &quot;I, Libertine&quot; simultaneously in hardcover and paperback editions with Shepherd pictured as Ewing, looking as dissolute as possible, on the back cover author&#x27;s photograph. The proceeds from book sales were donated to charity. A few weeks before publication, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; officially &quot;exposed&quot; the hoax, already an open secret.

=== Plot ===
&quot;I, Libertine&quot; tells the story of a social climber who styles himself as Lance Courtenay. Most of the plot is closely based on the life of Elizabeth Chudleigh. An afterword states that &quot;The story of Elizabeth Chudleigh is substantially true ...&quot;, which could easily be taken as being part of the hoax, ironically.

=== Cover painting ===
The front cover displays a quote: Gadzooks,&#x27; quoth I, &#x27;but here&#x27;s a saucy bawd!. The cover painting by Frank Kelly Freas includes hidden images and inside jokes: The sign on the tavern, Fish &amp; Staff, has a shepherd&#x27;s staff and an image of a sturgeon, referencing both Sturgeon and Shepherd. A portion of the word often spoken on the air by Shepherd – &quot;Excelsior!&quot; – can be seen on the paperback cover in a triangular area at extreme left, where it is part of the decoration on the coach door. The entire word is visible on the hardcover dust jacket, which features more of the illustration.

<doc id="151682" wikidata="Q1196186" url="?curid=151682" title="John Shelby Spong">
<text>John Shelby &quot;Jack&quot; Spong (June 16, 1931 – September 12, 2021) was an American bishop of the Episcopal Church, born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He served as the Bishop of Newark, New Jersey from 1979 to 2000. Spong was a liberal Christian theologian, religion commentator, and author who called for a fundamental rethinking of Christian belief away from theism and traditional doctrines. He was known for his progressive and controversial views on Christianity, including his rejection of traditional Christian doctrines, his advocacy for LGBTQ rights, and his support for interfaith dialogue. Spong was a contributor to the Living the Questions DVD program and was a guest on numerous national television broadcasts. Spong died on September 12, 2021, at his home in Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 90.

== Early life ==
John Shelby Spong was born on June 16, 1931 in Charlotte, North Carolina. He grew up attending fundamentalist churches and was heavily influenced by his mother&#x27;s religious beliefs. After his father died when he was 12 years old, Spong continued to attend church and became more involved in his faith. He attended public schools in Charlotte and later went on to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952 as a Phi Beta Kappa graduate. He received his Master of Divinity degree from the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1955.

==Career==
Spong was ordained to the Episcopal priesthood in 1955. He served as rector of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Durham, North Carolina, from 1955 to 1957; rector of Calvary Parish, Tarboro, North Carolina, from 1957 to 1965; rector of St. John&#x27;s Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1965 to 1969; and rector of St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Richmond, Virginia, from 1969 to 1976. Spong became bishop coadjutor of Newark in 1976.

Spong was the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark from 1979 to 2000. He was known as a leader of the church&#x27;s liberal wing. He was one of the first American bishops to ordain a woman into the clergy (in 1977), and he was the first to ordain an openly gay man (Robert Williams in 1989). In response to the Williams ordination, Spong was censured by the church&#x27;s House of Bishops in 1990. Later the church followed his lead; an Episcopal court ruled that homosexuality was not counter to its principles in 1996, and the church recognized same-sex marriages in 2015. Spong held visiting positions and gave lectures at major American theological institutions, most prominently at Harvard Divinity School. He retired in 2000. As a retired bishop, he was a member of the Episcopal Church&#x27;s House of Bishops.

Spong described his own life as a journey from the literalism and conservative theology of his childhood to an expansive view of Christianity. In a 2013 interview, Spong credited the Anglican bishop John Robinson as his mentor in this journey and said reading Robinson&#x27;s writings in the 1960s led to a friendship and mentoring relationship with him over many years. 

A recipient of many awards, Spong was a contributor to the Living the Questions DVD program and was a guest on numerous national television broadcasts (including &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher, &quot;Dateline&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and &quot;Larry King Live&quot;). Spong received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from Virginia Theological Seminary and Saint Paul&#x27;s College, Virginia, as well as an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Muhlenberg College. In 1999, he was awarded the Humanist of the Year award by the American Humanist Association.

=== Beliefs ===
Spong&#x27;s views on the Bible, God, and Jesus Christ challenged traditional Christian beliefs. 

Spong stated that he was a Christian because he believed that Jesus Christ fully expressed the presence of a God of compassion and selfless love and that this is the meaning of the early Christian proclamation, &quot;Jesus is Lord.&quot; Elaborating on this last idea, he affirmed that Jesus was adopted by God as his son, and he says that this would be the way God was fully incarnated in Jesus Christ. He rejected the historical truth claims of some Christian doctrines, such as the virgin birth and the bodily resurrection of Jesus. In 2000, Spong was a critic of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s declaration &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, because it reaffirmed the Catholic doctrine that the Roman Catholic Church is the one true Church and that Jesus Christ is the one and only savior for humanity.

Spong was a strong proponent of the church reflecting the changes in society at large. Towards these ends, he called for a new Reformation, in which many of Christianity&#x27;s basic doctrines should be reformulated.

His views on the future of Christianity were &quot;that we have to start where we are. As I look at the history of religion, I observe that new religious insights always and only emerge from the old traditions as they begin to die. It is not by pitching the old insights out but by journeying deeply through them into new visions that we are able to change religion&#x27;s direction. The creeds were 3rd- and 4th-century love songs that people composed to sing to their understanding of God. We do not have to literalize their words to perceive their meaning or their intention to join in the singing of their creedal song. I think religion in general and Christianity in particular must always be evolving. Forcing the evolution is the dialog between yesterday&#x27;s words and today&#x27;s knowledge. The sin of Christianity is that any of us ever claimed that we had somehow captured eternal truth in the forms we had created.&quot;

Spong debated Christian philosopher and apologist William Lane Craig on the resurrection of Jesus on March 20, 2005.

==== Views on inclusion of women and LGBT people ====
Spong was a strong advocate for expanding the role of women in the church. He was one of the first American bishops to ordain a woman into the clergy, in 1977, and he continued to support women&#x27;s ordination throughout his career. Spong argued that the church needed to be more inclusive and accepting of diversity, including gender diversity.

Spong was also a strong supporter of LGBTQ inclusion. He was the first American bishop to ordain an openly gay man, Robert Williams, in 1989. Spong argued that the church needed to be more accepting of LGBTQ people and that traditional Christian beliefs about sexuality needed to be reinterpreted in light of modern knowledge and understanding.

=== Writings ===
Spong&#x27;s writings relied on Biblical and non-Biblical sources and were influenced by modern critical analysis of these sources. He believed in a nuanced approach to scripture, informed by scholarship and compassion, which he argued can be consistent with both Christian tradition and a contemporary understanding of the universe. He is representative of a stream of thought with roots in the medieval universalism of Peter Abelard and the existentialism of Paul Tillich, whom he called his favorite theologian. 

Spong&#x27;s books include &quot;A New Christianity for a New World&quot;, &quot;Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism&quot;, and &quot;Why Christianity Must Change or Die&quot;. In &quot;A New Christianity for a New World&quot;, Spong argued for a fundamental rethinking of Christian belief away from Theism and outlined his ideas for doctrinal changes within Christianity in the modern world. In &quot;Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism&quot;, Spong challenged the literal interpretation of the Bible and argued for a more nuanced approach to scripture; he also argued that St. Paul was homosexual, a theme that was satirized in Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Live from Golgotha&quot;. In &quot;Why Christianity Must Change or Die&quot;, Spong contended that Christianity must adapt to the changing world or risk becoming irrelevant.

Spong&#x27;s influence on the theological debate can be seen in the work of other theologians, such as Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and Karen Armstrong, who also challenged traditional Christian beliefs and called for a more inclusive and progressive faith.

=== Criticism ===
New Testament Catholic scholar Raymond E. Brown was critical of Spong&#x27;s scholarship, referring to his studies as &quot;amateur night&quot;. Spong frequently praised Brown&#x27;s scholarship, though the affection was not returned, with Brown having commented that &quot;Spong is complimentary in what he writes of me as a NT scholar; ... I hope I am not ungracious if in return I remark that I do not think that a single NT author would recognize Spong&#x27;s Jesus as the figure being proclaimed or written about.&quot;

Spong&#x27;s ideas have been criticized by some other theologians, notably in 1998 by Rowan Williams, the Bishop of Monmouth, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury. Williams described Spong&#x27;s Twelve Points for Reform as embodying &quot;confusion and misinterpretation&quot;.

During a speaking tour in Australia in 2001, Spong was banned by Peter Hollingworth, the Archbishop of Brisbane, from speaking at churches in the diocese. The tour coincided with Hollingworth leaving the diocese to become the Governor-General of Australia. Hollingworth said that it was not an appropriate moment for Spong to &quot;engage congregations in matters that could prove theologically controversial&quot;. After Spong&#x27;s book &quot;Jesus for the Non-Religious&quot; was published in 2007, Peter Jensen, the Archbishop of Sydney, banned Spong from preaching at any churches in his diocese. By contrast, Phillip Aspinall, the Primate of Australia, invited Spong in 2007 to deliver two sermons at St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Brisbane.

Following Spong&#x27;s death, Mark Tooley told &quot;The Washington Times&quot; that Spong &quot;claimed that he was making religion relevant for a new generation who could not believe in the supernatural, often citing his daughters. But the irony was that as he was making his case, modernity was ending and postmodernity starting, and his rationalist perspective became passé. There was new openness to the supernatural.&quot;

Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, described Spong&#x27;s teaching as constituting the historic definition of heresy. Mohler asserted that Spong had &quot;denied virtually every major Christian doctrine&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1955, Spong married Joan Lydia Ketner. She died in 1988. In 1990, Spong married Christine Mary Bridger. Spong had five children.

Spong died on September 12, 2021, at the age of 90.

<doc id="151686" wikidata="Q1007573" url="?curid=151686" title="Galaxy Science Fiction">
<text>Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published in Boston from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by a French-Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made &quot;Galaxy&quot; the leading science fiction magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.

Gold published many notable stories during his tenure, including Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Fireman&quot;, later expanded as &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;; Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;; and Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;. In 1952, the magazine was acquired by Robert Guinn, its printer. By the late 1950s, Frederik Pohl was helping Gold with most aspects of the magazine&#x27;s production. When Gold&#x27;s health worsened, Pohl took over as editor, starting officially at the end of 1961, though he had been doing the majority of the production work for some time.

Under Pohl &quot;Galaxy&quot; had continued success, regularly publishing fiction by writers such as Cordwainer Smith, Jack Vance, Harlan Ellison, and Robert Silverberg. Pohl never won the annual Hugo Award for his stewardship of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, winning three Hugos instead for its sister magazine, &quot;If&quot;. In 1969 Guinn sold &quot;Galaxy&quot; to Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD) and Pohl resigned, to be replaced by Ejler Jakobsson. Under Jakobsson the magazine declined in quality. It recovered under James Baen, who took over in mid-1974, but when he left at the end of 1977 the deterioration resumed, and there were financial problems—writers were not paid on time and the schedule became erratic. By the end of the 1970s, the gaps between issues were lengthening, and the title was finally sold to &quot;Galileo&quot; publisher Vincent McCaffrey, who brought out only a single issue in 1980. A brief revival as a semi-professional magazine followed in 1994, edited by H. L. Gold&#x27;s son, E. J. Gold; this lasted for eight bimonthly issues.

At its peak, &quot;Galaxy&quot; greatly influenced the science fiction genre. It was regarded as one of the leading science fiction magazines almost from the start, and its influence did not wane until Pohl&#x27;s departure in 1969. Gold brought a &quot;sophisticated intellectual subtlety&quot; to magazine science fiction according to Pohl, who added that &quot;after &quot;Galaxy&quot; it was impossible to go on being naive.&quot; SF historian David Kyle commented that &quot;of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold&quot;. Kyle suggested that the new direction Gold set &quot;inevitably&quot; led to the experimental New Wave, the defining science fiction literary movement of the 1960s.

==Publication history==
The first science fiction (sf) magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, appeared in 1926. By the end of the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its resulting paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. &quot;Galaxy&quot; appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.

===Origins and 1950s===
H. L. Gold, &quot;Galaxy&quot; first editor, had worked at Standard Magazines in the early 1940s as an assistant editor, reading for Standard&#x27;s three science fiction pulps: &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Wonder&quot;, and &quot;Captain Future&quot;. With the advent of the war, Gold left publishing and went into the army, but in late 1949 he was approached by Vera Cerutti, who had once worked for him. Cerutti was now working for a French-Italian publisher, Éditions Mondiales Del Duca founded by Cino Del Duca, that had opened an office in New York as World Editions. She initially asked Gold for guidance on how to produce a magazine, which he provided. World Editions took a heavy loss on &quot;Fascination&quot;, its first attempt to launch a US magazine, and Cerutti returned to Gold asking for recommendations for new titles. Gold knew about &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, a digest launched in the fall of 1949, but felt that there was still room in the market for another serious science fiction magazine. He sent a prospectus to World Editions that included a proposal for a series of paperback sf novels as well as a periodical, and proposed paying three cents a word, an impressively high rate, given that most competing magazines were paying only one cent a word. World Editions agreed, hired Gold as the editor, and the first issue appeared in October 1950. The novel series subsequently appeared as &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction Novels&quot;.

Gold initially suggested two titles for the magazine, &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Gold&#x27;s art director, Washington Irving van der Poel, mocked up multiple layouts and Gold invited hundreds of writers, editors, artists, and fans to view them and vote for their favorite; the vote was strongly for &quot;Galaxy&quot; as the title. For the first issue, Gold obtained stories by several well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Theodore Sturgeon, as well as part one of &quot;Time Quarry&quot; by Clifford D. Simak (later published in book form as &quot;Time and Again&quot;). Along with an essay by Gold, &quot;Galaxy&quot; premiere issue introduced a book review column by anthologist Groff Conklin, which ran until 1955, and a Willy Ley science column. Gold sought to implement high-quality printing techniques, though the quality of the available paper was insufficient for the full benefits to be seen. Within months, the outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages that forced Gold to find a new printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. According to Gold, the magazine was profitable within five issues: an &quot;incredible&quot; achievement, in his words.

In the summer of 1951, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt &quot;Galaxy&quot; distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director and the head of the American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out what the problem was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell &quot;Galaxy&quot; to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. In Gold&#x27;s words, &quot;he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn&#x27;t known what they were selling&quot;.

Guinn&#x27;s new company was named Galaxy Publishing Corporation, and it took over beginning with the October 1951 issue. Gold remained as editor, but lost the assistance of staff at World Editions, relying instead on help from Jerome Bixby, Algis Budrys, Theodore Sturgeon, and Gold&#x27;s wife, Evelyn Paige. Science fiction author Frederik Pohl, then working as a literary agent, was also helpful in connecting writers with Gold.

By the late 1950s, the science fiction magazine boom was over, and the relatively low circulation of the magazines did not endear them to distributors, the middlemen who transported magazines from the publishers to the newsstands and other outlets. Gold changed the title from &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; to &quot;Galaxy Magazine&quot; with the September 1958 issue, commenting that the term &quot;science fiction&quot; &quot;scares many people away from buying&quot;. &quot;Galaxy&quot; circulation, at about 90,000, was the highest of the science fiction magazines, but Guinn decided to cut costs, and in 1959 raised the cover price and changed the magazine to a bimonthly schedule, while increasing the page count. Guinn also cut the rates paid to authors from three (and occasionally four) cents a word to one and a half cents a word. These changes saved &quot;Galaxy&quot; over $12,000 a year. The result was a fall in circulation to about 80,000 within two years, but this was sustainable because of the savings from the fiction budget.

===1960s===
Guinn acquired &quot;If&quot;, another science fiction magazine, in 1959, and gave it to Gold to edit as well. The July 1959 issue of &quot;If&quot; was the first under Gold&#x27;s editorship. &quot;Galaxy&quot; shift to a bimonthly schedule had been intended to help reduce the workload on Gold, who was not in good health; he was able to take on &quot;If&quot; as well because the two magazines alternated months of publication. Towards the end of the 1950s Frederik Pohl began to help Gold, occasionally to the extent of performing all the editorial duties, including writing the editorials and blurbs and working with the printer. Gold, who was agoraphobic, was making efforts at this time to leave his apartment, but in 1960 he was seriously injured in a taxi accident, and proved unable to continue as editor. Pohl took over at some point in early 1961, though he was not listed on the masthead as editor until the December 1961 issue.

Pohl attempted to persuade Guinn to double the pay rate of one and a half cents a word back to the former level of three. Guinn refused, but Pohl was able to find enough material that he could purchase at a low rate to allow him to offer some authors three cents per word. The strategy was successful in improving circulation, and Guinn eventually acceded to the rate increase.

Pohl also tried hard to persuade Guinn and Sol Cohen, whom Guinn had hired to help with the publishing duties, to switch both &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;If&quot; to monthly schedules. In late 1962, they agreed, but soon changed their minds and decided to start a third science fiction magazine instead. This was &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, which was launched in April 1963 and lasted until mid-1967 (it was briefly revived in 1970–71). Another companion magazine, &quot;International Science Fiction&quot;, was tried in late 1967, but lasted only two issues; it showcased stories translated from other languages, and sales were very weak. Finally, in 1968 Guinn launched &quot;Worlds of Fantasy&quot;, edited initially by Lester del Rey, &quot;Galaxy&quot; managing editor; only four issues appeared. In the middle of 1968, &quot;Galaxy&quot; was restored to a monthly schedule.

===1970s and after===
In 1969, Guinn sold &quot;Galaxy&quot; to Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro at a World Science Fiction Symposium when the sale went through; he heard the news when he returned to the &quot;Galaxy&quot; office afterwards and within a few days decided to resign. He remained on the masthead as &quot;editor emeritus&quot;, a post invented to keep Pohl from moving to one of the other sf magazines, and went back to his writing career. His place was taken by Ejler Jakobsson, who was working in UPD&#x27;s book department. Lester del Rey stayed on as features editor, and Judy-Lynn Benjamin took his place as managing editor. Jack Gaughan was made art editor.

&quot;Galaxy&quot; circulation had held relatively steady in the mid-1960s, ranging between 73,000 and 78,000, but the UPD acquisition coincided with a precipitous drop—from 75,300 for the year ended October 1968, circulation fell to 51,479 just one year later. Difficulties with distribution also cut into income, and Arnold Abramson, UPD&#x27;s owner, decided to cut costs and maximize profits. &quot;Galaxy&quot; went bimonthly in August 1970, ending a two-year spell of monthly scheduling (though a couple of months had been missed). The page count, which had been cut from 196 to 160 when UPD bought it, was increased again, and the price was raised from 60 cents to 75 cents. A British edition began in May 1972, published by Tandem Books, which was owned by UPD. The net effect of all these changes was a substantial increase in profitability. Circulation in 1972 also rose by about 6,000 issues, though it is possible that this was solely due to the new British edition.

UPD began to have financial difficulties in the early 1970s, and when Judy-Lynn del Rey (formerly Judy-Lynn Benjamin) left in May 1973 to work at Ballantine Books, Jakobsson&#x27;s workload increased greatly. He resigned less than a year later, citing overwork and other issues, and was replaced by James Baen, who took over with the June 1974 issue after Pohl declined the post. Baen also took over the editorship of &quot;If&quot;, but rising paper costs forced the closure of &quot;If&quot; at the end of 1974, and the title was merged with &quot;Galaxy&quot;. The magazine had returned to a monthly schedule in September 1973, but it was only patchily adhered to, with at least a couple of issues missed every year except 1974. Baen was successful at increasing circulation again, bringing it from 47,789 when he took over to 81,035 when he left. The magazine was profitable for UPD, but the financial pressure on the parent company took its toll and Baen left in late 1977 to work for Ace Books—the October issue was his last.

Baen was replaced by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce &quot;clearly loved what he did and knew what he was talking about&quot;. Pierce&#x27;s replacement was Hank Stine, who took over in late 1978, though because of &quot;Galaxy&quot; irregular schedule Pierce&#x27;s last issue was March–April 1979. Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD&#x27;s financial problems spelled the end. Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, &quot;Galileo&quot;, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.

The last few years of &quot;Galaxy&quot; life were marked by stories of unpaid contributors. John Varley, for example, reported that he was still owed money for his stories five years after they appeared. Submissions from well-known writers fell away, and the lack of financial support from UPD meant that the pay rate was an unattractive one cent per word. Higher postal rates, higher paper costs, and continuing competition from the paperback science fiction market all added to the pressure on &quot;Galaxy&quot;. These problems were not resolved by the sale to McCaffrey, who did not even have enough money to pay for circulation postage, with the result that not every &quot;Galaxy&quot; subscriber received a copy of the final issue. Frederik Pohl places the blame for &quot;Galaxy&quot; demise on Arnie Abramson, who, Pohl contends, &quot;simply did not perform [the] basic functions of a publisher&quot;: paying the authors, ensuring subscribers received copies, and meeting other obligations.

==Relaunches of the magazine==

In 1994, the magazine reappeared briefly as a semi-professional publication under the editorship of E. J. Gold, son of H. L. Gold. E. J. Gold produced eight issues on a regular bimonthly schedule, starting with the January–February 1994 issue, and ending with March–April 1995.

In August 2024, Starship Sloane Publishing relaunched &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; with Justin T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane serving as editor, Jean-Paul L. Garnier as deputy editor, Daniel Pomarède as science editor and Robert Silverberg as a contributing editor. The first issue featured cover art by Bruce Pennington, with new fiction by David Gerrold and Christopher Ruocchio among other notables.

==Contents and reception==

===Early years===
Gold intended &quot;Galaxy&quot; to publish stories of sufficient literary quality to attract readers of the slick magazines, as well as those who came to &quot;Galaxy&quot; already familiar with genre science fiction. His editorial policy was broader than that of John W. Campbell, the editor of the leading magazine in the field, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;: Gold was interested in sociology, psychology, and other &quot;soft&quot; sciences, and was also willing to publish humorous and satirical stories. Gold managed to persuade the publisher to let him offer three to four cents a word, which exceeded the highest rates paid in the field at that time. In addition to the high rates, &quot;Galaxy&quot; was an attractive market for writers because Gold bought only first magazine rights, unlike the other leading magazines. &quot;Galaxy&quot; was quickly established as one of the three leading science fiction magazines, along with Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (usually abbreviated to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;). Campbell had been enormously influential over the previous decade, but the appearance of &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, launched just a year before, marked the end of his dominance of the genre.

The cover for the first issue was by David Stone, depicting a scene from Simak&#x27;s &quot;Time Quarry&quot;. The image was muted, in contrast to the sensational art typically found on the covers of the sf pulps; the intention was that &quot;Galaxy&quot; should look like an sf magazine, but one &quot;that you were not embarrassed to hold&quot;, in the words of Mike Ashley. The early artwork was generally unremarkable, though Ed Emshwiller&#x27;s humorous cover for the June 1951 issue, his first professional sale as an artist, was a positive sign. &quot;Emsh&quot;, as he was known to science fiction readers, soon became a regular contributor. The relatively expensive production processes that Gold had insisted on enabled more sophisticated internal artwork, which could be integrated with type in ways not possible with cheaper letterpress printing.

On the rear cover of the first issue, Gold ran a feature called &quot;You&#x27;ll Never See It In &quot;Galaxy&quot;!&quot;, with two paragraphs side by side—one a parody of the introduction to a space western, the other the same story translated to become a true western, with spaceships replaced by horses. A sample: &quot;He cut out his super-hyper-drive for the landing ... and at that point, a tall, lean spaceman stepped out of the tail assembly, proton gun-blaster in a space-tanned hand&quot; became &quot;He spurred hard for a low overhang of rimrock ... and at that point a tall, lean wrangler stepped out from behind a high boulder, six-shooter in a sun-tanned hand&quot;. The feature drew much attention, though James Blish commented that &quot;Galaxy&quot; did not always avoid printing the kind of fiction it parodied.

In the first issue, Gold asked for reader feedback on what should be included in the magazine—letters, editorials, book reviews, or other features. The response was against a letter column, but the readers wanted editorials, and short book reviews with recommendations that would help them identify what books to buy, as opposed to in-depth criticism. Gold was also concerned that harsh critical reviews would scare away new authors who might otherwise submit their work. Groff Conklin began a book review column, called &quot;&quot;Galaxy&quot; Five Star Shelf&quot;, in the first issue; Floyd Gale took it over with the November 1955 issue—Gale was in fact Gold&#x27;s brother, using a slightly modified surname. The inaugural issue also included a competition for readers to explain UFOs in under 200 words, the first of many contests Gold would run.

The first six issues contained stories by well-known authors, including some that became highly regarded such as Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Coming Attraction&quot;, Damon Knight&#x27;s &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, and Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Fireman&quot;, later expanded as &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. Gold considered these early issues exploratory, and some of the material by major names was clearly lesser work. With its second volume, beginning in April 1951, &quot;Galaxy&quot; achieved consistently high quality, with virtually every issue featuring a story that would have a lasting reputation, including C. M. Kornbluth&#x27;s &quot;The Marching Morons&quot;, Wyman Guin&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Bedlam&quot;, and Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, whose serialization overlapped volumes 2 and 3. Early feedback from readers had been opposed to serialized novels, but here Gold did not follow their opinion, and &quot;Galaxy&quot; is remembered for featuring some very successful serials. A contemporary anthology of science fiction stories, E. F. Bleiler and T. E. Dikty&#x27;s &quot;The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1951&quot;, commented in an editorial that Gold&#x27;s work &quot;will succeed in placing science-fiction on an equal basis with any other field of modern literature&quot;. With a circulation of over 100,000 in its second year, &quot;Galaxy&quot; surpassed &quot;Astounding&quot;.

===Mid- and late 1950s===
Gold maintained &quot;Galaxy&quot; high standards for most of the 1950s. Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;—according to critic Peter Nicholls, &quot;among the few genuine classics of genre sf&quot;—was serialized in early 1952. Pohl and Kornbluth&#x27;s &quot;The Space Merchants&quot; followed a few months later, serialized as &quot;Gravy Planet&quot;; Brian Aldiss, in his critical genre study &quot;Trillion Year Spree&quot;, calls it &quot;one of the most famous books in SF&quot;. James Blish&#x27;s &quot;Surface Tension&quot; and Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;Baby is Three&quot;, both widely acclaimed, also appeared in 1952. Readers had expressed support for science articles, and in March 1952, Willy Ley, who had contributed occasional essays since the first issue, began a column, &quot;For Your Information&quot;, in which he replied to readers&#x27; scientific questions. Running uninterrupted until Ley&#x27;s death in 1969, Frederik Pohl describes it as &quot;the most popular single feature &quot;Galaxy&quot; ever had&quot;. The Hugo Awards were inaugurated the following year: &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; won the first Hugo for Best Novel and &quot;Galaxy&quot; shared the first Hugo for Best Magazine with &quot;Astounding&quot;.

Gold published a wide range of material, and &quot;Galaxy&quot; became known for irony and satire; the work of authors able to adopt the wry style he favored, such as Knight and Robert Sheckley, appeared regularly in the magazine and were obvious commentaries on contemporary society. In 1953, with McCarthyism at its height, Gold refused to publish &quot;The Liberation of Earth&quot;, a story by William Tenn satirizing both the Russian and American sides in the Korean War. Tenn quotes Gold, an ex-radical, as saying the idea made him &quot;sweat green&quot;, though the year before he had published Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Martian Way&quot;, a thinly veiled anti-McCarthy story.

L. Sprague de Camp commented that Gold &quot;sets an extremely high standard of literary excellence for his writers&quot;, and observed that he often demanded multiple revisions and rewrites. Gold was also infamous for making sweeping changes to the stories he printed. In meetings and in phone calls he became well known as a difficult editor whose determination to achieve perfection sometimes alienated his writers. He was unapologetic, declaring, &quot;I worked hard with writers, and they didn&#x27;t always enjoy it&quot;. The results were often very positive: some successful stories are said to have begun with an idea he provided to one of his authors. In the case of &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, his involvement extended almost to the point of collaboration. Gold was agoraphobic and rarely left his apartment, but writers often visited him, and he held regular parties and weekly poker games; in addition to the members of the science fiction community, the avant-garde composer John Cage often attended.

In March 1953 Gold announced a novel-writing contest, but it failed to attract any usable submissions. He asked Pohl and Kornbluth if they would allow him to print &quot;Gladiator-at-Law&quot;, which they had just completed, under a pseudonym, so he could claim that the contest had found a new talent. They refused, but shortly afterwards Pohl and Lester del Rey agreed to let Gold take their recently completed novel &quot;Preferred Risk&quot; and publish it as the winner under the pseudonym Edson McCann. Pohl and del Rey constructed a fake identity for McCann, but the news leaked out and Gold never ran another fiction competition. In July 1953, he launched a companion magazine, &quot;Beyond Fantasy Fiction&quot;, dedicated to fantasy material, which &quot;Galaxy&quot; editorial policy did not favor. It lasted for ten bimonthly issues, with the final one appearing in January 1955. After it failed, Gold opened &quot;Galaxy&quot; to more fantasy, publishing writers such as Cordwainer Smith.

The ABC radio series &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, which began in 1952 as an offshoot of the TV series of the same name, used stories from &quot;Galaxy&quot;; the connection was announced at the start of each of its fifteen episodes. On April 24, 1955, another radio series, NBC&#x27;s &quot;X Minus One&quot;, started a much longer run of 125 episodes, lasting until January 1958. From February 1956 onwards the scripts were adapted exclusively from stories in &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and from the April 1956 issue &quot;Galaxy&quot; ran advertisements for the series, which included work by Pohl, Sturgeon, and Philip K. Dick.

Through the 1950s, &quot;Galaxy&quot; contributors routinely dominated the Hugo ballots, but neither the magazine nor the fiction it published won many awards, despite what sf historian Donald Lawler describes as its &quot;deserved reputation for excellence&quot;. After several years of being shut out of the Hugos, &quot;Galaxy&quot; published two works in 1958 that won the honor: Fritz Leiber&#x27;s novel &quot;The Big Time&quot; and Avram Davidson&#x27;s short story &quot;Or All the Seas with Oysters&quot;.

===1960s===
When Pohl took over as editor in 1961, he broadened the magazine&#x27;s scope, including more fantasy material. Regular contributors in the 1960s included Jack Vance, Larry Niven, Frank Herbert, Robert Silverberg, and Cordwainer Smith. &quot;Galaxy&quot; stories from this era that won awards include Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Dragon Masters&quot; and &quot;The Last Castle&quot;; Clifford Simak&#x27;s &quot;Way Station&quot;, serialized as &quot;Here Gather the Stars&quot;; Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Repent, Harlequin,&#x27; Said the Ticktockman&quot; and &quot;The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World&quot;; and Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Nightwings&quot;. Pohl never succeeded in winning a Hugo Award as editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, although he won the award three consecutive times from 1966 to 1968 as editor of &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot; sister magazine, and in theory the junior of the two publications.

The quality of fiction in &quot;Galaxy&quot; had dipped towards the end of Gold&#x27;s editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine&#x27;s high standards. Gold&#x27;s difficult editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in &quot;Galaxy&quot; throughout the 1960s.

In February 1965, Pohl brought in Algis Budrys as book reviewer, after a year in which no review column had appeared. Budrys&#x27;s insightful reviews drew much praise, and editor David Hartwell has ranked him as one of the best sf critics of his generation.

The difference between Pohl&#x27;s approach and Gold&#x27;s was apparent in the editorials Pohl wrote, which were informal, entertaining, and rooted in his deep familiarity with the genre. With Pohl at the helm, &quot;Galaxy&quot; moved back toward the knowledgeable science fiction fan, and away from the mainstream market that Gold had targeted. Pohl said that he tried to &quot;cover the full spectrum of science fiction&quot;, however, unlike Gold&#x27;s &quot;specialist magazine&quot; of the 1950s; his &quot;Galaxy&quot; published both Sheckley&#x27;s &quot;Mindswap&quot; and Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Do I Wake or Dream?&quot; when Gold would not have purchased the latter, Pohl said.

===1970s===
Ejler Jakobsson&#x27;s tenure began with a large backlog of stories that Pohl had acquired, but within a year or two substantial changes were apparent. In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update &quot;Galaxy&quot; image, adding a comic strip, &quot;Sunpot&quot;, by Vaughn Bodé, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give &quot;Galaxy&quot; a new and distinctive character: &quot;Sunpot&quot; lasted only four issues, Sturgeon&#x27;s reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, &quot;mercifully unknown ever since&quot;. The paper quality and printing quality also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak. Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over the editorial page his work was unremarkable. He managed to attract some of the new writers who were becoming well known in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ. Three novels published in Jakobsson&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy&quot; won awards: Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;A Time of Changes&quot; won the Nebula in 1971. Sturgeon&#x27;s short story &quot;Slow Sculpture&quot; won both the Hugo and the Nebula in 1970.

A letter column was added at the end of 1971; this was the first time &quot;Galaxy&quot; had published reader&#x27;s letters. &quot;Galaxy&quot; long-time science columnist, Willy Ley, died in 1969, and was replaced by Donald Menzel. He was replaced in turn by Jerry Pournelle in April 1974.

Jakobsson&#x27;s successor, James Baen, was able to publish some high-quality fiction, including material by Roger Zelazny, John Varley, Larry Niven, and Pohl, whose novel, &quot;Gateway&quot;, won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. Baen raised the level of the magazine substantially, and Ashley refers to his editorship as &quot;Galaxy&quot; &quot;Indian summer&quot;. Under Baen the review columnist was Spider Robinson, who won a Locus Award in 1977, primarily for his work in &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Baen also published a series of essays by authors discussing their own work. Apart from &quot;Gateway&quot;, Baen published only one award-winning story: Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot;, which appeared in August 1974 and won the Nebula.

Baen&#x27;s successors, Pierce, Stine, and Kemske, were unable to maintain his standard. Pohl remained loyal to the magazine, but the serialization of his novel &quot;Jem&quot; exemplified &quot;Galaxy&quot; growing problems. Due to the magazine&#x27;s increasingly erratic schedule, the serialization stretched from the last issue of 1978 into 1980, well after it had appeared in book form. In November 1977, Paul Walker took over the book column from Spider Robinson, and Jerry Pournelle left the science column at the end of 1978. The artwork quality dropped to an amateurish level, and despite the appearance of a few successful stories and novels, such as C. J. Cherryh&#x27;s &quot;The Faded Sun: Kesrith&quot;, the overall quality was dramatically worse than it had been under Baen. &quot;Galaxy&quot; deterioration was largely due to the financial troubles of the publisher, Arnold Abramson, who reduced the pay rate (at a time of high inflation) to a penny a word. Even that low rate did not guarantee timely disbursement, and many writers stopped submitting because of &quot;Galaxy&quot; reputation for paying slowly, if at all. Costs were increasing for paper, postage, and production, and the paperback anthology market was booming, adding to the competition that &quot;Galaxy&quot; faced. Floyd Kemske&#x27;s only issue never received newsstand distribution, doomed by the financial troubles of the magazine&#x27;s publisher, Vincent McCaffrey.

===Cover layout and artwork===
&quot;Galaxy&quot; had a characteristic cover style in the 1950s with an inverted white &quot;L&quot; shape (Greek gamma) framing the cover art; this style was copied by several magazines, including &quot;Authentic Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Startling Stories&quot;. When &quot;Astounding&quot; followed suit in late 1951, Gold commented sarcastically in an editorial that &quot;Galaxy&quot; &quot;would like to know when we may have it [the format] back again&quot;. The first variation came with the September 1956 issue, which widened the left hand strip of white to allow room to print story titles and author names. The December 1961 issue was the first to eliminate the strip on the left, and until July 1969 the magazine varied between this layout, the inverted &quot;L&quot;, and a version with no white at all, first used on the August 1965 issue. Another change visible in that issue is the reversal of the title coloring to white lettering on a block of red; this was used from August 1963 to December 1965. In August 1969 the title was enlarged to fill the width of the magazine; this issue had the white inverted &quot;L&quot;, but it was the last one to do so till 1980. After August 1969 the cover paintings spanned the entire cover, though with some minor variations in layout such as can be seen in the October 1976 issue. Then in September 1978 (undated on the cover, but numbered vol. 39 no. 7) the original typeface for &quot;Galaxy&quot; was abandoned for the last few issues. The final issue, edited by Kemske, returned to the previous layout and typeface, although with a magazine twice the size of the original digest. When E. J. Gold revived &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1994, he restored the inverted &quot;L&quot; and employed a predominantly black-and-white look for the eight issues he published.

Notable artists who contributed regularly to &quot;Galaxy&quot; included Ed Emshwiller, who won several Hugo Awards for his work, Hugo nominee Wallace Wood, and Jack Gaughan, who won three Hugos in the late 1960s, partly for his work in &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Gaughan was commissioned by Pohl to provide the cover and interior art for Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Dragon Masters&quot; in 1962; the resulting illustrations made Gaughan immediately famous in the science fiction field. In the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Galaxy&quot; retained the original artwork sent in by its artists, though Emshwiller, much of whose best color work appeared there, was able to negotiate an exception to this rule, retaining the art for his portfolios. In 1972 much of this artwork—including both interior and cover illustrations—was sold off by Robert Guinn, who had kept it when he sold &quot;Galaxy&quot; to UPD in 1969.

===Influence on the field===
Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs, recalled being deeply impressed by the first issue of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and that many fans, including himself, believed that the magazine became the field&#x27;s leader almost immediately. In critic John Clute&#x27;s assessment, &quot;Galaxy&quot; indeed swiftly supplanted &quot;Astounding&quot; and remained the leading magazine in the field until Pohl resigned as editor in 1969. Science fiction historian and critic Mike Ashley regarded &quot;Galaxy&quot; success as the main reason for the subsequent boom in science fiction magazines, commenting that it &quot;revolutionized the field overnight&quot;. Under Gold &quot;Galaxy&quot; provided a market for social science fiction stories that might not have been accepted by &quot;Astounding&quot; and &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, the other leading magazines.

Pohl stated in 1965 that almost every major science fiction writer whose career began after 1950 primarily wrote for &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and that others closely imitated Gold&#x27;s magazine. He described &quot;Galaxy&quot; as where &quot;the stunning new kinds of science fiction ... flowered, and changed everything in science fiction&quot;. In his opinion, Gold&#x27;s innovation was to ask writers to consider not just new technology, but the subsequent impact of that technology on society. He adds, &quot;What &quot;Galaxy&quot; brought to magazine science fiction was a kind of sophisticated intellectual subtlety. ... After &quot;Galaxy&quot; it was impossible to go on being naive.&quot; Science fiction author Brian Stableford argues that &quot;Galaxy&quot; quickly usurped &quot;Astounding&quot;″s position as &quot;pioneer of hardcore sf&#x27;s progress&quot; because it &quot;embraced and gleefully pursued a new series of challenges to moral orthodoxy.&quot;

SF historian David Kyle ascribes &quot;Galaxy&quot; influence specifically to Gold, saying that &quot;of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold&quot; and that the new direction he set led, &quot;inevitably&quot;, to the New Wave, the celebrated science fiction literary movement of the 1960s. Kyle&#x27;s assessment of Gold is echoed by writer Barry N. Malzberg, who calls Gold &quot;perhaps the greatest editor in the history of all fields for the first half of his tenure&quot;. SF authors and historians Brian Aldiss and David Wingrove summarize &quot;Galaxy&quot; history by saying that it lasted for &quot;thirty mainly glorious years&quot;: it &quot;brought into the sunlight a number of excellent satirists, comedians and ironists&quot; and, through the influence of its reduced focus on technology, played an important role in attracting women to write science fiction.

===Overseas editions===
&quot;Galaxy&quot; had multiple foreign editions. This was in part because the original publisher, World Editions, had a European base, which Gold had planned to take advantage of when the magazine launched. Overseas editions included:
*Argentina. Two magazines, &quot;Más Allá&quot; (June 1953 – June 1957) and &quot;Géminis&quot; (July 1965 – August 1965), reprinted stories primarily from &quot;Galaxy&quot;, though they also published some original material and some stories reprinted from other sources.
*Finland. &quot;Aikamme tieteislukemisto&quot; (August 1958 – December 1958) was a Finnish edition of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, edited by Mary A. Wuorio and published by Viikkosanomat Oy.
*France. There were two separate French editions of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, both titled &quot;Galaxie&quot;. The first ran from November 1953 to April 1959 (a total of 65 issues), and was published by Editions OPTA, Paris. The first 11 issues were edited by Irina Orloff, the next 16 by Jacqueline Boissy, and the remainder by Jeannine Courtillet. The stories were badly translated, and printed in shortened form. Poor sales led to the cancellation of this version. The second version ran for 158 issues, from May 1964 to August–September 1977, and was also published by Editions OPTA. The editor was Alain Dorémieux for the first 67 issues, and Michel Demuth thereafter. This version, which contained original French stories as well as translated material from &quot;Galaxy&quot;, was much more successful and for a time outsold &quot;Fiction&quot;, the leading French science fiction magazine. From November 1974, more French authors were included, but publication ceased three years later when sales fell.
*Germany. Fifteen issues of a German version, titled &quot;Galaxis&quot;, was released from March 1958 to May 1959 by Moewig Verlag, Munich. The editor was Lothar Heinecke. Fourteen numbered paperbacks titled &quot;Galaxy&quot; appeared between 1965 and 1970, published by Heyne Verlag, Munich. The editor was Walter Ernsting, with Thomas Schlück as co-editor for the last five issues. The contents were reprints from the American edition.
*Italy. An Italian reprint edition titled &quot;Galaxy&quot; ran from June 1958 to May 1964; there were 70 physical issues, with two issues containing double numbers, so that the last issue was numbered 72. The publisher was Editrice Due Mondi, Milan, for the first ten issues; the remaining issues were published by Casa Editrice La Tribuna, Piacenza. The editors were R. Valente (issues 1–26/27), Mario Vitali (28/29–39), and Lella Pollini Rambelli (40–72). The magazine included some stories by Italian authors in addition to translated material.
*Netherlands. Five issues, titled &quot;Galaxis&quot;, appeared from October 1966 to February 1967, from Vector, Dordrecht. The editor was Theo Kemp. The translations were of poor quality.
*Norway. The Norwegian magazine &quot;Tempo-Magasinet&quot;, published by Greens Forlag, printed translations from US science fiction, mostly from &quot;Galaxy&quot;. It lasted for five issues, from November 1953 to March 1954. The editor was Arne Ernst.
*Sweden. A Swedish edition, titled &quot;Galaxy&quot;, appeared from September 1958 to June 1960 (19 issues); the publisher is unknown, though it is known to be the same company that published the Swedish edition of &quot;Mad&quot;. This version, which included some original Swedish stories, was edited by Henrik Rabe.
*UK. Several British editions of &quot;Galaxy&quot; were produced. From 1953 to 1962 Strato Publications published 94 numbered issues. The early issues were labeled vol. 3 no. 1 to no. 12. With the 13th issue the &quot;vol. 3&quot; was dropped. Until issue 72 (February 1959) they were shortened versions of the US edition, with one or more stories or features being cut. From no. 72 Strato reprinted the full US issue with a different title page, and from issue 80 the US edition was used with a variant cover. In 1967 a British edition appeared from Gold Star Publications; there were five bimonthly issues, identical to the US edition dated six months previously. The British issues were dated January–February 1967 through September–October 1967; the corresponding US issues were June, August, October, and December 1966, and February 1967. Universal-Tandem Publishing Co Ltd published 25 issues of &quot;Galaxy&quot; in the UK; the original US issues were May–June 1972 to January 1975. These were re-covered for UK distribution. The numbering was erratic: it ran 1–10, then 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 14, and finally 17–25.

===Other bibliographic details===
The following table shows which issues appeared from which publisher.

The title changed several times, and was frequently inconsistently given between the cover, spine, indicia, and masthead.
&quot;Galaxy&quot; remained a digest-sized magazine from the beginning until 1979; the last issue was published in pulp format, as were the semi-professional issues produced by E. J. Gold. The page count began at 160; it dropped to 144 in January 1955, but went up to 192 in February 1959. In July 1969 the count went back down to 160; it returned to 192 pages with the August–September 1970 issue and stayed there till May–June 1971, when it dropped to 176. From June 1974 to June–July 1979 it was back at 160 pages, and then went to 128 pages for the final digest issue, September–October 1979. The single 1980 issue was 72 pages long. The eight issues published in the 1990s all had 96 pages, except the first, January–February 1994, which had 56 pages. The initial price was 25 cents. Price changes were as follows: 35 cents from May 1958; 50 cents from February 1959; 60 cents from December 1964; 75 cents from August–September 1970; $1.00 from April 1975; 79 cents for the August 1975 issue; 95 cents from September 1975; $1.00 from May 1976; $1.25 from June 1977, and $1.50 for the final professional issue in 1980.

===Derivative anthologies===
Several anthologies of stories from &quot;Galaxy&quot; have been published. The following list does not include reprint editions though in some cases these varied in contents, as for example with the UK editions of some of the early volumes.

==Related publications==
Two series of companion novels were issued by the publishers. The first series, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction Novels&quot;, began in 1950 with Eric Frank Russell&#x27;s &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;; seven titles were released by World Editions, and a further twenty-eight by Guinn&#x27;s Galaxy Publishing Corporation. The books were initially in digest format but this was changed to a standard paperback format for the last four titles. In 1959 the line was sold to Beacon Books, which produced another 11 volumes. Beacon specialized in softcore pornography, and changed the titles of most of the books they published to be more suggestive. The last title, &quot;Sin in Space&quot; (originally &quot;Outpost Mars&quot;), by Cyril Judd (a pseudonym for Cyril Kornbluth and Judith Merril) appeared in 1961. Two years later a second series, Galaxy Magabooks, appeared; each of these consisted of two short novels, both by the same author, published in a single volume. Only three were released; the last, &quot;And My Fear Is Great/Baby Is Three&quot; by Theodore Sturgeon, appeared in 1964.

<text>The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal is a canal of the Birmingham Canal Navigations in the West Midlands of England. Its purpose was to provide a link between the Coventry Canal and Birmingham and thereby connect Birmingham to London via the Oxford Canal.

==History==
The story of the Birmingham and Fazeley begins in 1770, when the Birmingham Canal Company was seen as having a monopoly. At the time, the coalfields at Walsall did not have canal access, and a public meeting was held at Lichfield on 18 August to discuss an independent link from Walsall to Fradley Junction on the Trent and Mersey Canal, passing through Lichfield. Opposition from local landowners resulted in the plan being shelved, but a further plan was proposed at a meeting held in Warwick in August 1781, for a canal to run from Wednesbury through Fazeley to Atherstone, which was the end of the Coventry Canal at the time. The plans were changed somewhat in October, but shareholders in the Birmingham Canal saw it as a serious threat.

Two bills were put before Parliament in 1782, one for the Birmingham and Fazeley, and a rival one from the Birmingham Canal for a branch from Wednesbury to Walsall. Both sides opposed the other&#x27;s proposal, and both bills were defeated.
The promoters then opened negotiations with other canal companies, to ensure that when the canal was built, it would be part of a larger network. In 1782, they obtained an agreement from the Oxford Canal Company that they would complete the route to the River Thames at Oxford, one from the Coventry Canal that they would extend their canal from Atherstone to Fazeley, and agreed that they would complete the Coventry Canal&#x27;s route from Fazeley as far as Whittington, as the Coventry Canal company could not finance the whole route. The Trent and Mersey would finish that link by building the remainder of the route to Fradley Junction. A second bill was put before Parliament, and at the same time, the Birmingham Canal presented a scheme for a canal from Riders Green to Broadwaters, near Walsall, with eight branches, and a second canal from Newhall to Fazeley. The Birmingham and Fazeley was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (24 Geo. 3. Sess. 2. c. 4). The new company and the Birmingham Canal merged soon afterwards, becoming the awkwardly named Birmingham &amp; Birmingham &amp; Fazeley Canal Company.

John Smeaton was the engineer employed by the Birmingham and Fazeley, but work did not start immediately, as he was also responsible for the Riders Green to Broadwaters line, which was completed first. The project did not go smoothly, as there were disputes between James Bough, the superintendent of the canal company, and Pinkertons, who were the civil engineering contractors employed to carry out the work. The issue concerned the cement that the Pinkertons were using. Work on the Fazeley line began in April 1786, with Bough still acting as superintendent, and the Pinkertons responsible for the construction of the section between Minworth and Fazeley. In late 1786, George Pinkerton found out that the levels, which had been surveyed by Bough, were wrong. Samuel Bull, the engineer for the canal company, investigated and reported that Pinkerton was right. The Pinkertons started to work on the project from January 1787, even though the contracts were not signed until May. Bough made a series of allegations that Pinkertons&#x27; workmanship and the materials used were of poor quality.

The company stopped paying Pinkerton in late 1788, as the costs were exceeding the original estimates, and the contract was taken away from them in February 1789. There was then a financial dispute over money which had been paid to Pinkerton as &quot;extras&quot;, but which the company then claimed were overpayments. Some £2,750 was at issue, and the case rumbled on for a decade, until a court case in 1801 gave him only £436 of the claim. Unhappy with the outcome, Pinkerton justified his position, but his remarks about John Houghton, the Company Clerk, were deemed to be libellous, for which he was fined and spent some time in prison. 
The canal was completed in August 1789. The benefits of the co-operation with the other canal companies were that when all the links were completed in 1790, it immediately generated a great deal of freight traffic. This created problems, as the flights of locks at Aston and Farmer&#x27;s Bridge became congested, and this became worse when the Warwick Canal built a junction onto the Digbeth Branch. The problem was not solved until 1844, when the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal to the south east and the Tame Valley Canal to the north west were opened. The name of the Birmingham &amp; Birmingham &amp; Fazeley Canal Company was changed to Birmingham Canal Navigations in 1794.
In 1926 the construction of Salford Bridge which spans the River Tame and the Tame Valley Canal at the end of Lichfield Road at the foot of Gravelly Hill resulted in the demolition of the cast-iron roving bridge over the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, and also four cottages belonging to the canal company. The cast-iron bridge was replaced with a new reinforced concrete bridge and new cottages were erected on the other side of the canal. 
The bridge over the canal at the junction of Chester Road and Kingsbury Road (Tyburn Bridge) was replaced in 1934. 

In 1935 Birmingham Council gained powers to stop up the arm of the canal on the north east side of Summer Row for the development of a new civic centre and the widening of Great Charles Street. 

In 1962 Birmingham Council decided to fill in the arm of the canal which ran in Newtown Row, following the drowning of a boy the previous year. 

In 1967 a pipeline was laid under the towpath to link the gasworks at Coleshill with the Washwood Heath Works. 

In 2019, the Canal &amp; River Trust announced that repair works had started on two locks at Farmer&#x27;s Bridge Locks as part of a wider £2.5 million programme of repairs across the West Midlands.

In 2022, work started on the &quot;Scotland Works&quot; site opposite Lock 1 of Farmer&#x27;s Bridge Locks, a former glassworks that is being redeveloped into residential apartments named Lockside Wharf by Consortia Developments and Joseph Mews Property Group. Lockside Wharf will comprise 61 apartments and is currently under construction.

==Route==
The canal is now regarded as running from the BCN Main Line at Old Turn Junction (near the National Indoor Arena), Birmingham to the Coventry Canal at Fazeley Junction, just outside Tamworth. The length of this stretch is 15 miles (24 km), and it includes 38 locks. From Old Turn Junction, 13 locks drop the level of the canal by , after which there is a short flat stretch from St Chads Cathedral to Aston Junction. There is a one-mile (1.6 km) branch called the Digbeth Branch Canal which runs from the junction to Typhoo Basin and contains 6 locks. A short cut runs from near the end of the branch to the Grand Union Canal at Bordesley Junction.

Below the junction there are another 11 locks, which form the Aston flight. Holborn Hill bridge carries the railway to Aston station over the canal, just before the bottom lock of the flight is reached. At Salford Junction, the Tame Valley Canal runs to the north west, and the Grand Union Canal runs southwards, while the Fazeley heads eastwards. Three more locks continue the descent at Minworth, and the character of the surroundings changes from an urban and industrial landscape to open countryside. There is a short Grade II listed tunnel at Curdworth, after which fields and flooded gravel pits line the canal. At Drayton Bassett, an eccentric Grade II listed footbridge with Gothic-style towers crosses the canal, close to Drayton Manor Theme Park, after which Fazeley is reached, where the canal joins the Coventry Canal.

The stretch which extends northwards beyond Fazeley Junction to Whittington, near Lichfield, was built by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Company, with the remainder of the route to Fradley Junction being built by the Trent and Mersey Canal. Both sections used the route authorised by the Coventry Canal Act 1768 (8 Geo. 3. c. 36), but although the Coventry Canal subsequently bought back the northern section from the Trent and Mersey Canal, the southern section remained in the ownership of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. However, it is often regarded as being part of the Coventry Canal, with the Canal and River Trust quoting the length of that canal as being which includes the Birmingham and Fazeley section.

Historically the canal started at Farmer&#x27;s Bridge Top Lock (the real Farmer&#x27;s Bridge Junction), where it met the already existing Birmingham Canal Newhall Branch. That branch has now been built over, with only Cambrian Wharf surviving.

The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal forms part of the Warwickshire ring.

===Features===

At Common lock 10, on the lower lock tail, an inscription can be found in the stonework. It reads: &quot;Pax Missa Per Orbem, Pax Quaeritur Bello&quot;, which translates as &quot;Peace Is Sent Throughout The World, Peace Is Sought Through War&quot;. The inscription comes from two coins, the first part from the Queen Ann Farthing, and the second part from the Cromwell Broad.

<text>The Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal, later known as the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal, was a canal in the west of Scotland, running between Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone which later became a railway. Despite the name, the canal was never completed down to Ardrossan, the termini being Port Eglinton in Glasgow and Thorn Brae in Johnstone. Within months of opening, the canal was the scene of a major disaster.

==Construction==
The canal was first proposed by Hugh Montgomerie, 12th Earl of Eglinton in 1791. He wanted to connect the booming industrial towns of Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone to his new deep sea port at Ardrossan and his Ayrshire coal fields. His fellow shareholders included William Dixon of Govan who wished to export coal from his Govan colliery. The Earl had spent £100,000 on creating Ardrossan&#x27;s harbour and intended to make it the principal port for Glasgow. Interest was also shown by Lord Montgomerie and William Houston who would also benefit from the canal passing through their lands and connecting their own coal and iron mines to nearby industrial consumers. In this pre McAdam period, the roads around Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Ayrshire were not suitable for heavily loaded traffic. The other alternative route, up the Clyde river estuary to Glasgow, was not navigable by large ships as the river was too shallow.

Engineers John Rennie, Thomas Telford and John Ainslie were employed to design the canal, survey a route, and estimate the costs. The original design was in three parts. The first section would be a contour canal of about in length. Following the land, a contour canal is entirely level and requires no locks or lifts making navigation quick and easy. Contour canals require only a small water supply since no water is lost to locks, but this method of construction would make the canal longer than it need have been. The second section would see a series of 8 locks lift the level up to a summit near Johnstone. The third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at Ardrossan Harbour. When complete the canal have been just shy of long. The dimensions of the cutting were to be broad at the top and at bottom, . The depth was to be 4 feet 6 inches.
The Company of the Proprietors of the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal was incorporated by an act of Parliament, the (46 Geo. 3. c. lxxv) which received royal assent on 20 June. This bill allowed for funding to be raised by the sale of two thousand eight hundred shares of £50 each, a total of £140,000, of which the proprietors, the Earl of Eglinton, Lord Montgomerie and Lady Jane Montgomerie subscribed £30,000.

Construction began in 1807 and the first boat, the passenger boat, &quot;The Countess of Eglinton&quot;, was launched on 31 October 1810. The passenger service initially only ran between Paisley and Johnstone. The full length to Glasgow&#x27;s Port Eglinton was complete sometime in 1811. The original plans to extend the canal to Ardrossan were soon suspended. The costs of completing the first contour canal had consumed all the available funds – the initial estimates having been grossly understated. Further estimates indicated that £300,000 additional funding would need to be secured to complete the project. Hugh Montgomerie, 12th Earl of Eglinton, had already spent £100,000 on a separate project to build a sea harbour at Ardrossan, at the proposed terminus of the canal. The harbour project would eventually be competed by his grandson, the 13th Earl, for a total cost of £200,000. Attempts were made to raise extra funds but other major investors, such as William Houston, were reluctant to invest as the canal already linked his own coal and iron mines, around Johnstone, to Glasgow and Paisley.

==Operation==

The canal ran from Port Eglinton; and an inn was built there in 1816. A wharf was built on the north bank of the White Cart near Crookston Castle; and canal basins provided at Paisley and Johnstone.

===Passenger traffic===
The canal became a popular service for passenger transport.

In 1830, long, and shallow wrought iron canal boats began to run regularly, conveying about sixty passengers a distance of , at an average rate of , stoppages included. The boats reached speeds of , and although 14 journeys were made each day, no damage was caused to the canal banks by their wash.

This development was copied widely in the canal world, where they were known as swift boats or fly-boats, but it took the young John Scott Russell to explain the phenomenon and show its limits.

The Paisley canal passage boats were long and wide. With 90 passengers on board their draft was . The hull was constructed of light iron ribs and thin metal plates. The cabin was covered with oiled cloth. They covered the between Glasgow and Paisley in 50 minutes. They were towed by teams of two horses which were changed every .
====Deaths on the canal====

A few months before the canal saw its first traffic, poet Robert Tannahill drowned himself during a bout of depression, by throwing himself into a deep pit which carries the water of a stream down to a culvert under the canal. This came to be known as Tannahills Hole. A group of his poems had just been rejected by an Edinburgh publisher. He was well known for periods of depression. He burned many of his writings at this time. His body was found on 17 May 1810 in the Candren Burn tunnel under the canal.

Shortly after the canal&#x27;s opening, the Paisley canal disaster took the lives of 84 people, 52 males and 32 females. Saturday 10 November 1810 was the Martinmas Fair. Many people, with the day off work, took the opportunity to travel the short distance of by canal between Paisley and Johnstone. As &quot;The Countess of Eglinton&quot; docked at the Paisley wharf, there was a rush of people trying to get onto the boat. At the same time, people from Johnstone were attempting to disembark. Despite the attempts of the boat men to push off again, the weight of people pushing onto the boat caused it to suddenly overturn, throwing many passengers into the cold water of the wharf.

Even though the wharf was only deep, the coldness of the water and the sheer sides of the embankments compounded the problem that few people of the time could swim. 85 people died in this disaster.

===Freight traffic===
Freight also made a significant part of the traffic on the canal. Basin dues were set at 2 pence per ton. Stone, dung and earth were charged at 2 pence per mile per ton; coal, coke culm and lime were 3 pence per mile per ton; Bricks, tiles, slates, ores, iron and metal were rated at 5 pence per mile per ton; and all other goods were charged 2 pence per mile per ton. In 1840, the canal handled of goods.

===Profitability===
The construction costs were so high that the canal never made an issue of dividend on its shares. Even after 20 years of operations, the accounts showed an outstanding debt of £71,208, 17 shillings and 6 pence.

===Canal versus railway===
In 1827, a second bill passed Parliament and gained royal assent on 14 June as the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal and Railway Act 1827 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. lxxxvii). This act allowed for the financing and construction of a railway from the Johnstone canal basin to Ardrossan. This railway was to have been and 3 furlongs long. Parliament dictated that due to the failure to complete the canal past Johnstone, that work on the railway should be started at the Ardrossan harbour end. The line did not progress past Kilwinning before running out of funds. The railway, owned and operated by the canal company, was built to the Scotch gauge of . It used pairs of horses to pull carriages of up to 22 people each. The fares were initially 1 penny per mile but in 1837, due to the application of a government duty, the fare was raised to 8 pence per . In the three years preceding September 1839, the railway transported an average of 30,000 people each year. Apart from passengers, the main freight was coal from Eglinton&#x27;s mines.

The dredging of the River Clyde and other navigation improvements, allowing ships to sail directly to the centre of Glasgow, meant Eglinton&#x27;s dream that, &quot;Ardrossan would be to Glasgow what Liverpool is to Manchester.&quot; would not be fulfilled.

A second railway line was opened, in 1840, by the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway Company (GPK&amp;A), in direct competition with the canal. This new railway linked with the Ardrossan Railway near Kilwinning and later purchased the Ardrossan Railway, the railway company&#x27;s debts and the harbours. The canal continued to compete with the railways for many decades, but in 1869, was purchased by the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company (the successor to GPK&amp;A). In 1881, the Glasgow and South Western Railway Act 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. cxlix) closed the canal. Much of the route was used to construct the Paisley Canal railway line.

==Conversion to a railway==

===The Ardrossan Railway===
In the 1820s the canal company planned to build a railway between Johnstone and Ardrossan to finish the link. They raised further capital and started building the railway from Ardrossan; reaching Kilwinning before running out of money. In the 1830s they planned to turn their canal into a railway and complete the link from Kilwinning to Johnstone; but allowed the scheme to fold. In the 1840s they split off their railway, by the Ardrossan and Johnston Railway Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. civ) to form a separate company, the Ardrossan Railway, and transferred their debt to the new company.

===Closure of the canal===
The canal was purchased in 1869 by the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company. In 1881, the Glasgow and South-Western Railway Act 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. cxlix) closed the canal. Much of the route was used to construct the Paisley Canal Line. This line still uses the River Cart Aqueduct (which it crosses at a skewed angle). This makes the former aqueduct the world&#x27;s oldest railway bridge that is still in active use.

===Closure and partial reopening of the Paisley Canal Line===
The Paisley Canal railway line closed to passengers in 1983. The rails between Elderslie and the original Paisley Canal Station were uplifted in 1986; and the station became a steakhouse. In 1990, passenger services resumed on the section from Glasgow Central station to a new Paisley Canal station. Much of the abandoned track bed beyond Paisley has now been developed into a cycle and walkway operated by Sustrans.

Short sections of the original canal can still be seen at the Millarston and Ferguslie Mills area of Paisley. Houses in Tenters Way and Cromptons Grove face across the remnants. Traces of the old canal are also visible in fields between Hawkhead and Rosshall.

<text>In computing, tar is a computer software utility for collecting many files into one archive file, often referred to as a tarball, for distribution or backup purposes. The name is derived from &quot;tape archive&quot;, as it was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own, such as devices that use magnetic tape. The archive data sets created by tar contain various file system parameters, such as name, timestamps, ownership, file-access permissions, and directory organization. POSIX abandoned &quot;tar&quot; in favor of &quot;pax&quot;, yet &quot;tar&quot; sees continued widespread use.

==History==
The command-line utility was first introduced in the Version 7 Unix in January 1979, replacing the tp program (which in turn replaced &quot;tap&quot;). The file structure to store this information was standardized in POSIX.1-1988 and later POSIX.1-2001, and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems. The tar command was abandoned in POSIX.1-2001 in favor of pax command, which was to support ustar file format; the tar command was indicated for withdrawal in favor of pax command at least since 1994.

Today, Unix-like operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as xz, gzip, and bzip2.

The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

BSD-tar has been included in Microsoft Windows since Windows 10 April 2018 Update, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.

==Rationale==
Many historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving). Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks. Also, when writing to any medium such as a file system or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks. Therefore, the tar command writes data in records of many 512 B blocks. The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of blocks per record. The default is 20, producing 10 KiB records.

==File format==
There are multiple tar file formats, including historical and current ones. Two tar formats are codified in POSIX: ustar and pax. Not codified but still in current use is the GNU tar format.

A tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term &quot;tarball&quot;, referencing how a tarball collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface. Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte header record. The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros. The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records. (The origin of tar&#x27;s record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.

===Header===
The file header record contains metadata about a file. To ensure portability across different architectures with different byte orderings, the information in the header record is encoded in ASCII. Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many NUL characters).

The fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below. The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions. When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes. The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record. There is no &quot;magic number&quot; in the header, for file identification.

Pre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:
The pre-POSIX.1-1988 Link indicator field can have the following values:

Some pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing slash (/) in the name.

Numeric values are encoded in octal numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes. For historical reasons, a final NUL or space character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored. This gives a maximum file size of 8 gigabytes on archived files. To overcome this limitation, in 2001 star introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.

The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ASCII spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.

Unix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file. If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the &quot;name of linked file&quot; field set to the first one&#x27;s name. On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.

===UStar format===
Most modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (&quot;Unix Standard TAR&quot;) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988. It introduced additional header fields. Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the &quot;ustar&quot; string to determine if the new format is in use. 

The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file. The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path &quot;filename prefix&quot; and the filename itself, so can be much less.

The &quot;type flag&quot; field can have the following values:

POSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values &#x27;A&#x27;–&#x27;Z&#x27; partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen as outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.

Type &#x27;7&#x27; (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the MASSCOMP RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.

===POSIX.1-2001/pax===
In 1997, Sun proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as &quot;extended tar&quot; format or pax format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:
* atime, mtime: all timestamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)
* path: path names of unlimited length and character set coding
* linkpath: symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding
* uname, gname: user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding
* size: files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)
* uid, gid: userid and groupid without size limitation (the historic tar format is limited to a max. id of 2097151)
* a character set definition for path names and user/group names (UTF-8)

In 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write it as its default output from the tar program yet.

The pax format is designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read the pax format as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special or type files, typically under a directory. A pax-supporting implementation would make use of the information, while non-supporting ones like 7-Zip would process them as additional files.

== Features of the archival utilities ==
Besides creating and extracting archives, the functionality of the various archival utilities varies. For example, implementations might automatically detect the format of compressed TAR archives for extraction so the user does not have to specify it, and let the user limit adding files to those modified after a specified date.

==Uses==
=== Command syntax ===
 tar [-options] &lt;name of the tar archive&gt; [files or directories which to add into archive]
Basic options:
* codice_1 — create a new archive;
* codice_2 — additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive&#x27;s name ends with then use gzip, if then use xz, for Zstandard etc.;
* codice_3 — append files to the end of an archive;
* codice_4 — extract files from an archive;
* codice_5 — specify the archive&#x27;s name;
* codice_6 — show a list of files and folders in the archive;
* codice_7 — show a list of processed files.

=== Basic usage ===
Create an archive file from the file and directory :

$ tar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src
Extract contents for the into the current directory:

$ tar -xvf archive.tar
Create an archive file from the file and directory and compress it with gzip :

$ tar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src
Extract contents for the into the current directory:

$ tar -xvf archive.tar.gz
===Tarpipe===
A tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the standard output file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its standard input, working in another directory, where it is unpacked. This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:

$ tar cf - srcdir | tar x -C destdir
===Software distribution===
The tar format continues to be used extensively for open-source software distribution. *NIX-distributions use it in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software source code made available in compressed tar archives.

==Limitations==
The original tar format was created in the early days of Unix, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.

Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.

=== File names ===
Due to the field size, the original TAR format was unable to store file paths and names in excess of 100 characters.

To overcome this problem while maintaining readability by existing TAR utilities, GNU tar stores file paths and names in excess of the 100 characters are stored in codice_8 entries that would be seen as ordinary files by TAR utilities unaware of this feature. Similarly, the PAX format uses codice_9 entries.

=== Attributes ===
Many older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or access-control lists (ACLs). In 2001, Star introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax. bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs. More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions. A number of extensions are reviewed in the filetype manual for BSD tar, tar(5).

===Tarbomb===

A tarbomb, in hacker slang, is a tarball containing a large number of items whose contents are written to the current directory or some other existing directory when untarred instead of the directory created by the tarball specifically for the extracted outputs. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory&#x27;s other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive&#x27;s creator.

A related problem is the use of absolute paths or parent directory references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag or the option . The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on Mac OS X v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.
If a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command codice_10, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards. These commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it—or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. Vim can open tar archives and display their contents. GNU Emacs is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a dired buffer.

===Random access===
The tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. Instead, the metadata for each file (such as name, size, time stamps) for each file is stored in a header before each file. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.

In turn, this design makes TAR archives resilient against damage from missing portions, in both the form of digital files and physical tape. A truncated TAR file with missing parts on either ends still allows recovering the parts that are not missing, including the file paths and file names and metadata, by starting from the first TAR header that is not missing.

With a well-formed tar file stored on a seekable (i.e. allows efficient random reads) medium, the program can still relatively quickly (in linear time relative to file count) look for a file by skipping file reads according to the &quot;size&quot; field in the file headers. This is the basis for option in GNU tar. When a tar file is compressed whole, the compression format, being usually non-seekable, prevents this optimization from being done. There is at least one decompressor (libarchive) that implements the same functionality for compressed .tar.gz files using a &quot;seek-through-archive&quot; technique (the read and unpacked tar headers are used to jump directly to the next file, avoiding all intermediate read operations). To maintain seekability, tar files must be also concatenated properly, by removing the trailing zero block at the end of each file.

===Duplicates===
Another issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical paths and filenames. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.

This can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring to parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a symlink to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).

==Key implementations==
Historically, many systems have implemented tar, and many general file archivers have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the &quot;tar wars&quot;. Most tar implementations can also read and create cpio and pax (the latter actually is a &quot;tar&quot;-format with POSIX-2001-extensions).

Key implementations in order of origin:
* Solaris tar, based on the original Unix V7 tar and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system
* GNU tar is the default on most Linux distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.
* FreeBSD tar (also BSD tar) has become the default tar on most Berkeley Software Distribution-based operating systems including Mac OS X. The core functionality is available as libarchive for inclusion in other applications. This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, rar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.
* Schily tar, better known as star (, ), is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. First published in April 1997, its developer has stated that he began development in 1982.
* Python tarfile module supports multiple tar formats, including ustar, pax and gnu; it can read but not create V7 format and the SunOS tar extended format; pax is the default format for creation of archives. Available since 2003.

Additionally, most pax and cpio implementations can read and create multiple types of tar files.

==Suffixes for compressed files==
&quot;tar&quot; archive files usually have the file suffix &quot;.tar&quot; (e.g. &quot;somefile.tar&quot;).

A tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of compression programs are available, such as gzip, bzip2, xz, lzip, lzma, zstd, or compress, which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive &quot;archive.tar&quot;, is named &quot;archive.tar.gz&quot;, when it is compressed by gzip.

Popular tar programs like the BSD and GNU versions of tar support the command line options &quot;Z&quot; (compress), &quot;z&quot; (gzip), and &quot;j&quot; (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. Relatively recent additions include &quot;--lzma&quot; (LZMA), &quot;--lzop&quot; (lzop), &quot;--xz&quot; or &quot;J&quot; (xz), &quot;--lzip&quot; (lzip), and &quot;--zstd&quot;. The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option &quot;--auto-compress&quot; (short form &quot;-a&quot;) is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar. BSD tar detects an even wider range of compressors (lrzip, lz4), using not the filename but the data within. Unrecognized formats are to be manually compressed or decompressed by piping.

MS-DOS&#x27;s 8.3 filename limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. However, this practice has declined with FAT now offering long filenames.

<doc id="151695" wikidata="Q7709951" url="?curid=151695" title="Thames and Medway Canal">
<text>The Thames and Medway Canal is a disused canal in Kent, south east England, also known as the Gravesend and Rochester Canal. It was originally some long and cut across the neck of the Hoo peninsula, linking the River Thames at Gravesend with the River Medway at Strood. The canal was first mooted in 1778 as a shortcut for military craft from Deptford and Woolwich Dockyards on the Thames to Chatham Dockyard on the Medway, avoiding the journey round the peninsula and through the Thames estuary. The canal was also intended to take commercial traffic between the two rivers.

==Construction==

The first practical attempt to build the canal began in 1799, when Ralph Dodd published a pamphlet and began to solicit investment for the scheme. Dodd&#x27;s plan was for a canal with locks and basins, taking two years to build and costing £24,576, part of the cost to be defrayed by selling the excavated chalk as agricultural lime. Dodd was confident that the canal would be useful to the government but would also attract commercial vessels.
In 1800 the canal company received the necessary act of Parliament, the (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. xxiii), and work began at the Gravesend end. The estimated cost had now risen to £57,433.
From the Gravesend basin, the canal began with a straight section aligned with New Tavern Fort, Gravesend. By 1801 it ran to Higham. A new engineer, Ralph Walker, arrived and announced that the whole canal would cost significantly more than the revised estimate. Work halted, and by 1804 Dodd had probably left the project. Over the next few years, Walker suggested two new routes for the Higham to Strood stretch, for which acts of Parliament were obtained and money raised. His second route was decided on but required a tunnel through the chalk hills; work on this did not start until 1819. The canal finally opened on 14 October 1824, by which time the Napoleonic wars were long over and the military need had greatly diminished. The canal had taken five acts of Parliament and cost some £260,000.

==Operating problems==

The canal was wide and carried the Thames sailing barges common on both rivers. It was intended that the canal would be used for the transport of hops and other locally grown produce, but it was not a commercial success. It had locks at each end to protect the water level from tidal change, but the canal walls leaked and the water level dropped between every spring tide. A steam-driven pumping station was built to rectify this. 
Complaints then came from barge-owners that the tunnel was slow to use, so in 1830 it was shut for two months while an open-air passing place was dug in the middle. This 100-yard long cutting divided the tunnel into a separate Higham tunnel and Strood tunnel. The canal tolls reflected these improvements, but if a boat missed the tide it would have to wait in the canal basin for longer than the journey round Hoo would have taken.

==Higham and Strood tunnel==

The Higham and Strood tunnel is long, and was the second longest canal tunnel built in the UK (the longest is the Standedge Canal Tunnel). It was also the largest: high from arch to canal bed, wide at the water line, a further wide at towpath level, and had water deep. These dimensions could accommodate a 60 tonne sailing barge with its mast lowered.

The tunnel was dug through the chalk using only hand tools, but occasionally gunpowder was used. Several workmen were killed in rockfalls. It was considered an engineering wonder of its time.

The tunnel is so perfectly straight, that a person placed at one end, may discern a small light entering at the other extremity [...] On the opening of the tunnel, a small steam passage boat was employed for the conveyance of passengers from Gravesend to Rochester, and vice versa; but as it was found to injure the towing-path of the tunnel, as well as the banks of the canal, it was discontinued. Foot passengers, however, still pass to and fro, though some caution is necessary, to avoid coming into contact with the horse, or horses, towing the barges.
—Tallis Directory
 1839

===Sharing with the railway===

From 1845 the newly built railway between Gravesend and Strood shared the tunnel with the canal, a single track resting partially on the towpath and partially on wooden stakes in the water.

The ride through the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal beneath us, and an insecure chalk roof above our heads, enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine&#x27;s vaporous lungs, and the unceasing rattle of the train, is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us, relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed by the fall of some twenty tons of chalk from above, or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath, with the doors of the carriages locked and no &quot;Nautilus belt&quot; around our waists and not even a child&#x27;s caul in our pocket. This relief is however temporary, for the light only breaks in through a gap in the tunnel, and some more experienced traveller informs us we are only half out of it. However, our journey is brought to a close without any accident: and we embark on the steamer that is to deposit us at Chatham. 
—William Orr, 1847
In 1846 the canal company sold the tunnel to the South Eastern Railway company, which filled the canal and laid a double railway track over it. This was part of the North Kent Line. The canal towing contractor&#x27;s home was converted into the ticket office for Higham railway station.

Orr&#x27;s fears of a chalk fall, however, were not unfounded. Over the years, there have been many roof falls, most small. But in December 1999 a fall near Strood derailed a train, fortunately without causing serious injuries (but leaving a hole in the ground in an orchard). Some 60% of the tunnel had by this date been lined: in 2004 it was closed to line the remainder and renew the track, reopening a year later on 17 January 2005.

==1846 to today==

The remainder of the canal, between Higham and Gravesend, continued to be used until 1934. It suffered bomb damage during World War II, and some areas have been back-filled or are choked with reed growth. The Strood canal basin, long orphaned by the loss of the tunnel, was back-filled in 1986 and has now been built over.

Since 1976 the canal has been in the hands of the Thames &amp; Medway Canal Association (TMCA), which has dredged some areas. British Rail restored one of the swing bridges. The towpath has recently been renovated for use by pedestrians and cyclists. It now forms part of Route 1 of the National Cycle Network from Dover to John o&#x27; Groats. For walkers, it forms part of circular walks linked to the Saxon Shore Way.

There are now plans to fully renovate the canal and make it a focal point of development in Gravesend, to benefit the town while meeting the Thames Gateway project&#x27;s demands for housebuilding. In October 2004, the Gravesend canal basin was dredged, after which the lock gates into the Thames were renovated, enabling the basin to be used by boats from the river. The line of the canal has been protected from development since 1992.

<text>The Thames and Severn Canal is a canal in Gloucestershire in the south-west of England, which was completed in 1789. It was conceived as part of a cargo route from Bristol and the Midlands to London, linking England&#x27;s two largest rivers for better trade. The route climbs the steep Cotswold escarpment through the Golden Valley, tunnels underneath the summit of the Cotswold Edge, and emerges near the source of the Thames.

At its eastern end, it connects to the top of the navigable Thames at Inglesham Lock near Lechlade, while at its western end, it connects to the Stroudwater Navigation at Wallbridge near Stroud, and thence to the River Severn. It had one short arm (branch), from Siddington to the town of Cirencester. It includes Sapperton Tunnel, which when built was the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and remains the second-longest complete tunnel. There were always problems with water supply, as no reservoirs were built, while the summit section near the tunnel ran through porous limestone, and there were constant difficulties with leakage. Competition from the railways took much of the canal&#x27;s traffic by the end of the 19th century, and most of the canal was abandoned in 1927, the remainder in 1941.

Since 1972, the Cotswold Canals Trust has been working to restore both the canal and the Stroudwater Navigation to navigably re-link the Thames and the Severn. A number of the structures have been restored, and some sections are now in water. A major step forward occurred in 2003, when a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both canals. The bid and the project had to be split into smaller sections, but £11.9 million was awarded in 2006 for Phase 1A, which with matched funding has restored from The Ocean at Stonehouse to Wallbridge on the Stroudwater Navigation, and from there to Stroud Brewery on the Thames and Severn Canal. The Phase 1B reconnection to the national waterways network at Saul Junction is expected to be completed by 2028, connecting the Severn with the Golden Valley for the first time in a century.

In 2010, British Waterways gave Inglesham Lock to the Trust, and the Inland Waterways Association mounted a national campaign to fund its restoration (and of canal above). To re-open the whole canal some major engineering obstacles will need to be overcome.

==History==
Since the 1730s, when the first act of Parliament to authorize a canal from the River Severn to Stroud had been passed, the Stroudwater Navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link London and Bristol by waterway. No work took place immediately, but the Stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779, and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from Dudbridge to Cricklade, which would complete the link. It is likely that John Priddy – previously the engineer for the Stroudwater scheme – carried out the survey, but others were soon involved including Sir Edward Littleton, who was connected with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Priddy suggested that there were better terminal points at Wallbridge and Lechlade. Robert Whitworth then surveyed two routes, the first as suggested by Priddy, and the second direct from the Severn to the Thames following the valley of the River Coln. The first route was chosen, based on excellent water supplies at Cirencester, although the estimates of the amount of water available proved to be wildly optimistic.

The estimated cost of the project was £127,916, most of which was promised within three weeks. The bill to authorise the canal passed through Parliament relatively easily, and became an the (23 Geo. 3. c. 38) on 17 April 1783. The company could raise an initial £130,000, with an additional £60,000 if required. The canal was to be suitable for boats wide, and so could accommodate Thames barges, but not Severn trows. Josiah Clowes was appointed head engineer, surveyor and carpenter to the canal in 1783 to assist Whitworth. Clowes became resident engineer and was paid £300 per year. His work on the canal gave him a reputation that made him highly sought after in the last five years of his life. He left the construction of the canal shortly before its completion, to work on Dudley Tunnel.

There was great debate about the gauge of the tunnel required at Sapperton. Commissioners from the River Thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats, since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive. It was also going to be longer than any tunnel yet built. However, a decision was made that it would be built as a broad tunnel, wide and high, and so the company advertised for tunnellers. The tunnel was expected to take four years to complete when work began at the start of 1784, but it was not completed until April 1789.

The canal opened in stages as it was completed. The first from Wallbridge to Chalford opened in January 1785, and by mid-1786, the navigable section had reached the western portal of the tunnel, and 28 locks from Wallbridge. A wharf was built at Daneway Bridge, equipped with a warehouse and coalyard.
The tunnel was constructed from many workfaces, with 25 shafts sunk along its course to provide access. After completion there were problems, and the tunnel was shut for two and a half months during 1790 for further work to be carried out. The summit level and the branch to Cirencester were completed in 1787, and became operational as soon as the tunnel opened. The final section to the junction with the Thames at Inglesham, which descends through 16 locks, was finished in November 1789. The canal was completed at a cost of £250,000. With the Stroudwater Navigation, which had been completed in 1779, it completed a link between the River Severn in the west and the River Thames in the east.

As built, the main line was just under long and had 44 locks. The branch to Cirencester added a further . The first from Wallbridge to Brimscombe, where there was a transhipment basin, was built with locks , enabling Severn trows to use it. Beyond that, the locks were and the boats used were Thames barges. The canal&#x27;s summit, which is above sea level and long, includes the Sapperton Tunnel, at the time, the longest in England. Its length has only been exceeded by two other canal tunnels, at Standedge in the Pennines and at Strood in Kent.

===Operation===
Until the summit level was completed, little thought seems to have been given to water supply. It was assumed that the River Frome, to the west of the tunnel, the River Churn which flows through Cirencester, and the River Coln, together with springs at Boxwell and a well near the source of the River Thames at Thames Head, would be sufficient. The original horse pump at Thames Head was replaced by a windmill, but Clowes found that he could not stop the summit pound from leaking. The flow on the River Churn was , whereas the calculated flow at the start of the project had been more than ten times this value. The summit level was losing around , largely because the underlying rock was porous limestone, and it was estimated that around half of the daily requirement could actually be supplied. The wells at Thames Head were extended and a Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine was installed in 1792 to pump the water into the canal. An extra, shallow lock was built at Boxwell, which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it, and more water to be taken from Boxwell springs. The new arrangements were adequate, although some of the reason was the failure of traffic to develop to the levels anticipated.

Leakage was affected by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed. In summer, when the springs receded, water was lost through these holes at a rate greater than the available supply. In one of the attempts to conserve water, the length of the locks was reduced by , giving them an unusual double-headed appearance. In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King&#x27;s Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay. The concrete invert was thick, and A. Brome Wilson, the canal&#x27;s engineer, used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal, but at a level above the waterline.

Neither of the river navigations to which the canal connected were satisfactory. In the west, the situation was remedied in 1827, on completion of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. On the Thames, there had been a proposal for a canal from Lechlade to Abingdon in 1784, and for a cut from Inglesham to Buscot in 1788, but neither had been built. Some improvements were made to the river after 1786, but the canal company encouraged the building of bypasses. The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal was one Thames bypass, providing a link to the river at Abingdon, but did not initially connect to the Thames &amp; Severn Canal. Although it was proposed in 1793, it was not opened until 1810, and the North Wilts Canal, which eventually provided the connecting link from Latton to Swindon for Thames &amp; Severn traffic to bypass the upper river, was not completed until 1819. Even after this, vessels were restricted by the narrow 7ft width of the North Wilts, which was considerably smaller than the rest of the link between the Thames and the Severn, limiting income from cargo.

Ultimately, most of the Bristol to London trade used the Kennet and Avon Canal after it opened in 1810, as it provided a much shorter route than the Thames and Severn Canal. Similarly, the Midlands-London traffic that the proprietors had hoped to attract via the Severn found newer routes further east, such as the Grand Junction Canal, considerably more direct. Thus, the compromise alignment of the Thames &amp; Severn found itself bypassed, with income mainly generated by carriage of Forest of Dean coal to places along the canal rather than the balanced trade of long-distance traffic between Thames and Severn that had been anticipated. Pleasure cruising, meanwhile, was firmly discouraged, with the proprietors setting a punitive toll of £1 per lock for such boats (equivalent to over £120 today).

===Decline===
Railway competition began in 1836, when the Cheltenham and Great Western Railway proposed a line between Swindon and Cheltenham, via Gloucester. The canal company opposed the scheme, and received compensation of £7,500 from the railway company over the next four and a half years. The line opened to Kemble in 1841, and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway&#x27;s construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time. The railway company was then taken over by the Great Western Railway, who built a new tunnel at Sapperton, and opened the railway to Gloucester in 1845. Canal tolls were cut in an attempt to retain traffic, but toll revenue fell from £11,000 to £2,874 between 1841 and 1855. The Thames Commissioners were also in financial difficulties, and the Thames was almost unnavigable from Oxford to Lechlade after 1855. In 1866, plans to convert the canal to a railway were rejected by Parliament, but the Thames Commissioners were replaced by the Thames Conservancy, and most of the river was soon returned to a navigable state.


The condition of the canal continued to decline. Complaints were made about its state in 1874 and 1885, which resulted in surveys being undertaken, but little was done to remedy the situation. In 1893, the Thames and Severn company announced that the canal between Chalford and Inglesham would close two days later. Negotiations with a number of interested parties took place, and having given an assurance to the Great Western Railway that it would not be converted into a railway, an act of Parliament was obtained in 1895, the (58 &amp; 59 Vict. c. cxlix), which formed a trust with powers to raise £15,000. The trust included representatives from the Sharpness New Docks &amp; Gloucester &amp; Birmingham Company, the Stroudwater Canal, the Staffs &amp; Worcs Canal, the Severn Commissioners, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire county councils, and Stroud and Cirencester district councils. At the same time as the trust refurbished the canal, the upper Thames was upgraded by the Thames Conservancy.
Although the canal was re-opened in March 1899, lack of water on the summit level soon closed it again, after which Gloucestershire County Council suggested that they take it over, which was the first instance of a public body taking over a waterway in the public interest. They did so on 2 July 1901, by the (1 Edw. 7. c. iii). In 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from Chalford to Inglesham in 1927. The Stroudwater Navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933, when it was abandoned, and their own canal closed in 1941.

==Restoration==

Following the publication of Ronald Russell&#x27;s influential book &quot;Lost Canals of England and Wales&quot; in 1972, a number of canal restoration schemes sprang up. Among the organisations established that year was the Stroudwater Canal Society, which soon became the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust, and from 1975, the Cotswold Canals Trust. Volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. Extensive lobbying in 1979 resulted in Gloucestershire County Council deciding to rebuild a damaged bridge at Daneway, rather than replace it with a much cheaper low-level causeway, which would have severed the route. Two years later, County Council support was required when the project benefited from 20 workers and a £17,000 budget for materials under the Job Creation Scheme set up by the Manpower Services Commission, as the council had to manage the scheme.

In 1991, the trust commissioned the engineering consultancy Sir William Halcrow and Partners to conduct a feasibility study for restoration of the eastern end of the canal. Funding was provided by the National Rivers Authority, local authorities, and other interested parties. The report demonstrated that there was a good case for the provision of a navigable culvert beneath the proposed Latton Bypass. Despite initially saying that a culvert would not be built, negotiation continued, and – helped by grants of £250,000 from Gloucestershire County Council and £125,000 from North Wilts District Council – the Department of the Environment decided in 1997 that a culvert would be provided under the road. The completed underpass now lies buried, awaiting the arrival of restoration work on either side.

===Funding===
In order to provide a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established in 2001, drawing together people representing the Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, and a number of other interested parties. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled &quot;Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain&#x27;s Inland Navigation Network&quot;, and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways&#x27; &quot;Unlocked and Unlimited&quot; conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project was £82 million. Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged the money with the Waterways Trust, in the hope that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the full-time Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid.

By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were managing the application, to split the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency. Alongside these major developments, the Cotswold Canals Trust has rebuilt a number of locks and bridges and some small sections of the rest of the route are now in water.

With the restoration underway, British Waterways pulled out of the partnership in 2008 because of financial difficulties. The role of project leader was taken over by Stroud District Council, and a new body, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company, was created in March 2009 to act as a holding company for the assets of the waterway, with a responsibility to manage and maintain it once it is reopened. They now own most of the canal bed between Wallbridge and Brimscombe. The cost of the restoration exceeded estimates, and as a result, the Heritage Lottery Fund agreed to supply an additional £800,000 in December 2012, to allow full restoration between Stonehouse and Bowbridge, and the upgrading of the towpath onwards to Brimscombe Port. Work on the canal beyond Bowbridge would be handled by volunteers.

===Progress===
The restoration programme is divided into several phases. Phase 1a covers of the most difficult section to restore, centred on Stroud, comprising the lengths of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. Phase 1b connects the completed Phase 1a section, westwards, to the rest of the inland waterways network, at Saul Junction on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. Phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal, between Gateway Bridge in the Cotswold Water Park (Cerney Wick), and Inglesham Lock, the junction with the Thames. It will form a link between the upper Thames, the North Wilts Canal and the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal. Phase 3 completes the project, connecting Brimscombe Port in the west with Gateway Bridge in the east, via Sapperton Tunnel.

====Phase 1a====

Phase 1a of the restoration programme covered the length of canal from The Ocean at Stonehouse, on the Stroudwater Navigation, to Brimscombe Port, east of Stroud, on the Thames and Severn Canal – a length of about . The work included restoration of 10 locks, reconstruction of 10 bridges, and reinstatement of about of in-filled canal; plus the major reconstruction of Brimscombe Port. Funding was in place for all of the scheduled work, but increasing costs curtailed the programme. A revised plan – with increased support from volunteer labour – aimed to have restoration completed to Bowbridge by the end of 2015, with all major work eastwards put on hold. Phase 1a also included the provision of a multi-user trail between Stonehouse and Saul, but this was held over to Phase 1b.

The final section of the canal before it joins the Stroudwater Navigation presented particular problems for restoration, as the channel had been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the Environment Agency. Water from Slad Brook, which is culverted beneath Stroud, joins the canal a short distance above Lower Wallbridge Lock. Painswick Stream and Ruscombe Brook join the channel below the junction and flow through the Dudbridge locks, after which the water is discharged into the River Frome below the A419 Dudbridge Road bridge. As a consequence of its flood relief function, the channel here is classified as a &quot;main river&quot;. Designs for reinstatement of the canal had to accommodate large flows on this section, and include underground bywash culverts, capable of carrying the full flood flow of the streams.

At Capels Mill, the bed of the canal was used as the route for the Stroud Bypass in the 1980s, and so a diversion had to be built at this point. It passes through an area that was used as a landfill site in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of new channel was constructed, some of it edged with sheet piling. After passing through a railway viaduct, the bank is supported by a series of contiguous concrete piles, which were drilled to a depth of between and and provide a retaining wall which is tall at its highest point. As the project neared completion, open days to allow the public to walk along the bottom of the new canal section were held on 10 and 11 May 2013, and were attended by over 1,800 people. Where domestic rubbish had to be removed, it was relocated on the site, covered with of crushed recycled concrete and a layer of Bentomat geotextile, which was topped by subsoil and topsoil obtained from elsewhere on the site. Tubular vents allow any methane produced by the disturbed rubbish to escape safely. The new section was filled with water and officially completed on 2 June 2013.

An evaluation cruise was held on 10 November 2017, when the maintenance boat &quot;Wookey Hole&quot; carried three assessors from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the chief executive from Stroud District Council and their canal project manager, the Mayor of Stroud, and the Cotswold Canal Trust chief executive and vice-chair. It travelled from The Ocean at Stonebridge eastwards to Bowbridge Lock, with a stop for lunch at Upper Wallbridge Lock. The cruise enabled the HLF assessors to view the work done and to sign off the Phase 1a project, bringing it to a conclusion. An official opening of Wallbridge Lower Lock took place on 2 February 2018, when Prince Charles cut a ribbon to celebrate the reconnection of the Thames and Severn Canal with the Stroudwater Navigation, and unveiled a commemorative plaque.

During the execution of the phase 1a project, it became obvious that there would be a shortfall in funding, caused in part by the development of Brimscombe Port being deferred. Thus the Heritage Lottery funded works ended at Bowbridge Lock, and work up to Hope Mill Lock has been undertaken largely by volunteers. Some work to prepare the Brimscombe Port site for development was funded by a £2 million grant from the Homes &amp; Communities Agency given in October 2015. Volunteers completed restoration of Griffin&#x27;s Mill Lock in 2017, but dredging of the intervening channel took rather longer, and the lock was opened on 9 July 2018. Work had already begun on the restoration of Ham Mill Lock, the next one upstream. In a separate development, water supply to the restored section was improved by building a feeder siphon at Gough&#x27;s Orchard Lock, which takes water from a millpond supplied by the River Frome and feeds it into the lock. The pipeline runs over the top of the canal bank, and a solar-powered pump creates a vacuum within the pipe to allow the siphoning to begin. The volume of water taken is regulated by a gate valve, and is governed by an abstraction licence issued by the Environment Agency.

====Phase 1b====

The second phase of the restoration programme covers the length of the Stroudwater Navigation between the Ocean Railway Bridge, Stonehouse, and Saul Junction on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, a distance of about . The simpler work includes construction of two new locks, restoration of a further six locks, construction of several minor road bridges, and reinstatement of about of in-filled canal. This section poses some significant engineering problems. A new railway bridge was required at Stonehouse, where the canal had been culverted underneath the Bristol–Birmingham line. Since the canal was abandoned, the River Frome and the Oldbury Brook have both been diverted to use part of the canal bed. Most significantly, the original route has been divided by both the construction of the M5 motorway and development of the A38 trunk road. Plans to overcome these obstacles were produced, in anticipation of the necessary funding becoming available.

Bids for Heritage Lottery funding were rejected in May 2012 and November 2015. A revised bid was submitted in November 2017, and following criticism of the lack of investment by partners in the project, was backed by a promise of £3 million from Stroud District Council, £700,000 from Gloucestershire County Council and £675,000 from the Canal &amp; River Trust, who also pledged practical support. In addition, the Cotswold Canals Trust offered financial assistance and volunteer labour. A development grant of £0.8 million was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund in April 2018, which led to the award of £8.9 million in October 2020. A further boost was the granting of £4 million from Highways England in May 2019, to cover the cost of tunnelling under the A38 roundabout and other environmental projects along the &quot;missing mile&quot;, the new route of the canal to replace the section obliterated by road construction and infilling. Phase 1b, which became known as Cotswold Canals Connected in 2018, is expected to be completed by 2028.

Stroud District Council decided that the infrastructure costs for the development of Brimscombe Port were too high to entice developers to the scheme, and made a bid to Homes England in 2015 for public funding. They received £2 million from this source, to which they added another £2 million as match funding. They also received £776,000 from the One Public Estate Land Release Fund, which is given for the development of brownfield sites. Planning permission was obtained on 24 March 2021 for the development of the port, including reinstatement of the canal, basin and various bridge works. The initial work includes demolition of modern additions to Port Mill, so that a new canal channel and river bed can be constructed further to the south than formerly, with the new river channel replacing the previous culvert under the modern parts of Port Mill. In July 2022, the council selected St. Modwen Homes as the developer to work on the project.

====Phase 2====
Restoration programme phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal, between Gateway Bridge in the Cotswold Water Park (Cerney Wick), and the junction with the Thames at Inglesham Lock, a distance of about . The section does not pose the major engineering challenges faced elsewhere, but land ownership is an issue, and there are several miles of infilled canal around Kempsford. Funding is only in place for minor projects, but several locks have been substantially restored, lengths of towpath reconstructed, and dredging completed.

In 2002, British Waterways bought the lock at Inglesham and the adjacent round house, to safeguard the route of the canal. After they pulled out of the restoration scheme, they sold the house, which was bought by a member of the Cotswold Canals Trust, and transferred the ownership of the lock to the trust. In June 2010 the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) mounted a national campaign for £125,000 to enable Inglesham Lock and around of the pound above it to be restored. Work on the refurbishment of the lock structure began in 2016 and was completed in May 2019, with some tidying up of the site continuing until September.

====Phase 3====
The completion of the project is outlined in phase 3, to connect Brimscombe Port in the west with Gateway Bridge in the east, a distance of about . Restoring this central section poses several major engineering difficulties: firstly to overcome the water supply that was always inadequate, and secondly because the Sapperton Tunnel is blocked by two rock falls. In addition, there are two missing railway bridges, an aqueduct, and 31 locks to rebuild. As of May 2015, there was no significant funding in place for any restoration projects on this section of the canal.

Parts of the tunnel are in good condition, where it has been cut through stable rock, either Great Oolite limestone at the Coates end, or Inferior Oolite towards the Daneway end. However, a length of near the middle of the tunnel and at the Daneway end are cut through fuller&#x27;s earth, and although lined with brick, the fuller&#x27;s earth expands when wet, and this has resulted in heave of the bottom of the tunnel, causing wall and roof falls.

==Structures==
A number of the buildings associated with the canal have survived and appear on the listed building register, including five circular cottages, built with three floors. The lower floor was intended to be used as a store and has access to the outside. A set of outside steps leads up to the first floor, which is around in diameter. It was designed as a living area and was equipped with a cooking range. A staircase, built between the inner and outer wall, leads up to a circular bedroom on the second floor. The round houses are situated at Lechlade (the Round House, Inglesham), by the entrance lock from the Thames; at Marston Meysey; at Cerney Wick near Latton, next to lock 39; at Coates, close to the eastern portal of the tunnel; and at Chalford, next to lock 13. Some had a pointed slate roof, while others had a lead cone, which collected rainwater for drinking. They were built in the 1790s for use by lock-keepers and lengthsmen, but were not particularly popular due to the limited amount of space and problems with finding suitable furniture for a circular room.

==Literary connections==
In 1953, C. S. Forester published &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot;, a historical novel set during the Napoleonic Wars, in which Horatio Hornblower, a captain in the Royal Navy, travels along the canal to London. He assists with legging the boat through the Sapperton tunnel and then steering it after the postillion in charge of the horses is injured.

<text>The Trent and Mersey Canal is a canal in Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in north-central England. It is a &quot;narrow canal&quot; for the vast majority of its length, but at the extremities to the east of Burton upon Trent and north of Middlewich, it is a wide canal.

The narrow locks and bridges are big enough for a single narrowboat wide by long, while the wide locks can accommodate boats wide, or two narrowboats next to each other.

==History==

The Trent and Mersey Canal (T&amp;M) was built to link the River Trent at Derwent Mouth in Derbyshire to the River Mersey, and thereby provide an inland route between the major ports of Hull and Liverpool. The Mersey connection is made via the Bridgewater Canal, which it joins at Preston Brook in Cheshire. Although mileposts measure the distance to Preston Brook and Shardlow, Derwent Mouth is about beyond Shardlow.
The plan of a canal connection from the Mersey to the Trent (&quot;The Grand Trunk&quot;) came from canal engineer James Brindley. It was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 3. c. 96) and the first sod was cut by Josiah Wedgwood in July that year at Brownhills, Burslem. In 1777, the canal was completed, including more than 70 locks and five tunnels, with the company headquarters in Stone.

The first known idea to build a canal between the River Mersey and the River Trent was put forward in 1755, though no action was taken at that time. In 1760, Lord Gower, a local businessman and brother-in-law of the Duke of Bridgewater, drew up a plan for the Trent and Mersey Canal. If his plan had gone ahead, this would have been the first modern canal constructed in England. James Brindley, the engineer behind many of the canals in England, did his first canal work on the Trent and Mersey, though his first job in charge of construction was on the Bridgewater Canal.

In 1761, Josiah Wedgwood showed an interest in the construction of a canal through Stoke-on-Trent, the location of his Wedgwood pottery, as his business depended on the safe and smooth transport of his pots. Pots transported by road were liable to be damaged and broken, and a canal near to his factory would provide fast and safe transport for his wares. Wedgwood&#x27;s plan was not to connect the two rivers by canal, but to connect the potteries to the River Mersey.

There was much debate about possible routes that a canal could take. Coal merchants in Liverpool felt threatened about a canal that could bring coal in from Cheshire. The owners of the River Weaver Navigation were also not happy about the proposals, because the route would almost parallel that of the river. Yet another route was published which, much to the shock of Wedgwood, did not at all include the potteries.

Wedgwood, intent on having a waterway connection to his potteries, managed to send his proposal to Parliament, with the help of two of his friends, Thomas Bentley and Erasmus Darwin. John Gilbert&#x27;s plan for the &quot;Grand Trunk&quot; canal met opposition at the eastern end where, in Burton on Trent, the locals objected to the canal passing parallel to the upper Trent navigation. In 1764, Wedgwood managed to convince Gilbert to include the Potteries in his route. In 1766, Gilbert&#x27;s plan was authorised by an Act of Parliament. Later that year, &quot;[o]n July 26th a massive celebration was held in the Potteries where Josiah Wedgwood cut the first sod of soil. James Brindley was employed as engineer and work got under way.&quot;

Six years before the complete opening of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1771, Wedgwood built the factory village of Etruria on the outskirts of Stoke-on-Trent, close to the canal. By this time, much of the canal had been built towards Preston Brook. The only obstacle that still had to be tackled by the canal company was the hill at Kidsgrove, through which a tunnel was being dug. Up until 1777, pots had to be carried on the short journey from Etruria, over the top of Kidsgrove Hill, and to the other side, where the canal had been constructed to Preston Brook. 
On 15 January 1847 the Trent and Mersey Canal was acquired by the North Staffordshire Railway Company (NSR). This was done to stifle the opposition of the Canal Company to the creation of the Railway Company. In particular, the NSR had plans for a railway from Stoke-on-Trent to Liverpool, however, this line was abandoned because of opposition from other rail interests.

In 1891 the North Staffordshire Railway Company obtained statutory powers to raise £400,000 () to widen and improve the canal. By 1893 the section between the Anderton Boat Lift and Middlewich had been widened and deepened to allow an increase in the maximum tonnage of boats using this section to be increased from 30 tons to 60 tons. The basin at Middlewich was widened from to with the erection of a concrete wall and an extension to the wharfage. The canal was dredged by a Priestman-type steam dredger which removed between 80,000 and 100,000 tons. 

The Grand Trunk was a part of a larger scheme of James Brindley&#x27;s to link the four main rivers of England (Trent, Mersey, Severn and Thames) in a project known as the &quot;Grand Cross&quot;. The Trent and Mersey Canal provided the northwestern arm of the cross (to the Mersey), and the northeastern arm (to the Trent). It also provided the central hub of the cross, between Great Haywood, and Fradley Junctions. The southwestern arm, to the Severn, was built as the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, whilst the southeastern arm (to the Thames) traversed the Coventry and Oxford Canals.

==Features==

===Anderton Lift===

On the Cheshire stretch of the canal, between Middlewich and the northern end of the canal in Preston Brook Tunnel, is the Victorian Anderton Boat Lift, which lowers boats fifty feet from the T&amp;M to the River Weaver. It was restored to full operation in 2002 after twenty years of disuse, and was then the only operational boat-lift in the United Kingdom until the construction of the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland.

===Harecastle Tunnel===

Another major feature is the Harecastle Tunnel, near Kidsgrove in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, north Staffordshire. There are actually two tunnels; the first was built by Brindley and was long, and boats were moved through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow process and created major delays, so civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. This tunnel was opened in 1827. 

In the 1900s, the Brindley tunnel was closed because of severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel – although also prone to the same problems – remains in use, and is the fourth-longest navigable canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.

===Flyover Junction===

Just north of Harecastle Tunnel, the T&amp;M features a &#x27;flyover&#x27; junction. The Hall Green Branch leaves the T&amp;M mainline (which runs east–west here) on the south side, but then crosses over the main line and travels a short distance north to join the Macclesfield Canal at Hall Green Stop lock (some guides do not refer to the Hall Green branch, simply treating it as part of the Macclesfield Canal).

The actual junction where the branch leaves the main line is a normal right-angle junction called Hardings Wood Junction. The branch leaves the main line on the south side, then immediately turns 90 degrees clockwise. It runs westwards alongside the main line, maintaining the original level while the main line drops through two locks. At the Red Bull settlement, the branch turns 90 degrees right, to head north and cross the main line on Poole Lock aqueduct. It then immediately crosses the A50 on Red Bull aqueduct, carrying boats north to join the Macclesfield Canal at Hall Green.

===Stoke-on-Trent===

The canal passes through the city of Stoke-on-Trent, where it meets the Caldon Canal.

The canal formed an integral part of the 1986 Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival and in 1988 was declared a linear Conservation Area.
The towpath was upgraded in the 1990s and forms part of the National Cycle Network (Route 5).
===Burslem Port Trust===
A charity, the Burslem Port Trust, has been established to renovate the short Burslem arm of the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal which will extend 3/8 mile into Burslem.

==Route==
The route is conveniently divided into a northern and southern section by the Harecastle Tunnel.

===Northern Trent and Mersey===
The northern end of the canal makes an end-on junction with the Bridgewater Canal within Preston Brook Tunnel, from which one can access Runcorn (but no longer the Mersey or Ship Canal) in one direction and Manchester (with its many canal links) in the other direction.

From the junction with the Bridgewater Canal, the T&amp;M travels south through Preston Brook Tunnel (one-way operation, alternating each half-hour) and two smaller tunnels at Saltersford (since 2008 also one-way operation, alternating each half-hour), and Barnton to the &quot;junction&quot; with the River Weaver at Anderton Boat Lift near Northwich.

After Anderton, the next major destination is Middlewich, where a junction with the Wardle Canal leads to the Middlewich Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal which gives access to Chester, Llangollen and ( heading south on the Shropshire Union) a parallel route to Birmingham via Wolverhampton.

South of Middlewich, having passed through Wheelock, the T&amp;M climbs out of the Cheshire Plain via the &#x27;Heartbreak Hill&#x27; locks (more traditionally known as the &#x27;Cheshire Locks&#x27;) to the summit-level and the junction with the Hall Green Branch, leading to the Macclesfield Canal at Red Bull Kidsgrove. Most of the locks in this flight are doubled, although not all of the duplicates are still usable. Of particular note was lock 53 where, because of subsidence from brine pumping, the &#x27;spare&#x27; lock was replaced by a steel contrivance with guillotine gates. Theoretically, this was adjustable to compensate for further subsidence although, in practice it was less than successful and was ultimately removed altogether. Little evidence of &#x27;Thurlwood Steel Lock&#x27; remains today. The boater can use the Macclesfield Canal to head for Marple, and the junction with the Peak Forest Canal (and hence, via the Ashton, Rochdale and Bridgewater canal) to complete the &#x27;Cheshire Ring&#x27;.

====2012 breach at Dutton Hollow====
In September 2012 a serious breach occurred at Dutton Hollow near Preston Brook, which cost around £2.1 million to repair. The breach was south of bridge 213 and the canal was unusable between there and Middlewich Big Lock 75. The canal was officially reopened on 2 May 2013.

===Southern Trent and Mersey===
After the Harecastle Tunnel (one way, alternating roughly every two hours), the canal emerges in the outskirts of Stoke-on-Trent, and is soon in the middle of the city and then at Etruria, and the junction with the Caldon Canal.

Leaving Etruria, the canal is soon back in open country. It is now in the upper valley of the River Trent, which the canal follows until the river becomes navigable and the canal is no longer needed. The next sizeable place is the market town of Stone.

After more countryside, the canal reaches Great Haywood Junction and the towpath bridge across the junction with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which heads south to skirt Wolverhampton and join with the River Severn at Stourport-on-Severn, thus connecting the Mersey with the Severn.

The next event is a right-angle bend, of no apparent significance from the boat, but this is where the canal (and the Trent itself) changes its basic direction from south-east to north-east (heading towards Nottingham).

Very near is Fradley Junction (with the Coventry Canal&#x27;s &quot;detached portion&quot;). The Coventry soon leads to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and branches off to Birmingham or (via another stretch of the Coventry Canal) to Coventry and a junction with the Oxford Canal and thence to the Thames and the &#x27;Southern Half&#x27; of the English canals.

The canal now heads directly to its terminus, passing through Burton upon Trent, Mercia Marina at Findern, the largest inland waterway marina in the United Kingdom, and then through wide locks (the first being at Stenson) to Shardlow and finally Derwent Mouth.

It is not far from Derwent Mouth, via the River Trent, to Trentlock, the four-way junction with the Erewash Canal (dead end at Great Northern Basin, formerly a link with the Cromford Canal), Cranfleet Cut (bypassing Thrumpton Weir to continue navigation towards Nottingham) and the River Soar Navigation (linking via Leicester to the Grand Union Canal). Beyond the Cranfleet Cut the Trent is navigable all the way to its mouth at Trent Falls on the Humber Estuary.

<text>The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal is a navigable narrow canal in Staffordshire and Worcestershire in the Midlands of England. It is long, linking the River Severn at Stourport in Worcestershire with the Trent and Mersey Canal at Haywood Junction by Great Haywood.

==History==
===Creation===
James Brindley was the chief engineer of the canal, which was part of his &quot;Grand Cross&quot; plan for waterways connecting the major ports at Hull (via the Trent), Liverpool (via the Mersey), Bristol (via the Severn) and London (via the Thames).
The act of Parliament authorising the canal, the (6 Geo. 3. c. 97), was passed on 14 May 1766. This created &quot;The Company of Proprietors of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation&quot;, which was empowered to raise an initial £70,000 (equivalent to £ in ), with a further £30,000 (equivalent to £ in ), if needed, to fund the canal&#x27;s construction.

The canal was completed in 1771 for a cost that exceeded the authorised capital, and opened to trade in 1772. It was a commercial success, with trade from the Staffordshire Potteries southwards to Gloucester and Bristol, and trade from the Black Country northwards to the Potteries via the junction with the Birmingham Canal at Aldersley.

===Development===

The company obtained a second act of Parliament, the (30 Geo. 3. c. 75), on 9 June 1790, authorising it to raise another £12,000 (equivalent to £ in ), to improve the River Severn immediately below Stourport as far as Diglis, to improve navigation to and from the canal. At Stourport there were four basins, linked by broad locks, that allowed broad-beamed Severn trows to enter them from the river. Goods could then be trans-shipped from the canal narrow boats to the trows for onward shipment to Bristol.

===Competition===
Trade declined when the newer Worcester and Birmingham Canal was opened in 1815, providing a more direct route between Birmingham and Bristol. To remain competitive, the company increased the hours when locks could be used, and by 1830 they were available 24 hours a day. Another setback occurred when the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal opened its new route to Chester and Merseyside, meeting the canal at Autherley Junction. This took much of the traffic from the section to Great Haywood. Faced with a high volume of trade using the stretch between Aldersley and Autherley Junctions, the company levied very high tolls.

In order to resolve the situation the Birmingham Canal Company and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Company jointly promoted an act of Parliament to authorise a short canal that would have left the Birmingham Canal at a higher level than the junction, crossed the Staffordshire and Worcestershire by an aqueduct, and then dropped down by a series of locks to join the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal north of Autherley junction. The canal company decided to reduce its tolls rather than lose the trade altogether. Further concessions were obtained by the other two canal companies by threats to resurrect the plans on two subsequent occasions.

===Decline===
Despite the competition, and later competition from the railways, the canal company paid dividends to its shareholders until nationalisation, although profits fell steadily from the 1860s. It remained independent until the Transport Act 1947 nationalised Britain&#x27;s canals on 1 January 1948. In its latter years the major trade was in coal from Cannock to a power station at Stourport. The power station closed in 1949, and after that, the only commercial traffic was on the stretch between Autherley and Aldersley Junctions.

===Restoration===
In 1959 the British Transport Commission planned to close the canal but it was saved by a volunteer group, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society. In 1968 the canal was reclassified as a cruiseway, and the following year all of it was declared a Conservation Area. This has resulted in historical buildings and structures being retained and improved sympathetically.

==Course==
===A strategic link===
The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal links two of southern Britain&#x27;s largest river catchments:
* The Trent catchment, which drains most of the north and east of the English Midlands, as well as parts of the West Midlands, and flows ultimately into the North Sea via the Humber Estuary,
* The Severn catchment, which drains a large area of north and central Wales, as well as much of the West Midlands, and drains ultimately into the Celtic Sea via the Bristol Channel.

The canal was a major north–south route for the west of England, linking other canals to create a network running:
* via the Trent and Mersey Canal, to Stoke-on-Trent, to the northwest of England (Lancashire and Cheshire) and to the East Midlands,
* via the BCN Main Line and the Stourbridge Canal to the Black Country and Birmingham,
* via the Shropshire Union Canal to Chester and north Wales.

The canal essentially follows river valleys, shadowing the course of tributaries, to break through the watershed between the Trent and Severn north-west of Wolverhampton, at the Aldersley Gap, a minor glacial feature turned to advantage by Brindley.

===Within the Trent catchment===
The northern starting point of the canal at Great Haywood, its junction with the Trent and Mersey Canal, is only about from the confluence of the River Sow with the Trent. The canal runs west through Tixall Wide and along the Sow valley, closely following the river, to Weeping Cross, on the south east edge of Stafford, the confluence of the River Penk with the Sow. The canal then swings at right angles to the south, taking up the course of the Penk.

It then runs via Acton Trussell and Penkridge to Calf Heath, where it is joined by the now-derelict Hatherton Canal. Continuing south via Coven, it begins to bear away from the Penk, which has its source at Perton, well to the west of the canal. The canal enters north-west Wolverhampton. Here it is joined, in rapid succession, by the Shropshire Union Canal at Autherley Junction and the BCN Main Line at Aldersley Junction.

===Within the Severn catchment===
South of Aldersley, the canal begins to shadow the River Smestow, part of the Severn catchment. The Smestow actually crosses the canal via the Dunstall Water Bridge, a small aqueduct planned by Brindley to preserve the flow of the river, before dropping into the valley and running alongside it. Skirting Wolverhampton between the steep hillsides of Compton and Tettenhall, through the Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve, the canal reaches Wightwick. Here it bears south, cutting across a wide bend in the course of the Smestow. Descending sharply through the impressive Bratch locks, the canal rejoins the River Smestow just south of Wombourne. From here it follows the river very closely to its confluence with the Stour near Prestwood.

The confluence of Smestow and Stour is paralleled closely by the junction of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire with the Stourbridge Canal, which descends through the Stour valley to Stourton. Southward from this point, the canal is cut through very steep sandstone banks and passes through a tunnel at Dunsley all the way closely following the river while slicing across its many meanders. Running through Kinver, Caunsall, Cookley and Wolverley, it serves a series of wharves in the old industrial town of Kidderminster. Finally it reaches its end in a complex of wharves and basins in the canal town of Stourport-on-Severn, where it descends steeply to the river through two sets of locks.

==Linked canals==
The canal is linked (in order, from the Severn) to:
*Stourbridge Canal at Stourton Junction
*BCN Main Line at Aldersley Junction
*Shropshire Union Canal at Autherley Junction
*Hatherton Canal, (currently derelict but with proposals for restoration) at Hatherton Junction

The canal today forms part of the Stourport Ring, which is one of the popular cruising rings for leisure boating. It is also part of the Four Counties Ring.

<text>Roger Edward Paul Mellie (&quot;The Man on the Telly – who says &#x27;Bollocks!&#x27;&quot;) is a fictional character featured in &quot;Viz&quot; magazine. His catchphrase was originally the same as David Frost&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Hello, good evening, and welcome&quot;, but very soon degenerated into &quot;Hello, good evening and bollocks!&quot;. The character first appeared in Issue 6 in July 1981 and (like many other characters in &quot;Viz&quot;) is a foul-mouthed and obnoxious misogynist who manages to maintain a career as a television presenter, in spite of his objectionable personality and incompetence (he sees himself as highly professional, despite abundant evidence to the contrary). He is shown working on various TV networks and channels, the fictional Fulchester Television (FTV) and the BBC being his primary employers. He is the ostensible author of &quot;Roger&#x27;s Profanisaurus&quot; (), a parody of &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot; which is updated with extra entries in each edition of &quot;Viz&quot; and has been published several times under considerably risqué titles.

==Background==
&quot;Viz&quot;&#x27;s founder and main contributor Chris Donald has said that the character of Roger Mellie was inspired by the off-screen behaviour of Rod Griffith, a 1980s Tyne Tees Television presenter, but that Mellie is &quot;nothing like&quot; Griffith and other presenters have been worked into the character, including &quot;Look North&quot; presenter Mike Neville. One issue gave Roger&#x27;s name as &quot;Roger Michael Neville Mellie&quot;.

An animated TV series was released on VHS and also broadcast on Channel 4 in 1991, with Peter Cook providing the voice of Roger, and Harry Enfield voicing all the other characters. Roger also appeared in the 1991 as the commentator for all the races.

It was said on a few occasions that Roger drove a Suzuki Swift 1.3GTi.

==Fictional biography==
Born Roger Edward Paul Mellie in 1937 in North Shields, Roger was educated at Fulchester Mixed Infants, Bartlepool Grammar School, and the Oxford Remand Centre. He began his broadcasting career as a cub reporter on the news with Robert Dougall and shot to fame filling in for a poorly Bruce Forsyth on &quot;Saturday Night at the London Palladium&quot; with his &quot;Last Turkey in the Shop&quot; routine, featuring genital mutilation routines. Recruited by Fulchester Television he became a popular TV personality and established his own production company, MellieVision. Mellie was frequently pulled over for drink-driving and, in 1986, he ran over and killed a bus queue. He often stays at his favourite lap-dancing club in Acton until past 3am, but lives in Fulchester with his 17-year-old Thai wife and fifteen Staffordshire Bull Terriers. He has had five previous wives (two &quot;accidentally&quot; murdered) and is a convicted rapist, undischarged bankrupt, a hopeless alcoholic, extremely sexist, very right-wing, a bigot and a recovering cocaine addict. He owned a restaurant in Stoke Newington with Alex Higgins, George Best and Chris Quinten. He once almost died while unveiling a plaque, but was resuscitated by the nurses in hospital, and promptly ordered his breakfast - sausages, fried bread, fried eggs, black pudding and several other heart-destroying items.

Roger&#x27;s straight man is Tom, in early strips, a director or producer, later a portmanteau figure, an agent for Roger or a television executive, to suit the situation. In one issue, he has a sign reading &quot;Tom - Straight Man&quot;. One of Roger&#x27;s defining features is that he will always arrive very late, regardless of if it is to a job or simply a meeting, despite Tom making desperate attempts to make sure Roger understands the importance of being on time (leading to Tom&#x27;s catchphrase of &quot;Where the Hell is Roger?&quot;). Roger usually arrives announcing &quot;Sorry I&#x27;m late, Tom&quot;. In one strip, Tom imagines Roger has arrived on time only to discover that it is a life-size cardboard cutout, and, on another occasion, Tom is utterly shocked as Roger arrives two minutes early - but then he wakes up. Roger and Tom have crossed over into the Billy the Fish strip occasionally before realising they are in the wrong page. They are used in other &quot;Viz&quot; strips when a reporter or narrator is needed and, on these occasions, Roger is generally (although not always) without his usual lecherous and/or violent behaviour.

On one occasion in 2006, while requiring a liver transplant (due to chronic alcoholism), Roger became a hit-and-run driver: he ran over and killed a motorcyclist without stopping, later receiving the dead man&#x27;s liver for himself, then celebrating the successful liver transplant with a booze-up at the nearest pub. Sometimes the strip follows current or recent events: in a parody of the kidnapping of Alan Johnston, Roger is kidnapped in Beirut, but after eight days it turns out to be an attempt to seek publicity. Tom discovers that the BBC is in on the deception and reluctantly takes part by being a fake phone-in contestant on Radio 4. In 2011, due to recent news stories revolving around celebrities taking out super injunctions in an attempt to protect themselves from scandal, Roger goes to his crooked solicitor attempting to silence his ex-wife from releasing a book about their violent marriage which also details Roger&#x27;s &quot;questionable&quot; hobbies. However, it emerges he is not trying to silence his wife to protect himself, but is actually releasing this information himself in a new autobiography and he does not want her to cash in before him. In 2015, following the high amount of media attention following Jeremy Clarkson punching a producer (memorably referred to as a &quot;fracas&quot;), the strip showed Roger entering his office just before he is due to renegotiate his contract to present &quot;Roger Mellie&#x27;s Skidmarks&quot; and punching Tom in the face. As Tom attempts to recover, Roger organizes the ensuing scandal and his recovery to ensure a lucrative contract. When meeting the Director General of FTV in the cafeteria, Roger turns up drunk and is delighted to be told his show is being recommissioned for five years along with a huge salary increase. However, Roger then is told there is no hot food available (another reference to the incident with Clarkson), causing him to fly into a rage and then punch the Director General too. In another strip, Roger finally finds mainstream success by presenting &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; only to have it ruined when a dead body is fished out of his swimming pool. However, despite whatever misfortunes and/or scandals might befall him, Roger never learns his lesson and his TV career always remains intact.

Roger has also appeared in several other parodies of real TV shows, including a stint as presenter of &quot;Springwatch&quot; whilst Bill Oddie was in hospital after Roger had accidentally shot him. Roger&#x27;s version of the show consisted of him launching live rabbits from a catapult for Jack Charlton and Ted Nugent to shoot. Usually, Roger has little success hosting mainstream shows but often suggests pornographic reworkings of well-known shows, which against all odds prove successful.
Another episode has a considerably elderly Roger (grey/white hair and most teeth missing) having fronted &quot;Fulchester News&quot; for a considerable number of years; but he decides that he cannot arbore such a thing and gets himself a wig and a whole set of false teeth. In the last panel he is shown fronting &quot;Fulchester Tonight&quot;, with the false teeth clacking dreadfully as he attempts to be much more youthful.

===TV series===
The 1991 animated TV series had 4 episodes.
*Episode 1, Celebrity Bumhole:
Due to an &quot;administrative error&quot;, Roger has been asked by the BBC to present the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, but arrives late as he claimed that there is &quot;some sort of fucking jumble sale&quot; in the hall: Tom tells him that it is part of the programme. After being introduced to the antiques expert, Hedley Smedley-Smythe, they look at a vase, but Roger breaks one of its handles off. Then, they look at an old wooden chair which Roger sits on and breaks to pieces due to his weight. Next, he is in the office with the boss who gives him one more chance to change his behaviour. The next day, at FTV studios, Roger presents a kids&#x27; TV show called &quot;Blue Roger&quot; (a parody of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;) along with a ginger-haired kid. They have a look at some puppies and Roger exclaims that one of them has a &quot;little penis!&quot; Tom then asks Roger to go to the producer&#x27;s office, where he is fired. At the bar, Roger has an idea for a game show (&quot;Celebrity Bumhole&quot;) and the head of BBC1&#x27;s early evening programmes hires him for £500,000 a year. The next day, he presents &quot;Blinkety Blank&quot; (a parody of &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;) but this ends after he punches one of the contestants (Paul Daniel), who made fun of Roger&#x27;s baldness. Later at the bar, Roger tells Tom that he is writing an autobiography called &quot;They Don&#x27;t Call Me Roger for Nothing&quot;, but Tom says that he cannot publish it because it is &quot;disgusting&quot;, although a man from the &quot;News of the World&quot; says that they will serialise his book in their newspaper and pay him £50,000. He then tells Roger that they have job vacancies for TV presenters on Sky TV.

*Episode 2, Celebrity Golf:
On Sunday morning, Tom phones Roger from the golf club to remind him about participating in FTV&#x27;s first annual Celebrity Golf tournament. Roger tells him he will be there in twenty minutes, but he finally arrives in a golf cart two hours later. Tom tells him that it is for charity and that they are already four hours behind schedule. Tom introduces Roger to Jimmy Tarbrush and Bruce Fivesyth, and Roger tries to get a drink from the clubhouse to avoid playing golf for nothing. During the game, Roger tries to tell Tarby a rude joke, but Tom reminds him that it is a family show. Then Roger breaks one of Brucie&#x27;s drivers while taking his shot. While Brucie takes his shot, Roger is trying to find his &quot;bastard ball&quot; and when Brucie&#x27;s ball lands in a bunker, he finds Roger &quot;having a dump&quot; in it. Eventually, on the green, Brucie and Tarby have putted and after Roger is finished, he goes off to the clubhouse for a drink, but Tom tells him that it was only the first hole and there is still another seventeen to play. However, Roger carries on regardless as he cannot be bothered to play anymore. The group carry on without him and Brucie wins the tournament. A very drunk Roger congratulates Brucie for winning the tournament and vomits on him.

*Episode 3, Challenge Roger:
Roger (who is between jobs) is at home watching the TV when &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot; comes on; this gives him an idea to make his own version of the programme, called &quot;Challenge Roger&quot;. The next day, in his office, he tells Tom about his show which is for charity. Roger gets a tracksuit, camera, mobile phone and an old yellow van with &quot;Challenge Roger&quot; in red lettering. The plan is to build a swimming pool in just 24 hours (for the &quot;orphaned kids and old folks&quot;) at Roger&#x27;s house. Roger tries to phone a builder using his mobile phone, which malfunctions, and they have to find a phone box. On the way, they stop at an off-licence in an attempt to get some free lager and cigarettes, but the salesman says that he can only sell them and Roger insults him in front of the camera. Eventually, they finally find a phone box and when they finally get an Irish builder called Mr. Murphy to do the job, they only have 18 hours left to build the pool. As the builder starts the job, Roger and Tom head down to the pub for a few drinks and after telling the barman that he will mention his pub on the telly, he gives them the drinks free of charge. When they return, the builder is finished with about a minute to spare. After thanking him for the job, Roger says that they will flog the programme to the BBC and keep the money for themselves.

*Episode 4, The Crook Report:
One morning, at FTV, &quot;Challenge Roger&quot; has been such a success and Roger is asked to present &quot;The Crook Report&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Cook Report&quot;) after Roger Cook gets beaten up, but before rushing into it, Tom tells him to be calm, sympathetic and tactful at all times. Soon, in Tom&#x27;s car, they arrive in a poor area to investigate the slum landlord who owns a block of flats. In one flat lives the 84-year-old Mrs Parker. She lives alone and is very frightened because the landlord has been trying to evict her. Roger tries to interview Mrs Parker, but she wants him to go away. However, Roger breaks the door down and scares her to death. Next, they have a word with the landlord, Mr McKenzie. Roger tries to refresh his memory about the tenants but is told to talk to his solicitor. Then, the police arrive but they arrest Roger instead of Mr McKenzie. The next day, in Tom&#x27;s office, Roger reveals he was fined £250 by the police, but Tom tells him to forget it. Kenneth Spanner has had to drop out of &quot;Whose Line Is It Now?&quot; (a parody of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;) to perform a heart bypass operation, and Roger is asked to replace him. Then, on the show, Roger wants to see the script, but Tom tells him that there is no script as it is spontaneous improvisation. Roger gets annoyed with the contestant beside him (a parody of &quot;Whose Line&quot; panellist John Sessions), and after being asked by Clive Sanderson to improvise a poem about changing a light bulb, he does it in the style of Muhammad Ali. However, this ends with him punching the contestant beside him and calling him a &quot;Scottish twat!&quot;

<text>The General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is an academic qualification in a range of subjects taken in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, having been introduced in September 1986 and its first exams taken in 1988. Public schools in Scotland use the Scottish Qualifications Certificate instead. However, private schools in Scotland often choose to follow the English GCSE system.

Each GCSE qualification is offered as a specific school subject, with the most commonly awarded ones being: English literature, English language, mathematics, science (combined &amp; triple), history, geography, art, design and technology (D&amp;T), business studies, economics, music, and modern foreign languages (E.g. Spanish, French, German) (MFL). 

The Department for Education has drawn up a list of core subjects known as the English Baccalaureate for England based on the results in eight GCSEs, which includes both English language and English literature, mathematics, science (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science), geography or history, and an ancient or modern foreign language. 

Studies for GCSE examinations take place over a period of two or three academic years (depending upon the subject, school, and exam board). They usually start in Year 9 or Year 10 for the majority of pupils, with around two mock exams – serving as a simulation for the actual tests – normally being sat during the first half of Year 11, and the final GCSE examinations nearer to the end of spring, in England and Wales.

==History==

Before the introduction of GCSEs, pupils took the CSE (Certificate of Secondary Education) or the more academically challenging O-Level (General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level) exams, or a combination of the two, in various subjects. The CSE broadly covered GCSE grades C–G or 4–1 and the O-Level covered grades A*–C or 9–4, but the two were independent qualifications, with different grading systems. The separate qualifications were criticised for disadvantaging the bottom 42% of O-Level entrants, who failed to receive a qualification, and the highest-achieving CSE entrants, who had no opportunity to demonstrate higher ability.

In their later years O-Levels were graded on a scale from A to E, with a U (ungraded) below that. Before 1975 the grading scheme varied between examination boards, but typically there were pass grades of 1 to 6 and fail grades of 7 to 9. However the grades were not displayed on certificates.

The CSE was graded on a numerical scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest and 5 the lowest passing grade. Below 5 there was a U (ungraded) grade. The highest grade, 1, was considered equivalent to an O-Level C grade or above, and achievement of this grade often indicated that the pupil could have taken an O-Level course in the subject to achieve a higher qualification. As the two were independent qualifications with separate syllabi, a separate course of study would have to be taken to convert a CSE to an O-Level in order to progress to A-Level.

There was a previous attempt to unite these two disparate qualifications in the 1980s, with a trial ‘16+‘ examination in some subjects, awarding both a CSE and an O-Level certificate, before the GCSE was introduced. The final O-level/CSE examinations were sat in 1987.

===Introduction of the GCSE===
GCSEs were introduced in September 1986 to establish a national qualification for those who decided to leave school at 16 without pursuing further academic study towards qualifications such as A-Levels or university degrees. The first GCSE exams were sat in 1988. They replaced the former CSE and O-Level qualifications, uniting the two qualifications to allow access to the full range of grades for more pupils. However the exam papers of the GCSE sometimes had a choice of questions, designed for the more able and the less able candidates.

When introduced the GCSEs were graded from A to G, with a C being set as roughly equivalent to an O-Level Grade C or a CSE Grade 1 and thus achievable by roughly the top 25% of each cohort.

The Royal Alexandra &amp; Albert School in Reigate, Surrey, trialled GCSE English in 1980. Those who passed would receive both a CSE and an O-Level certificate. There was still a separate English Literature O-Level exam.

===Changes since initial introduction===

Over time the range of subjects offered, the format of the examinations, the regulations, the content and the grading of GCSE examinations have altered considerably. Numerous subjects have been added and changed, and various new subjects are offered in modern languages, ancient languages, vocational fields and expressive arts, as well as citizenship courses.

====Introduction of the A* grade====
In 1994 the A* grade was added above the grade A to further differentiate attainment at the very highest end of the qualification. This remained the highest grade available until 2017, when numerical grades were introduced (see below). The youngest pupil to gain an A* grade was Thomas Barnes, who earned an A* in GCSE Mathematics at the age of 7.

====Mathematics tiers====
Initially, the mathematics papers were divided between three tiers: higher (able), intermediate (less able) and foundation (near unable), to cover different mathematical abilities. The higher level corresponded to grades A–C, the intermediate level to grades C–E, and the foundation level to grades E–G. However, it was later realised that students who sat the foundation level exam couldn&#x27;t pass the subject at grade C, so this system was replaced by a two-tier arrangement whereby the intermediate and foundation levels were merged. This brought the subject into line with other subjects that typically had foundation and higher-level papers. This meant that somebody who sat the new foundation level could now achieve a grade C and thus pass.

With the introduction of numbered grades, the higher tier provides grades 9–3, with 3 being classed as a &#x27;safety net&#x27; grade, and the foundation tier provides grades 5–1.

====2000s reforms====
Between 2005 and 2010 a variety of reforms were made to GCSE qualifications, including increasing modularity and a change to the administration of non-examination assessment.

From the first assessment series in 2010, controlled assessment replaced coursework in various subjects, requiring more rigorous exam-like conditions for much of the non-examination assessed work and reducing the opportunity for outside help in coursework.

====2010s reforms====
Under the Conservative government of David Cameron various changes were made to GCSE qualifications taken in England. Before a wide range of reforms, interim changes were made to existing qualifications, removing the January series of examinations as an option in most subjects and requiring that 100% of the assessment in subjects from the 2014 examination series be taken at the end of the course. These were a precursor to the later reforms.

From 2015 a large-scale programme of reform began in England, changing the marking criteria and syllabi for most subjects as well as the format of qualifications and the grading system.

Under the new scheme all GCSE subjects were revised between 2015 and 2018 and all new awards were to be on the new scheme by summer 2020. The new qualifications are designed such that most exams will be taken at the end of a full two-year course, with no interim modular assessment, coursework nor controlled assessment except where necessary (such as in the arts). Some subjects retain coursework on a non-assessed basis, with the completion of certain experiments in science subjects being assumed in examinations and teacher reporting of spoken language participation for English GCSEs as a separate report.

Other changes include the move to a numerical grading system to differentiate the new qualifications from the old-style letter-graded GCSEs, publication of core content requirements for all subjects and an increase in longer, essay-style questions to challenge pupils more. Alongside this a variety of low-uptake qualifications and qualifications with significant overlap will cease, with their content being removed from the GCSE options or incorporated into similar qualifications. A range of new GCSE subjects was also introduced for pupils to study from 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.

GCSE examinations in English and mathematics were reformed with the 2015 syllabus publications, with these first examinations taking place in 2017. The remainder were reformed with the 2016 and 2017 syllabus publications, leading to first awards in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

For GCSE Science the old single-award ‘science’ and ‘additional science’ options are no longer available, being replaced with a double award ‘combined science’ option (graded on the scale 9–9 to 1–1 and equivalent to 2 GCSEs). Alternatively pupils can take separate qualifications in chemistry, biology and physics. Other removed qualifications include a variety of design technology subjects, which are reformed into a single ‘design and technology’ subject with several options, and various catering and nutrition qualifications, which are folded into ‘food technology’. Finally several ‘umbrella’ GCSEs such as ‘humanities’, ‘performing arts’ and ‘expressive arts’ are dissolved, with those wishing to study those subjects needing to take separate qualifications in the incorporated subjects.

====Implications for Wales and Northern Ireland====
These reforms did not apply immediately in Wales and Northern Ireland, where GCSEs would continue to be available on the A*–G grading system. However owing to legislative requirements for comparability between GCSEs in the three countries and allowances for certain subjects and qualifications to be available in Wales and Northern Ireland, some 9–1 qualifications were to be available and the other changes were mostly adopted in these countries as well.

In Northern Ireland a decision was taken by Minister of Education, Peter Wier (DUP), in 2016 to align the A* Grade to the 9 Grade of the English reformed qualifications. The first award of the new A* grade being in 2019. A C* grade was also introduced in Northern Ireland to align to the 5 Grade in England, again with first awarding in 2019. GCSEs in Northern Ireland remain modular and Science practicals can count towards the overall grade. Speaking and listening also remains a component of the GCSE English Language specification.

==Examination boards==
Historically, there were a variety of regional examination boards, or awarding organisations (AOs), who set examinations in their area. The five examination boards include:

* Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA), which absorbed the following boards: AEB, JMB, NEAB, and SEG.
* Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR), which absorbed the Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations, Cambridge Local Examinations, Oxford &amp; Cambridge Examinations Board, MEG, and RSA exam boards.
* Pearson Edexcel, which absorbed the LREB, BTEC, and ULEAC boards.
* Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC or CBAC), the main examining board in Wales.
* Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment (CCEA), the examining board and regulator in Northern Ireland.

The examination boards operate under the supervision of Ofqual (The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) in England, Qualifications Wales in Wales, and the CCEA in Northern Ireland.

In England, AQA, OCR, and Pearson operate under their respective brands. Additionally, WJEC operate the brand Eduqas, which develops qualifications in England. CCEA qualifications are not available in England.

In Wales, WJEC is the only accredited awarding body for GCSEs in the public sector, and thus no other board formally operates in Wales. However, some qualifications from the English boards are available as designated qualifications in some circumstances, due to not being available from WJEC.

In Northern Ireland, CCEA operates as both a board and a regulator. Most qualifications from the English boards are also available, with the exception of English language and the sciences, due to requirements for speaking and practical assessment, respectively.

==Structure and format==
Pupils usually take 7–10 GCSEs in Key Stage 4. The exact qualifications taken vary from school to school and pupil to pupil but all schools are encouraged to offer a pathway that leads to qualification for the English Baccalaureate, requiring GCSEs in English literature, English language, mathematics, science (including computer science), a modern or ancient language and history and geography.

===Subjects===
The list of currently available GCSE subjects is much shorter than before the reforms, since the new qualifications in England all have core requirements set by the regulator, Ofqual, for each subject. In addition there are several subjects for which only one board offers qualifications, including some that are available only in one country of the UK for that reason. The following lists are sourced from the exam board websites.

====Core subjects====
These are the requirements for achieving the English Baccalaureate headline measure in league tables, from 2017 onwards. Other subjects, especially religious studies, citizenship studies, computer science and physical education are compulsory in the majority of secondary schools since these subjects form part of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 4.

===Grades and tiering===

GCSEs are awarded on a graded scale and cross two levels of the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF): Level 1 and Level 2. These two levels roughly correspond, respectively, to foundation and higher tier in tiered GCSE qualifications. Level 1 qualifications constitute GCSEs at grades G, F, E, and D or 1, 2, and 3. Level 2 qualifications are those at grades C, B, A, and A* or 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

The tiering of qualifications allows a subset of grades to be reached in a specific tier&#x27;s paper. Formerly many subjects were tiered, but with the mid-2010s reform the number of tiered subjects reduced dramatically, including the removal of tiering from the GCSE English specifications. Untiered papers allow any grade to be achieved. Coursework and controlled assessment tasks are always untiered.

In the past mathematics qualifications offered a different set of tiers, with three. These were foundation tier at grades G, F, E, and D; intermediate tier at grades E, D, C, and B; and higher tier at grades C, B, A, and A*. This eventually changed to match the tiers in all other GCSE qualifications.

The evolution of grades and a rough comparison between them are as follows:

====Letter grades====
When GCSEs were introduced in 1988 they were graded on a letter scale in each subject: A, B, C, D, E, F and G being pass grades, with a U (unclassified) below that, which did not qualify the pupil for a certificate. These grades were initially set such that a GCSE grade C was equivalent to an O-Level grade C or a CSE grade 1, though changes in marking criteria and boundaries over the years mean that this comparison is only approximate.

Infrequently, X and Q grades are awarded. X indicates that a course was not completed and therefore an appropriate grade cannot be calculated. The Q (query) grade is a temporary grade that requires the school to contact the examining body. These two grades are usually provisional and are replaced with a normal grade once any issues have been resolved. X grades are also sometimes used for other purposes on rare occasions, such as to indicate that an examiner found offensive material or hate speech within a pupil’s answers. In some cases this may lead to the pupil losing all marks for that paper or course. These grades are most common in subjects that cover ethical issues, such as biology, religious studies and citizenship.

In 1994 an A* grade was added above the initial A grade to indicate exceptional achievement, above the level required for the A grade.

Under the letter grade scheme, foundation tier papers assess content at grades C to G, while higher tier papers assess content at grades A* to C. In foundation-tier papers, pupils can obtain a maximum grade of a C, while in a higher-tier paper they can achieve a minimum grade of a D. Higher-tier candidates who miss the D grade by a small margin are awarded an E. Otherwise the grade below E in these papers is U. In untiered papers pupils can achieve any grade in the scheme. This scheme has been phased out in England, but remains in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland the A* grade has been adjusted upwards with the introduction of the numerical scheme in England, such that an A* is equivalent to a new English grade 9. Northern Ireland also added a C* grade to line up with the grade 5 in the English grading.

====Numerical grades (2017 onwards)====
Since 2017 in England (and in Wales and Northern Ireland on qualifications from the English-based awarding bodies) most GCSEs have been assessed on a nine-point scale, using numbers from 9 to 1, and a U (unclassified) grade for achievement below the minimum pass mark. Under this system 9 is the highest grade and is set above the former A* classification, equivalent to the new Northern Irish A* grade. A grade 8 is also equivalent to an A*, however the grade 9 is the top end of the A*. The former C grade is set at grade 4 (known as a &#x27;standard pass&#x27;) and grade 5 (considered a &#x27;strong pass&#x27;) under the numerical scheme.

Although fewer qualifications have tiered examinations than before, the tiering system still exists. At foundation tier the grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are available, whilst at higher tier the grades 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are targeted. Students who take the higher tier and miss the grade 4 mark by a small margin are awarded a grade 3. Controlled assessment and coursework tasks are untiered. The youngest person known to have achieved a grade 9 is Ellie Barnes, who achieved the grade in Mathematics aged eight.

====Results====
GCSE results are published by the examination board in August for the exam series in April to June of the same year. They are usually released one week after the A-Level results, on the Thursday that falls between 20 August and 26 August. The examination results are released to centres (schools) prior to the release to candidates and the public. Examination results are released by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), which represents the main GCSE awarding organisations. Some boards and schools release results online, although many still require pupils to attend in person to collect their results from the centre at which they sat the exams.

In England these results then go on to inform league tables published in the following academic year, with headline performance metrics for each school. Owing to COVID-19, pupils who were supposed to sit their GCSEs in 2020 and 2021 were awarded qualifications based on predicted grades from their teachers. Traditional exams, however, have been taken since the summer of 2022.

Note: In the final year DES statistics for O-Levels are available, and across all subjects, 6.8% of candidates obtained a grade A, and 39.8% achieved grades A to C.

=====2018–present=====
===Assessment types===
====Modular and linear GCSEs====
In the past, many GCSE qualifications used a modular system, where some assessment (up to 60% under the &#x27;terminal rule&#x27;) could be submitted prior to the final examination series. This allowed for students to take some units of a GCSE before the final examination series, and thus gave indication of progress and ability at various stages, as well as allowing for students to resit exams in which they did not score as highly, in order to boost their grade, before receiving the qualification. Various qualifications were available as both modular and linear schemes, and schools could choose whichever fit best for them.

Under the Conservative government of David Cameron, reforms were initiated which converted all GCSEs from 2012 (for assessment from 2014) to de facto linear schemes, in advance of the introduction of new specifications between 2015 and 2018 (for first assessment from 2017 to 2020). These new rules required that 100% of the assessment in a GCSE be submitted in the final examination series, at the same time as applying for certification of the full qualification. The examination boards complied by modifying the syllabi of the remaining GCSE qualifications to remove modular components.

====Coursework and controlled assessment====
In some subjects, one or more controlled assessment or coursework assignments may also be completed. These may contribute either a small or large proportion of the final grade. In practical and performance subjects, they generally have a heavier weighting to reflect the difficulty and potential unfairness of conducting examinations in these areas.

In the past, these were available in a variety of subjects, including extended writing in English, the sciences, business, and foreign languages; practical assessment in the sciences and technology subjects; and speaking assessments in languages. Since the 2010s reform, the availability has been cut back, with mostly only design and technology subjects and performing arts retaining their controlled assessment contributions. In English language, the spoken language assessment has been downgraded to an endorsement which is reported separately on the English certificate, not contributing to the grade. The English spoken language assessments are set throughout the course and assessed by teachers. Students can be awarded a Pass, Merit, Distinction or Not Classified. In the sciences, practical exercises are a required part of the qualification, but are not directly assessed; they are only endorsed by a teacher&#x27;s statement.

The balance between controlled assessment and examinations is contentious, with the time needing to be set aside for coursework sessions being seen as a burden on the school timetable. However, the use of controlled assessment allows for the marking of some work outside of examination season, and can ease the burden on students to perform well on the day of the examination.

===Exceptional and mitigating circumstances===
For pupils with learning difficulties, an injury/repetitive strain injury (RSI) or a disability, help is offered in these forms. These may not necessarily be diagnosed, depending on the context.

*Extra time: the amount depends on the severity of the learning difficulty, such as dyslexia, disability, injury or learning in English as a second language provided that the pupil has been studying in the UK for no more than 2 years. This tends to range from 5% to 50%, although most commonly is at 25%. To qualify for 25% extra time, a student must show evidence of at least 2 below average standardised scores of 84 or less, or one below average (84 or less) and one low average standardised score (between 85 and 89). Extra time may also be provided to students with an EHCP (Education, Health, and Care Plan), provided that it has necessary evidence to show this could be required. Students are not required to use all of this time, and are allowed to finish the exam at any point during the extra time.
*Amanuensis: somebody (typically known as a scribe) types or handwrites as the pupil dictates; this is normally used when the pupil cannot write due to an injury or disability. This can be quite tightstudents have to dictate correct punctuation. This requires centre-based evidence from the SENDCo of the school.
*A word processor (typically Exam Write-Pad): this be used by pupils who have trouble writing legibly or who are unable to write quickly enough to complete the exam. This must be the student&#x27;s typical or one of their typical ways of working and requires centre-based evidence.
*A different format exam paperexamples of this may include Braille for students with visual impairment, colour pointers for students who have colour blindness of some form, large print for those with visual impairment, and different coloured paper (typically blue) for those with dyslexia. This only requires centre-based evidence, as a student without these difficulties would not benefit from these formats.
*A reader: a teacher or exam invigilator can read out the words in the exam paper, but they cannot explain their meaning. This is used most often with severely dyslexic students who cannot read questions effectively enough, and is commonly used in conjunction with amanuensis, as most students requiring this will lack writing ability as well.
*A different room: due to evidence from the centre, students may be placed in small rooms. This most commonly occurs in cases of rest breaks and extra time, where students will finish later than other candidates, and have this so as to not be disturbed by most students leaving the exam before them. All exam rooms are covered by separate dedicated invigilators.
*Rest breaks: these are optional breaks requiring centre-based evidence as the students normal way of working. A student with rest breaks does not need a diagnosis of a disability, and is often used for medical reasons such as migraines which prevent students from focusing for periods of time, and anxiety attacks, meaning a students may not be able to work for periods of time. Students typically receive rest breaks at a ratio of 1:6 with exam time. These breaks can only be taken within this time, and cannot exceed it. Students receive the time they spent in the rest break back through a later finish time and are not required to take all of the allocated rest break time.

Any of the above must be approved by the examination board. Other forms of help are available with the agreement of the examination board, but the above are the most common.

If a student is ill or an unforeseen circumstance occurs that may affect their performance in an examination, they can apply for special consideration from the examination board. The procedures vary depending on how much the student has completed, but in the case of sitting an examination, they may receive a percentage increase on their grade to reflect this, or a consideration of their coursework and other assessment alongside their predicted grades, to calculate a fair grade based on their other attainment.

==Progression==
GCSEs and other Level 2 qualifications are generally required in order to pursue Level 3 qualifications, such as A-Levels or BTEC (Business and Technology Education Council) beyond the age of 16.

The requirement of 5 or more 9–4 grades, including English, Mathematics and Science is often a requirement for post-16 qualifications in sixth form colleges and further education colleges after leaving secondary school. 

Most universities, in addition to their post-16 requirements, seek that their candidates have grades of 4 or higher in GCSE English, Mathematics and Science. Many of those who achieve below this standard will later retake GCSEs to improve their grade and results. The November examination series exists for this purpose, to allow a faster path to gain these grades than waiting until the following summer&#x27;s main series. Leading universities often take into account performance at GCSE level, sometimes expecting applicants to have a high proportion of top grades.

==Comparison with other qualifications==
===Within the UK===
====England, Wales and Northern Ireland====

GCSEs in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are part of the Regulated Qualifications Framework. A GCSE at grades G, F, E, D, 1, 2, or 3 is a Level 1 qualification. A GCSE at C, B, A, A*, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 is a Level 2 qualification. Qualifications are not awarded to grades U, X or Q. Level 2 qualifications are much more sought-after, and generally form minimum requirements for jobs and further study expectations.

The BTEC is another Level 1/2 qualification available in the same territories as the GCSE, and is graded at 5 levels. At Level 2, comparable to A*, A, B, and C respectively are the Distinction*, Distinction, Merit, and Pass. A BTEC at Level 1 is simply marked as &quot;Level 1&quot;, with no subdivision. Below that level, a U is awarded, as in GCSEs. Other qualifications at this level include Cambridge Nationals, Key Skills, and Functional Skills.

Some schools in the UK choose to enter their students for IGCSE examinations.

====Scotland====

The comparable qualifications in Scotland are the National 4 and National 5 awards (formerly Standard Grades and/or Intermediates).

===Outside the UK===
The international version of the GCSE is the IGCSE, which can be taken anywhere in the world and includes additional options relating to coursework and the language the qualification is pursued in. All subjects completed in the fifth of the European Baccalaureate are generally equivalent to the GCSE subjects.

====Current and former British territories====

The education systems of current and former British territories, such as Gibraltar, and Nigeria, also offer the qualification, as supplied by the same examination boards. Other former British colonies, such as Singapore and Zimbabwe, continue to use qualifications called O-levels.

====Ireland====

In the Republic of Ireland, the Junior Certificate is a comparable qualification.

====United States====

In the United States, a high school diploma is required for entry into college or university. In the UK, this is considered to be at the level of the GCSE, awarded at Year 11. For college and university admissions in the UK, a high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade better than D+ is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.

As A-levels are generally expected for UK university admission, a high school diploma is not considered enough for direct university entry in the UK. Advanced Placement programmes or International Baccalaureate are considered equal to the A-level and earn points on the UCAS tariff. They may therefore be accepted in lieu of A-levels for university entry in the UK by US students. However, entry requirements differ at each university and may take subsequent work history after high school in place of A-levels/AP for future study applications.

The SAT Reasoning Test and SAT Subject Tests, or the ACT may also be considered in an offer for direct university entry.

US students who have studied at a university, a senior college, a community college; or graduated with a certificate, diploma or associate degree may have their credits and award transferred into a UK university, subject to entry requirements.

====France====

The (previously ) is generally considered to be comparable to four GCSEs. The is usually sat in (or year 10 in England and Wales).

India 

In India, GCSE can be used for comparison with class 12 and class 10 Board Examination which is usually taken in Class 10 and Class 12.The Board Exams are usually important for student who want to seek admission in India Along with Admission in college in UK as CBSE, ICSE-ISC are similar to GCSE. IGCSE Exams are also available in India for the Students who wants to go to UK or else wants to learn advance courses .

==Criticism==

=== Grade disparity ===
Statistics released by London&#x27;s Poverty Profile found overall GCSE attainment in London to be greater than the rest of England. 39% of pupils in Inner London and 37% in Outer London did not get five GCSEs at A* to C, compared with 42% in the rest of England. Also, according to an ITV News report, UK students tend to outperform Jersey students on GCSE examinations. Gender bias is another area of concern. Department of Education data shows that the relative performance gap between girls and boys widened under GCSEs, compared with O-Levels.

=== Grade inflation ===
When the GCSE system was introduced, there were comments that it was a dumbing down of the previous GCE O-Level system (as it took the focus away from the theoretical side of many subjects, and taught pupils about real-world implications and issues relating to ICT and citizenship).

In addition, the proportions of candidates awarded high grades at GCSE have been rising for many years, which critics attribute to grade inflation. By comparing pupils&#x27; scores in the YELLIS ability test with their GCSE results over a period of about 20 years, Robert Coe found a general improvement in grades awarded which ranges from 0.2 (science) to 0.8 (maths) of a GCSE grade. Only slightly more than half of pupils sitting GCSE exams achieve the 5 A* to C grades required for most forms of academic further education.

One of the important differences between previous educational qualifications (and the earlier grading of A-Levels) and the later GCSE qualifications was supposed to be a move from norm-referenced marking to criterion-referenced marking. In a norm-referenced grading system, fixed percentages of candidates achieve each grade. With criterion-referenced grades, in theory, all candidates who achieve the criteria can achieve the grade. A comparison of a clearly norm-referenced assessment, such as the NFER Cognitive Ability Test or CAT, with GCSE grading seems to show an unexpected correlation, which challenges the idea that the GCSE is a properly criterion-based assessment.

=== Mental health ===
Senior school leaders, the NSPCC, and Childline have expressed concern that GCSEs in their current exam-only format are too stressful and will lead to mental health crises. Students in 2019 were subjected to more exams and spent longer in the exam hall than their 2016 counterparts. While a GCSE student in 2016 had an average of 18 exams to prepare for, totalling 24 hours and 30 minutes, the average examinee in 2019 sat 22 exams, totalling 33 hours.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) surveyed 606 headteachers from schools that had entered pupils for exam-only GCSEs. They found reports of panic attacks, sleepless nights, depression, extreme fatigue, self-harming, and suicidal thoughts.

Even before all GCSE qualifications adopted the exam-only format, students complained about the memorization load, the need to write continuously for long hours, how their social lives have been affected and the need for sleeping pills and painkillers. They have observed younger siblings starting to panic about the exams at the beginning of the course- not just in the final year or the final few months.

=== Social divide ===
The incorporation of GCSE awards into school league tables, and the setting of targets at school level at above national average levels of attainment, has been criticised. At the time of introduction, the E grade was intended to be equivalent to the CSE grade 4, and so obtainable by a candidate of average/median ability. Sir Keith Joseph set schools a target of 90% of their pupils obtaining at least a grade F (which was the &quot;average&quot; grade achieved in the past). This target was reached nationally about 20 years later. David Blunkett went further and set schools the goal of 50% of 16-year-olds gaining 5 GCSEs or equivalent at grade C and above, although these grades were previously only obtained by the top 30%. This was achieved with the help of equivalent and largely vocational qualifications. Labelling schools as failing if 40% of their pupils do not achieve at least 5 Cs, including English and Maths at GCSE, has also been criticised, as it essentially requires 40% of each intake to achieve the grades only obtained by the top 20% when GCSE was introduced.

The extent of the switching away from the terminal exam only GCSE to the IGCSEs in public and private schools was revealed in answers to a parliamentary question posed by Labour MP Lucy Powell in November 2018. The option to choose to do so is no longer open to state schools since the introduction of the new GCSEs graded 1–9.

Michael Gove, the architect of these reformed examinations, said in 2009: &quot;Denying IGCSEs in core subjects to children in state schools will only serve to increase the level of inequality in education&quot;.

=== Errors and mistakes ===
Teachers and pupils have the option to question exam results and have the scripts marked again if they feel the grade awarded does not reflect the pupil&#x27;s ability and expectations; or if they review a copy of the script and notice a marking error. In recent years, there have been complaints that GCSEs and GCE A-Levels were marked unfairly. (In 2012, for the first time in the history of the exams, the proportion of all GCSEs awarded an A*–C grade fell).

This can be seen as, in general, more appeals being submitted each year, however the appeals rarely result in any grade changes as only 182 out of 6.2 million (0.003%) grades were changed in England in 2018, with most upheld appeals ending in no change of marks.

In one incident concerning the 2016 GCSE biology exam, there were complaints about the apparent lack of biology content in the exam. One of the questions in the biology exam asked students to define an &quot;independent company&quot;, which some students perceived to be a business studies question.

The May 2017 English literature exam (under the regulation of OCR) wrongly implied that Tybalt, a character in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, was not a Capulet. This serious flaw in the question confused many of the students. OCR accepted responsibility and claimed no pupil would be disadvantaged. The question was worth 40 marks, a relatively large number of marks.

In 2022, advance information was given by examination boards to students, providing them with information on what topics would or would not be on the exam. However, in the Physics paper 1 exam, a topic that was stated as &quot;Not Assessed&quot; came up; AQA accepted the mistake and awarded all students the full 9 marks to the question. Also, in 2022, a question on one of the higher Maths papers was leaked hours before students sat them. The exam board Edexcel apologised and conducted a full investigation.

=== Cancellations ===
In 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, GCSE examinations, along with all other May and June exams that year were cancelled. The government announced that GCSE and A-level grades would be awarded through teachers&#x27; assessments based on mock exams, coursework and other available evidence, moderated by a statistical standardisation model developed by Ofqual. This is the first cancellation of GCSEs since they were introduced.

An algorithm for deciding grades was originally introduced by Ofqual, which got used for A-Level grades. However, this caused backlash, causing the government to ultimately replace the algorithm with Center Assessed Grades for GCSEs on 17 August.

In 2021, GCSEs, along with A-level and AS exams, were cancelled again due to the pandemic and replaced with teacher assessed grades. The grades were decided based on previous mock exams, homework, classwork, and optional examinations set by Ofqual.

=== Calls for reform and abolition ===
Support for scrapping GCSEs in England has increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rethinking Assessment was established in September 2020 to call for assessment reform in secondary education, including scrapping GCSEs. Members include multi-academy trusts including the Academies Enterprise Trust and Bohunt Academy Trust, independents schools including Eton College, Bedales School and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, and Lord Baker of Dorking, the Conservative who introduced GCSEs as education secretary in 1986.

In 2021, former Conservative prime minister John Major led calls by him and eight former education secretaries, both Conservative and Labour, for GCSEs to either be scrapped and replaced, reformed or reviewed. Former education secretaries who called for them to be scrapped included Lord Baker, Lord Blunkett and Alan Johnson, while those calling for changes, reforms or a review included Major and former education secretaries Baroness Morgan of Cotes, Justine Greening, Charles Clarke and Ruth Kelly. Former Labour schools minister David Miliband also called for them to be scrapped, as did Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chaired the Education Select Committee in the House of Commons between 2017 and 2022. Support for scrapping GCSEs also came from teaching unions, including the National Education Union which is the largest teaching union in the country, and a group of centrist one-nation Conservative MPs. Schools Minister Nick Gibb rejected the proposal, thinking that &quot;it would be a huge mistake to abolish the tried and tested GCSEs&quot;.

In 2022, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair called for GCSEs and A-Levels to be scrapped and replaced by a new qualification and an examination based on the International Baccalaureate. Before the age of 16, pupils would be assessed through pupil assessment. From 16 to 18, they would be assessed continually on their subject knowledge and skills through multiple methods including examination, which would determine their final grade. Blair declined enacting a similar proposal when he was prime minister.

<text>A one-instruction set computer (OISC), sometimes referred to as an ultimate [[RISC|reduced instruction set computer]] (URISC), is an abstract machine that uses only one instructionobviating the need for a machine language opcode. With a judicious choice for the single instruction and given arbitrarily many resources, an OISC is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions. OISCs have been recommended as aids in teaching computer architecture and have been used as computational models in structural computing research. The first carbon nanotube computer is a 1-bit one-instruction set computer (and has only 178 transistors).

== Machine architecture ==
In a Turing-complete model, each memory location can store an arbitrary integer, anddepending on the mode, there may be arbitrarily many locations. The instructions themselves reside in memory as a sequence of such integers.

There exists a class of universal computers with a single instruction based on bit manipulation such as bit copying or bit inversion. Since their memory model is finite, as is the memory structure used in real computers, those bit manipulation machines are equivalent to real computers rather than to Turing machines.

Currently known OISCs can be roughly separated into three broad categories:

* Bit-manipulating machines
* Transport triggered architecture machines
* Arithmetic-based Turing-complete machines

=== Bit-manipulating machines ===
Bit-manipulating machines are the simplest class.

==== FlipJump ====
The FlipJump machine has 1 instruction, a;b - flips the bit a, then jumps to b. This is the most primitive OISC, but it&#x27;s still useful. It can successfully do math/logic calculations, branching, pointers, and calling functions with the help of its standard library.

==== BitBitJump ====
A bit copying machine, called BitBitJump, copies one bit in memory and passes the execution unconditionally to the address specified by one of the operands of the instruction. This process turns out to be capable of universal computation (i.e. being able to execute any algorithm and to interpret any other universal machine) because copying bits can conditionally modify the copying address that will be subsequently executed.

==== Toga computer ====
Another machine, called the Toga Computer, inverts a bit and passes the execution conditionally depending on the result of inversion. The unique instruction is TOGA(a,b) which stands for TOGgle &quot;a&quot; And branch to &quot;b&quot; if the result of the toggle operation is true.

==== Multi-bit copying machine ====
Similar to BitBitJump, a multi-bit copying machine copies several bits at the same time. The problem of computational universality is solved in this case by keeping predefined jump tables in the memory.

=== Transport triggered architecture ===
&quot;Transport triggered architecture&quot; (TTA) is a design in which computation is a side effect of data transport. Usually, some memory registers (triggering ports) within common address space perform an assigned operation when the instruction references them. For example, in an OISC using a single memory-to-memory copy instruction, this is done by triggering ports that perform arithmetic and instruction pointer jumps when written to.

=== Arithmetic-based Turing-complete machines ===
Arithmetic-based Turing-complete machines use an arithmetic operation and a conditional jump. Like the two previous universal computers, this class is also Turing-complete. The instruction operates on integers which may also be addresses in memory.

Currently there are several known OISCs of this class, based on different arithmetic operations:

* addition (addleq, add and branch if less than or equal to zero)
* decrement (DJN, Decrement and branch (Jump) if Nonzero)
* increment (P1eq, Plus 1 and branch if equal to another value)
* subtraction (subleq, subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero)
* positive subtraction when possible, else branch (Arithmetic machine)

== Instruction types ==
Common choices for the single instruction are:

* Subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero
* Subtract and branch if negative
* Subtract if positive else branch
* Reverse subtract and skip if borrow
* Move (used as part of a transport triggered architecture)

* Subtract and branch if non zero (SBNZ a, b, c, destination)
* Cryptoleq (heterogeneous encrypted and unencrypted computation)

Only &quot;one&quot; of these instructions is used in a given implementation. Hence, there is no need for an opcode to identify which instruction to execute; the choice of instruction is inherent in the design of the machine, and an OISC is typically named after the instruction it uses (e.g., an SBN OISC, the SUBLEQ language, etc.). Each of the above instructions can be used to construct a Turing-complete OISC.

This article presents only subtraction-based instructions among those that are not transport triggered. However, it is possible to construct Turing complete machines using an instruction based on other arithmetic operations, e.g., addition. For example, one variation known as DLN (Decrement and jump if not zero) has only two operands and uses decrement as the base operation. For more information see Subleq derivative languages .

=== Subtract and branch if not equal to zero ===
The codice_1 instruction (&quot;&quot;subtract and branch if not equal to zero&quot;) subtracts the contents at address &quot;a&quot; from the contents at address &quot;b&quot;, stores the result at address &quot;c&quot;, and then, &quot;if the result is not 0&quot;, transfers control to address &quot;d&quot; (if the result is equal to zero, execution proceeds to the next instruction in sequence).

=== Subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero ===
The instruction (&quot;subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero&quot;) subtracts the contents at address from the contents at address , stores the result at address , and then, &quot;if the result is not positive&quot;, transfers control to address (if the result is positive, execution proceeds to the next instruction in sequence). Pseudocode:

 Instruction subleq a, b, c
 Mem[b] = Mem[b] - Mem[a]
 if (Mem[b] ≤ 0)
 goto c

Conditional branching can be suppressed by setting the third operand equal to the address of the next instruction in sequence. If the third operand is not written, this suppression is implied.

A variant is also possible with two operands and an internal accumulator, where the accumulator is subtracted from the memory location specified by the first operand. The result is stored in both the accumulator and the memory location, and the second operand specifies the branch address:

 Instruction subleq2 a, b
 Mem[a] = Mem[a] - ACCUM
 ACCUM = Mem[a]
 if (Mem[a] ≤ 0)
 goto b

Although this uses only two (instead of three) operands per instruction, correspondingly more instructions are then needed to effect various logical operations.

==== Synthesized instructions ====
It is possible to synthesize many types of higher-order instructions using only the instruction.

Unconditional branch:
:
 subleq Z, Z, c
Addition can be performed by repeated subtraction, with no conditional branching; e.g., the following instructions result in the content at location being added to the content at location :
:
 subleq a, Z
 subleq Z, b
 subleq Z, Z
The first instruction subtracts the content at location from the content at location (which is 0) and stores the result (which is the negative of the content at ) in location . The second instruction subtracts this result from , storing in this difference (which is now the sum of the contents originally at and ); the third instruction restores the value 0 to .

A copy instruction can be implemented similarly; e.g., the following instructions result in the content at location getting replaced by the content at location , again assuming the content at location is maintained as 0:
:
 subleq b, b
 subleq a, Z
 subleq Z, b
 subleq Z, Z
Any desired arithmetic test can be built. For example, a branch-if-zero condition can be assembled from the following instructions:
:
 subleq b, Z, L1
 subleq Z, Z, OUT
L1:
 subleq Z, Z
 subleq Z, b, c
OUT:


Subleq2 can also be used to synthesize higher-order instructions, although it generally requires more operations for a given task. For example, no fewer than 10 subleq2 instructions are required to flip all the bits in a given byte:
:
 subleq2 tmp ; tmp = 0 (tmp = temporary register)
 subleq2 tmp
 subleq2 one ; acc = -1
 subleq2 a ; a&#x27; = a + 1
 subleq2 Z ; Z = - a - 1
 subleq2 tmp ; tmp = a + 1
 subleq2 a ; a&#x27; = 0
 subleq2 tmp ; load tmp into acc
 subleq2 a ; a&#x27; = - a - 1 ( = ~a )
 subleq2 Z ; set Z back to 0
==== Emulation ====
The following program (written in pseudocode) emulates the execution of a -based OISC:
 int memory[], program_counter, a, b, c
 program_counter = 0
 while (program_counter &gt;= 0):
 a = memory[program_counter]
 b = memory[program_counter+1]
 c = memory[program_counter+2]
 if (a &lt; 0 or b &lt; 0):
 program_counter = -1
 else:
 memory[b] = memory[b] - memory[a]
 if (memory[b] &gt; 0):
 program_counter += 3
 else:
 program_counter = c
This program assumes that is indexed by &quot;nonnegative&quot; integers. Consequently, for a instruction (, , ), the program interprets , , or an executed branch to as a halting condition. Similar interpreters written in a -based language (i.e., self-interpreters, which may use self-modifying code as allowed by the nature of the instruction) can be found in the external links below.

A general purpose SMP-capable 64-bit operating system called Dawn OS has been implemented in an emulated Subleq machine. The OS contains a C-like compiler. Some memory areas in the virtual machine are used for peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, hard drives, network card, etc. Basic applications written for it include a media player, painting tool, document reader and scientific calculator.

A 32-bit Subleq computer with a graphic display and a keyboard called Izhora has been constructed by Yoel Matveyev as a large cellular automation pattern.

==== Compilation ====
There is a compiler called Higher Subleq written by Oleg Mazonka that compiles a simplified C program into code.

Alternatively there is a self hosting Forth implementation written by Richard James Howe that runs on top of a Subleq VM and is capable of interactive programming of the Subleq machine 

=== Subtract and branch if negative ===
The instruction (&quot;subtract and branch if negative&quot;&quot;), also called , is defined similarly to :

 Instruction subneg a, b, c
 Mem[b] = Mem[b] - Mem[a]
 if (Mem[b] &lt; 0)
 goto c

Conditional branching can be suppressed by setting the third operand equal to the address of the next instruction in sequence. If the third operand is not written, this suppression is implied.

==== Synthesized instructions ====
It is possible to synthesize many types of higher-order instructions using only the instruction. For simplicity, only one synthesized instruction is shown here to illustrate the difference between and .

Unconditional branch:
:
 subneg POS, Z, c
where and are locations previously set to contain 0 and a positive integer, respectively;

Unconditional branching is assured only if initially contains 0 (or a value less than the integer stored in ). A follow-up instruction is required to clear after the branching, assuming that the content of must be maintained as 0.

==== subneg4 ====
A variant is also possible with four operands – subneg4. The reversal of minuend and subtrahend eases implementation in hardware. The non-destructive result simplifies the synthetic instructions.

 Instruction subneg s, m, r, j
 &quot;(* subtrahend, minuend, result and jump addresses *)&quot;
 Mem[r] = Mem[m] - Mem[s]
 if (Mem[r] &lt; 0)
 goto j

=== Arithmetic machine ===
In an attempt to make Turing machine more intuitive, Z. A. Melzak consider the task of computing with positive numbers. The machine has an infinite abacus, an infinite number of counters (pebbles, tally sticks) initially at a special location S. The machine is able to do one operation: 

Take from location X as many counters as there are in location Y and transfer them to location Z and proceed to instruction y.

If this operation is not possible because there is not enough counters in X, then leave the abacus as it is and proceed to instruction n. 
In order to keep all numbers positive and mimic a human operator computing on a real world abacus, the test is performed before any subtraction. Pseudocode:

 Instruction melzak X, Y, Z, n, y
 if (Mem[X] &lt; Mem[Y])
 goto n
 Mem[X] -= Mem[Y]
 Mem[Z] += Mem[Y]
 goto y

After giving a few programs: multiplication, gcd, computing the &quot;n&quot;-th prime number, representation in base &quot;b&quot; of an arbitrary number, sorting in order of magnitude, Melzak shows explicitly how to simulate an arbitrary Turing machine on his arithmetic machine.
:
multiply:
 melzak P, ONE, S, stop ; Move 1 counter from P to S. If not possible, move to stop.
 melzak S, Q, ANS, multiply, multiply ; Move q counters from S to ANS. Move to the first instruction.
stop:

where the memory location P is &quot;p&quot;, Q is &quot;q&quot;, ONE is 1, ANS is initially 0 and at the end &quot;pq&quot;, and S is a large number. 

He mentions that it can easily be shown using the elements of recursive functions that every number calculable on the arithmetic machine is computable. A proof of which was given by Lambek on an equivalent two instruction machine : X+ (increment X) and X− else T (decrement X if it not empty, else jump to T).

=== Reverse subtract and skip if borrow ===
In a &quot;reverse subtract and skip if borrow&quot; (RSSB) instruction, the accumulator is subtracted from the memory location and the next instruction is skipped if there was a borrow (memory location was smaller than the accumulator). The result is stored in both the accumulator and the memory location. The program counter is mapped to memory location 0. The accumulator is mapped to memory location 1.

 Instruction rssb x
 ACCUM = Mem[x] - ACCUM
 Mem[x] = ACCUM
 if (ACCUM &lt; 0)
 goto PC + 2

==== Example ====
To set x to the value of y minus z:
# First, move z to the destination location x.
 RSSB temp # Three instructions required to clear acc, temp [See Note 1]
 RSSB temp
 RSSB temp
 RSSB x # Two instructions clear acc, x, since acc is already clear
 RSSB x
 RSSB y # Load y into acc: no borrow
 RSSB temp # Store -y into acc, temp: always borrow and skip
 RSSB temp # Skipped
 RSSB x # Store y into x, acc
# Second, perform the operation.
 RSSB temp # Three instructions required to clear acc, temp
 RSSB temp
 RSSB temp
 RSSB z # Load z
 RSSB x # x = y - z [See Note 2]

* [Note 1] If the value stored at &quot;temp&quot; is initially a negative value and the instruction that executed right before the first &quot;RSSB temp&quot; in this routine borrowed, then four &quot;RSSB temp&quot; instructions will be required for the routine to work.
* [Note 2] If the value stored at &quot;z&quot; is initially a negative value then the final &quot;RSSB x&quot; will be skipped and thus the routine will not work.

=== Transport triggered architecture ===

A transport triggered architecture uses only the &quot;move&quot; instruction, hence it was originally called a &quot;move machine&quot;. This instruction moves the contents of one memory location to another memory location combining with the current content of the new location:

 Instruction movx a, b (also written &quot;a&quot; -&gt; &quot;b&quot;)
 OP = GetOperation(Mem[&quot;b&quot;])
 Mem[&quot;b&quot;] := OP(Mem[&quot;a&quot;], Mem[&quot;b&quot;])

The operation performed is defined by the destination memory cell. Some cells are specialized in addition, some other in multiplication, etc. So memory cells are not simple store but coupled with an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) setup to perform only one sort of operation with the current value of the cell. Some of the cells are control flow instructions to alter the program execution with jumps, conditional execution, subroutines, if-then-else, for-loop, etc...

A commercial transport triggered architecture microcontroller has been produced called MAXQ, which hides the apparent inconvenience of an OISC by using a &quot;transfer map&quot; that represents all possible destinations for the &quot;move&quot; instructions.

=== Cryptoleq ===

Cryptoleq is a language similar to Subleq. It consists of one eponymous instruction and is capable of performing general-purpose computation on encrypted programs. Cryptoleq works on continuous cells of memory using direct and indirect addressing, and performs two operations and on three values A, B, and C:

 Instruction cryptoleq a, b, c
 Mem[b] = O1(Mem[a], Mem[b])
 if O2(Mem[b]) ≤ 0
 IP = c
 else
 IP = IP + 3

where a, b and c are addressed by the instruction pointer, IP, with the value of IP addressing a, IP + 1 point to b and IP + 2 to c.

In Cryptoleq operations and are defined as follows:

:formula_1

:formula_2

The main difference with Subleq is that in Subleq, simply subtracts from and equals to . Cryptoleq is also homomorphic to Subleq, modular inversion and multiplication is homomorphic to subtraction and the operation of corresponds the Subleq test if the values were unencrypted. A program written in Subleq can run on a Cryptoleq machine, meaning backwards compatibility. However, Cryptoleq implements fully homomorphic calculations and is capable of multiplications. Multiplication on an encrypted domain is assisted by a unique function G that is assumed to be difficult to reverse engineer and allows re-encryption of a value based on the operation:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the re-encrypted value of and formula_5 is encrypted zero. is the encrypted value of a variable, let it be , and formula_6 equals .

The multiplication algorithm is based on addition and subtraction, uses the function G and does not have conditional jumps nor branches. Cryptoleq encryption is based on Paillier cryptosystem.
