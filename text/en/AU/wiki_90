<text>A federation [[Urdu language|(Urdu وفاق)]]: (also called a federal state) is an entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision, neither by the component states nor the federal political body without constitutional amendment.

Sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.

Overriding powers of a central authority theoretically can include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state&#x27;s government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states&#x27; powers by invoking the central government&#x27;s constitutional authority to ensure &quot;peace and good government&quot; or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty.

The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered in comparison with the unitary state. France and Japan, for example, have been unitary for many centuries.
The Austrian Empire was a unitary state with crown lands; after the transformation into the Austria-Hungary monarchy, the remaining crown lands of so-called Cisleithania became federated as &quot;Länder&quot; of the Republic of Austria through the implementation of its constitution. Germany, with its 16 states, or &quot;Länder&quot;, and Nigeria, with its 36 states and federal capital territory, are examples of federations. Federations are often multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory (such as Russia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil, Pakistan or Australia), but neither is necessarily the case (such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or the Federated States of Micronesia). About 40% of world population live in a federation.

==History==
Several ancient chiefdoms and kingdoms, such as the 4th-century-BCE League of Corinth, Noricum in Central Europe, and the Iroquois Confederacy in pre-Columbian North America, could be described as federations or confederations. The Old Swiss Confederacy was an early example of formal non-unitary statehood.

Several colonies and dominions in the New World consisted of autonomous provinces, transformed into federal states upon independence such as the United States, and various countries in Latin America (see Spanish American wars of independence). Some of the New World federations failed; the Federal Republic of Central America broke up into independent states less than 20 years after its founding. Others, such as Argentina, have shifted between federal, confederal, and unitary systems, before settling into federalism. Brazil became a federation only after the fall of the monarchy, and Venezuela became a federation after the Federal War. Australia and Canada are also federations.

Germany is another nation-state that has switched between confederal, federal and unitary rules, since the German Confederation was founded in 1815. The North German Confederation, the succeeding German Empire and the Weimar Republic were federations.

Founded in 1922, the Soviet Union was formally a federation of Soviet republics, autonomous republics and other federal subjects, though in practice highly centralized under the government of the Soviet Union. The Russian Federation has inherited a similar system.

India, Pakistan, Nigeria and Malaysia (then Federation of Malaya) became federations on or shortly before becoming independent from the British Empire.

In some recent cases, federations have been instituted as a measure to handle ethnic conflict within a state, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraq since 2005 as well as Somalia since 2012.

With the United States Constitution having become effective on 4 March 1789, the United States is the oldest surviving federation, while the newest federation is Nepal, after its constitution went into effect on 20th September 2015.

==Federations and other forms of state==








===Federations===
The component states are in some sense sovereign, insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government. However, a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states. The component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law. However, German Länder have that power, which is beginning to be exercised on a European level.

Some federations are called asymmetric because some states have more autonomy than others. An example of such a federation is Malaysia, in which Sarawak and Sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of Peninsular Malaysia.

A federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states. The purpose can be the will to solve mutual problems and to provide for mutual defense or to create a nation-state for an ethnicity spread over several states. The former was the case with the United States and Switzerland. However, as the histories of countries and nations vary, the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models. Australia, for instance, is unique in that it came into existence as a nation by the democratic vote of the citizens of each state, who voted &quot;yes&quot; in referendums to adopt the Australian Constitution. Brazil, on the other hand, has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history. Some present-day states of the Brazilian federation retain borders set during the Portuguese colonization (before the very existence of the Brazilian state), whereas the latest state, Tocantins, was created by the 1988 Constitution for chiefly administrative reasons.

Seven of the top eight largest countries by area are governed as federations.

===Unitary states===
A unitary state is sometimes one with only a single, centralized, national tier of government. However, unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions. The difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government, and may be unilaterally revoked. While it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states, in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution, where a formerly centralized state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate. Thus, federations are often established voluntarily from &quot;below&quot; whereas devolution grants self-government from &quot;above&quot;.

===Confederation===

A confederation, in modern political terms, is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states. The closest entity in the world to a confederation at this time is the European Union. While the word &quot;confederation&quot; was officially used when the Canadian federal system was established in 1867, the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since Canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be. In the case of Switzerland, while the country is still known officially as the Swiss Confederation, this is now a misnomer since the Swiss cantons lost their sovereign status in 1848.

In Belgium, however, the opposite movement is underway. Belgium was founded as a centralized state, after the French model, but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s. Moreover, although nominally called a federal state, the country&#x27;s structure already has a number of confederational traits. At present, there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions.

A confederation is most likely to feature three differences when contrasted with a federation: (1) No real direct powers: many confederal decisions are externalized by member-state legislation; (2) Decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple majority but by special majorities or even by consensus or unanimity (veto for every member); (3) Changes of the constitution, usually a treaty, require unanimity.

Over time these terms acquired distinct connotations leading to the present difference in definition. An example of this is the United States under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system (albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government). However, Canadians, designed with a &quot;stronger&quot; central government than the US in the wake of the Civil War of the latter, use the term &quot;Confederation&quot; to refer to the formation or joining, not the structure, of Canada. Legal reforms, court rulings, and political compromises have &quot;decentralized&quot; Canada in practice since its formation in 1867.

===Empire===
An empire is a multi-ethnic state, multinational state, or a group of nations with a central government established usually through coercion (on the model of the Roman Empire). An empire often includes self-governing regions, but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government. On the other hand, a political entity that is an empire in name, may comprise several partly autonomous kingdoms organised together in a federation, with the empire being ruled over by an emperor or senior king (great king, high king, king of kings...). One example of this was the German Empire (1871–1918).

===Comparison with other systems of autonomy===

====Federacy====
A federacy is a unitary state that incorporates one or more self-governing autonomous areas. It is distinguished from a federation in that the constitutional structure of the state is still unitary, but incorporates federalist principles. Some federacies, notably Åland, were established through international treaty.

====Devolution====
A federation differs from a devolved state, such as Indonesia and the United Kingdom, because, in a devolved state, the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits (the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly in the case of the United Kingdom) without changing the constitution. In some cases, such as the autonomous communities of Spain, devolution has led to federation in all but name, or &quot;federation without federalism&quot;.

====Crown dependencies====
The relation between the Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands and the United Kingdom is very similar to a federate relation: the Islands enjoy independence from the United Kingdom, which, via The Crown, takes care of their foreign relations and defense – although the UK Parliament does have overall power to legislate for the dependencies. However, the islands are neither an incorporated part of the United Kingdom nor are they considered to be independent or associated states. The islands do not have a monarch, &quot;per se&quot;; rather in the Isle of Man the British Monarch is, &quot;ex officio&quot;, Lord of Mann, and in the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, the British Monarch rules as the Duke of Normandy.

====Dependent territories====
Dependent territories, such as the British overseas territories, are vested with varying degrees of power; some enjoy considerable independence from the sovereign state, which only takes care of their foreign relations and defense. However, they are neither considered to be part of it nor recognized as sovereign or associated states.

===&quot;De facto&quot; federations===
The distinction between a federation and a unitary state is often quite ambiguous. A unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and, while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region, it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice. The self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations. For these reasons, it is sometimes argued that some modern unitary states are &quot;de facto&quot; federations.

&quot;De facto&quot; federations, or quasi-federations, are often termed &quot;regional states&quot;.

====Spain====

Spain is suggested as one possible &quot;de facto&quot; federation as it grants more self-government to its autonomous communities than are retained by the constituent entities of most federations. For the Spanish parliament to revoke the autonomy of regions such as Galicia, Catalonia or the Basque Country would be a political near-impossibility, though nothing bars it legally. The Spanish parliament has, however, suspended the autonomy of Catalonia in response to the Catalan declaration of independence, in the lead-up to the 2017 Catalan election. Additionally, some autonomies such as Navarre or the Basque Country have full control over taxation and spending, transferring a payment to the central government for the common services (military, foreign relations, macroeconomic policy). For example, scholar Enrique Guillén López discusses the &quot;federal nature of Spain&#x27;s government (a trend that almost no one denies).&quot; Each autonomous community is governed by a Statute of Autonomy () under the Spanish Constitution of 1978.

====South Africa====

Although South Africa bears some elements of a federal system, such as the allocation of certain powers to provinces, some nevertheless argue that it is functionally a unitary state. On the other hand, if federation is defined as the constitutional entrenchment of the powers of subcentral units (provinces, etc.) that is not unilaterally changeable or revocable by the central authority, South Africa does qualify, formally, as a federal state.

====European Union====
The European Union (EU) is a sui generis political union or confederation (the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state). Robert Schuman, the initiator of the European Community system, wrote that a transnational Community like the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community lay midway between an association of States where they retained complete independence and a federation leading to a fusion of States in a super-state. The Founding Fathers of the European Union wrote the Europe Declaration (Charter of the Community) at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 18 April 1951 saying that Europe should be organized on a transnational foundation. They envisaged a structure quite different from a federation called the European Political Community.

The EU is a three-pillar structure of the original supranational European Economic Community and the nuclear energy cooperation and non-proliferation treaty, Euratom, plus two largely intergovernmental pillars dealing with External Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs. The EU is therefore not a &quot;de jure&quot; federation, although some academic observers conclude that after 50 years of institutional evolution since the Treaties of Rome it is &quot;becoming&quot; one. The European Union possesses attributes of a federal state. However, its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law, so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union. The EU has responsibility for important areas such as trade, monetary union, agriculture, and fisheries. Nonetheless, EU member states retain the right to act independently in matters of foreign policy and defense, and also enjoy a near-monopoly over other major policy areas such as criminal justice and taxation. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, the Member States&#x27; right to leave the Union is codified, and the Union operates with more qualified majority voting (rather than unanimity) in many areas.



A more nuanced view has been given by the German Constitutional Court. Here the EU is defined as &#x27;an association of sovereign national states (&quot;Staatenverbund&quot;)&#x27;. With this view, the European Union resembles more of a confederation.

====People&#x27;s Republic of China====

Constitutionally, the power vested in the special administrative regions of the People&#x27;s Republic is granted from the Central People&#x27;s Government, through a decision by the National People&#x27;s Congress. However, there have been certain largely informal grants of power to the provinces, to handle economic affairs and implement national policies, resulting in a system some have termed federalism &quot;with Chinese characteristics&quot;.

====Myanmar====
Constitutionally a unitary state, the political system in Myanmar bears many elements of federalism. Each administrative division has its own cabinets and chief ministers, making it more like a federation rather than a unitary state.

====Wallis and Futuna====
The French overseas collectivity Wallis and Futuna maintains some quasi-federation attributes. The territory is divided into three traditional chiefdoms: Uvea, Sigave, and Alo. The chiefdoms are allowed to have their own legal system which have to be implemented along with French legal system.

====Comoros====
Under the terms of the Fomboni Accords, signed in December 2001 by the leaders of all three islands, the official name of the country was changed to the Union of the Comoros; the new state was to be highly decentralised and the central union government would devolve most powers to the new island governments, each led by a president.

==Internal controversy and conflict==

Certain forms of political and constitutional dispute are common to federations. One issue is that the exact division of power and responsibility between federal and regional governments is often a source of controversy. Often, as is the case with the United States, such conflicts are resolved through the judicial system, which delimits the powers of federal and local governments. The relationship between federal and local courts varies from nation to nation and can be a controversial and complex issue in itself.

Another common issue in federal systems is the conflict between regional and national interests, or between the interests and aspirations of different ethnic groups. In some federations the entire jurisdiction is relatively homogeneous, and each constituent state resembles a miniature version of the whole; this is known as &#x27;congruent federalism&#x27;. On the other hand, incongruent federalism exists where different states or regions possess distinct ethnic groups.

The ability of a federal government to create national institutions that can mediate differences that arise because of linguistic, ethnic, religious, or other regional differences is an important challenge. The inability to meet this challenge may lead to the secession of parts of a federation or to civil war, as occurred in the United States (southern states sought to protect the institution of slavery while northern states opposed it, with a catalysis occurring in the then–Kansas Territory), in Nigeria and in Switzerland. In the case of Malaysia, Singapore was expelled from the federation because of rising racial tension. In some cases, internal conflict may lead a federation to collapse entirely, as occurred the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Gran Colombia, the United Provinces of Central America, and the West Indies Federation.

==Federal governments==
The federal government is the common government of a national or supranational federation. A federal government may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states. The structure of federal governments varies. Based on a broad definition of a basic federalism, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a constitution.

The federal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state. Usual responsibilities of this level of government are maintaining national security and exercising international diplomacy, including the right to sign binding treaties. Basically, a modern federal government, within the limits defined by its constitution, has the power to make laws for the whole country, unlike local governments. As originally written, the United States Constitution was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers. It was further limited by the addition of the Tenth Amendment contained in the Bill of Rights and the Eleventh Amendment. However, later amendments, particularly the Fourteenth Amendment, gave the federal government considerable authority over states.

Federal government within this structure are the government ministries and departments and agencies to which the ministers of government are assigned.

<text>&quot;Zdravljica&quot; (; ) is a &quot;carmen figuratum&quot; poem by the 19th-century Romantic Slovene poet France Prešeren, inspired by the ideals of &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;. It was written in 1844 and published with some changes in 1848. Four years after it was written, Slovenes living within Habsburg Empire interpreted the poem in spirit of the 1848 March Revolution as political promotion of the idea of a united Slovenia. In it, the poet also declares his belief in a free-thinking Slovene and Slavic political awareness. In 1989, it was adopted as the regional anthem of Slovenia, becoming the national anthem upon independence in 1991.

== History ==

The integral version of the poem was first published only after the March Revolution when Austrian censorship was abolished, since the censorship did not allow for the poem to be printed earlier because of its political message. On 26 April 1848, it was published by the Slovene newspaper &quot;Kmetijske in rokodelske novice&quot;, that was edited by the Slovene conservative political leader Janez Bleiweis.
Before the censorship was abolished, Prešeren omitted the third stanza (&quot;&quot;V sovražnike &#x27;z oblakov / rodú naj naš&#x27;ga treši gróm&quot;) because he intended to include the poem in his &quot;Poezije&quot; collection (&quot;Poems&quot;), however the censor (fellow-Slovene Franz Miklosich in Austrian service) saw in the fourth stanza (&quot;Edinost, sreča, sprava / k nam naj nazaj se vrnejo&quot;&quot;) an expression of pan-Slavic sentiment and therefore did not allow its publication either. Prešeren believed the poem would be mutilated without both the third and the fourth stanza and decided against including it in the &quot;Poezije&quot;.

&quot;Zdravljica&quot; was first set to music in the 1860s by Benjamin Ipavec and Davorin Jenko, but their versions didn&#x27;t go well with the public, probably because the stanzas that they chose were not enough nationally awakening. In 1905, the Slovene composer Stanko Premrl wrote a choral composition. It was first performed only on 18 November 1917 by the Music Society (&quot;&quot;) in the Grand Hotel Union, Ljubljana. It became an immediate success.

<doc id="156383" wikidata="Q17104990" url="?curid=156383" title="Harriet Vane">
<text>Harriet Deborah Vane, later Lady Peter Wimsey, is a fictional character in the works of British writer Dorothy L. Sayers (1893–1957) and the sequels by Jill Paton Walsh.

Vane, a mystery writer, initially meets Lord Peter Wimsey while she is on trial for poisoning her lover (&quot;Strong Poison&quot;). The detective falls in love with her and proposes marriage, but she refuses to begin a relationship with him, traumatised as she is by her dead lover&#x27;s treatment of her and her recent ordeal. In &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;, she collaborates with Wimsey to solve a murder but still finds him to be overbearing and superficial. She eventually returns his love (&quot;Gaudy Night&quot;) and marries him (&quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;).

==Character biography==
Harriet Vane was born in 1903, the only daughter of a country doctor. She was an undergraduate at Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers&#x27; own Somerville College, the location of which is given as the Balliol College Sports Grounds, now partly occupied by a residential annexe, on Holywell Street) and took a First in English. Her parents both died while she was quite young and she was left to make her own fortune at the age of 23. She has had some success as a writer of detective stories, living and socialising with other artists in Bloomsbury. She begins a relationship with Philip Boyes, a more literary but far less successful writer who professes not to believe in marriage, and she agrees to live with him without marrying. After a year of this arrangement, Boyes believes that she truly loves him and proposes marriage. Angered by his hypocrisy and aghast at being offered marriage as &quot;a bad-conduct prize&quot;, Harriet breaks off the relationship.

Boyes dies soon afterwards of arsenic poisoning – the method Harriet had researched for her new book. She is arrested and tried for murdering Boyes. Wimsey comes to her rescue by proving who really poisoned Boyes.

After Harriet is acquitted, she remains quite notorious. Sales of her books skyrocket. Wimsey continues to pursue her romantically, but Harriet repeatedly declines marriage on the principle that gratitude is not a good basis for it. To relax, she takes a walking tour, during which she finds a corpse on a beach, adding to her notoriety. The press is naturally interested; Wimsey hastens to the scene, after receiving a tip from a journalist friend, to help shield Harriet from suspicion. The two investigate the death (when they are not romantically sparring) and unmask the murderer.

A few years later, in 1935, Harriet returns to her old Oxford college for a reunion (or Gaudy) and is later asked to investigate some strange occurrences there. She protests that she is not a sleuth, and recommends that the college hire professional detectives. However, failing to reach either Miss Climpson, at the female detective agency set up by Wimsey, or Wimsey himself, she agrees to assist the college. Her cover is research into Sheridan Le Fanu (in the books spelled &quot;Lefanu&quot;), an Anglo-Irish writer of Gothic tales and mystery novels of the 19th century. (In &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, the Authors&#x27; Note – plural, since the novel was finished posthumously by another author – states that Vane published a monograph on Le Fanu in 1946.) After months of unpleasant incidents at the college and with no solution in sight, Harriet turns once again to Wimsey for help. By the end of the book the villain has been discovered and Harriet has finally accepted Wimsey&#x27;s proposal.

The press is delighted to have a woman once accused of murder engaged to a duke&#x27;s son, and happily publicises the fact. Wimsey and Vane have a quiet wedding in Oxford with no notice to the press, and escape to their new country residence, Talboys, a Tudor farmhouse in North Hertfordshire which Harriet had admired as a child and which Peter has given her as a wedding present. The body of the former owner is discovered in the cellar, leading them to investigate.

&quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, a novel abandoned by Sayers and finished by Jill Paton Walsh, is set in and around London, shortly after Wimsey and Vane return from their honeymoon.

The first of their children is born in the story &quot;The Haunted Policeman&quot;.

By the time of the short story &quot;Talboys&quot;, they have three sons: Bredon Delagardie Peter Wimsey (born in October 1936), Paul Wimsey (born 1938), and Roger Wimsey (born 1940 or 1941). Chronologically between the two are &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot;, a series of epistolary articles Sayers wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot; at the beginning of World War II. Jill Paton Walsh referenced &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot; in writing &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot;, set at the beginning of the Second World War, in which Harriet takes a leading role. Sayers told friends orally that Harriet and Peter Wimsey were to have five children in all, though she did not disclose the names and sexes of the two youngest children. However, Paton Walsh did not follow this part of the Sayers heritage, and in her Wimsey books no further children come after the original three.

==Fictional works by Harriet Vane==
The following is a list of works mentioned by Dorothy Sayers and/or Jill Paton Walsh in their novels. The protagonist in most of the books is private sleuth Robert Templeton.

*Blades of Hatred in Chapter 8 of &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;.
*Curiosity Killed the Cat in chapter 13 of &quot;Busman’s Honeymoon&quot;. Possibly as a joke.
*Death ‘Twixt Wind and Water in Chapter 11 of &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;; Chapter 10 of &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, and Chapter 10 of &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;.
*Death in the Pot in Chapter 4 of &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot;.
*The Fountain Pen Mystery in Chapter 1 of &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;; Chapter 17 of &quot;The Attenbury Emeralds&quot;; chapter 4 of &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot;.
*Murder by Degrees in Chapter 1 of &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;; Chapter 4 of Presumption of Death&quot;; Chapter 9 of &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;.
*The Sands of Crime in chapter 1 of &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;.
*Sheridan Le Fanu Monograph in &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, Author’s Note. In &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, its tentative title is given as &quot;Study of Le Fanu&quot;.
*Three short stories are mentioned in chapter 14 of &quot;Busman’s Honeymoon&quot;.
*A novel set in Carcassonne and one set in Madrid in the first chapter of &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.
*Series of short stories set in Berlin in the first chapter of &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.

==Influences==
Sayers consciously modelled Vane on herself, although perhaps not as closely as her fans (and even friends) sometimes thought. Some view Vane as a stand-in for the author, although Vane has many more faults than most such characters.

Sayers was among the first generation of women to receive an Oxford education, graduating BA with first-class honours in 1915 and as an MA in 1920. She gave Harriet Vane, too, an Oxford education. Vane&#x27;s relationship with Boyes has many similarities with Sayers&#x27; love affair (1921–1922) with the author John Cournos (1881–1966), a Russian-born American Jew.

Biographers note that Sayers&#x27; later relationship with Bill White and her marriage to the fellow writer Oswald Atherton &quot;Mac&quot; Fleming provide grist for Vane&#x27;s struggle to balance love (and perhaps marriage to Wimsey) and her work. After Sayers&#x27; affairs with Cournos and White were revealed, the comparisons between Sayers and Vane became more emphatic. (Neither of these affairs was publicly known during Sayers&#x27; lifetime.)

McGregor and Lewis suggest that some of Vane&#x27;s and Wimsey&#x27;s observations about mystery in story versus real life – though in the context of a mystery story – reflect Sayers&#x27; sense of fun and ability to laugh with her characters.

==Portrayal in film, TV or theatre==
Harriet Vane was portrayed by Constance Cummings in a 1940 film adaptation of &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; (US: &quot;The Haunted Honeymoon&quot;), with Robert Montgomery as Peter Wimsey. However, the film bore little resemblance to Sayers&#x27; writing, and she refused to see it. Vane was voiced by Sarah Badel in a BBC Radio 4 serialization of &#x27;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&#x27; in 1983 and was played by Harriet Walter in the 1987 BBC television adaptations of &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, &quot;Have his Carcase&quot; and &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; and by Emily Richard in the 1988 stage adaptation of &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; at The Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. In a 2005 BBC audio production of Gaudy Night, Harriet Vane was played by Joanna David.

<doc id="156385" wikidata="Q3154246" url="?curid=156385" title="Ira Einhorn">
<text>Ira Samuel Einhorn (May 15, 1940 – April 3, 2020), known as &quot;The Unicorn Killer&quot;, was an American environmental activist and convicted murderer. His moniker, &quot;the Unicorn&quot;, was derived from his surname; Einhorn means &quot;unicorn&quot; in German. As an environmental activist, Einhorn was a speaker at the first Earth Day event in Philadelphia in 1970. On September 9, 1977, Einhorn&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Holly Maddux disappeared following a trip to collect her belongings from the apartment she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighteen months later, police found her partially decomposed body in a trunk in Einhorn&#x27;s closet.

After his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty-two years in Europe before being extradited to the United States. He took the stand in his own defense, claiming his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who had framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency&#x27;s paranormal military research. He was convicted of murdering Holly Maddux and served a life sentence until his death in prison on April 3, 2020.

==Early life and education==
Ira Einhorn was born in Philadelphia into a middle-class Jewish family. As a student at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his undergraduate degree in English in 1961 before returning to complete some graduate work in the discipline in 1963, he became active in ecological groups and was part of the counterculture, anti-establishment, and anti-war movements of the 1960s and 1970s.

==Career and activism==
Einhorn was a speaker at the first Earth Day event in Philadelphia in 1970 and later claimed to have been instrumental in creating and launching the event, but event organizers dispute his account.

Einhorn served as an instructor of English at Temple University during the 1964–1965 academic year, although his contract was not renewed after he conceded his &quot;contempt for the academic world&quot; and boasted of proffering &quot;straight answers about the delights and dangers&quot; of cannabis and LSD to students in an interview. He also was a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics during the autumn 1978 semester.

==Murder of Holly Maddux==
Einhorn had a five-year relationship with Holly Maddux, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College who was from Tyler, Texas. In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to New York City, where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Powelton Village apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the Philadelphia police questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts, and never returned.

Einhorn&#x27;s initial alibi came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. During this time, Einhorn was dating filmmaker Cecelia Condit, who could not smell the body due to medication she was on affecting her smell. Condit would later go on to make the short film &quot;Beneath the Skin&quot; about this experience. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux&#x27;s decomposing corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn&#x27;s closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, &quot;It looks like we found Holly,&quot; to which he reportedly replied, &quot;You found what you found.&quot; Einhorn&#x27;s lawyer, Arlen Specter, negotiated bail of $40,000; he was released from custody after posting a bond of $4,000, or 10% of the $40,000. This was paid by Barbara Bronfman (née Baerwald), a Montreal socialite who married into the wealthy Bronfman family and met Einhorn through a shared interest in the paranormal. During Einhorn&#x27;s flight he was again aided by Bronfman, who continued to support him financially until 1988, when she read Steven Levy&#x27;s damning book on Einhorn, &quot;The Unicorn&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

In 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to Europe. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a Swedish woman named Annika Flodin. In Pennsylvania, as Einhorn had already been arraigned, the state convicted him &quot;in absentia&quot; of Maddux&#x27;s murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

===Extradition===
In 1997, Einhorn was arrested in Champagne-Mouton, France, where he had been living under the name &quot;Eugène Mallon&quot; and incarcerated for about six months at the local Gradignan jail before he was placed under a loose form of house arrest. The extradition process proved more complex than initially envisioned. Under the extradition treaty between France and the United States, either country may refuse extradition under certain circumstances, and Einhorn used multiple avenues to avoid extradition.

Although Einhorn was not sentenced to death, his defense attorneys argued that he would face the death penalty if he were returned to the United States. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that it will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, the state did not practice the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the state and federal constitutions forbid &quot;ex post facto&quot; law. Einhorn&#x27;s next strategy involved French law and the European Court of Human Rights, which require a new trial when the defendant was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and unable to present his defense. On this basis, the court of appeals of Bordeaux rejected the extradition request.

Following the court&#x27;s decision, thirty-five members of Congress sent a letter to French President Jacques Chirac to ask for Einhorn&#x27;s extradition. However, under France&#x27;s doctrine of the separation of powers, which was invoked in this case, the President cannot give orders to courts and does not intervene in extradition affairs. Therefore, in 1998, to secure Einhorn&#x27;s extradition, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill, nicknamed the &quot;Einhorn Law&quot;, allowing defendants convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; to request another trial. In another delay tactic, Einhorn&#x27;s attorneys criticized the bill as unconstitutional and tried to get the French courts to once again deny the extradition on the grounds that the law would be inapplicable. However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the United States was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on remand, the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial. Einhorn then became the focus of intense surveillance by French police.

The matter went before Prime Minister Lionel Jospin; extraditions, after having been approved by courts, must be ordered by the executive. The French Green Party stated that Einhorn should not be extradited until it was certain that the &quot;Einhorn Law&quot; could not be reversed. Jospin rejected the claims and issued an extradition decree. Einhorn then litigated against the decree before the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, which ruled against him; again, the Council declined to review the constitutionality of foreign law. He then attempted to slit his own throat to avoid imprisonment and eventually litigated his case before the European Court of Human Rights, which also ruled against him. On July 20, 2001, Einhorn was extradited to the United States.

===Trial and sentencing===
Taking the stand in his own defense, Einhorn claimed that Maddux was murdered by CIA agents, who attempted to frame him due to his investigations into the Cold War and psychotronics.

After two hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Einhorn on October 17, 2002, concluding the month-long trial. The following day, he was sentenced to a mandatory life term without the possibility of parole. Einhorn began serving his sentence at Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution (SCI) Houtzdale. In November 2006, Einhorn&#x27;s sentence was unanimously affirmed by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.

==Death==
On April 3, 2020, Einhorn died in the Pennsylvania SCI Laurel Highlands. His death was reported to be of natural causes.

<doc id="156393" wikidata="Q1092765" url="?curid=156393" title="Circe chess">
<text>Circe chess (or just Circe) is a chess variant in which captured pieces return to their starting positions as soon as they are captured. The game was invented by French composer Pierre Monréal in 1967 and the rules of Circe chess were first detailed by Monréal and Jean-Pierre Boyer in an article in &quot;Problème&quot;, 1968. It is named for the enchantress Circe, who in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; instructs Odysseus on how to enter the Underworld and return, just as pieces in Circe chess can return after being killed.

Circe is rarely played as a variant game (when it is, it is usually combined with progressive chess), but very often employed in composed fairy chess problems.
==Rules==
These are the most usual rules employed in Circe—there are numerous other forms of the game in which the rules of rebirth may vary.

* Pawns return to the start position on the same file they are captured on.
* Rooks, knights and bishops return to the starting square which is the same colour as the square they are captured on.
* Captured queens are returned to the queen&#x27;s square.

For instance, a white pawn captured on b4 is reborn on b2; a black knight captured on f6 is reborn on b8; a black rook captured on the same square is reborn on h8. Castling with a reborn rook is permitted. A reborn pawn regains its initial two-step move option. A captured promoted piece is treated as a piece (not a pawn). 

If the square that the rebirth should take place on is occupied, either by a friendly or enemy piece, the captured unit is not reborn—it is instead removed from the board and takes no further part in the game (like a capture in orthodox chess).

If a pawn captures via &quot;en passant&quot;, it would be immediately in front of the reborn opponent&#x27;s pawn, thus preventing either pawn from moving.

Philip Cohen has suggested that a move that simply reverses the opponent&#x27;s previous move should not be permitted. (For example, White Qd1, Black Bg4: if White plays Qxg4, the bishop is reborn on c8, and Black should not be permitted to immediately recapture Bxg4.)

==Example==
The position illustrated demonstrates a couple of unusual effects which can occur in Circe. It is Black to move. White is threatening checkmate with 1.Re1#. Black would not be able to defend with 1...Kxe1 after this move, because the rook is instantly reborn on a1 from where it gives check (Black&#x27;s bishop does defend a1, and the black king is free to move to e2 or capture at d2, but this is of no consequence as after Kxe1 it will be &quot;White&#x27;s&quot; move.). It might appear that there is nothing Black can do to prevent this threat, but in fact he has 1...Ba1 – if now 2.Re1+, Kxe1 is possible because the rook is not reborn because its rebirth square is occupied.

==Notation==
When notating a Circe game in algebraic notation, it is conventional to place details of where a captured piece has been reborn in parentheses following the move. For example, if in the example diagram, White were to take Black&#x27;s knight, this would be notated Rxe8(Ng8).

==Circe variants==
There are many variants of Circe, especially in chess problems. Instead of being reborn on their starting positions the pieces may be reborn on other locations.
* Anticirce: The capturing piece is reborn on its initial square. The captured piece disappears from the board. The rebirth square must be empty or the capture is illegal. There are two types: Type Cheylan: captures on the rebirth square are illegal (i.e. a white rook can not capture on a1). Type Calvet: captures on the rebirth square are legal.
* Assassin Circe: The rebirth occurs even if the rebirth square is occupied. The occupying piece is removed from the board. When a piece is captured on its rebirth square, the capturing piece disappears.
* Chamaeleon Circe: A captured piece (other than a pawn) is reborn as a different piece: knight becomes bishop, bishop becomes rook, rook becomes queen and queen becomes knight. The reborn piece is placed according to the Circe rule for the new piece.
* Circe Parrain: A captured piece is reborn on the square displaced from the capture square by a vector equal to that of the move following the capture. If the following move is castling, then the sum of the king-move and rook-move vectors is used (for a castle, rebirth can occur only if the piece is a pawn captured &quot;en passant&quot;).
* Circe Rex inclusive: As Circe, but also the kings may be captured. A mate requires that the initial square of the king is occupied.
* Clone Circe: A captured piece is reborn on its initial square but reappears as the piece by which it is captured (not a king).
* CouCou Circe: As Circe, but the rebirth square is that of the capturing piece. Pawns captured by a piece are reborn on the promotion rank, and promote. The promotion is chosen by the capturing side.
* CousCous Circe: As CouCou Circe, but for captures resulting in promotion, the promotion type is chosen by the side whose pawn promotes.
* Diagram Circe: A captured piece is reborn on the position it had on the diagram.
* Equipollents Circe: As Circe Parrain, but the rebirth occurs immediately on a vector equal to the capturing move.
* Kamikaze Circe: The captured piece is reborn on its initial square. The capturing piece disappears.
* Martian Circe: Pieces move in the ordinary manner but capture only from their initial position (if it is unoccupied). Captured pieces disappear from the board.
* Mirror Circe: A captured piece is reborn on a square where a piece of the opposite colour would be reborn in ordinary Circe.
* Platzwechsel Circe (PWC): A captured piece is reborn on the square where the capturer was placed before the capture. &quot;Platzwechsel&quot; means &quot;position exchange&quot; in German.
* Strict Circe: As ordinary Circe, but the rebirth square must be free for the capture to be legal.
* Symmetrical Circe: As Circe, but the rebirth square is the capture square mirrored across the center of the board.
* Volcanic Circe: As Circe, but if the rebirth square is occupied, the captured piece is &#x27;hidden&#x27; under that piece. When that piece moves, the hidden piece is revealed. E.g. white king on f1, white bishop on a6, black king on b6: Black captures Kb6xa6(+wBf1(hidden)) Kf1-e1 (+wBf1).

<text>Vincent Moore (born April 14, 1964) is an American guitarist and a former member of the British hard rock band UFO.

== Biography ==
Moore was born in New Castle, Delaware. He began his professional career at age 12 after receiving a guitar as a Christmas present. During a 2018 interview, Moore stated, &quot;I got my first guitar for Christmas when I was like 12, basically just because I saw a picture of a guitar in a catalog, a JCPenney&#x27;s catalog. I thought, &#x27;Hey that looks pretty cool. I want that.&#x27; That was my motivation at the time, and I got it for Christmas, and really didn&#x27;t bother with it a whole lot. Then, I started taking lessons for the next year. Then I really started to get obsessed with it.&quot; During that same interview, Moore was asked who his earliest teachers were, and he stated, &quot;The first teacher was Mary Biddle, and I studied for a year with her, just some basic lessons at the local music shop. After about a year, I had advanced, and she referred me to another guy named Nick Bucci, who was a great player in my local area. He was studying jazz guitar with Pat Martino, and was also a rock guy, and he just taught me a lot of stuff; theory, and exercises, and all different kinds of stuff to make me become a better player and musician.&quot; Moore played clubs and bars until Shrapnel executive Mike Varney discovered him via a demo and biography that Moore submitted to the Spotlight column, which Varney headed for &quot;Guitar Player&quot;. His connection to Varney led to an opportunity to appear in a Pepsi commercial in 1985 (only Vinnie&#x27;s hands appeared in the commercial as his guitar playing is heard). Following this, Moore recorded his first solo album, &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1986), released on Shrapnel Records and featuring Tony MacAlpine on keyboards. The album received several awards from guitar magazines and sold over 100,000 copies.

Moore played lead guitar with the heavy metal band Vicious Rumors on their debut album, &quot;Soldiers of the Night&quot; (1985). The album featured Moore&#x27;s solo-song &quot;Invader&quot;, which was in the style of Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Eruption&quot;. The shred guitar craze of the late 1980s led to more releases for Shrapnel. Moore also began performing with other hard rock and heavy metal bands.

Moore joined Alice Cooper&#x27;s band for a tour and then appeared on the &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; (1991) album. Moore released two instructional videos on guitar playing, in 1987 and 1989.

Moore had been the lead guitarist of UFO for 21 years, joining in June 2003 and remaining until their breakup in April 2024. He performed on six studio albums with the band: &quot;You Are Here&quot; (2004), &quot;The Monkey Puzzle&quot; (2006), &quot;The Visitor&quot; (2009), &quot;Seven Deadly&quot; (2012), &quot;A Conspiracy of Stars&quot; (2015) and the covers album &quot;The Salentino Cuts&quot; (2017).

On August 5, 2013, Moore came on stage to perform live with Peter Frampton on Frampton&#x27;s Guitar Circus concert at Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Moore played guitar on Red Zone Rider&#x27;s debut album &quot;Red Zone Rider&quot; released on September 16, 2014.

== Equipment ==
Vinnie Moore currently endorses Kramer guitars.
Moore was previously sponsored by Dean guitars, who produced several Vinnie Moore signature models for their instrument lineup. Prior to his endorsement of Dean, he played various other brands of guitars over the years, including Ibanez and Fender, most notably the Talon model that was manufactured by Heartfield, one of Fender&#x27;s subsidiary brands. Moore also currently uses ENGL amplifiers and DiMarzio pickups.

<doc id="156403" wikidata="Q2624046" url="?curid=156403" title="Mountain chain">
<text>A mountain chain is a row of high mountain summits, a linear sequence of interconnected or related mountains, or a contiguous ridge of mountains within a larger mountain range. The term is also used for elongated fold mountains with several parallel chains (&quot;chain mountains&quot;).

While in mountain ranges, the term mountain chain is common, in hill ranges a sequence of hills tends to be referred to a ridge or hill chain.

Elongated mountain chains occur most frequently in the orogeny of fold mountains, (that are folded by lateral pressure), and nappe belts (where a sheetlike body of rock has been pushed over another rock mass). Other types of range such as horst ranges, fault block mountain or truncated uplands rarely form parallel mountain chains. However, if a truncated upland is eroded into a high table land, the incision of valleys can lead to the formations of mountain or hill chains.

== Formation of parallel mountain chains ==

The chain-like arrangement of summits and the formation of long, jagged mountain crests – known in Spanish as (&quot;saws&quot;) – is a consequence of their collective formation by mountain building forces. The often linear structure is linked to the direction of these thrust forces and the resulting mountain folding which in turn relates to the fault lines in the upper part of the Earth&#x27;s crust, that run between the individual mountain chains. In these fault zones, the rock, which has sometimes been pulverised, is easily eroded, so that large river valleys are carved out. These, so called longitudinal valleys reinforce the trend, during the early mountain building phase, towards the formation of parallel chains of mountains.

The tendency, especially of fold mountains (e. g. the Cordilleras) to produce roughly parallel chains is due to their rock structure and the propulsive forces of plate tectonics. The uplifted rock masses are either magmatic plutonic rocks, easily shaped because of their higher temperature, or sediments or metamorphic rocks, which have a less robust structure, that are deposited in the synclines. As a result of orogenic movements, strata of folded rock are formed that are crumpled out of their original horizontal plane and thrust against one another. The longitudinal stretching of the folds takes place at right angles to the direction of the lateral thrusting. The overthrust folds of a nappe belt (e.g. the Central Alps) are formed in a similar way.

Although the fold mountains, chain mountains and nappe belts around the world were formed at different times in the Earth&#x27;s history, all during their initial mountain building phases, they are nevertheless morphologically similar. Harder rock forms continuous arêtes or ridges that follow the strike of the beds and folds. The mountain chains or ridges therefore run approximately parallel to one another. They are only interrupted by short, usually narrow, transverse valleys, which often form water gaps. During the course of Earth history, erosion by water, ice and wind carried away the highest points of the mountain crests and carved out individual summits or summit chains. Between them, notches were formed that, depending on altitude and rock-type, form knife-edged cols or gentler mountain passes and saddles.

== Dominant rocks and mountain forms ==

Nappe or fold mountains, with their roughly parallel mountain chains, generally have a common geological age, but may consist of various types of rock. For example, in the Central Alps, granitic rocks, gneisses and metamorphic slate are found, while to the north and south, are the Limestone Alps. The Northern Limestone Alps are, in turn, followed by soft flysch mountains and the molasse zone. 

The type of rock influences the appearance of the mountain ranges very markedly, because erosion leads to very different topography depending on the hardness of the rock and its petrological structure. In addition to height and climate, other factors are the layering of the rock, its gradient and aspect, the types of waterbody and the lines of dislocation. For hard rock massifs, rugged rock faces (e.g. in the Dolomites) and mighty scree slopes are typical. By contrast, flysch or slate forms gentler mountain shapes and &quot;kuppen&quot; or domed mountaintops, because the rock is not porous, but easily shaped.

<text>Icelandair is the flag carrier of Iceland, with its corporate head office on the property of Reykjavík Airport in the capital city Reykjavík. It is part of the Icelandair Group and operates to destinations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean from its main hub at Keflavík International Airport. The geographical position of Iceland is convenient for one-stop transatlantic flights via the Atlantic Bridge route, which is one pillar of the airline&#x27;s business strategy, along with traffic to, from, and within the country.

== History ==
=== Flugfélag Íslands in the early decades ===
Icelandair traces its roots back to 1937, when Flugfélag Akureyrar was founded in Akureyri on the north coast of Iceland. Flight operations started in 1938 with a single Waco YKS-7 configured as a floatplane. In 1939 the airline was grounded when this aircraft was destroyed in a capsizing accident. In March 1940, Flugfélag Akureyrar moved its hub to Reykjavík and moved its operations to fixed-wing seaplane scheduled flights from the Vatnsmýri area, and changed its name to Flugfélag Íslands, where it acquired another Waco aircraft and was relaunched in 1940 as Flugfélag Íslands, which translates as &quot;Flight Company of Iceland&quot;. Seaplane flights were operated in the vicinity of Vatnsmýri in Skerjafjörður and Vatnagarðar. Previously, the two unrelated airlines of the same name (Flugfélag Íslands) had existed in the country (from 1919 to 1920, and between 1928 and 1931). For international purposes, the name Iceland Airways was adopted.

In 1940, Iceland was invaded by the British and Reykjavík Airport was established south of the capital during the war. In in 1946 the airport was handed over to Icelandic civilian authorities, now called Isavia. Iceland Airways (Icelandair) inherited a small building constructed by the British Army on the west side of the airport. Since 1947, the building has been gradually expanded but is still in use by Icelandair as a domestic terminal in 2024. By the 1950s, Iceland Airways operated flights to Britain and Northern Europe from the airport, as well as domestic flights.

The airline was based from Reykjavík Airport, close to the city centre, and the fleet was expanded with a Beechcraft Model 18 in 1942; and with two De Havilland Dragon Rapides and a Consolidated PBY Catalina in 1944, the latter being the first ever aircraft registered in Iceland to be flown to Iceland by an Icelandic crew from North America. On 11 July 1945, this aircraft operated the first commercial flight over the Atlantic Ocean for the airline, which led from Reykjavík to Largs in Scotland, with four passengers and four crew members on board. Regular flights to Prestwick Airport in Scotland and Copenhagen in Denmark, using Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft leased from Scottish Airlines were launched in 1946.

In the same year, the comfort and performance of domestic flights in Iceland was improved with the introduction of the Douglas DC-3. A total of six were purchased, which remained in service with the airline until 1972. Until the late 1960s, Flugfélag concentrated mostly on domestic service, but it also continued operating internationally; in 1948, the Douglas DC-4 was introduced on international routes, and in 1957 two new Vickers 759 Viscounts were acquired, the first turboprop airliners to be operated by an Icelandic airline. In the 1950s, Flugfélag began to use &quot;Icelandair&quot; branding for flights beyond Iceland.

In 1967, Flugfélag was the first Icelandic airline to join the jet age, when a Boeing 727-100 dubbed &quot;Gullfaxi&quot; was put into service. The B-727 jet aircraft was operated from Keflavík Airport, as the aircraft was considered too large for the smaller Reykjavík Airport. Most of Flugfélag&#x27;s international operations transferred to Keflavík by this time. This left only shorter-distance flights to Greenland and the Faroes as the only international services from Reykjavík Airport. Another 727 was acquired in 1971, and the aircraft type was operated until 1990. In 2008, the cockpit section of &quot;Gullfaxi&quot; was put on display at the Akureyri Aviation Museum.

=== Loftleiðir ===

Another company, Loftleiðir, called Icelandic Airlines internationally, was formed in 1944 by three young pilots returning from their flight training in Canada. The company, whose name roughly means &quot;Skyways&quot;, initially concentrated on Icelandic domestic routes using two Stinson Reliants and then a Grumman G-21 Goose amphibious aircraft.

Loftleiðir began scheduled international operations in 1947 from a small shed on the east apron of Reykjavík Airport. Loftleiðir soon began challenging Flugfélag&#x27;s dominance within Iceland; by 1952, the Icelandic authorities became concerned that the fierce domestic rivalry would cripple both companies, and attempted to force them to merge. Unable to consummate a merger, the authorities instead divided domestic routes between the two airlines, prompting Loftleiðir to exit the domestic market and concentrate instead on international flights. Its pioneering low-fare service across the North Atlantic commenced in 1953. Loftleiðir is considered a precursor to the low-cost carriers, that emerged worldwide in the 1970s, as it was not part of or subject to IATA fares or rules. Loftleiðir, anticipating increased demand, began construction of a large passenger terminal at Reykjavík Airport.

The late 1960s were an exciting time for Loftleiðir. In 1964, the airline acquired Canadair CL-44 aircraft, which were the largest transatlantic aircraft operating at the time. As a result of the large size of the new aircraft, Loftleiðir moved its entire operation to Keflavík Airport in the same year, abandoning Reykjavík Airport completely. The planned passenger terminal at Reykjavik Airport later became a hotel and headquarters for Loftleiðir, and as of 2024, continues to be the headquarters of Icelandair and a hotel.

In 1969 the company acquired International Air Bahama, a small Bahamian airline that operated transatlantic nonstop service between Nassau and Luxembourg using Douglas DC-8 jetliners, and a year later, Loftleiðir became one of the founders of Cargolux, a cargo airline. Also in 1970, Loftleiðir entered the jet age with its first two DC-8 aircraft.

During those years, many people including the company&#x27;s own staff called Loftleiðir &quot;the Hippie Airline&quot; or &quot;the Hippie Express&quot;. The airline was not known for speed or punctuality, but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for young &quot;hippies&quot; from America travelling to Europe, one of whom was future U.S. president Bill Clinton.

=== Merger with Loftleiðir ===
During the 1970s energy crisis, the economic situation for both Flugfélag Íslands and Loftleiðir worsened. The government of Iceland initiated a new attempt to merge the two airlines, which could be realized in 1973 following lengthy and difficult negotiations. In 1975, the Icelandic government provided a $13.5 million loan to Flugleiðir. The staff of Loftleiðir complained that Flugfélag Íslands, although smaller, had gained the upper hand in the united company. A holding company called &quot;Flugleiðir&quot; was created, which combined the two companies and began to streamline staff and operations. At the time of the merger, two-thirds of the passenger traffic of the airline were international transatlantic crossings, and Flugfélag Íslands&#x27;s fleet of Douglas DC-3s and Boeing 727s were enlarged by the Douglas DC-8s of Loftleiðir. In 1979, the two airlines Flugfélag Íslands and Loftleiðir merged into one airline Flugleiðir, and the airline was renamed Icelandair.

=== Post-merger Icelandair ===

In 1980, the Icelandic government provided a loan to Icelandair due to the company&#x27;s bad financial situation.

The aircraft fleet of Icelandair remained mainly unchanged until the Boeing 757-200 became the new backbone for transatlantic flights during the 1990s. The domestic Fokker F27s were replaced by Fokker 50s and Boeing 737s deployed on European routes. The European hub at Luxembourg Airport had been taken over from Loftleiðir. Passenger count topped one million in 1997 as the company&#x27;s business grew on a reputation as a &quot;backpacker airline&quot;, similar to Loftleiðir, which had been referred to as &quot;Hippie Airline&quot; since the late 1960s. In the same year, it was begun to dismantle the Luxembourg hub in favour of today&#x27;s decentralized European network, linking the largest cities non-stop to Reykjavík, closing it down altogether by 1999.

In 1997 the domestic operations of Icelandair, part of which had previously been operated under the &#x27;Flugfélag Nordurlands&#x27; branding, were combined with a small airline Nordurflug to form the Air Iceland (Icelandic: &quot;Flugfélag Íslands&quot;) subsidiary, allowing mainline Icelandair to fully concentrate on international flights since then. On 20 November 1999, a new aircraft livery was introduced, as part of an image campaign designed to retire Icelandair&#x27;s &quot;backpacker&quot; label in favour of an emphasis on business travel. In 2001, the Icelandair hub was moved to Keflavík International Airport. As Icelandair particularly focuses on flights to North America, the company was significantly affected by the airspace closure following the September 11 attacks in the same year.

The Flugleiðir holding was reorganized as Icelandair Group (for aviation business) and FL Group (for non-aviation finance and investment business) between 2002 and 2005, with Icelandair becoming the largest and most important of eleven subsidiaries. The wet-lease and charter department, which was founded in 2003, was named &quot;Loftleiðir Icelandic&quot;, thus re-introducing a familiar name.

=== Developments since 2010 ===
Icelandair was hit by the 2008 financial crisis in the country and was further impacted by a volcanic eruption in 2010. Air traffic restrictions following the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull resulted in large parts of the European airspace being closed down. The air travel disruption coincided with the start of the important summer season for the company. The in-house crisis management organisation began assessing the situation once the scale of the problem had become known. Thrice-daily crisis meetings were held at the airline&#x27;s headquarters. Icelandair tried to operate as many passenger flights as possible, keeping its hub at Keflavík open and diverting European flights to airports that were still open. The eventual closure of Keflavík due to the volcanic ash cloud coincided with an improvement of the situation towards Europe, which allowed Icelandair to move its headquarters with 200 staff to Glasgow and operate flights from there for ten days, with shuttle flights to Iceland&#x27;s Akureyri Airport and round-the-clock bus shuttles onwards to Reykjavík.

In the aftermath of the eruption, the government of Iceland launched the successful &quot;Inspired by Iceland&quot; campaign to regain confidence in travelling to Iceland for tourists and business people, of which Icelandair was a leading participant and initiator.

When the Grímsvötn volcano erupted in 2011, Icelandair once again had to cope with airspace closures in Europe. However, this time to a lesser extent due to a higher level of political preparedness. Weekly newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; claimed that Icelandair could even take advantage when catering for disaster tourists.

In February 2011 Icelandair was chosen &quot;The Knowledge Company&quot; of the year and Icelandair CEO Birkir Hólm Guðnason was picked as &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in the Icelandic business community. In both categories the panel of judges of the Association of Economists and Business Graduates in Iceland said that &quot;the fine results of the company in the previous year showed both a high degree of skill and specialist knowledge within the company as well as excellent leadership.&quot; In October of the same year, the airline was awarded the title &quot;Marketing Firm of the Year in Iceland&quot;, by a judging panel from IMARK, the Marketing Association in Iceland.

==== Further route expansion ====
After having launched scheduled flights to Washington, D.C., in 2011, Denver was announced as a new U.S. destination for 2012, followed by Anchorage in 2013, bringing the total number of cities served in the country up to eight, along with Boston, Minneapolis, New York City, Orlando and Seattle. Also in 2012, Icelandair resumed domestic services, with regular flights linking Akureyri to its Keflavík hub through subsidiary company Air Iceland.

From 2009 to 2014, operations doubled. New destinations in 2014 were Edmonton and Vancouver in Canada; and Geneva. Twice-weekly flights to Vancouver commenced on 13 May 2014 and continued until October of that year. Flights to Edmonton started on 4 March 2014, with a year-round service operating five times a week. The Geneva service started on 24 May 2014 and continued twice weekly until September.

On 9 December 2014, Icelandair revealed a northern lights-themed Boeing 757-200 (registration TF-FIU) named &quot;Hekla Aurora&quot;. The aircraft was officially launched in February 2015 as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;#MyStopover campaign&quot;. The exterior, which was hand-painted by a team of highly skilled airbrush artists from the UK, features artwork depicting an Icelandic winter scene complete with the Aurora Borealis. An installation of LED mood lighting in the cabin continues the theme by emulating both the colours and dancing patterns of the aurora. As part of Icelandair&#x27;s transatlantic fleet, the &quot;Hekla Aurora&quot; began operating to all of Icelandair&#x27;s destinations at the time, and has a three-day advance schedule available for passengers and observers.

On 5 February 2015, Birmingham became Icelandair&#x27;s 5th gateway in the UK, and the 39th overall, with flights operating twice weekly, on Thursdays and Mondays. On 19 May 2015, Icelandair launched scheduled flights to and from Portland, Oregon in the US: its 14th destination in North America. Flights were set to operate twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 20 October. Further expansion of Icelandair&#x27;s global network was announced on 12 May 2015 with new, year-round services from Chicago O’Hare International Airport. Services commenced on 16 March 2016, with flights to Iceland operating four days a week. On 17 August 2015 Icelandair announced the augmentation of its global flight network with a new service between Keflavik and Aberdeen, the company&#x27;s second Scottish destination. The new service, operated by Air Iceland Connect (a subsidiary of Icelandair Group), commenced in March of the following year, with flights scheduled four times per week.

Icelandair commenced scheduled flights to Paris Orly Airport beginning on 29 March 2016. Services to Montréal–Trudeau Airport began on 26 May 2016. In September 2016, Icelandair announced services to Philadelphia, US, starting in May 2017 and Tampa, US starting in Sep 2017.

In May 2017, Icelandair unveiled a glacier-themed special livery on Boeing 757-200 (registration TF-FIR) named Vatnajökull, the name of Europe&#x27;s largest glacier. The special livery was created to commemorate Icelandair&#x27;s 80th anniversary. In August 2017, Icelandair announced service five days per week to Cleveland, US, which began on 16 May 2018. The route was cut in early 2019. In August 2017, the Cape Verdean government signed an agreement with Icelandic Airlines, part of the Icelandair Group, which turned the administration of TACV to the Icelandic group. The new administration plans include discontinuing the hub at Praia International Airport focusing all of the airline&#x27;s operations at Amílcar Cabral International Airport and from there serving as a connecting hub between the Americas, Europe and Africa. On 5 November 2017, the company Icelandair (the new TACV administrator) passed the first Boeing 757-200 to TACV to reinforce existing routes, such as daily flights to Lisbon, Fortaleza and Recife (which increases to 4 weekly flights as of 3 December).

Since the 1960s, Icelandair has offered passengers travelling on transatlantic flights between North America and Europe an opportunity to stopover in Iceland for up to seven days, at no additional cost. To raise awareness about its stopover offer, the company launched a new social media initiative in 2014, with the hashtag &quot;#MyStopover&quot;.

On 9 January 2018, Icelandair announced that it would provide three non-stop flights a week from Kansas City International Airport to Keflavík International Airport, which commenced on 25 May 2018. Icelandair commenced four weekly flights to and from Dallas Ft. Worth on 30 May 2018. It ended on 6 March 2019. On 5 November 2018, Icelandair announced plans to take over its low-cost competitor, WOW Air, with the two airlines to be operated as separate brands. On 29 November, Icelandair abandoned this endeavour as the shareholders’ meeting pre-conditions were unlikely to be met.

On 18 September 2020, the company&#x27;s share capital was increased with the issue of 23,000,000,000 new shares with a nominal value of 1 Icelandic króna following a public share offering. In addition, the Icelandic government decided to guarantee a line of credit for Icelandair. The guarantee amounts to $120 million.

In March 2020, Air Iceland Connect, a wholly owned subsidy of Icelandair, was absorbed into Icelandair, albeit retaining its separate air operator&#x27;s certificate. Since then, all domestic flights have been operated under Icelandair&#x27;s brand.

On 9 March 2021, Icelandair Group announced that Air Iceland Connect is to merge with Icelandair by uniting domestic and international services from 16 March 2021 and continuing the current flight operations under the Icelandair brand.

Icelandair announced the launch of a new flight path from Reykjavik to Istanbul. The new flight option will operate four times per week beginning September 5, 2025. In January 2025, Icelandair was reported to be launching a non-stop flight between Reykjavik and Miami with three weekly flights starting in January 2026. The route will be serviced by its Airbus A321LR aircraft.

All of Icelandair&#x27;s aircraft are equipped with a free-of-charge VOD in-flight entertainment system that includes seatback, and touch-screen monitors for each passenger. On 1 April 2013 Icelandic band Sigur Rós debuted its latest album, &quot;Valtari&quot;, exclusively onboard Icelandair&#x27;s aircraft, two months before the album&#x27;s general release. &quot;Biophilia&quot;, Björk&#x27;s 2011 album, had earlier been released on Icelandair&#x27;s fleet in the same way. All of Icelandair&#x27;s fleet is equipped with in-flight Wi-Fi.

===Current fleet===
, Icelandair operates the following aircraft, and most of the aircraft in Icelandair&#x27;s fleet are named after Icelandic volcanoes.

===Fleet development===
In 2005, the airline, on behalf of its parent company Icelandair Group, announced an order for ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft with options for five more. Those options were later exercised. These were not placed into service by the airline but leased to other airlines. During that same year, Icelandair announced an order for two Boeing 787 Dreamliners. In 2006, Icelandair announced an order for two more Boeing 787s. In 2011, it was announced that orders for three of the 787s had been cancelled.

On 13 February 2013, Icelandair Group announced that the company had finalized an order with Boeing for 16 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Purchase rights for eight additional 737s were also signed. The value for all 16 aircraft was US$1.6 billion at Boeing list prices, but the actual purchase price was confidential. The aircraft were scheduled to be delivered in 2018–2021. The order was for nine 737 MAX 8s configured for 153 passengers, and seven 737 MAX 9s to hold 172 passengers. Icelandair Group&#x27;s current Boeing 757-200 aircraft hold 183 passengers.

On 8 May 2019, Icelandair announced that the company was considering ordering the Airbus A321neo and Airbus A321LR as a replacement for their ageing fleet of Boeing 757s, or to run alongside their Boeing 737 MAX 8 or to even replace the MAX 8s entirely, due to the Boeing 737 MAX groundings.

On 22 January 2020 Icelandair announced that the airline would lease three Boeing 737-800 airliners to enter service in spring 2020. The aircraft were to be dry leased and flown by Icelandair pilots. However this never took place.

On 12 August 2020, Icelandair reached a settlement with Boeing over the MAX groundings. The settlement included reducing the carrier&#x27;s order for future MAX aircraft by four.

On 7 April 2023, Icelandair announced that the airline had signed an MOU for an order of up to 25 A321XLRs: 13 firm orders with 12 further options. At the same time, it was also announced that negotiations were underway to lease four A321LRs. These will replace its ageing Boeing 757 fleet. This will be the first-ever Airbus order for the Icelandic flag carrier. The first Airbus A321LR was delivered on 2 December 2024.

In December 2024, Icelandair&#x27;s two Boeing 757-300 aircraft were wet-leased to Fly Khiva of Uzbekistan.

===Special liveries===
As of November 2024, Icelandair operates two aircraft with special liveries. These depict the natural beauty of Iceland. One showcases the largest glacier in Europe, Vatnajökull, as well as celebrates the independence of Iceland for 100 years. The other highlights the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights), also part of Icelandair&#x27;s #IcelandStopover campaign.

A third aircraft (Boeing B757-300 TF-ISX &quot;Þingvellir&quot;) was painted in the red, white, and blue livery of Iceland&#x27;s flag and celebrated both the 100th anniversary of Icelandic National Sovereignty (1918–2018) and the National Men&#x27;s Football Team&#x27;s World Cup debut in 2018. This aircraft was retired from the Icelandair fleet in October 2024.


===Historical fleet===
Over the years, Icelandair operated the following aircraft types:

==Icelandair Cargo==
===Overview===

Icelandair Cargo is a sister airline to Icelandair; it is Icelandair Group&#x27;s cargo airline subsidiary. Flugfélag Íslands and Loftleiðir used their aircraft to carry freight as well as passengers, and when Icelandair was established in 1973 a freight division was set up within the airline. After years of operating freighter aircraft as part of Icelandair, Icelandair Cargo was established as a separate entity in 2000. The airline uses available space in the baggage compartments of Icelandair&#x27;s passenger aircraft, as well as operating two Boeing 757 freighters to destinations in Europe and North America from its base at Keflavík International Airport.

In 2021, Icelandair Cargo announced Boeing 767-300ER passenger aircraft would be converted to freighters. The first converted 767-300BCF was delivered to Icelandair on 8 December 2022 with plans to use the increased capacity to establish new routes to the United States.

===Fleet===
, the Icelandair Cargo fleet consists of the following aircraft:

== Sponsorships ==

Icelandair and the City of Reykjavík are two of the main sponsors of the Iceland Airwaves, an annual music festival held in Reykjavík on the first weekend in November.

== Accidents and incidents ==

;29 May 1947: A Flugfélag Islands Douglas DC-3 (registered as TF-ISI) crashed near Héðinsfjörður during a scheduled domestic flight from Reykjavík to Akureyri, killing the 21 passengers and four crew members on board. To date, this remains the worst aviation accident in Iceland.
;7 March 1948: An Avro Anson Mk5 belonging to Loftleiðir crashed on the mountain Skálafell en route from the Westmann Islands (Vestmannaeyjar) to Reykjavík, killing the pilot and the five passengers on board.
;31 January 1951: The 17 passengers and three crew members on board a DC-3, registered TF-ISG and named Glitfaxi, were killed when the aircraft crashed in the sea off the Icelandic coast near Hafnarfjörður in what became known as the Glitfaxi air crash. The pilots were attempting to land the aircraft at Reykjavík Airport in heavy snowfalls following a flight from Vestmannaeyjar when radar contact was lost.
;14 April 1963: A Vickers Viscount (registered TF-ISU) crashed on approach to Oslo-Fornebu Airport. All 12 people on board were killed.
;26 September 1970: A Flugfélag Fokker F27 Friendship (registered TF-FIL) crashed into a mountain near Vágar, Faroe Islands while approaching Vágar Airport following a scheduled passenger flight from Bergen, in what is known as controlled flight into terrain. Of the 34 people on board, seven passengers and one crew member were killed.
;15 November 1978: Loftleiðir Flight 001, a Douglas DC-8 (registered TF-FLA), operating for Garuda Indonesia, missed the runway upon approach of Colombo Airport in Sri Lanka during a chartered Hajj pilgrimage flight from Jeddah and crashed. 181 passengers died in the accident, while 74 passengers and 5 crew members survived.

; 22 January 2002
: The crew of Icelandair Flight 315, a Boeing 757-200 registered TF-FIO with 75 passengers on board, unintentionally entered a series of extreme manoeuvres during a go-around from a low altitude following an unstabilised approach into Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. During the incident the aircraft was subjected to load factors over the design limits, culminating in a dive followed by a +3.59 g pull-up manoeuvre clearing the ground by only 321 ft. The speed limit for the flap configuration was also exceeded. Control was regained and a second approach was flown with the aircraft landing safely. The airliner was permitted to proceed on its subsequent scheduled flights without a technical inspection being conducted until 13 March of that year when its manufacturer Boeing recommended further maintenance work after having evaluated the readings from the flight data recorder. The Accident Investigation Board Norway, which led the investigation into the incident, made four safety recommendations, including one to the wider aviation community on operational procedures regarding discontinued approaches.
;7 February 2020: Icelandair Flight 529, a Boeing 757-200 registered TF-FIA, suffered a right-hand main landing gear collapse after landing on runway 10 at Keflavík International Airport, Iceland. There were no injuries among the 166 people on board.

<doc id="156411" wikidata="Q1491747" url="?curid=156411" title="Galois connection">
<text>In mathematics, especially in order theory, a Galois connection is a particular correspondence (typically) between two partially ordered sets (posets). Galois connections find applications in various mathematical theories. They generalize the fundamental theorem of Galois theory about the correspondence between subgroups and subfields, discovered by the French mathematician Évariste Galois.

A Galois connection can also be defined on preordered sets or classes; this article presents the common case of posets.
The literature contains two closely related notions of &quot;Galois connection&quot;. In this article, we will refer to them as (monotone) Galois connections and antitone Galois connections.

A Galois connection is rather weak compared to an order isomorphism between the involved posets, but every Galois connection gives rise to an isomorphism of certain sub-posets, as will be explained below.
The term Galois correspondence is sometimes used to mean a bijective &quot;Galois connection&quot;; this is simply an order isomorphism (or dual order isomorphism, depending on whether we take monotone or antitone Galois connections).

== Definitions ==

=== (Monotone) Galois connection ===
Let and be two partially ordered sets. A &quot;monotone Galois connection&quot; between these posets consists of two monotone functions, and , such that for all in and in , we have

: if and only if .

In this situation, is called the lower adjoint of and is called the upper adjoint of &quot;F&quot;. Mnemonically, the upper/lower terminology refers to where the function application appears relative to ≤. The term &quot;adjoint&quot; refers to the fact that monotone Galois connections are special cases of pairs of adjoint functors in category theory as discussed further below. Other terminology encountered here is left adjoint (respectively right adjoint) for the lower (respectively upper) adjoint.

An essential property of a Galois connection is that an upper/lower adjoint of a Galois connection &quot;uniquely&quot; determines the other:

: is the least element with , and 
: is the largest element with .

A consequence of this is that if or is bijective then each is the inverse of the other, i.e. .

Given a Galois connection with lower adjoint and upper adjoint , we can consider the compositions , known as the associated closure operator, and , known as the associated kernel operator. Both are monotone and idempotent, and we have for all in and for all in .

A Galois insertion of into is a Galois connection in which the kernel operator is the identity on , and hence is an order isomorphism of onto the set of closed elements &amp;hairsp;[] of .

=== Antitone Galois connection ===
The above definition is common in many applications today, and prominent in lattice and domain theory. However the original notion in Galois theory is slightly different. In this alternative definition, a Galois connection is a pair of &quot;antitone&quot;, i.e. order-reversing, functions and between two posets and , such that

: if and only if .

The symmetry of and in this version erases the distinction between upper and lower, and the two functions are then called polarities rather than adjoints. Each polarity uniquely determines the other, since

: is the largest element with , and 
: is the largest element with .

The compositions and are the associated closure operators; they are monotone idempotent maps with the property for all in and for all in .

The implications of the two definitions of Galois connections are very similar, since an antitone Galois connection between and is just a monotone Galois connection between and the order dual of . All of the below statements on Galois connections can thus easily be converted into statements about antitone Galois connections.

== Examples ==

===Bijections===
The bijection of a pair of functions formula_1 and formula_2 each other&#x27;s inverse, forms a (trivial) Galois connection, as follows. Because the equality relation is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric, it is, trivially, a partial order, making formula_3 and formula_4 partially ordered sets. Since formula_5 if and only if formula_6 we have a Galois connection.

===Monotone Galois connections===

====Floor; ceiling====
A monotone Galois connection between formula_7 the set of integers and formula_8 the set of real numbers, each with its usual ordering, is given by the usual embedding function of the integers into the reals and the floor function truncating a real number to the greatest integer less than or equal to it. The embedding of integers is customarily done implicitly, but to show the Galois connection we make it explicit. So let formula_9 denote the embedding function, with formula_10 while formula_11 denotes the floor function, so formula_12 The equivalence formula_13 then translates to
:formula_14
This is valid because the variable formula_15 is restricted to the integers. The well-known properties of the floor function, such as formula_16 can be derived by elementary reasoning from this Galois connection.

The dual orderings give another monotone Galois connection, now with the ceiling function:
:formula_17

====Power set; implication and conjunction====
For an order-theoretic example, let be some set, and let and both be the power set of , ordered by inclusion. Pick a fixed subset of . Then the maps and , where , and , form a monotone Galois connection, with being the lower adjoint. A similar Galois connection whose lower adjoint is given by the meet (infimum) operation can be found in any Heyting algebra. Especially, it is present in any Boolean algebra, where the two mappings can be described by and . In logical terms: &quot;implication from &quot; is the upper adjoint of &quot;conjunction with &quot;.

====Lattices====
Further interesting examples for Galois connections are described in the article on completeness properties. Roughly speaking, it turns out that the usual functions ∨ and ∧ are lower and upper adjoints to the diagonal map . The least and greatest elements of a partial order are given by lower and upper adjoints to the unique function Going further, even complete lattices can be characterized by the existence of suitable adjoints. These considerations give some impression of the ubiquity of Galois connections in order theory.

====Transitive group actions====
Let act transitively on and pick some point in . Consider

:formula_18

the set of blocks containing . Further, let formula_19 consist of the subgroups of containing the stabilizer of .

Then, the correspondence formula_20:
:formula_21
is a monotone, one-to-one Galois connection. As a corollary, one can establish that doubly transitive actions have no blocks other than the trivial ones (singletons or the whole of ): this follows from the stabilizers being maximal in in that case. See Doubly transitive group for further discussion.

====Image and inverse image====
If is a function, then for any subset of we can form the image and for any subset of we can form the inverse image Then and form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of and the power set of , both ordered by inclusion ⊆. There is a further adjoint pair in this situation: for a subset of , define Then and form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of and the power set of . In the first Galois connection, is the upper adjoint, while in the second Galois connection it serves as the lower adjoint.

In the case of a quotient map between algebraic objects (such as groups), this connection is called the lattice theorem: subgroups of connect to subgroups of , and the closure operator on subgroups of is given by .

====Span and closure====
Pick some mathematical object that has an underlying set, for instance a group, ring, vector space, etc. For any subset of , let be the smallest subobject of that contains , i.e. the subgroup, subring or subspace generated by . For any subobject of , let be the underlying set of . (We can even take to be a topological space, let the closure of , and take as &quot;subobjects of the closed subsets of .) Now and form a monotone Galois connection between subsets of and subobjects of , if both are ordered by inclusion. is the lower adjoint.

====Syntax and semantics====
A very general comment of William Lawvere is that &quot;syntax and semantics&quot; are adjoint: take to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations) reverse ordered by strength, and the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory , let be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms &amp;hairsp;; for a set of mathematical structures , let be the minimum of the axiomatizations that approximate (in first-order logic, this is the set of sentences that are true in all structures in ). We can then say that is a subset of if and only if logically entails : the &quot;semantics functor&quot; and the &quot;syntax functor&quot; form a monotone Galois connection, with semantics being the upper adjoint.

===Antitone Galois connections===

====Galois theory====
The motivating example comes from Galois theory: suppose is a field extension. Let be the set of all subfields of that contain , ordered by inclusion ⊆. If is such a subfield, write for the group of field automorphisms of that hold fixed. Let be the set of subgroups of , ordered by inclusion ⊆. For such a subgroup , define to be the field consisting of all elements of that are held fixed by all elements of . Then the maps and form an antitone Galois connection.

====Algebraic topology: covering spaces====
Analogously, given a path-connected topological space , there is an antitone Galois connection between subgroups of the fundamental group and path-connected covering spaces of . In particular, if is semi-locally simply connected, then for every subgroup of , there is a covering space with as its fundamental group.

====Linear algebra: annihilators and orthogonal complements====
Given an inner product space , we can form the orthogonal complement of any subspace of . This yields an antitone Galois connection between the set of subspaces of and itself, ordered by inclusion; both polarities are equal to .

Given a vector space and a subset of we can define its annihilator , consisting of all elements of the dual space of that vanish on . Similarly, given a subset of , we define its annihilator This gives an antitone Galois connection between the subsets of and the subsets of .

====Algebraic geometry====
In algebraic geometry, the relation between sets of polynomials and their zero sets is an antitone Galois connection.

Fix a natural number and a field and let be the set of all subsets of the polynomial ring ordered by inclusion ⊆, and let be the set of all subsets of ordered by inclusion ⊆. If is a set of polynomials, define the variety of zeros as

:formula_22

the set of common zeros of the polynomials in . If is a subset of , define as the ideal of polynomials vanishing on , that is

:formula_23

Then and &quot;I&quot; form an antitone Galois connection.

The closure on is the closure in the Zariski topology, and if the field is algebraically closed, then the closure on the polynomial ring is the radical of ideal generated by .

More generally, given a commutative ring (not necessarily a polynomial ring), there is an antitone Galois connection between radical ideals in the ring and Zariski closed subsets of the affine variety .

More generally, there is an antitone Galois connection between ideals in the ring and subschemes of the corresponding affine variety.

====Connections on power sets arising from binary relations====
Suppose and are arbitrary sets and a binary relation over and is given. For any subset of , we define Similarly, for any subset of , define Then and yield an antitone Galois connection between the power sets of and , both ordered by inclusion ⊆.

Up to isomorphism &quot;all&quot; antitone Galois connections between power sets arise in this way. This follows from the &quot;Basic Theorem on Concept Lattices&quot;. Theory and applications of Galois connections arising from binary relations are studied in formal concept analysis. That field uses Galois connections for mathematical data analysis. Many algorithms for Galois connections can be found in the respective literature, e.g., in.

The general concept lattice in its primitive version incorporates both the monotone and antitone Galois connections to furnish its upper and lower bounds of nodes for the concept lattice, respectively.

== Properties ==
In the following, we consider a (monotone) Galois connection , where is the lower adjoint as introduced above. Some helpful and instructive basic properties can be obtained immediately. By the defining property of Galois connections, is equivalent to , for all in . By a similar reasoning (or just by applying the duality principle for order theory), one finds that , for all in . These properties can be described by saying the composite is &quot;deflationary&quot;, while is &quot;inflationary&quot; (or &quot;extensive&quot;).

Now consider such that . Then using the above one obtains . Applying the basic property of Galois connections, one can now conclude that . But this just shows that preserves the order of any two elements, i.e. it is monotone. Again, a similar reasoning yields monotonicity of . Thus monotonicity does not have to be included in the definition explicitly. However, mentioning monotonicity helps to avoid confusion about the two alternative notions of Galois connections.

Another basic property of Galois connections is the fact that , for all in . Clearly we find that

because is inflationary as shown above. On the other hand, since is deflationary, while is monotonic, one finds that

This shows the desired equality. Furthermore, we can use this property to conclude that

and

i.e., and are idempotent.

It can be shown (see Blyth or Erné for proofs) that a function is a lower (respectively upper) adjoint if and only if is a residuated mapping (respectively residual mapping). Therefore, the notion of residuated mapping and monotone Galois connection are essentially the same.

== Closure operators and Galois connections ==
The above findings can be summarized as follows: for a Galois connection, the composite is monotone (being the composite of monotone functions), inflationary, and idempotent. This states that is in fact a closure operator on . Dually, is monotone, deflationary, and idempotent. Such mappings are sometimes called kernel operators. In the context of frames and locales, the composite is called the nucleus induced by . Nuclei induce frame homomorphisms; a subset of a locale is called a sublocale if it is given by a nucleus.

Conversely, any closure operator on some poset gives rise to the Galois connection with lower adjoint being just the corestriction of to the image of (i.e. as a surjective mapping the closure system ). The upper adjoint is then given by the inclusion of into , that maps each closed element to itself, considered as an element of . In this way, closure operators and Galois connections are seen to be closely related, each specifying an instance of the other. Similar conclusions hold true for kernel operators.

The above considerations also show that closed elements of (elements with ) are mapped to elements within the range of the kernel operator , and vice versa.

== Existence and uniqueness of Galois connections ==
Another important property of Galois connections is that lower adjoints preserve all suprema that exist within their domain. Dually, upper adjoints preserve all existing infima. From these properties, one can also conclude monotonicity of the adjoints immediately. The adjoint functor theorem for order theory states that the converse implication is also valid in certain cases: especially, any mapping between complete lattices that preserves all suprema is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection.

In this situation, an important feature of Galois connections is that one adjoint uniquely determines the other. Hence one can strengthen the above statement to guarantee that any supremum-preserving map between complete lattices is the lower adjoint of a unique Galois connection. The main property to derive this uniqueness is the following: For every in , is the least element of such that . Dually, for every in , is the greatest in such that . The existence of a certain Galois connection now implies the existence of the respective least or greatest elements, no matter whether the corresponding posets satisfy any completeness properties. Thus, when one upper adjoint of a Galois connection is given, the other upper adjoint can be defined via this same property.

On the other hand, some monotone function is a lower adjoint if and only if each set of the form for in , contains a greatest element. Again, this can be dualized for the upper adjoint.

== Galois connections as morphisms ==
Galois connections also provide an interesting class of mappings between posets which can be used to obtain categories of posets. Especially, it is possible to compose Galois connections: given Galois connections between posets and and between and , the composite is also a Galois connection. When considering categories of complete lattices, this can be simplified to considering just mappings preserving all suprema (or, alternatively, infima). Mapping complete lattices to their duals, these categories display auto duality, that are quite fundamental for obtaining other duality theorems. More special kinds of morphisms that induce adjoint mappings in the other direction are the morphisms usually considered for frames (or locales).

== Connection to category theory ==
Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a category in a natural way: there is a unique morphism from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if and only if . A monotone Galois connection is then nothing but a pair of adjoint functors between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets. In this context, the upper adjoint is the &quot;right adjoint&quot; while the lower adjoint is the &quot;left adjoint&quot;. However, this terminology is avoided for Galois connections, since there was a time when posets were transformed into categories in a dual fashion, i.e. with morphisms pointing in the opposite direction. This led to a complementary notation concerning left and right adjoints, which today is ambiguous.

== Applications in the theory of programming ==
Galois connections may be used to describe many forms of abstraction in the theory of abstract interpretation of programming languages.

<text>Ellen Taaffe Zwilich ( ; born April 30, 1939) is an American composer, the first female composer to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Her early works are marked by atonal exploration, but by the late 1980s, she had shifted to a postmodernist, neoromantic style. She has been called &quot;one of America&#x27;s most frequently played and genuinely popular living composers.&quot; She was a 1994 inductee into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame. Zwilich has served as the Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor at Florida State University.

==Biography==
Ellen Taaffe was born in Miami, Florida. She began her music studies as a violinist, earning a bachelor of music degree from Florida State University in 1960. She moved to New York City to play with the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. She later enrolled at Juilliard School, in 1975 becoming the first woman at Juilliard to earn the degree of doctor of musical arts in composition. Her teachers included John Boda, Elliott Carter, and Roger Sessions. She first came to prominence when Pierre Boulez programmed her &quot;Symposium for Orchestra&quot; with the Juilliard Symphony Orchestra in 1975.

Some of her work during this period was written for her husband, violinist Joseph Zwilich, who played in the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera. He died in 1979, after which Taaffe Zwilich refocused her compositional efforts on &quot;communicating more directly with performers and listeners,&quot; softening her somewhat harsh, jagged style.

Her Symphony No. 1 (&quot;Three Movements for Orchestra&quot;) was premiered by the American Composers Orchestra in 1982, conducted by Gunther Schuller. It won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize, after which her popularity and income from commissions ensured that she could devote herself to composing full-time. From 1995–99, she was the first occupant of the Composer&#x27;s Chair at Carnegie Hall; while there, she created the &quot;Making Music&quot; concert series, which focuses on performances and lectures by living composers, a series that is still in existence.

She has received a number of other honors, including the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Chamber Music Prize, the Arturo Toscanini Music Critics Award, the Ernst von Dohnányi Citation, an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, and four Grammy nominations. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1999, she was designated Musical America&#x27;s Composer of the Year. She has been professor at Florida State University, and has served for many years on the advisory panel of the BMI Foundation, Inc. In 2009, she became the chair of the BMI Student Composer Awards following Milton Babbitt and William Schuman. She has received six honorary doctorates.

A 2012 recording of Taaffe Zwilich&#x27;s Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra, performed by Chamber Music Northwest with clarinetist David Shifrin, was selected by the Library of Congress in 2023 for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Musical career==
Taaffe Zwilich&#x27;s compositional style is marked by an obsession with &quot;the idea of generating an entire work – large-scale structure, melodic and harmonic language, and developmental processes – from its initial motives.&quot; In addition to large scale orchestral works like &quot;Symbolon&quot; (1988), Symphony No. 2 (&quot;Cello Symphony&quot;) (1985), and Symphony No. 3 (1992), she has written a number of notable, smaller-scale concertos. These include works for trombone (1988), bass trombone (1989), flute (1989), oboe (1990), bassoon (1992), horn (1993), trumpet (1994) and clarinet (2002). She has also written a small number of choral works and song cycles. Her music was conducted by Pierre Boulez at Juilliard in 1975. Her major breakthrough came after winning the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for her Symphony No. 1. Following this, she was commissioned to work on two more symphonies, for the San Francisco Symphony and for the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s 150th anniversary. &quot;Symbolon&quot; has been performed in Europe, Asia, and America.

<doc id="156416" wikidata="Q544485" url="?curid=156416" title="Virgil Thomson">
<text>Virgil Thomson (November 25, 1896 – September 30, 1989) was an American composer and critic. He was instrumental in the development of the &quot;American Sound&quot; in classical music. He has been described as a modernist, a neoromantic, a neoclassicist, and a composer of &quot;an Olympian blend of humanity and detachment&quot; whose &quot;expressive voice was always carefully muted&quot; until his late opera &quot;Lord Byron&quot; which, in contrast to all his previous work, exhibited an emotional content that rises to &quot;moments of real passion&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Thomson was born in Kansas City, Missouri. As a child he befriended Alice Smith, great-granddaughter of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter-day Saint movement. During his youth he often played the organ in Grace Church, (now Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral), as his piano teacher was the church&#x27;s organist. After World War I, he entered Harvard University thanks to a loan from Dr. Fred M. Smith, the president of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and father of Alice Smith. His tours of Europe with the Harvard Glee Club helped nurture his desire to return there.

At Harvard, Thomson focused his studies on the piano work of Erik Satie. He studied in Paris on fellowship for a year, and after graduating lived in Paris from 1925 until 1940. While studying in Paris he was influenced by several French composers who were members of &quot;Les Six&quot; including: Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Arthur Honegger, Georges Auric, and Germaine Tailleferre. He eventually studied with Nadia Boulanger and became a fixture of &quot;Paris in the twenties&quot;.

In Paris in 1925, he cemented a relationship with painter Maurice Grosser, who was to become his life partner and frequent collaborator. Later he and Grosser lived at the Hotel Chelsea, where he presided over a largely gay salon that attracted many of the leading figures in music and art and theater, including Leonard Bernstein, Tennessee Williams, and many others. He also encouraged many younger composers and literary figures such as Theodor Adorno, Ned Rorem, Lou Harrison, John Cage, Frank O&#x27;Hara, and Paul Bowles. Grosser died in 1986, three years before Thomson.

His most important friend from this period was Gertrude Stein, who was an artistic collaborator and mentor to him. After meeting Stein in Paris in 1926, Thomson invited her to prepare a libretto for an opera which he hoped to compose. Their collaboration resulted in the premier of the groundbreaking composition &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; in 1934. At the time, the opera was noted for its form, musical content and the portrayal of European saints by an all-black cast. Years later in 1947, he collaborated once again with Stein on his provocative opera &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot; which portrays the life of the social reformer Susan B. Anthony. Thomson incorporated musical elements from Baptist hymns, Gregorian chants and popular songs into both scores while demonstrating a restrained use of dissonance.

Thomson&#x27;s contributions to music were not limited to the operatic stage, however. In 1936, he established a collaboration with the film director Pare Lorentz and composed music for the documentary film &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; for the United States government&#x27;s Resettlement Administration (RA). Thomson incorporated folk melodies and religious musical themes into the film score and subsequently composed an orchestral suite of the same name which was recorded by Leopold Stokowski and the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra in 1946 for RCA Victor (# 11-9522,11-9523). In 1938 he also formed a collaboration with Lorentz and the operatic singer Thomas Hardie Chalmers on the documentary film &quot;The River&quot; for the United States government&#x27;s Farm Security Administration. Thomson composed an orchestra suite based on the score; when it was published, the musical journal &quot;Notes&quot; commented: &quot;Delightful as background music, the piece is an awful bore when you try to give it your full attention&quot;.

Subsequently, in 1948 he collaborated with the director Robert J. Flaherty on the docufiction film &quot;Louisiana Story&quot;, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1949. At the time, the award was the only Pulitzer Prize in music granted for a musical composition written exclusively for film. Thomson&#x27;s suite based on the score was premiered by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1949 to widespread critical acclaim.

Following the publication of his book, &quot;The State of Music&quot;, Thomson established himself in New York City as a rival of Aaron Copland. Thomson&#x27;s criticisms of Copland were phrased in terms that brought accusations of antisemitism, but Copland remained on good terms with him, and Thomson admitted his envy of Copland&#x27;s greater success as a composer. Thomson was also a music critic for the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; from 1940 to 1954. A fellow critic, Robert Miles, accused him of being &quot;vindictive and of settling scores in print&quot;. In a 1997 article in &quot;American Music&quot;, Suzanne Robinson writes that Thomson, motivated by &quot;a mixture of spite, national pride, and professional jealousy&quot; was consistently &quot;severe and spiteful&quot; to Benjamin Britten. Miles records that Thomson agitated for more performances in New York of new music, including his own.

Thomson&#x27;s definition of music was &quot;that which musicians do&quot;, and his views on music are radical in their insistence on reducing the rarefied aesthetics of music to market activity. He even went so far as to claim that the style a piece was written in could be most effectively understood as a consequence of its income source.

===Later years===
In 1969, Thomson composed &quot;Metropolitan Museum Fanfare: Portrait Of An American Artist&quot; to accompany the Museum&#x27;s Centennial exhibition &quot;New York Painting And Sculpture: 1940–1970&quot;.

Thomson became a sort of mentor and father figure to a new generation of American tonal composers such as Ned Rorem, Paul Bowles and Leonard Bernstein, a circle united as much by their shared homosexuality as by their similar compositional sensibilities. Women composers were not part of that circle, and one writer has suggested that, as a critic, he selectively omitted mention of their works, or adopted a more passive tone when praising them.

===Awards and honors===
Thomson was a recipient of Yale University&#x27;s Sanford Medal. In 1949, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music for the score to the film &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; and in 1977, he was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture. In addition, the Kennedy Center Honors award was bestowed upon Thomson in 1983. In 1988, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Ronald Reagan. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

===Death===
Thomson died on September 30, 1989, in his suite at the Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan, aged 92. He had lived at the Chelsea for close to 50 years.

<text>Lord Peter Views the Body, first published in 1928, is the first collection of short stories about Lord Peter Wimsey by Dorothy L. Sayers. 
Some stories, starting with “The Problem of Uncle Meleager’s Will,” had been previously published.
All twelve stories were included in later complete collections.

==Synopsis==
===The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers===
Members of London&#x27;s &quot;Egotists&#x27; Club&quot; are telling stories of mysterious, unsolved happenings. One of the members&#x27; guests, a cinema actor named Varden, tells how he was invited to model for a wealthy sculptor, Eric Loder, and spent several months at Loder&#x27;s New York mansion. After the war, Loder invited Varden to return to New York for another sitting. Varden noticed that Loder&#x27;s mistress, Maria Morano, had disappeared, though a life-size silver-plated sculpture of her now occupied the living room. One night, Varden was wakened and told to flee for his life by a &quot;funny-looking&quot; monocled man. This man then smashed the arm of the statue with a fireplace poker, showing Varden a human arm bone inside. Varden fled the house immediately, but afterwards wondered if it was all a practical joke.

The &quot;funny-looking man&quot; – Wimsey, also a member of the club – appears and explains the mystery. Wimsey himself was a guest in Loder&#x27;s mansion some weeks before Varden&#x27;s arrival. A burst water bottle led him to abandon his bed for the living room sofa; there, he secretly witnessed Loder enter a hidden workshop behind a bookcase. After Loder left, Wimsey investigated and discovered an electroplating apparatus, as well as evidence that Loder had killed and electroplated Maria, and intended to do the same to Varden when he arrived. Loder had believed (incorrectly) that Varden and Maria were having an affair.

After frightening Varden away, Wimsey confronted Loder in the workshop. Loder tried to turn off the lights and attack Wimsey, but tripped and fell into the plating apparatus&#x27; cyanide tank, dying instantly. In trying to turn on the lights, Wimsey accidentally turned on the apparatus, causing Loder&#x27;s hands to be electroplated in copper. Loder&#x27;s death was ruled an accident, and Wimsey and Bunter gave the statue of Maria a Christian burial with the help of a sympathetic priest.

===The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question===
Peter and Bunter are queueing at Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris, when Peter overhears a conversation from a young woman in the queue that makes him curious, particularly when he notes that the woman and her companion are travelling to Dover. After patient investigation, Peter meets with his mother&#x27;s friend, the Dowager Countess of Medway, warning her that someone is planning a burglary during her granddaughter&#x27;s forthcoming wedding. He believes he knows who the thief is, but has no proofs and must catch him red-handed.

Peter also alerts Charles Parker, who has men on guard during the wedding. A brief uproar arises when the bride&#x27;s famous diamond necklace, brought out of the family vault for the occasion, is reported stolen. The thieves are caught, however, and Peter shocks the assembled wedding party by exposing the Dowager Countess&#x27;s French lady&#x27;s maid as Monsieur Jacques le Rouge, alias &quot;Jacques Sans-culotte&quot;, a notorious safecracker, burglar and female impersonator. Jacques cheerfully confesses, asking Peter how he knew. Peter explains that, while queueing at Saint-Lazare, he overheard the &quot;female&quot; Jacques refer to himself by the masculine article instead of the feminine . Jacques congratulates Peter for such a mastery of the French language, probably unique among English people. The Dowager Countess is initially outraged that Peter knowingly allowed her to be dressed, undressed, and assisted to bed by a man, but then laughs off the whole affair; she was a famous beauty in her youth, who attracted the attentions of many young men.

===The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager&#x27;s Will===
This is apparently the first Lord Peter story; it was originally published in Pearson&#x27;s Magazine vol. 60, July 1925, pp. 27–35.

When old Meleager Finch dies, he leaves two wills: the first grants his fortune to the conservative Primrose League, while the second leaves everything to his niece, Hannah, a young, serious socialist. He writes a letter to Hannah explaining that this second will has been hidden somewhere, and that her only chance of finding it is &quot;by the exercise of a sustained frivolity.&quot;

Lord Peter, his sister Mary, and his valet Bunter travel with Hannah to help her find the missing will. They discover that Meleager was a crossword puzzle fiend, and find a trove of puzzles he had written, including one with no accompanying grid. When Peter falls into the impluvium, he discovers that the missing grid is the tiled floor of the fountain itself, and solving it reveals the location of the missing will.

The story is notable for containing an entire crossword puzzle in which all the clues are rhyming couplets (or quatrains): for example,

&lt;poem&gt;
:One drop of vinegar to two of oil
:Dresses this curly head sprung from the soil.
&lt;/poem&gt;

clues the word ENDIVE.

===The Fantastic Horror of the Cat in the Bag===
Two motorcyclists enter into a high speed chase on the Great North Road, which carries on for many miles and passes many startled passers-by and motorists. They are blocked from tearing through a village by a brave policeman, who stands in their way. The second motorist (Mr Walters) explains that he was only chasing the first motorist (Mr Simpkins) because Simpkins dropped a bag further up the road. Simpkins vehemently denies owning the bag, much to Walters&#x27; astonishment as he actually saw the bag fall from Simpkin&#x27;s bike. A passer-by discovers that the bag in question contains part of a corpse, and the two motorcyclists are detained just as Lord Peter arrives to claim the bag, which he claims was full of jewellery and was stolen from him.

Suspicious, the policeman takes all three in for questioning, and Wimsey insists that he be given no preferential treatment, as he too wants this matter looked into. Wimsey recognizes the face of the dead woman as that of a wealthy socialite who horribly mistreated her husband. The socialite, who recently disappeared, was said to have travelled to America, and her husband was supposed to sail to meet her in a few days&#x27; time. Further inquiries elicit that Simpkins, who runs a delivery service, was unwittingly hired by the jewel thief to pick up the bag of stolen jewels at a local baggage depot. He knew nothing of either crime, nor was he aware that he was given the wrong bag at the depot as both bags were identical. He also did not discover the gruesome contents until much later. Afraid he would be arrested, Simpkins then attempted to get rid of the bag, but Walters happened to see the moment the bag fell and kindly tried to return it, setting up the events of the story. Both motorcyclists make up their disagreement, deciding to someday have a more legal race.

Wimsey recovers his own bag of jewels from the depot, and lays a trap for the socialite&#x27;s husband on the steamer bound for America. The murderer is quickly arrested, and his final fate is left unknown.

===The Unprincipled Affair of the Practical Joker===
Wimsey is surprised when Mrs. Ruyslander, the wife of a diamond merchant, knocks on his hotel room door in the middle of the night. She asks for his help in recovering some stolen jewels, and a photograph with an indiscreet inscription, from a blackmailer before her husband returns from a trip to South Africa. Wimsey finds Paul Melville, the blackmailer, at one of his clubs; through sleight of hand, Wimsey convinces the other members of the club that Melville has been hiding cards up his sleeve during poker games. Wimsey agrees to confront the now-vehemently-protesting Melville alone. After some arguing, Melville, much to his annoyance, is forced to return the diamonds and photograph to clear his name. After regaining Mrs. Ruyslander&#x27;s property, Wimsey then returns to the other members of the club and exonerates Melville by demonstrating how the simple conjuring trick was done, assuring the onlookers that there are some crimes the law does not need to touch.

===The Undignified Melodrama of the Bone of Contention===
Lord Peter is visiting a friend, Mr. Frobisher-Pym, in a small village in Essex. Mr. Burdock, a local member of the landed gentry, has recently died, leaving two sons: Martin, who married discreditably beneath his class and moved abroad, and Haviland, a businessman in London.

Peter is introduced to a villager who reports having seen a ghostly coach, drawn by four headless horses, galloping soundlessly in the middle of the night, which he takes as an omen of death. Peter goes to investigate, finding no clues, but meets the High Church vicar and learns of an unusual plan for various village inhabitants to keep an overnight vigil, two at a time, for the deceased Mr. Burdock.

Peter then borrows a horse and rides to a neighboring village to catch up with an old war comrade. On his way back, late at night and inebriated, he encounters the same ghostly coach, and notes where it goes. In the morning, he learns that the church has been vandalized and the two vigil-keepers locked in the cellar, apparently the work of Nonconformists. Regardless, Mr. Burdock&#x27;s coffin is buried.

Investigating where the ghostly coach might have gone, Peter finds a barn containing a number of suspicious items that might have been used to make a carriage appear spectral. He visits the decaying manor house of the late Mr. Burdock, and discovers, behind a water-damaged copy of the Nuremberg Chronicle, the last will of the deceased gentleman. It contains a bizarre stipulation: as long as his body remains above ground, Martin inherits his wealth; but as soon as it is buried, it reverts to Haviland.

Since the body was apparently already buried, Haviland appears to have won, but it soon transpires that the coffin was empty, with the body having been removed by friends of Martin, who arranged the ghostly coach and vandalism of the church to distract from their theft of the corpse. But Haviland is not innocent either; the matching water stains on the Chronicle and the adjacent wall prove that the will had been only recently placed there. Martin, who was not aware of his friends&#x27; handiwork until after the fact, declares he will have his father entombed above the ground, and split the fortune with his brother. Lord Peter concludes that the whole affair &quot;throws a sad light on human nature&quot; and departs for London.

===The Vindictive Story of the Footsteps That Ran===
While assisting a doctor friend with his experiments in curing diseases in rats, Wimsey and Bunter hear the sound of footsteps and shouting from the flat above. A moment later, the tenant comes running downstairs to get the doctor, hysterically proclaiming his wife Maddalena has been killed by a Mafioso who broke in through their kitchen window.

While the police are sent for, Wimsey searches the flat for clues, his subconscious telling him that something is strange about the whole story. The woman has been stabbed to the heart but with a strange, jagged weapon that has now been removed. There are no footprints on the sill or glass roof of the doctor&#x27;s laboratory below, as the window-cleaner had recently been. Furthermore, though the chicken is burning in the oven, the bowl of dripping, which is full, has been already removed and set on the counter, suggesting the chicken was taken out and then hurriedly put back in again. Quickly, Wimsey realizes what was subconsciously bothering him – the sound of footsteps running came from the wrong direction, running to and fro in the kitchen instead of to the body and then to the stair as the tenant suggests. Pulling the skewer out from the chicken, Wimsey and the doctor discover traces of human blood on it, which the man was trying to burn off in the oven. His motive for the crime was unreasonable jealousy, as his pretty Italian wife attracted several admirers each time they went out.

===The Bibulous Business of a Matter of Taste===
A man going by the name of Death Bredon, claiming to be a journalist, heads to an old &quot;chateau&quot; in France, which contains a laboratory where an aging Count is inventing a formula that may be used in chemical warfare. It has been well-publicized that Lord Peter Wimsey himself has been sent to buy this formula for the British government. However, Bredon, in his supposed pursuit of Wimsey and the story, has been waylaid several times on the journey and nearly misses the train after being locked in a public lavatory.

Finally arriving at the &quot;chateau&quot;, Bredon sends in a letter purporting to be from Wimsey, saying he is Wimsey&#x27;s cousin and has been sent ahead by him to visit the Count. Being shown in, he is confronted by two men claiming to be Lord Peter Wimsey, and both deny he is their cousin. When the Count suggests Bredon could identify which Wimsey is the impostor, Bredon tells the Count that he only communicates with his cousin in writing and has never seen him face to face.

After many hours of frustration, the Count decides the only way to solve the mystery is a wine-tasting test. Wimsey is famously known to be able to identify nearly all wines in existence by taste, even when blindfolded. Bredon is allowed to taste all the wines and venture an opinion so he will not feel left out, and he quickly leaves both &quot;Wimseys&quot; in the dust, proving his real identity. By this time, one false Wimsey is too inebriated to care, but the other attempts to take the formula by force. After the impostor is subdued by &quot;Bredon&quot;, the real Wimsey, the Count declares that seeing the two Englishmen betraying their country to buy the formula for some foreign power has caused him to decide not to sell the formula to another country, even an ally, for fear he himself might someday be labelled a traitor. Wimsey wholeheartedly agrees with this decision, as he had disliked the idea of &quot;trafficking in destruction&quot; anyway.

===The Learned Adventure of the Dragon&#x27;s Head===
At Mr Ffoliot&#x27;s used bookstore, Lord Peter Wimsey and his 10-year-old nephew Viscount St George, alias &quot;Gherkins&quot;, discover an old copy of Münster’s &quot;Cosmographia Universalis&quot;, which is in bad condition and missing several pages. Despite this, Gherkins buys it, wanting to start collecting old and rare books like his uncle. The book is one of several that Dr Conyers, a cancer specialist, sold to fund his research.

Wimsey and Gherkins (who is staying with his uncle) return home, and are soon visited by a man named Wilberforce Pope, who insists upon buying the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; from them. He cites sentimental reasons, saying he is Dr Conyers&#x27; relative and used to read the book as a boy. However, he shows little real knowledge as to the book&#x27;s contents. Gherkins refuses to sell, and is backed up by Peter, who is suspicious of Pope&#x27;s motives. Three nights later, the burglar alarm trips, and Wimsey and Bunter stop two criminals from stealing the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;. The two men confess they were hired by a mysterious gentleman, and told the theft of the book was merely a harmless prank. They describe Wilberforce Pope&#x27;s appearance when asked what their employer looked like.

Peter and Gherkins examine the book, and go to stay with Dr Conyers. The doctor explains he wishes to build a hospital and a clinic to continue his research. He lately has been seeking &quot;the treasure hidden in Munster&quot;, which retired pirate &quot;Old Cut-Throat&quot; Conyers bequeathed to his descendants many generations before. However, the doctor&#x27;s capital has been severely depleted in searching both Munster, Ireland and Münster, Germany, with no success. Wimsey suggests that the Munster in question is really the author of the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;; opening the book in question, he shows Conyers an inscription someone has written around a dragon decoration in a map of the Canary Islands. It suggests the treasure may be in the Canaries, so Wimsey and Conyers decide to fund an expedition there. However, in the middle of the night, Wimsey looks out of the window and discovers that the man-made pond Old Cut-Throat built in the grounds has false islands and a dragon fountain corresponding exactly to the old map. He and Gherkins sneak out, take a dinghy from the boathouse, and explore the dragon fountain, finding the treasure chest inside. Mr Pope arrives on the scene minutes too late, in search of the treasure himself (to which he has no claim), and is arrested by policemen waiting in the shadows on Wimsey&#x27;s orders. Gherkins and Wimsey give Dr Conyers his treasure, congratulating him on the hospital that is soon to be.

===The Piscatorial Farce of the Stolen Stomach===
Thomas MacPherson, a final year medical student in Scotland, shows Wimsey the very strange legacy his Great-Uncle Joseph Ferguson left him. Great-Uncle Joseph, who died at the age of 95 by throwing himself out of a sixth-floor window, bequeathed his grand-nephew only his stomach and alimentary organs, with their contents, preserved in a bottle. Wimsey suspects there is more to the story than an eccentric old man&#x27;s whims, especially when he learns that Great-Uncle Joseph was said to be very rich but withdrew more than £84,000 (nearly £5.5 million today) from the bank in the years leading up to his death. The only other heir, one Robert Ferguson, is a greedy wastrel, and was upset to receive only a pittance.

Wimsey goes to Somerset House (where the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths was then located) and asks to see Great-Uncle Joseph&#x27;s will. He finds that the old man was careful to specify that his entire alimentary canal be ligatured top and bottom, and that Ferguson was to study it, not keep it on the shelf. Wimsey encounters Robert there, and pretends to be writing a book on odd wills, hoping that will allay Robert&#x27;s suspicions. He makes further inquiries and discovers from a friend in the jewellery business that Great-Uncle Joseph bought 12 large matching diamonds from assorted dealers, paying in cash for all of them. Wimsey immediately sends MacPherson a telegram advising him to open up the specimen, then washes his hands of the matter and attends a rare book auction.

However, the next day, Wimsey gets a telegram informing him that a burglar stole Great-Uncle Joseph&#x27;s bottle from MacPherson&#x27;s house. The burglar dropped the bottle in his flight, and the shards were found, but not the specimen. Wimsey heads back to Scotland, where he finds that MacPherson didn&#x27;t see his first telegram, being out fishing at the time. Robert was also discovered fishing in the river that morning, but tried to flee when spotted by MacPherson and slipped and broke his kneecap, and is now staying in the house awaiting the arrival of a qualified doctor. Wimsey and MacPherson drive along the river until they find the specimen washed up on a bank and being eaten by seagulls. They bring it home, and dissect it. Eleven of the diamonds are still within, the twelfth having been presumably eaten by a gull. Wimsey then explains that he and Robert had both come to the conclusion that the old man had swallowed the diamonds shortly before committing suicide. MacPherson is more than happy with his eleven diamonds, though his manservant Jock insists upon shooting the gulls to find the twelfth.

===The Unsolved Puzzle of the Man with No Face===
Several passengers on a train are excitedly discussing a recent murder, in which a man was found on a beach, strangled, with his face cut off. Lord Peter Wimsey is among them, and cleverly deduces several facts about the case based on details mentioned by the passengers. A policeman, Inspector Winterbottom, overhears the conversation and takes Lord Peter&#x27;s calling card.

Shortly afterwards, newspapers announce that police have identified the faceless victim as the studio manager of an advertising agency. The policeman from the train visits Wimsey and professes his theory that the murder was committed by an Italian over a love affair.

Peter meets with an old journalist friend and learns that the murder victim had had his portrait recently painted by one of his employees at the advertising agency. He goes to investigate, and finds that the portrait is a striking piece of art but an unflattering likeness, and purchases it from the artist. He interviews a woman working at the agency and learns that the victim was loathed by his employees, and that he commissioned the portrait but refused to buy it.

Meeting with Inspector Winterbottom again, Wimsey recounts his final theory of the murder, in which the frustrated artist opportunistically kills his manager and destroys the face he grew to hate while painting his portrait. Winterbottom congratulates him on his theory but reveals that the Italian suspect was found dead by suicide with an apparent confession, and that the case is closed.

Afterwards, Peter muses to himself that he could have proved that the artist was indeed the murderer, &quot;but the man had a villainous face, and there are few good painters in the world.&quot;

===The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba===
Shortly after the newspapers announce that Lord Peter Wimsey is suspected of having been killed while hunting big game in Africa, Rogers, a disgruntled footman who had been dismissed from his post, joins a mysterious and highly effective secret society of criminals. This society is unusual in that all members are required to wear black executioner&#x27;s hoods with white numbers embroidered on them so no one knows anyone else&#x27;s identity, whenever the gang meets together. To openly name another member means instant death. Rogers, now &quot;Number 21&quot;, is told his principal duty is to give information about houses he has served in, and for two years is a useful and respected member of the society. After this time, however, things suddenly start to go wrong for the society – robbery attempts end in narrow escapes from being arrested instead of in lucrative hauls, stolen pearls turn out to be imitation, and so forth. Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s mother loses a diamond tiara to the gang during this time.

Finally, the entire gang of 50 is called to a dance, but only 48 arrive. The gigantic and brutal man who is Number One informs them he has had two members secretly executed, as they have been arrested and he was afraid they would talk. He then exposes &quot;Number 21&quot; as the mole who has been ruining their plans. Rogers admits that the real footman Rogers was the one killed in the big game hunting accident, and that he is really Lord Peter Wimsey, who stole Rogers&#x27; identity for the purpose of infiltrating the gang and helping Scotland Yard finally bring them to justice. He offers, in exchange for a quick death and the sparing of Bunter, his mother, and his sister (whom he falsely claims know nothing of the matter), the combination to a secret room in the back of his safe, in which he has a book containing the identities and professions of all 50 members of the society.

Horrified, Number One (the only other person who knows everyone&#x27;s identity) interrogates Wimsey in private and learns Wimsey is not bluffing. Returning to the gang and berating them for gross carelessness, he orders two men to go to retrieve Wimsey&#x27;s book of evidence from the safe. The gang rises up against their leader, afraid the two men will be traitors as well. Number One is forced to go himself, leaving his mistress Number Two in charge. When he does not return, Wimsey admits to an enraged Number Two and the rest of the society that he had a second secret door in the hidden chamber, which, when the book was lifted, would slam shut and seal Number One in. The gang sets a time fuse to blow up their meeting house, despite Number Two&#x27;s protests, and lock Wimsey inside before fleeing. They encounter hidden police officers, who had come when an electric alarm in Wimsey&#x27;s safe alerted them. Wimsey informs Number Two that the secret door is voice-activated and only he can open it – she frees him, and the two escape just as the house goes up in flames. Chief Inspector Parker and Inspector Sugg are delighted to see Wimsey again, and they return to Wimsey&#x27;s flat to let Number One out of the safe before he suffocates. Wimsey opens the voice-activated door with his code word, which turns out to be &quot;Open Sesame&quot;, Ali Baba&#x27;s password in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.

<text>Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one&#x27;s , capacity, productivity and . It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of physical fitness related to a specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military applications and some other occupations. Training methods of all types can be improved by setting specific, time-based, and difficult goals. This allows for the progressive mastery of a topic with a measured outcome.

== Types ==
===Physical training===

Physical training concentrates on mechanistic goals: training programs in this area develop specific motor skills, agility, strength or physical fitness, often with an intention of peaking at a particular time.

In military use, training means gaining the physical ability to perform and survive in combat, and learn the many skills needed in a time of war. These include how to use a variety of weapons, outdoor survival skills, and how to survive being captured by the enemy, among many others. See military education and training.

For psychological or physiological reasons, people who believe it may be beneficial to them can choose to practice relaxation training, or autogenic training, in an attempt to increase their ability to relax or deal with stress.
While some studies have indicated relaxation training is useful for some medical conditions, autogenic training has limited results or has been the result of few studies.

===Occupational skills training===
Some occupations are inherently hazardous, and require a minimum level of competence before the practitioners can perform the work at an acceptable level of safety to themselves or others in the vicinity. Occupational diving, rescue, firefighting and operation of certain types of machinery and vehicles may require assessment and certification of a minimum acceptable competence before the person is allowed to practice as a licensed instructor.

===On-job training===
Some commentators use a similar term for workplace learning to improve performance: &quot;training and development&quot;. There are also additional services available online for those who wish to receive training above and beyond what is offered by their employers. Some examples of these services include career counseling, skill assessment, and supportive services. One can generally categorize such training as &quot;on-the-job&quot; or &quot;off-the-job&quot;.

The on-the-job training method takes place in a normal working situation, using the actual tools, equipment, documents or materials that trainees will use when fully trained. On-the-job training has a general reputation as most effective for vocational work. It involves employees training at the place of work while they are doing the actual job. Usually, a professional trainer (or sometimes an experienced and skilled employee) serves as the instructor using hands-on practical experience which may be supported by formal classroom presentations. Sometimes training can occur by using web-based technology or video conferencing tools. On-the-job training is applicable on all departments within an organization.

Simulation based training is another method which uses technology to assist in trainee development. This is particularly common in the training of skills requiring a very high degree of practice, and in those which include a significant responsibility for life and property. An advantage is that simulation training allows the trainer to find, study, and remedy skill deficiencies in their trainees in a controlled, virtual environment. This also allows the trainees an opportunity to experience and study events that would otherwise be rare on the job, e.g., in-flight emergencies, system failure, etc., wherein the trainer can run &#x27;scenarios&#x27; and study how the trainee reacts, thus assisting in improving his/her skills if the event was to occur in the real world. Examples of skills that commonly include simulator training during stages of development include piloting aircraft, spacecraft, locomotives, and ships, operating air traffic control airspace/sectors, power plant operations training, advanced military/defense system training, and advanced emergency response training like fire training or first-aid training.

Off-the-job training method takes place away from normal work situations — implying that the employee does not count as a directly productive worker while such training takes place. Off-the-job training method also involves employee training at a site away from the actual work environment. It often utilizes lectures, seminars, case studies, role playing, and simulation, having the advantage of allowing people to get away from work and concentrate more thoroughly on the training itself. This type of training has proven more effective in inculcating concepts and ideas. Many personnel selection companies offer a service which would help to improve employee competencies and change the attitude towards the job. The internal personnel training topics can vary from effective problem-solving skills to leadership training.

A more recent development in job training is the On-the-Job Training Plan or OJT Plan. According to the United States Department of the Interior, a proper OJT plan should include: An overview of the subjects to be covered, the number of hours the training is expected to take, an estimated completion date, and a method by which the training will be evaluated.

=== Religion and spirituality ===

In religious and spiritual use, the word &quot;training&quot; may refer to the purification of the mind, heart, understanding and actions to obtain a variety of spiritual goals such as (for example) closeness to God or freedom from suffering. Note for example the institutionalised spiritual training of Threefold Training in Buddhism, meditation in Hinduism or discipleship in Christianity. These aspects of training can be short-term or can last a lifetime, depending on the context of the training and which religious group it is a part of.

Compare religious ritual.

=== Artificial-intelligence feedback ===

Learning processes developed for artificial intelligence are typically also known as training. Evolutionary algorithms, including genetic programming and other methods of machine learning, use a system of feedback based on &quot;fitness functions&quot; to allow computer programs to determine how well an entity performs a task. The methods construct a series of programs, known as a “population” of programs, and then automatically test them for &quot;fitness&quot;, observing how well they perform the intended task. The system automatically generates new programs based on members of the population that perform the best. These new members replace programs that perform the worst. The procedure repeats until the achievement of optimum performance.
In robotics, such a system can continue to run in real-time after initial training, allowing robots to adapt to new situations and to changes in themselves, for example, due to wear or damage. Researchers have also developed robots that can appear to mimic simple human behavior as a starting point for training.

<doc id="156425" wikidata="Q1294168" url="?curid=156425" title="F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas">
<text>Wing Commander Forest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas, (17 June 1902 – 26 February 1964), known as &quot;Tommy&quot;, was a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent in the Second World War. Codenamed &quot;Seahorse&quot; and &quot;Shelley&quot; in the SOE, Yeo-Thomas was known by the Gestapo as &quot;The White Rabbit&quot;. His particular sphere of operations was Occupied and Vichy France. He was one of the most highly decorated agents in the Second World War.

==Early life==
Forest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas was born in London to John Yeo Thomas, a coal merchant, and Daisy Ethel Thomas (born Burrows). Early in his life, his family moved to Dieppe, France. He spoke both English and French fluently. Lying about his age, he enlisted in the US Army at the age of 16 and served on the Western Front as a dispatch rider in 1918. He saw action in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919 and 1920, fighting alongside the Poles. He was captured by the Soviet forces and avoided execution by escaping, in the process strangling a Soviet guard.

Between the wars, Yeo-Thomas held a number of jobs. He trained as an apprentice engineer with Rolls-Royce then became an accountant for a firm of travel agents before joining Molyneux in 1932, a successful fashion-house in Paris, rising to become a director.

==Early RAF service==

On the outbreak of war in 1939, Yeo-Thomas was still living in France. He attempted to join the British Army but was turned down as they had received enough recruits at that stage of the war. He then attempted to join the French Foreign Legion but they were not accepting Britons. After placing his car at the service of the British Air Attaché in France he was granted permission to join the RAF in September 1939.

He applied to be trained as an air gunner but this application was rejected due to his age, instead he was enlisted as an AC2 (the lowest rank possible) in the Intelligence Branch taking up the trade of interpreter. His first posting was to a forward air ammunition park with the Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) in France. He was soon promoted to corporal and then acting sergeant before being posted back to HQ Fighter Command and a Bomber Liaison Section at RAF Stanmore Park in England. While stationed here he met his second &#x27;wife&#x27; Barbara who was then a young WAAF. At this point, a second application to become an air gunner was refused.

Posted back to France in April 1940, Yeo-Thomas was based at Le Bourget Aerodrome when he was caught up in the rapid German advance. In June 1940 he withdrew with his unit, travelling 800 km across France via Tours, Limoges and Bordeaux - finally sailing to England from Pointe de Grave. Before embarking on a ship to England he purchased a postcard from a stall at the monument commemorating the landing of American troops in France 1917, he sent it to a friend with the prophetic words &quot;I know how you are feeling at present, but don&#x27;t get discouraged. We will return and liberate France.&quot;

Back in England, he was assigned to work as an interpreter with the Free French Forces before being recommended for a commission by his commanding officer. He was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the RAFVR on 28 November 1940 and posted to No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron as an intelligence officer, receiving further promotion to flying officer on 28 November 1941. After repeated complaints about his misemployment, and threatening to raise the issue in Parliament, he was posted to RF Section of the Special Operations Executive in February 1942.

==Life as an agent==

At first, Yeo-Thomas worked in an administrative capacity, but SOE soon used him as a liaison officer with the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action (BCRA), the Free French intelligence agency. He was parachuted into occupied France for the first time on 25 February 1943. Both within France and back in England, Yeo-Thomas forged links with Major Pierre Brossolette and Andre Dewavrin (who went under the codename &quot;Colonel Passy&quot;), and between them they created a strategy for obstructing the German occupation of France. During his missions in France, he dined with many infamous Nazis, such as Klaus Barbie who was known as the &quot;Butcher of Lyon&quot;, to gather vital information, returning again to France on 18 September 1943. He was appalled by the lack of logistical and material support which the French resistance movements such as the &quot;maquis&quot; were receiving, to the extent that he begged five minutes with Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister. Churchill, reluctant at first, but fascinated by what Yeo-Thomas told him, agreed to help him obtain resources for the resistance.

In February 1944, Yeo-Thomas was parachuted into France after flying from RAF Tempsford. However, he was betrayed and captured at the Passy metro station in Paris. In endeavouring to hide his true identity, Yeo-Thomas claimed he was a British pilot named Kenneth Dodkin. He was then taken by the Gestapo to their headquarters at Avenue Foch and subjected to brutal torture by Ernst Misselwitz, including repeated submersion in ice-cold water (each time to the point that artificial respiration was required to bring him back to consciousness), innumerable beatings, and electric shocks applied to the genitals. Held in Fresnes prison, he made two failed attempts to escape and was transferred first to Compiègne prison and then to Buchenwald concentration camp. At Buchenwald with the help of Arthur Dietzsch he was committed to block 46, the Epidemic Typhus Experimentation Station (Fleckfieberversuchsstation) as a typhus patient. With Stéphane Hessel and Harry Peulevé he was given the name of a Frenchman (Maurice Choquet) who had died a short time earlier and whose death had not yet been reported. Under this new identity he survived as &quot;a hospital orderly,&quot; being later transferred to &quot;Willie,&quot; one of the many sub-camps of Buchenwald, at Tröglitz/Rehmsdorf in Saxony-Anhalt. The inmates were deployed there (from June 1944) primarily in the reconstruction of a coal liquefaction plant destroyed by allied bombing, which belonged to the Brabag company. Within the camp, he began to organize resistance and again made a brief escape. On his recapture he passed himself off as a French national and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag XX-B, near Marienburg.

While at Buchenwald, Yeo-Thomas met Squadron Leader Phil Lamason, the officer in charge of 168 Allied airmen, also being held there. At great risk, Yeo-Thomas assisted Lamason in getting word out of the camp to the German Luftwaffe of the airmen&#x27;s captivity, knowing that RAF prisoners of war were the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not of the Gestapo. He had to don many disguises, as well as shooting an enemy agent point blank with a pistol, to escape. Eventually he succeeded in escaping, leading 10 French prisoners of war through German patrols to the American lines in April 1945.

==After the war==
After the war, Yeo-Thomas was to be an important witness at the Nuremberg trials in the identification of Buchenwald officials. He was a key prosecution witness at the Buchenwald trial held at Dachau Concentration Camp between April and August 1947. At this trial, 31 members of the Buchenwald staff were convicted of war crimes. He was also a surprise defence witness in the war crimes trial of Otto Skorzeny, particularly on the charge of Skorzeny&#x27;s use of American uniforms in infiltrating American lines. Yeo-Thomas testified that he and his operatives wore German uniforms behind enemy lines while working for the SOE.

He died at the age of 61 in his Paris apartment following a massive haemorrhage. He was cremated in Paris and then subsequently repatriated to be interred in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey, where his grave can be found in the Pine Glade Garden of Remembrance. In March 2010 his life was commemorated with an English Heritage blue plaque erected at his flat in Queen Court where he lived in Guilford Street, Bloomsbury.

He was played by Kenneth More in the 1967 TV series &quot;The White Rabbit&quot;.

<doc id="156428" wikidata="Q1484779" url="?curid=156428" title="Microtechnology">
<text>Microtechnology is technology whose features have dimensions of the order of one micrometre (one millionth of a metre, or 10−6 metre, or 1μm). It focuses on physical and chemical processes as well as the production or manipulation of structures with one-micrometre magnitude.

== Development ==
Around 1970, scientists learned that by arraying large numbers of microscopic transistors on a single chip, microelectronic circuits could be built that dramatically improved performance, functionality, and reliability, all while reducing cost and increasing volume. This development led to the Information Revolution.

More recently, scientists have learned that not only electrical devices, but also mechanical devices, may be miniaturized and batch-fabricated, promising the same benefits to the mechanical world as integrated circuit technology has given to the electrical world. While electronics now provide the ‘brains’ for today&#x27;s advanced systems and products, micro-mechanical devices can provide the sensors and actuators — the eyes and ears, hands and feet — which interface to the outside world.

Today, micromechanical devices are the key components in a wide range of products such as automobile airbags, ink-jet printers, blood pressure monitors, and projection display systems. It seems clear that in the not-too-distant future these devices will be as pervasive as electronics. The process has also become more precise, driving the dimensions of the technology down to sub-micrometer range as demonstrated in the case of advanced microelectric circuits that reached below 20 nm.

==Micro electromechanical systems==

The term MEMS, for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, was coined in the 1980s to describe new, sophisticated mechanical systems on a chip, such as micro electric motors, resonators, gears, and so on. Today, the term MEMS in practice is used to refer to any microscopic device with a mechanical function, which can be fabricated in a batch process (for example, an array of microscopic gears fabricated on a microchip would be considered a MEMS device but a tiny laser-machined stent or watch component would not). In Europe, the term MST for Micro System Technology is preferred, and in Japan MEMS are simply referred to as &quot;micromachines&quot;. The distinctions in these terms are relatively minor and are often used interchangeably.

Though MEMS processes are generally classified into a number of categories – such as surface machining, bulk machining, LIGA, and EFAB – there are indeed thousands of different MEMS processes. Some produce fairly simple geometries, while others offer more complex 3-D geometries and more versatility. A company making accelerometers for airbags would need a completely different design and process to produce an accelerometer for inertial navigation. Changing from an accelerometer to another inertial device such as a gyroscope requires an even greater change in design and process, and most likely a completely different fabrication facility and engineering team.

MEMS technology has generated a tremendous amount of excitement, due to the vast range of important applications where MEMS can offer previously unattainable performance and reliability standards. In an age where everything must be smaller, faster, and cheaper, MEMS offers a compelling solution. MEMS have already had a profound impact on certain applications such as automotive sensors and inkjet printers. The emerging MEMS industry is already a multibillion-dollar market. It is expected to grow rapidly and become one of the major industries of the 21st century. Cahners In-Stat Group has projected sales of MEMS to reach $12B by 2005. The European NEXUS group projects even larger revenues, using a more inclusive definition of MEMS.

Microtechnology is often constructed using photolithography. Lightwaves are focused through a mask onto a surface. They solidify a chemical film. The soft, unexposed parts of the film are washed away. Then acid etches away the material not protected.

Microtechnology&#x27;s most famous success is the integrated circuit. It has also been used to construct micromachinery. As an offshoot of researchers attempting to further miniaturize microtechnology, nanotechnology emerged in the 1980s, particularly after the invention of new microscopy techniques. These produced materials and structures that have 1-100 nm in dimensions.

==Items constructed at the microscopic level==

<doc id="156431" wikidata="Q926299" url="?curid=156431" title="Müller-Lyer illusion">
<text>The Müller-Lyer illusion is an optical illusion consisting of three stylized arrows. When viewers are asked to place a mark on the figure at the midpoint, they tend to place it more towards the &quot;tail&quot; end. The illusion was devised by Franz Carl Müller-Lyer (1857–1916), a German sociologist, in 1889.

A variation of the same effect (and the most common form in which it is seen today) consists of a set of arrow-like figures. Straight line segments of equal length comprise the &quot;shafts&quot; of the arrows, while shorter line segments (called the fins) protrude from the ends of the shaft. The fins can point inwards to form an arrow &quot;head&quot; or outwards to form an arrow &quot;tail&quot;. The line segment forming the shaft of the arrow with two tails is perceived to be longer than that forming the shaft of the arrow with two heads.

==Variation in perception ==

Research has shown that sensation of the Müller-Lyer illusion can vary. Around the turn of the 20th century, W. H. R. Rivers noted that indigenous people of the Australian Murray Island were less susceptible to the Müller-Lyer illusion than were Europeans. Rivers suggested that this difference may be because Europeans live in more rectilinear environments than the islanders. Similar results were also observed by John W. Berry in his work on Inuit, urban Scots, and the Temne people in the 1960s.

In 1963, Segall, Campbell and Herskovitz compared susceptibility to four different visual illusions in three population samples of Caucasians, twelve of Africans, and one from the Philippines. For the Müller-Lyer illusion, the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4% to 20.3%. The three European-derived samples were the three most susceptible samples, while the San foragers of the Kalahari desert were the least susceptible.

In 1965, following a debate between Donald T. Campbell and Melville J. Herskovits on whether culture can influence such basic aspects of perception such as the length of a line, they suggested that their student Marshall Segall investigate the problem. In their definitive paper of 1966, they investigated seventeen cultures and showed that people in different cultures differ substantially on how they experience the Müller-Lyer stimuli. They wrote that &quot;European and American city dwellers have a much higher percentage of rectangularity in their environments than non-Europeans and so are more susceptible to that illusion.&quot;

They also used the word &quot;carpentered&quot; for the environments that Europeans mostly live in - characterized by straight lines, right angles, and square corners.

These conclusions were challenged in later work by Gustav Jahoda, who compared members of an African tribe living in a traditional rural environment with members of same group living in African cities. Here, no significant difference in susceptibility to the M-L illusion was found. Subsequent work by Jahoda suggested that retinal pigmentation may have a role in the differing perceptions on this illusion, and this was verified later by Pollack (1970). It is believed now that not &quot;carpenteredness&quot;, but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the M-L illusion. Dark-skinned people often have denser eye pigmentation.
A later study was conducted in 1978 by Ahluwalia on children and young adults from Zambia. Subjects from rural areas were compared with subjects from urban areas. The subjects from urban areas were shown to be considerably more susceptible to the illusion, as were younger subjects. While this by no means confirms the carpentered world hypothesis as such, it provides evidence that differences in the environment can create differences in the perception of the Müller-Lyer illusion, even within a given culture. Experiments have been reported suggesting that pigeons perceive the standard Müller-Lyer illusion, but not the reversed. Experiments on parrots have also been reported with similar results.

==Perspective explanation==

One possible explanation, given by Richard Gregory, is that the Müller-Lyer illusion occurs because the visual system learns that the &quot;angles in&quot; configuration corresponds to a rectilinear object, such as the convex corner of a room, which is closer, and the &quot;angles out&quot; configuration corresponds to an object which is far away, such as the concave corner of a room. However, in a recent report Catherine Howe and Dale Purves contradicted Gregory&#x27;s explanation:
Although Gregory&#x27;s intuition about the empirical significance of the Müller-Lyer stimulus points in the right general direction (i.e., an explanation based on past experience with the sources of such stimuli), convex and concave corners contribute little if anything to the Müller-Lyer effect.

Neural nets in the visual system of human beings learn how to make a very efficient interpretation of 3D scenes. That is why when somebody goes away from us, we do not perceive them as getting shorter. And when we stretch one arm and look at the two hands we do not perceive one hand smaller than the other. Visual illusions are sometimes held to show us that what we see is an image created in our brain. Our brain supposedly projects the image of the smaller hand to its correct distance in our internal 3D model. This is what is called the size constancy mechanism hypothesis.

In the Müller-Lyer illusion, the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues, which are usually associated with 3D scenes, and incorrectly decide it is a 3D drawing. Then the size constancy mechanism would make us see an erroneous length of the object which, for a true perspective drawing, would be farther away.

In the perspective drawing in the figure, we see that in usual scenes the heuristic works quite well. The width of the rug should obviously be considered shorter than the length of the wall in the back.

==Centroid explanation==


According to the so-called centroid hypothesis, judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of the centroids of the luminance profiles of the objects, in that the position of the centroid of an image determines its perceived location. Morgan &quot;et al.&quot;, suggest that the visual procedure of centroid extraction is causally related to a spatial pooling of the positional signals evoked by the neighboring object parts. Though the integration coarsens the positional acuity, such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole, irrespective of its size, the shape complexity, and illumination conditions. Concerning the Müller-Lyer and similar illusions, the pattern of neural excitation evoked by contextual flank (e.g., the Müller-Lyer wings themselves) overlaps with that caused by the stimulus terminator (e.g., the wings apex), thereby leading (due to the shift of the centroid of summed excitation) to its perceptual displacement. The crucial point in the centroid explanation regarding the positional shifts of the stimulus terminators in the direction of the centroids of contextual flanks was confirmed in psychophysical examination of illusory figures with rotating distractors. The relative displacement of all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them; that is, the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects. Besides, it was shown that well-known asymmetry in manifestation of the wings-in and wings-out modifications of the Müller-Lyer illusion can be successfully explained by supplemental effects of the filled-space illusion.

<text>Arthur Wilton Brown (born 24 June 1942) is an English singer and songwriter best known for his flamboyant and theatrical performances, eclectic (and sometimes experimental) work and his powerful, wide-ranging operatic voice, in particular his high pitched banshee screams. He is also notable for his unique stage persona, featuring extreme facepaint and a burning helmet.

Brown has been the lead singer of various groups, most notably the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Kingdom Come, followed by a varied solo career as well as associations with Hawkwind, the Who and Klaus Schulze. In the late 1960s, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown&#x27;s popularity was such that the group shared bills with the Who, Jimi Hendrix, the Mothers of Invention, the Doors, Small Faces and Joe Cocker, among others.

He is best known for The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;Fire&quot;, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart and Canada, and number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as well as its parent album &quot;The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&quot; which reached number 2 in the UK, number 6 in Canada, and number 7 in the US. Following the success of the single &quot;Fire&quot;, the press would often refer to Brown as &quot;The God of Hellfire&quot;, in reference to the opening shouted line of the song, a moniker that exists to this day.

Although Brown has had limited commercial success and has never released another recording as commercially successful as &quot;Fire&quot;, he has remained a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres because of his operatic vocal style, wild stage persona and often experimental concepts; he is considered to be a pioneer of shock rock and progressive rock and has had an influence on both electronic and heavy metal music. In 2005 Brown won the &#x27;Showman of the Year&#x27; award from &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, receiving the award at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards ceremony held in London&#x27;s Café de Paris.

== History ==
Brown was born in Whitby where his parents ran a guest house. After attending Roundhay Grammar School in Leeds, Yorkshire, Brown attended the University of London and the University of Reading and studied philosophy and law, but he gravitated to music instead, forming his first band, Blues and Brown, while at Reading. After a spell fronting a number of bands in London, Brown then moved to Paris in 1966, where he worked on his theatrical skills. During this period he recorded two songs for the Roger Vadim film &quot;The Game Is Over&quot;. Returning to London around the turn of 1966 to 1967, he was a temporary member of a London-based R&amp;B/soul/ska group the Ramong Sound that would soon become the hit-making soul group the Foundations. 

=== The Crazy World of Arthur Brown ===
By the time the Foundations had been signed to Pye Records, Brown had left the group to form his band, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The band included Vincent Crane (Hammond organ and piano), Drachen Theaker (drums), and Nick Greenwood (bass). Brown quickly earned a reputation for outlandish performances, which included the use of a burning metal helmet, that led to occasional mishaps, such as during an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, where he wore a colander on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident caught fire; a bystander doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown&#x27;s head, preventing any serious injury. The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature. On occasion he also stripped naked while performing, most notably at the Palermo Pop 70 Festival in Sicily, Italy, July 1970, where he was arrested and deported. He was also notable for the extreme make-up he wore onstage, which would later be reflected in the stage acts of Alice Cooper and Kiss. He was also famed for his powerful operatic voice and his high pitched screams.

By 1968, the debut album, &quot;The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&quot; became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by the Who&#x27;s manager Kit Lambert, and executive-produced by Pete Townshend on Track Records, the label begun by Lambert and Chris Stamp, it spun off an equally surprising hit single, &quot;Fire&quot;, and contained a version of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, a similarly bizarre showman. &quot;Fire&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song has since seen its opening line &quot;I am the God of Hellfire&quot; sampled in numerous other places, most notably in the Prodigy&#x27;s 1992 rave anthem &quot;Fire&quot;. The band recorded a second album, titled &quot;Strangelands&quot;, intended for release in 1969 but shelved by their label over concerns that it lacked sales potential. The album featured a more experimental and avant-garde sound that shed the pop sensibilities of the Crazy World&#x27;s debut. &quot;Strangelands&quot; was not issued until 1988. Theaker was replaced because of his aviophobia in 1968 by drummer Carl Palmer, later of Atomic Rooster and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, for the band&#x27;s second American tour in 1969, on which keyboardist Vincent Crane also left – although he soon returned. However, Crane and Palmer eventually left in June 1969 to form Atomic Rooster, spelling the end for the Crazy World of Arthur Brown.

=== Arthur Brown&#x27;s Kingdom Come ===
Though Brown never released another recording as commercially successful as &quot;Fire&quot;, he worked with a varied group of musicians on projects called Strangelands, Puddletown Express, and (briefly) the Captain Beefheart-influenced Rustic Hinge, before releasing three albums with his new band Kingdom Come in the early 1970s.
The three Kingdom Come albums each have a distinctive character. The first, Galactic Zoo Dossier, was a highly complex concept album apparently on the theme of humanity living in a zoo and being controlled by cosmic, religious and commercial forces. The second, simply titled Kingdom Come, was loosely on the theme of water, which Brown had declared four years earlier would be the subject of the second album by the Crazy World. It was musically more conventional than the first, much less heavy, though stranger in places. The third album, &quot;Journey&quot; (1973), recorded in Rockfield Studios in Wales, was a space rock album, with Brown playing an early drum machine and thereby replacing a series of drummers. The band also recorded three of its songs in a live Peel Session for the John Peel BBC Radio 1 show on 25 September 1972. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said that the album has been &quot;most noted in retrospect as one of the first rock records to use a drum machine, which was still quite a novelty back in 1973.&quot; This was especially noteworthy on the track &quot;Time Captives&quot;. Brown recalled &quot;the whole album is based around the drum machine, and we had a lot of ideas that we wanted to explore using this technology. The drum machine they used was the Bentley Rhythm Ace, the British version of the Ace Tone Rhythm Ace FR-1.

Overlooked upon release, &quot;Journey&quot; has received generally positive retrospective reviews from critics. Alan Holmes of &quot;Freq&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Journey&quot; was so far ahead of its time that you have to keep checking the sleeve to make sure that it really does say 1973 and not 1983&quot; and that the album was &quot;not only Arthur Brown&#x27;s masterpiece, but also one of the truly great albums of the seventies.&quot;

The stage acts for all three albums featured a wild mix of special effects, dramatic costumes and colourful theatrics, which were sometimes controversial. Brown had declared when Kingdom Come was formed that the intention was to create a multi-media experience and the band always followed that policy. The concepts, the music and the theatrics proved very popular on the university circuit but proved too way-out for a mainstream audience. The band appeared at the 1971 Glastonbury Festival in Somerset, England and featured in the Glastonbury Fayre film which was shown in cinemas.

=== Later career ===
In later years, Brown released several solo albums. In 1973, he was one of the performers on Robert Calvert&#x27;s album &quot;Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters&quot;, together with a number of other Hawkwind members. In 1975, he appeared in the Who&#x27;s rock opera movie &quot;Tommy&quot; as &quot;The Priest&quot;. Later that year he contributed vocals to the song &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; on the Poe-based concept album &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; by the Alan Parsons Project. In 1979 and 1980, he collaborated with German electronic musician Klaus Schulze, and can be heard on the albums &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;...Live...&quot; and &quot;Time Actor&quot;. Also, In 1979 he moved to Africa and lived there for six months. He directed the Burundi National Orchestra, a nine-piece rock group that played Jimi Hendrix songs and local music.

In the 1980s, Brown moved to Austin, Texas, where his wife came from, and obtained a master&#x27;s degree in counselling. On 17 January 1987, Brown performed &quot;Fire&quot; on the &quot;Flashback&quot; segment of the television programme &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. Together with former Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black, he also became a painter and carpenter for some years, and released an album with him, &quot;Brown, Black &amp; Blue&quot; (1988). In 1992, Brown and fellow counsellor Jim Maxwell founded Healing Songs Therapy, a service that culminated in Brown creating a song for each client about their emotional issues.

Brown returned to England in 1996. In 1997, he re-recorded &quot;Fire&quot; with German band Die Krupps, while in 1998, he provided a spoken-word performance on Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; album, reading a portion of three poems by William Blake, and appeared as Satan in Dickinson&#x27;s music video for &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. He was narrator for the Pretty Things&#x27; live performance of their album &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; (1998) at Abbey Road Studios. He also appeared on television, guesting on Kula Shaker track &quot;Mystical Machine Gun&quot; several times during 1999.

A further change of musical direction occurred, when he formed an acoustic band and went on tour with Tim Rose in 1999. This band then added Stan Adler (cello and bass) and Malcolm Mortimore (percussion) and produced the album &quot;Tantric Lover&quot; (2000). However, the lineup did not last, and Brown put a new band together with guitarist Rikki Patten and multi-instrumentalist Nick Pynn. In 2002, Brown was asked to support Robert Plant on his Dreamland Tour. By now Patten had been replaced by guitarist Chris Bryant. Brown was getting some more media exposure now. His band was briefly called the Giant Pocket Orchestra, and also Instant Flight. In the middle of this, in 2003, Brown released &quot;Vampire Suite&quot; (2003), an album with Josh Philips and Mark Brzezicki of the band Big Country, released on Ian Grant&#x27;s Track Records. Also around this time, Brown&#x27;s back catalogue was re-released by Sanctuary Records.

In 2001 and 2002, Brown made several guest appearances at live Hawkwind concerts, subsequently touring with them as a guest vocalist. On their December 2002 tour, Hawkwind played several songs by Brown from the Kingdom Come era, along with &quot;Song of the Gremlin&quot;, which Brown had sung on &quot;Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters&quot;; this was documented on the Hawkwind DVD &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;.

Brown also provided vocals on two of the tracks on Hawkwind&#x27;s studio album &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, released in 2005. One is the spoken-word &quot;A Letter to Robert&quot;, where Brown recalls a conversation with Robert Calvert. Brown continued his association with Hawkwind, touring with a support set for them on their 40th anniversary tour in the United Kingdom in 2009.
Brown reunited the surviving members of Kingdom Come (except Des Fisher) in 2005, for a one-off concert at The Astoria in London, performing material from Kingdom Come&#x27;s album &quot;Galactic Zoo Dossier&quot;, with an encore of &quot;Spirit of Joy&quot;. This show won Brown the &#x27;Showman of the Year&#x27; award from &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, with Brown receiving the award at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards ceremony held in London&#x27;s Café de Paris. In 2007, Brown and Pynn released &quot;Voice of Love&quot; on the Côte Basque record label, featuring a number of original recordings.

In August 2007, during a concert in Lewes, East Sussex, England, Brown once again set fire to his hair. While trying to extinguish the flames, Phil Rhodes, a member of the band also caught fire. Brown carried on after the fire was put out; he had however lost a few chunks of hair. He appeared as a priest in the video for the Darkness song, &quot;Is It Just Me?&quot;. In 2009, a roll-out re-release of Brown&#x27;s back catalogue was commenced by Cherry Red Records&#x27; subsidiary Lemon Recordings and continued from 2010 onwards on their sister label Esoteric Recordings.

In 2010, Brown played a set at the Glastonbury Festival in the Glade. On 10 June 2011, days before his 69th birthday, he played at the Ray Davies Meltdown Festival at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London where he invited Z-Star to duet with him. Six weeks later, again in London, he played the High Voltage Festival; the gig was recorded and released (on vinyl only) as &quot;The Crazy World of Arthur Brown Live at High Voltage&quot;. In 2012, Brown and Rick Patten released &quot;The Magic Hat&quot; alongside a comic of the same title by Matt Howarth. In 2013, as the result of a successful pledge campaign on PledgeMusic, Brown released the album &quot;Zim Zam Zim&quot;, recorded in his yurt in Lewes. In 2018, Brown was a guest vocalist on the first five dates of Hawkwind&#x27;s UK tour.

In April 2019, it was announced that Brown would join Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy as guest vocalist on &quot;The Royal Affair Tour&quot;, starting in June 2019. ELP Legacy&#x27;s sets on this tour included Brown providing vocals on his signature song &quot;Fire&quot;, as well as on the Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer songs &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; and &quot;Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression, Part 2.&quot;

On 29 March 2022 it was announced that the new Arthur Brown album, titled &quot;Long Long Road&quot;, would be released on his 80th birthday, 24 June 2022.

== Musical style and influence ==

Brown&#x27;s music encompasses psychedelic soul, soul, blues, British rhythm and blues, pop, acid rock, psychedelia, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shock rock and experimental music.

Though Brown has had limited commercial success and has never released another recording as commercially successful as &quot;Fire&quot;, he has been a significant influence on Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Marilyn Manson, George Clinton, Kiss, King Diamond, and Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, among others, and his songs have been covered or sampled by a range of artists including Ozzy Osbourne, Psychic TV, the Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, the Who and Death Grips.

Brown&#x27;s voice and in particular his high banshee screams, are a precursor to the banshee screaming of many later heavy metal singers, and his theatrical concepts and stage presence such as the face makeup, especially his black and white face paint (corpse paint), voodoo dancing, and flaming helmet pioneered a lot of what was to become shock rock and progressive rock. Alice Cooper stated, &quot;Can you imagine the young Alice Cooper watching that with all his make-up and hellish performance? It was like all my Halloweens came at once!&quot; Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan has said he was inspired by Brown to incorporate screaming into his singing style, stating &quot;He changed my life&quot;.

Mike Knoop, writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, said that Brown&#x27;s singing style recalls &quot;Eric Burdon, Bob Calvert, Ian Gillan, Tim Curry, Brian Connolly, and a smidgen of King Diamond all coming out of one person.&quot; Brian Carr, another &quot;Classic Rock&quot; writer, compared the debut album&#x27;s music to that of Alice Cooper and Frank Zappa.

The third and final Kingdom Come album, &quot;Journey&quot; (1973), is noteworthy for being one of the first rock albums to feature a drum machine, especially on the track &quot;Time Captives&quot;.

<text>Horace Michael Swaby (21 June 1953 – 18 May 1999), also known as Augustus Pablo, was a Jamaican roots reggae and dub record producer and a multi-instrumentalist that was active from the 1970s until his death.

== Biography ==
He was born in St. Andrew, Jamaica, and learned to play the organ at the Kingston College School, where a girl lent him a melodica. He also met Herman Chin Loy, who after working at his cousin Leslie Kong&#x27;s Beverley&#x27;s record shop, had set up his own Aquarius store in Half Way Tree. Swaby recorded several tracks, including &quot;Higgi Higgi&quot;, &quot;East of the River Nile&quot;, &quot;Song of the East&quot; and &quot;The Red Sea&quot; between 1971 and 1973, for Chin-Loy&#x27;s Aquarius Records. Chin Loy had previously used the name Augustus Pablo generically for keyboard instrumentals recorded by Lloyd Charmers and Glen Adams, and Swaby took the name for this recording.

He soon joined Now Generation (Mikey Chung&#x27;s band) and played keyboard with them while his friend Clive Chin began his own career as a record producer. Pablo and Chin recorded &quot;Java&quot; (1972) together after Pablo quit Now Generation. He has recorded with Chin and Chin&#x27;s uncle, Leonard Chin, and Lee Perry. Pablo formed the labels Hot Stuff, Message and Rockers (named after his brother&#x27;s soundsystem, Rockers). Pablo&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;This Is Augustus Pablo&quot; was recorded with Clive and Pat Chin. This was followed by a collaboration with King Tubby in their 1975&#x27;s &quot;Ital Dub&quot;.

Pablo produced a number of songs in the 1970s, including &quot;Black Star Liner&quot; (with Fred Locks). He has also worked with Dillinger, I-Roy, Jacob Miller, The Immortals, Paul Blackman, Earl Sixteen, Roman Stewart, Lacksley Castell, The Heptones, Bob Marley, Delroy Wilson, Junior Delgado, Horace Andy and Freddy McKay.

With Jacob Miller, he recorded &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot; in 1974. Pablo&#x27;s dub version of the song, titled &quot;King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown&quot;, was mixed by sound engineer King Tubby. It was named the 266th greatest song of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Pablo later released a few LPs, including &quot;King Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown&quot; (1976) and Hugh Mundell&#x27;s &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;. This was followed by &quot;East of the River Nile&quot; (1978), &quot;Original Rockers&quot; (1979) and another album, &quot;Rockers Meets King Tubbys in a Firehouse&quot;. In 1980, he appeared on the soundtrack of the documentary &quot;DOA&quot;. He released &quot;Rising Sun&quot; in 1986. He also toured throughout the world, recording a live album in Tokyo in 1987.

In 1997, he played melodica on Primal Scream&#x27;s single &quot;Star&quot;.

Augustus Pablo died as a result of a collapsed lung on 18 May 1999. He had been suffering for some time from the nerve disorder myasthenia gravis.

==Personal life==
Pablo was a Rasta. His son, Addis Pablo, followed him into a career in music, as did his daughter, Isis Swaby.

<doc id="156436" wikidata="Q316906" url="?curid=156436" title="Philippe Starck">
<text>Philippe Starck (; born 18 January 1949) is a French industrial architect and designer known for his wide range of designs, including interior design, architecture, household objects, furniture, boats and other vehicles. His most popular pieces were made in the 1980s and the 1990s.He is considered one of the pioneers of democratic design, aiming to offer the best possible service while using the minimum of materials, in order to improve the life of the user.

==Life==
Starck was born on 18 January 1949 in Paris. He is the son of André Starck, who was an aeronautics engineer. He says that his father often inspired him because he was an engineer, who made invention a &quot;duty&quot;. His family is originally from, and lived in, the Alsace region, before his grandfather moved to Paris. He studied at the École Nissim de Camondo in Paris.

==Career==
While working for Adidas, Starck set up his first industrial design company, &quot;Starck Product&quot;, which he later renamed &quot;Ubik&quot; after Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel. For this company, he built relationships with manufacturers across Europe including: Driade, Alessi, and Kartell, in Italy, Drimmer in Austria, Vitra in Switzerland, and Disform and Andreu World in Spain.
In 1983, then-French President François Mitterrand, on the recommendation of his Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, chose Starck to refurbish the president&#x27;s private apartments at the Élysée. The following year he designed the Café Costes. One of his best-known creations is the Juicy Salif for Alessi in 1987 and the Louis Ghost Chair for Kartell (2000), which sold over two million copies. 

After this, Starck&#x27;s output expanded to include furniture, decoration, architecture, street furniture, industry (wind turbines, photo booths), bathroom fittings, kitchens, floor, and wall coverings, lighting, domestic appliances, office equipment such as staplers, utensils, tableware, clothing, accessories, toys, glassware, graphic design and publishing, food, and vehicles for land, sea, air and space.

=== Architecture ===

The buildings Starck designed in Japan, starting in 1989, went against the grain of traditional forms. The first, &quot;Nani Nani&quot;, in Tokyo, was described as a biomorphic shed. A year later he designed the Asahi Beer Hall in Tokyo, a building topped with a golden flame. This was followed in 1992 by &quot;Le Baron Vert&quot; office complex in Osaka. 

In France, with Luc Arsène-Henry, Starck designed the extension of the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD) in Paris (1998).

In 1991, Starck designed one of the pavilions for the new Groninger Museum.

At the 2024 Italian F1 Grand Prix in Monza, Alpine and Philippe Starck unveil the new motorhome for the French Alpine F1 Team.

In October 2024, LA Almazara, entirely imagined by Philippe Starck, opens in Ronda in Andalusia. The project is the first olive oil mill designed by an internationally renowned designer; a unique and immersive place, with an oil press, museum and restaurant.

Since the late 1980s, Starck has designed several hotels in different countries, these include the Royalton Hotel (1988) and the lobby of the Paramount Hotel (1990) in New York City, the Delano in Miami, the Hudson Hotel, the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood, the Sanderson, the Saint Martin&#x27;s Lane in London, Le Meurice renovations in 2016, the Royal Monceau (2010) and, more recently, the Hotel Brach (2018) and the Hotel 9Confidentiel (2018), in Paris. Also in France, in the South West, Philippe Starck designed La Co(o)rniche and Ha(a)itza hotels, both in Arcachon, near the Dune of Pilat. In 2019, Starck created the Lily of the Valley Hotel on the French Riviera and in 2020, opened La Réserve Eden au Lac Zurich.

In 2022 Philippe Starck was appointed artistic director of the TOO Hotel, which opened its doors at the top of one of Jean Nouvel&#x27;s DUO Towers in Paris. In the same year, he collaborated once again with architect Jean Nouvel to design the Rosewood Sao Paulo, a hotel in which most of the materials used were locally sourced and inspired by Brazilian culture. Also in 2022, Cyril Aouizerate, Michel Reybier and Philippe Starck joined forces to open the MOB House hotel and restaurant in Saint-Ouen, a concept designed for longer stays.

In 2023, Philippe Starck was appointed artistic director of Mondrian Bordeaux les Carmes, a hotel in the heart of Bordeaux&#x27;s Chartrons district, inspired by Japanese culture and featuring typical Bordeaux architecture.

Starck has designed several restaurants, including in the early years, the &quot;Café Costes&quot; (1984) in Paris, &quot;Manin&quot; (1985) in Tokyo, &quot;Theatron&quot; (1985) in Mexico City, &quot;Teatriz&quot; (1990) in Madrid, and, more recently, several restaurants with the Alajmo brothers in Paris, Venice and Milan: Caffe Stern (2014), Amo (2016), Gran Caffe Quadri (2018) and Amor (2019), La Réserve à la Plage in Saint Tropez, with Michel Reybier Hospitality, and &quot;The Avenue at Saks&quot; in New York in 2019.

The Alhondiga, a 43,000 square-meter culture and leisure venue in Bilbao designed by Starck, opened in 2010.

Starck also designed affordable and adjustable pre-fabricated P.A.T.H. houses.

Starck was commissioned by the Hilton Worldwide to create an entirely new hotel in Metz, France. Maison Heler is a phantasmagoric building topped by a traditional Alsatian house, a poetic symbol of the region that will open in 2025.

===Yachts===


Starck designed the Wedge Too, a superyacht, built by Feadship and launched in 2002.

In 2004, commissioned by Russian Oligarch Andrey Melnichenko, Starck designed the Motor Yacht A and then, in 2012, A (sailing yacht), one of the world&#x27;s largest sailing yachts. 

Starck designed the luxury marina renovation in the Port Adriano harbor, on the south-west bay of Palma de Mallorca It opened in April 2012.

In 2008, he designed for Steve Jobs the superyacht &quot;Venus,&quot; launched in October 2012, just over a year after Jobs&#x27; death. The yacht was built at Aalsmeer in the Netherlands.

=== Furniture ===

Zartan, created for Magis by Stark in 2010, is a chair entirely made from natural material like bamboo, linen and hemp fiber, a non-toxic and biodegradable alternative to replace plastic.

In 2012, Starck released Broom for Emeco, an anti-waste chair made of materials collected in lumber and plastic plants.

Starck released Cassina Croque la pomme in 2019, a furniture collection for Cassina, entirely made from a vegan fabric, with apple leather.In the same year, he created Smart Wood for Kartell, a collection of seats designed with a minimum of material thanks to a molding technique using wood residues.

For Salone del Mobile 2022, Dior Maison invited Starck to reinterpret the timeless Médallion seat.

===Technology===

In 1996, Starck worked with Alain Mikli to launch Starck Eyes. In 2013 Luxottica bought Starck Eyes and renamed it Starck Biotech Paris in 2019. Starck Biotech Paris is inspired by the human body to create revolutionary eyewear, merging design with biomechanics.

Starck helped design the Xiaomi Mi MIX smartphone, notable for having a 6.4-inch &quot;whole surface screen&quot;.

In 2016, Starck developed a GPS-tracking wristband, DIAL (Individual Alert and Localization Device) for Société nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, which allows endangered people to share their exact location with rescue services from the sea or the beach.

In 2018, Starck collaborated with Axiom Space and created the interior of the International Space Station&#x27;s housing module – a comfortable and luxurious living space adapted to weightlessness, with suede-textured walls, big windows to appreciate the view and all the technology needed to stay connected.

In 2019, Starck unveiled the &quot;AI chair&quot; to the public. The &quot;AI chair&quot; was developed in collaboration with experts of the 3D software company Autodesk and designed with help of Artificial Intelligence.

In 2021 Starck teams up with Delta Café to create RISE Delta Q, a coffee machine featuring the RISE system, a revolutionary reverse coffee extraction process.

In spring 2023, Baliston by Starck launches a collection of shoes featuring augmented technology and 100% recyclability. They incorporate a patented sensor module that analyzes the way the wearer moves to provide personalized information and recommendations. The same year, at COP 28 in Dubai, the HRS by Starck refueling stations were presented. These hydrogen refueling stations are accessible to all, considerably reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Starck&#x27;s work is seen in the collections of European and American museums, including the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne (to which he has donated several pieces, in particular, prototypes) the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, MOMA and the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, the Vitra Design Museum in Basel and the Design Museum in London. More than 660 of his designs were inventoried in French public collections in 2011.

==Gallery==
==Philosophy==
===Democratic design===
Starck&#x27;s concept of democratic design led him to focus on mass-produced consumer goods rather than one-off pieces, seeking ways to reduce cost and improve quality in mass market goods.

Through his &quot;democratic design&quot; concept, Starck has campaigned for well-designed objects that are affordable to the masses. He has expressed this as a utopian ideal, approached in practice by increasing production quantities to cut costs and by using mail-order, via Les 3 Suisses. In 1998, Starck established the Good Goods catalogue with La Redoute, proposing 170 sustainable and respectful everyday life objects &quot;for the future moral market&quot;. In 2000 he worked with Target Stores and proposed a collection of more than 50 products.

Starck released Ideas Box in 2011 for Bibliothèques Sans Frontières. These kit media libraries give refugee populations access to culture and information and can be installed anywhere around the world providing screens, books, games, cameras and more.

Starck has been involved in the development of Fluocaril toothbrushes and Laguiole Knives.

Working with electric bicycle maker Moustache Bikes, Starck designed the M.A.S.S. (Mud, Asphalt, Sand and Snow) line, released in 2014. The collection comprised four ebikes, each intended to handle a particular terrain, powered by a Bosch motor.

In January 2013, Starck redesigned the Navigo travel pass.

In 2016, the SNSM called on Philippe Starck to come up with the design for a portable warning device, he graciously created the design for DIAL - an individual warning and location device. 

Philippe Starck also designed the cauldron and Olympic flame for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, as well as the Panneaux Histoire de Paris (sometimes called “Starck shovels” or “Starck lollipops”) installed in 1992 during Jacques Chirac&#x27;s last municipal term.

In 2023, to celebrate 160 years of Perrier, Philippe Starck reimagines the iconic green bottle with the new Perrier + Starck limited edition. His design echoes the Fresnel lens and its diffraction.

<text>Bobby Chacon (November 28, 1951 – September 7, 2016) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1972 to 1988. He held titles in two weight classes, including the WBC featherweight title from September 1974 to June 1975 and the WBC super featherweight title from December 1982 to June 1983.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Born in Pacoima, in the San Fernando Valley, Chacon, who was of Mexican descent, graduated from San Fernando High School and turned professional in 1972 while a student at California State University, Northridge, leading to the nickname &quot;Schoolboy&quot;. He trained under Joe Ponce and won his first 19 fights, including a win against former champion Jesus Castillo. Fourteen months into his professional career, Chacon faced world champion Rubén Olivares but lost the bout when Olivares scored a ninth-round knock out. After suffering his first defeat against Olivares, Chacon won his next four bouts, then faced off against cross-town rival and future champion Danny Lopez. Chacon outboxed Lopez and stopped him in the ninth round in an exciting fight.

===WBC Featherweight title===
On September 7, 1974, Chacon won the vacant WBC Featherweight title by defeating former WBA Junior Lightweight champion Alfredo Marcano in nine rounds at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. During his first period as a world champion, Chacon got to enjoy the good life, but he loved partying and became an alcoholic.

Chacon lost his title in his second defense against arch-rival Rubén Olivares. Almost immediately after the loss, he fought the first of his four fight rivalry with another world champion, Rafael &quot;Bazooka&quot; Limón, beginning what some boxing experts and historians called one of the fiercest and most spectacular boxing rivalries in history. Limón beat Chacon in their first bout by a decision. Chacon then scored nine straight wins, leading him to a third match with Olivares. This time, Chacon defeated Olivares in their 10-round bout by a decision. In Chacon&#x27;s next fight, he lost an upset decision to Arturo Leon. Chacon rebounded by scoring victories over Ignacio Campos, Augie Pantellas, Gerald Hayes and Shig Fukuyama. He then fought to a technical draw in a rematch against Rafael Limón.

In November 1979, Chacon received a shot at the WBC title, versus world champion Alexis Argüello. Arguello defeated him by a devastating knock out after Chacon sustained a bad cut in the seventh round. In 1980, Chacon had only one fight, but it was a significant one. He beat Limón in their third bout, and the WBC once again made him their number one challenger. In 1981, Arguello had left the title vacant and gone up in weight to pursue the world&#x27;s Lightweight title. Limón then beat Idelfonso Bethelmy by a knockout in 15 in Los Angeles to win the WBC world Jr. Lightweight championship. In his first title defense, he lost it by a decision to Uganda&#x27;s Cornelius Boza-Edwards, who, in turn, defended his title against Chacon on his first defense. In a televised bout, Edwards retained the world title by a knockout in the thirteenth round.

Chacon won five fights in a row in 1982, including a rematch victory over Arturo Leon, which kept him as the number one challenger, but then a dramatic development outside the ring changed his life forever: Chacon&#x27;s wife, Valorie Chacon, flew to Hawaii on February of that year, hoping to convince him to leave boxing and move there if she found them good jobs. She was able to find a job, but unable to convince him to join her in Hawaii, so she flew back. She pleaded for him to leave the sport but was unsuccessful, and the night before he boxed Salvador Ugalde, she shot and killed herself with a rifle. Chacon went through with the fight and KO&#x27;ed Ugalde in the third round. He dedicated his win to his deceased wife.

===WBC Super featherweight title===
Two more victories followed before his fourth and final bout with Limón. Limón had regained the world&#x27;s Jr. Lightweight title by beating Rolando Navarrete by a knockout in 12 rounds. Navarrete, for his part, had won the title by beating Edwards by a knockout in five rounds. Chacon-Limón IV became one of the fights of the year and the decade, according to such magazines as &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;KO Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Ring En Español&quot;, and after 15 rounds Chacon secured a close decision and his second world title in Sacramento.

About one and a half years after his wife&#x27;s suicide, Chacon remarried and bought a large farm with a mansion and, according to what he said at an interview, about 40 horses. He also acquired a collection of Rolls-Royce cars and some other vehicles. In between, he and Boza Edwards met for a second time, with his world title on the line, in what &quot;The Ring&quot; called 1983&#x27;s fight of the year. Chacon rose from a knockdown in round three and recovered from a dangerous cut. The announcers, including Ferdie Pacheco, were explicit in saying the fight should be stopped because of the pounding Chacon endured. But Chacon came back to drop Boza Edwards in round twelve and avenge his earlier defeat to the Ugandan former champion. In 1983, Chacon was signed to defend his WBC title in that rematch against Boza Edwards, who was the WBC&#x27;s mandatory challenger. Even though WBC rules stated the mandatory challenger should receive a shot at the title, the WBC insisted Chacon fight Héctor Camacho in Puerto Rico instead, then stripped him of his title when he refused.

Chacon started 1984 with a move up in weight, to the Lightweight division, where he tried to join the exclusive club of boxing&#x27;s three division world champions, but was knocked out in three during his challenge against world champion Ray Mancini in Reno. Chacon then beat Carlton Sparrow by a TKO in five rounds and announced his retirement. Chacon came back in 1985 and he won five fights, including one against former world champion Arturo Frias by a knockout in seven, and a knockout in five over Rafael Solis, who had challenged Camacho for the world Jr. Lightweight title that had once belonged to Chacon. In 1987 and 1989 he won one fight each year. He retired in 1989 winning 14 out of his last 15 fights.

==Professional boxing record==

==Later life and death==
Chacon was placed on probation in 1984 for beating his second of three wives. His life was again marred by tragedy in 1991, when his son Bobby Jr. was killed in a gang slaying. In 1996, he was spotted at a public appearance in Phoenix, Arizona, to see the fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Julio César Chávez. By 2000 he had lost most of his savings and was being cared for by a nurse as he was impacted by dementia pugilistica (boxer&#x27;s syndrome). He died after falling while in hospice care for dementia on September 7, 2016. He was 64.

==Honors and references==
In 1982, he was named comeback fighter of the year by &quot;The Ring&quot;. His wins over Limon in 1982 and Edwards in 1983, were both named Ring Magazine fights of the year. In 2003, Chacon was included on &quot;The Ring&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time&quot;. Chacon was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in January 2005; he was to be inducted into the West Boxing Hall of Fame later in September 2016.

The chorus of Warren Zevon&#x27;s song &quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot;, from his 1987 album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;, makes reference to Chacon&#x27;s fight with Mancini three years earlier. Chacon died thirteen years to the day after Zevon.

<text>Friedrich Traugott Wahlen (10 April 1899, in Mirchel, Canton of Bern – 7 November 1985, in Bern) was a Swiss agronomist and politician.

During the Second World War, he was responsible of the Swiss programme to reduce food imports and increase agricultural production, which consisted mainly in extending the cultivation area, and reducing meat production in favour of cereals production. The programme was called after his name, as &quot;Wahlen Plan&quot;.

He then served as Deputy Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization for the UN from July 1958 to January 1959. 

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 11 December 1958 and handed over office on 31 December 1965. He was affiliated to the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB/PAI), now the Swiss People&#x27;s Party. 

During his time in office he held the following departments:
* Department of Justice and Police (1959)
* Department of Economic Affairs (1960)
* Political Department (1961)
* Department of Economic Affairs (1961)
* Political Department (1962–1965)

He was President of the Confederation in 1961.

<text>Jean-Marie Musy (10 April 1876 – 19 April 1952) was a Swiss politician.

Affiliated with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland, he was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 11 December 1919 served until 30 April 1934.

During his time in office he held the Department of Finance and became President of the Confederation twice, in 1925 and 1930.

Musy was acquainted with Heinrich Himmler. Toward the end of World War II, the forces of Nazi Germany were retreating and near defeat. At the request of two Swiss Orthodox Jews, Recha Sternbuch and her husband Yitzchak Sternbuch, and in coordination with them, Musy and his son Benoît Musy engaged in high-level negotiations with the Nazis to rescue large numbers of Jews in the concentration camps. Following the of 12 January 1945, Musy was involved in the release of 1,210 prisoners from the Theresienstadt concentration camp in February 1945. The group was saved after $1.25 million was placed in Swiss banks by Jewish organizations working in Switzerland. However, the money was never paid to the Nazis.

Jean-Marie Musy&#x27;s son Pierre received numerous equestrian competition titles and won the four-man bobsleigh gold medal at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

* Department of Posts and Railways (1930–1939)
* Political Department (1940)
* Department of Posts and Railways (1940)
* Political Department (1941–1944)
He was President of the Confederation twice in 1934 and 1940.

Pilet-Golaz was said to be a pragmatic politician who tried to negotiate with German nazism and Italian fascism. He, therefore, had to face the reproach that he sympathized with fascism.

As the head of the foreign affairs, he had to find a balance between the German requirements, the objections of the Allies and the will of Switzerland to stay independent. His choice to build a relatively good rapport with Nazi Germany was very disputed, during as well as after the war. On 25 June 1940, Pilet-Golaz gave a speech containing numerous references to the coming of an authoritarian regime in Switzerland and to a &quot;new order&quot; in Europe. In September, he met with three representatives of the National Movement of Switzerland (&quot;Nationale Bewegung der Schweiz/Mouvement national suisse&quot;), the Swiss pro-Nazi party (the MNS was disbanded by the Federal government two months later).

In 1944, when Pilet-Golaz tried to take up relations with the Soviet Union, the latter refused roughly. So he lost all support and had to resign.

<doc id="156455" wikidata="Q158780" url="?curid=156455" title="Araucaria araucana">
<text>Araucaria araucana, commonly called the monkey puzzle tree, monkey tail tree, pewen, pehuen pine or piñonero, is an evergreen tree belonging to the family Araucariaceae and growing to a trunk diameter of and a height of . It is native to central and southern Chile and western Argentina. It is the hardiest species in the conifer genus &quot;Araucaria&quot;. Because of the prevalence of similar species in ancient prehistory, it is sometimes called an animate fossil. It is also the official tree of Chile and of the neighboring Argentine province of Neuquén. The IUCN changed its conservation status to Endangered in 2013 as logging, forest fires, and grazing caused its population to dwindle.

== Description ==
The leaves are thick, tough, and scale-like, triangular, long, broad at the base, and with sharp edges and tips. According to the scientist Christopher Lusk, the leaves have an average lifespan of 24 years and so cover most of the tree except for the older branches.

It is usually dioecious, with the male and female cones on separate trees, though occasional individuals bear cones of both sexes. The male (pollen) cones are oblong and cucumber-shaped, long at first, expanding to long by broad at pollen release. It is wind pollinated. The female (seed) cones, which mature in autumn about 18 months after pollination, are globose, large, in diameter, and hold about 200 seeds. The cones disintegrate at maturity to release the long nut-like seeds.

The thick bark of &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; (up to six inches (15 cm) in thickness) may be an adaptation to wildfire.

== Habitat ==

The tree&#x27;s native habitat is the lower slopes of the Chilean and Argentine south-central Andes, approximately between and 1,700 m (5,600 ft). In the Chilean Coast Range &quot;A. araucana&quot; can be found as far south as Villa Las Araucarias (latitude 38°30&#x27; S) at an altitude of 640 m asl. Juvenile trees exhibit a broadly pyramidal or conical habit which naturally develops into the distinctive umbrella form of mature specimens as the tree ages. It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic, volcanic soil, but will tolerate almost any soil type provided it drains well. Seedlings are often not competitive enough to survive unless grown in a canopy gap or exposed isolated area. It is almost never found together with &quot;Chusquea culeou&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus dombeyi&quot;, and &quot;Nothofagus pumilio&quot;, because they typically outcompete &quot;A. araucana&quot;.

== Seed dispersal ==
&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; is a masting species, and rodents are important consumers and dispersers of its seeds. The long-haired grass mouse, &quot;Abrothrix longipilis&quot;, is the most important animal responsible for dispersing the seeds of &quot;A.araucana&quot;. This rodent buries seeds whole in locations favorable for seed germination, unlike other animals.

Another important seed dispersal agent is the parakeet species &quot;Enicognathus ferrugineus&quot;. Adult trees are highly resistant to large ecological disturbances caused by volcanic activity, after events like these the parakeets play their role by dispersing the seeds far from affected territory.

==Threats==
Logging, long a major threat, was finally banned in 1990. Large fires burned thousands of acres of Araucaria forest in 2001–2002, and areas of national parks have also burned, destroying trees over 1300 years old. Overgrazing and invasive trees are also threats. Extensive human harvesting of piñones (Araucaria seeds) can prevent new trees from growing. A Global Trees Campaign project that planted 2000 trees found a 90percent 10-year survival rate.

Another major threat to the survival of &quot;A. araucana&quot;, is the presence of non-native seed eating species, in particular mammals, which have been shown to severely restrict the reproduction of the tree in comparison to native seed eaters. However it is still unclear as to how large a role these invasive species play in threatening this species of tree. One study in particular found that native species played a larger role in preventing reproduction through seed destruction. However this may be due to the relatively recent introduction of the selected species, causing their population to be smaller than other invasive species.

A study conducted found that cattle ranching by small landowners and larger timber companies within the range of &quot;A. araucana&quot; severely affects regeneration of seedlings.

== Cultivation and uses ==
&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; is a popular garden tree, planted for the unusual effect of its thick, &quot;reptilian&quot; branches with very symmetrical appearance. It prefers temperate climates with abundant rainfall, tolerating temperatures down to about . It is far and away the hardiest member of its genus, and can grow well in western and central Europe (north to the Faroe Islands and Smøla in western Norway), the west coast of North America (north to Baranof Island in Alaska), and locally on the east coast, as far north as Long Island, and in New Zealand, southeastern Australia and south east Ireland. It is tolerant of coastal salt spray, but does not tolerate exposure to pollution.
Its seeds (, ) are edible, similar to large pine nuts, and are harvested by indigenous peoples in Argentina and Chile. The tree has some potential to be a food crop in other areas in the future, thriving in climates with cool oceanic summers, e.g., western Scotland, where other nut crops do not grow well. A group of six female trees with one male for pollination could yield several thousand seeds per year. Since the cones drop, harvesting is easy. The tree, however, does not yield seeds until it is around 30 to 40 years old, which discourages investment in planting orchards (although yields at maturity can be immense); once established, individuals can achieve ages beyond 1,000 years. Pest losses to rodents and feral &quot;Sus scrofa&quot; limits the yields for human consumption and forage fattening of livestock by &quot;A. araucana&quot; mast. &quot;A. araucana&quot; has a high degree of inter-year variability in mast volume, and this variation is synchronous within a given area. This evolved to take advantage of predator satiety.

Once valued because of its long, straight trunk, its current rarity and vulnerable status mean its wood is now rarely used; it is also sacred to some indigenous Mapuche. Timber from these trees, was used for railway sleepers in order to access many industrial areas around the port of Chile. Before the tree became protected by law in 1971, lumber mills in Araucanía Region specialized in Chilean pine.

The species is protected under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permitting system and commercial trade in wild sourced specimens is prohibited.

Many young specimens and seeds were brought or sent back to the UK by Cornish miners in the nineteenth century, during the Cornish diaspora, and as a result Cornwall is reckoned to have a high genetic diversity of the species. Christopher Nigel Page, a botanist working at Camborne School of Mines, University of Exeter planted specimens in disused china clay pits in the St Austell area as part of his research into regreening former extractive minerals sites, which he presented in 2017 in the UK Parliament, with Professor Hylke Glass, also of CSM, as co-author.

== Naming ==

First identified by Europeans in Chile in the 1780s, it was named &quot;Pinus araucana&quot; by Molina in 1782. In 1789, de Jussieu erected a new genus called &quot;Araucaria&quot; based on the species, and in 1797, Pavón published a new description of the species which he called &quot;Araucaria imbricata&quot; (an illegitimate name, as it did not use Molina&#x27;s older species epithet). Finally, in 1873, after several further redescriptions, Koch published the combination &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;, validating Molina&#x27;s species name. The name &quot;araucana&quot; is derived from the native Araucanians who used the nuts (seeds) of the tree in Chile – a group of Araucanians living in the Andes, the Pehuenches, owe their name to their diet based on the harvesting of the &quot;A. araucaria&quot; seeds; hence from &quot;pewen&quot; or its Hispanicized spelling &quot;pehuen&quot; which means &quot;Araucaria&quot; and &quot;che&quot; means people in Mapudungun. They believe the pewen was given by a deity or &quot;gwenachen&quot; to nourish their offspring; many pewen gathering festivals (&quot;ngillatun&quot;) are celebrated in both Chile and Argentina in gratitude to the tree&#x27;s sustenance.

The origin of the popular English language name &quot;monkey puzzle&quot; lies in its early cultivation in Britain in about 1850, when the species was still very rare in gardens and not widely known. Sir William Molesworth, the owner of a young specimen at Pencarrow garden near Bodmin in Cornwall, was showing it to a group of friends, when one of them – the noted barrister and Benthamist Charles Austin – remarked, &quot;It would puzzle a monkey to climb that&quot;. As the species had no existing popular name, first &quot;monkey puzzler&quot;, then &quot;monkey puzzle&quot; stuck. Pencarrow in the current century has an avenue of mature Monkey Puzzles.

== Relatives ==
The nearest extant relative is &quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;, a South American &quot;Araucaria&quot; from Brazil which differs in the width of the leaves. Members of other sections of the genus &quot;Araucaria&quot; occur in Pacific Islands and in Australia, and include &quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot;, hoop pine, &quot;Araucaria heterophylla&quot;, the Norfolk Island pine and &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;, bunya pine.

The recently found &#x27;Wollemi pine&#x27;, &quot;Wollemia&quot;, discovered in southeast Australia, is classed in the plant family Araucariaceae. Their common ancestry dates to a time when Australia, Antarctica, and South America were linked by land – all three continents were once part of the supercontinent known as Gondwana.

<text>National Youth () was a Swedish neofascist and openly racist organisation. National Youth was closely linked with the Swedish Resistance Movement. SÄPO classified it as a white power organisation and Expo classified it as a Nazi organisation.

The group became famous in the summer of 1998 for tearing down photographs of nude boys at the Swedish Historical Museum. The reason behind the action was to protest against pedophilia and &quot;degenerate art&quot;. The exhibition was closed down after the event.

Since December 2000 they participated in the annual &quot;Salem March&quot; for Daniel Wretström, who was killed in the Stockholm suburb of Salem by a group of which some were young immigrants.

Together with the Swedish Resistance Movement they published the magazine &quot;Nationellt Motstånd&quot;. Earlier they published the magazine &quot;Folktribunen&quot;, which among other things has praised the people behind the racist killings in Kode and Klippan (in Sweden) as true patriots. The editor, Klas Lund, was convicted of bank robbery and of the murder of Ronny Landin in the summer of 1986. In the beginning of the 1990s Klas Lund was one of the leaders of VAM.

In May 2006, the Swedish Resistance Movement announced the youth organization and all its activities and members as merged with the main organization.

<text>The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded on 12 February 1921 as the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), and tactically dissolved itself in 1950 in the face of being declared illegal by the governing National Party under the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950. The Communist Party was reconstituted underground and re-launched as the SACP in 1953, participating in the struggle to end the apartheid system. It is a member of the ruling Tripartite Alliance alongside the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this it influences the South African government. The party&#x27;s Central Committee is the party&#x27;s highest decision-making structure.

==History==
The Communist Party of South Africa was founded in 1921 by the joining together of the International Socialist League and others under the leadership of William H. Andrews. It first came to prominence during the Rand Rebellion, a strike by white miners in 1922. The large mining concerns, facing labour shortages and wage pressures, had announced their intention of engaging blacks in semi-skilled and some higher-level jobs at low wage rates, compared to their white counterparts who enjoyed the monopoly of higher and well-paying occupations. The CPSA supported the strike as the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class, but it distanced itself from racist slogans associated with the strike. The party said in the statement a white South Africa was impossible, and all the workers had to organise and unite regardless of their race to fight for a non-racial South Africa and better conditions for all workers.

The party thus reoriented itself at its 1924 Party Congress towards organising black workers and &quot;Africanising&quot; the party. By 1928, 1,600 of the party&#x27;s 1,750 members were black. In the same year, the Communist International adopted a resolution for the CPSA to adopt the &quot;Native Republic&quot; thesis, which stipulated that South Africa is a country belonging to the natives, that is, the Indigenous Black population, and that most of South Africa&#x27;s revolutionary potential laid with them. The resolution was influenced by a delegation from South Africa. James la Guma, the party Chairperson from Cape Town, had met with the leadership of the Communist International.

Contemporary scholars have argued that the party dismissed competing attempts at multiracial revolutionary organisations during this period, especially multiracial union organising by the syndicalists, and used revisionist history to claim that the party and its Native Republic policy was the only viable route to African liberation. Despite this, in 1929 the party adopted a &quot;strategic line&quot; which held that, &quot;The most direct line of advance to socialism runs through the mass struggle for majority rule&quot;. By 1948, the Communist Party had officially abandoned the Native Republic policy.

In 1946, the CPSA along with the African National Congress participated in the general strike that was started by the African Mine Workers&#x27; Strike in 1946. Many party members, such as Bram Fischer, were arrested.

===Fight against apartheid===
Aware that the National Party, elected to government in 1948, was about to ban the Communist Party, the CPSA decided by a majority to dissolve itself. A minority felt that the party should organise underground, but the majority apparently argued that this would be unnecessary, believing that support should be given to the African National Congress (ANC) in the drive to majority rule. After its voluntary dissolution, the CPSA was declared illegal in 1950. In 1953, a group of former CPSA members launched the &quot;South African Communist Party&quot; that remained — as had been the CPSA — aligned with the Soviet Union. The ban on the party was lifted in 1990 when the ANC and other anti-apartheid organisations and individuals were also unbanned, and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela was released from prison.

The CPSA/SACP was a particular target of the governing National Party. The Suppression of Communism Act was used against all those dedicated to ending apartheid, but was obviously particularly targeted at the communists.

Following the dissolution and subsequent banning of the CPSA, former party members and, after 1953, members of the SACP adopted a policy of primarily working within the ANC in order to reorient that organisation&#x27;s programme from a nationalist policy akin to the CPSA&#x27;s former Native Republic policy towards a non-racial programme which declared that all ethnic groups residing in South Africa had equal rights to the country. While black members of the SACP were encouraged to join the ANC and seek leadership positions within that organisation, many of its white leading members formed the Congress of Democrats which in turn allied itself with the African National Congress and other &quot;non-racial&quot; congresses in the Congress Alliance on the basis of multi-racialism. The Congress Alliance committed itself to a democratic, non-racial South Africa where the &quot;people shall govern&quot; through the Freedom Charter. The Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC, the SACP and other partners in the Alliance in accordance with its evolution. The Charter has since remained the cornerstone of the Alliance, as its basic, shared programme to advance a national democratic revolution, both a process of struggle and transformation to achieve a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.

The SACP played a role in the development of the Freedom Charter through its cadres who were openly active in the Congress Alliance and in the Party&#x27;s underground organisation. In the same vein the Party played an important role in the evolution of the Alliance and the development of the liberation movement in South Africa.

As the National Party increased repression in response to increased black pressure and radicalism throughout the 1950&#x27;s the ANC, previously committed to non-violence, turned towards the question of force. A new generation of leaders, led by Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu recognised that the Nationalists were certain to ban the ANC and so make peaceful protest all but impossible.

They allied themselves with the communists to form Umkhonto we Sizwe (&quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;) which began a campaign of terror by bombing civilian targets like shopping malls and restaurants. However the leaders of Umkhonto were soon arrested and jailed and the liberation movement was left weak and with an exiled leadership. Communist Joe Slovo was Chief of Staff of Umkhonto; his wife and fellow SACP cadre Ruth First was perhaps the leading theoretician of the revolutionary struggle the ANC were engaged in. The ANC itself, though, remained broadly social democratic in outlook.

In exile, communist nations provided the ANC with funding and firearms. Gradual work by the ANC slowly rebuilt the organisation inside South Africa, and the ANC was able to capitalise on the wave of anger amongst young South Africans during and after the Soweto uprising of 1976.

Eventually external pressures and internal ferment made even many strong supporters of apartheid recognise that change had to come and a long process of negotiations began which resulted, in 1994, in the defeat of the National Party after forty-six years of rule.

===Post-apartheid===
With victory a number of communists occupied prominent positions on the ANC benches in parliament. Most prominently, Nelson Mandela appointed Joe Slovo as Minister for Housing. This period also brought new strains in the ANC-SACP alliance when the ANC&#x27;s programme did not threaten the existence of capitalism in South Africa and was heavily reliant on foreign investment and tourism. However, the Freedom Charter had been considered only as a blueprint for a future democratic and free South Africa. In his autobiography &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;, Nelson Mandela famously remarked:

&quot;The cynical have always suggested that the Communists were using us. But who is to say that we were not using them?&quot;

After Mandela&#x27;s death in 2013, the ANC confirmed that he had been a member of the SACP and served on its central committee.

Through the Tripartite Alliance and the sitting of many SACP members on the ANC&#x27;s NEC, the SACP has wielded influence from within the ANC, often serving as an ideological opposition against the presidency and socio-economic policies of Thabo Mbeki (1999–2008); this became most apparent with the ouster of Mbeki from the presidencies of both the party (2007, by vote) and the government (2008, by ANC party recall) and his eventual replacement in both offices with Jacob Zuma, who was widely seen as being more conciliatory to the ideological demands of both the SACP and COSATU.

Initially, the party did not contest elections under its own name. However, in December 2017, the party contested a number of local council by-elections in Metsimaholo Local Municipality in the Free State, failing to win any first-past-the-post ward seats, but gaining three proportional representation seats. In total the SACP received 3,270 votes (6,3%).

In his address to the 2015 Biennial National Conference of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, South African President Jacob Zuma credited South African Jews for being &quot;among the first to organise the South African working class&quot; as some Jewish activists occupied leading positions within the Communist Party.

Tahj Dayton Mowry was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on May 17, 1986. His mother, Darlene Renée (née Flowers), managed her children&#x27;s careers. His father, Timothy John Mowry, became a custody officer/jailer with the City of Glendale Police Department when the family moved to California.

His father has British and Irish ancestry, and his mother is of Afro-Bahamian descent. His parents met in high school in Miami, Florida. Both joined the U.S. Army, and eventually reached the rank of Sergeant. His older twin sisters are Tia and Tamera Mowry and he also has a younger brother named Tavior. He played football at Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa before transferring to Westlake High School in Thousand Oaks, California, and one season of football at Savannah State University and the University of Wyoming. He attended Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, where his sisters Tia and Tamera both graduated.

==Career==
Mowry starred and is perhaps best known as T.J. Henderson, a child prodigy, on the sitcom &quot;Smart Guy&quot;. He also played Teddy on the sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. Mowry has appeared in Disney Channel movies such as &quot;Hounded&quot; and &quot;The Poof Point&quot;. He had a guest role on the Disney Channel Original Series, &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and in a &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode titled &quot;Innocence&quot;. Mowry appeared in the movie &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; as Danny Pulu and in &quot;Seventeen Again&quot; as Willie Donovan. Mowry also had an appearance in one episode in the fourth season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. He guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Game&quot; as Melanie Barnett&#x27;s brother, acting alongside his real-life sister Tia who played Melanie Barnett in the series. Mowry performed the voice of Wade in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot;.

He sang &quot;Shine Your Light On Me&quot; for &quot;School&#x27;s Out! Christmas&quot;, &quot;Circle of Life&#x27;&quot; on the Disney Channel Circle of Stars recording of &quot;The Lion King&quot; included on the Platinum Edition DVD, and was featured on a single called &quot;Kick It Out&quot; with Boom Boom Satellites and Flo Rida. Mowry also appeared in an episode of &quot;Friends&quot; where Phoebe sings to kindergartners.

He starred as Tucker Dobbs in the ABC Family sitcom &quot;Baby Daddy&quot;, which premiered on June 20, 2012. Mowry released his debut single called &quot;Flirt&quot;, produced by Excel Beats, in April 2015. He released a six-song EP titled &quot;Future Funk&quot; on August 4, 2015. It featured tracks like &quot;Bossy&quot;, &quot;Dancing Alone&quot;, and &quot;End of the Road&quot;. He appeared on the daytime talk show &quot;The Real&quot; with his sister and co-host Tamera Mowry and was a guest co-host for three episodes. In 2023, he began starring in the Disney+ series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mowry dated actress Naya Rivera between 2000 and 2004, after the two worked together on &quot;Smart Guy&quot; in the 1990s. Rivera remained close with Tahj and his sisters, Tia and Tamera, until her death, and had once helped the sisters find an apartment when they got kicked out of their house.

On July 12, 2020, Mowry posted an Instagram tribute to Rivera, while search operations were underway for her after she went missing while swimming on July 8 at Lake Piru in Southern California. Rivera&#x27;s body was recovered the next day.

<text>An analog synthesizer () is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and analog signals to generate sound electronically.

The earliest analog synthesizers in the 1920s and 1930s, such as the Trautonium, were built with a variety of vacuum-tube (thermionic valve) and electro-mechanical technologies. After the 1960s, analog synthesizers were built using operational amplifier (op-amp) integrated circuits, and used potentiometers (pots, or variable resistors) to adjust the sound parameters. Analog synthesizers also use low-pass filters and high-pass filters to modify the sound. While 1960s-era analog synthesizers such as the Moog used a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables, later analog synthesizers such as the Minimoog integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems.

== History ==

===1900–1920===

The earliest mention of a &quot;synthetic harmoniser&quot; using electricity appears to be in 1906, created by the Scottish physicist James Robert Milne FRSE (d.1961).

===1920s–1950s===

The earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve (vacuum tube) and electro-mechanical technologies. While some electric instruments were produced in bulk, such as Georges Jenny&#x27;s Ondioline, the Hammond organ, and the Trautonium, many of these would not be considered synthesizers by the standards of later instruments. However, some of these synthesizers achieved a high level of sophistication, such as the Trautonium of Oskar Sala, the Electronium of Raymond Scott, and the ANS synthesizer of Evgeny Murzin. Another notable early instrument is the Hammond Novachord, first produced in 1938.

=== 1960s–1970s===
Early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally &quot;modular&quot; synthesizers, consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.
Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.

Famous modular synthesizer manufacturers included Moog Music, ARP Instruments, Inc., Serge Modular Music Systems, and Electronic Music Studios. Moog established standards recognized worldwide for control interfacing on analog synthesizers, using an exponential 1-volt-per-octave pitch control and a separate pulse triggering signal. These control signals were routed using the same types of connectors and cables that were used for routing the synthesized sound signals. A specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder, based on equipment developed for speech synthesis. Vocoders are often used to make a sound that resembles a musical instrument talking or singing.
Patch cords could be damaged by use (creating hard-to-find intermittent faults) and made complex patches difficult and time-consuming to recreate. Thus, later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks, but integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems. The most popular of these was the Minimoog. In 1970, Moog designed an innovative synthesizer with a built-in keyboard and without modular design—the analog circuits were retained, but made interconnectable with switches in a simplified arrangement called &quot;normalization&quot;. Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. This first pre-patched synthesizer, the Minimoog, became highly popular, with over 12,000 units sold. The Minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers, with integrated keyboard, pitch wheel and modulation wheel, and a VCO-&gt;VCF-&gt;VCA signal flow. In the 1970s, miniaturized solid-state components let manufacturers produce self-contained, portable instruments, which musicians soon began to use in live performances. Electronic synthesizers quickly become a standard part of the popular-music repertoire. The first movie to use music made with a (Moog) synthesizer was the James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in 1969. After the release of the film, composers produced a large number of movie soundtracks that featured synthesizers.

Notable makers of all-in-one analog synthesizers included Moog, ARP, Roland, Korg and Yamaha. Because of the complexity of generating even a single note using analog synthesis, most synthesizers remained monophonic. Polyphonic analog synthesizers featured limited polyphony, typically supporting four voices. Oberheim was a notable manufacturer of analog polyphonic synthesizers. The Polymoog was an attempt to create a truly polyphonic analog synthesizer, with sound generation circuitry for every key on the keyboard. However, its architecture resembled an electronic organ more than a traditional analog synthesizer, and the Polymoog was not widely imitated.

In 1978, the first microprocessor-controlled analog synthesizers were created by Sequential Circuits. These used microprocessors for system control and control voltage generation, including envelope trigger generation, but the main sound generating path remained analog. The MIDI interface standard was developed for these systems. This generation of synthesizers often featured six or eight voice polyphony. Also during this period, a number of analog/digital hybrid synthesizers were introduced, which replaced certain sound-producing functions with digital equivalents, for example the digital oscillators in synthesizers like the Korg DW-8000 (which played back PCM samples of various waveforms) and the Kawai K5 (waveforms constructed via additive synthesis). With the falling cost of microprocessors, this architecture became the standard architecture for high-end analog synthesizers.

===1980s–present===
During the middle to late 1980s, digital synthesizers and samplers largely replaced analog synthesizers. By the early 1990s, however, musicians from the techno, rave and DJ scenes who wanted to produce electronic music but lacked the budget for large digital systems created a market for the then cheap second hand analog equipment. This increased demand for analog synthesizers towards the mid-1990s, as larger numbers of musicians gradually rediscovered the analog qualities. As a result, sounds associated with analog synths became popular again.

Over time, this increased demand for used units (such as the 1980 Roland TR-808 drum machine and Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer). Late 1970s-era drum machines used tuned resonance voice circuits for pitched drum sounds and shaped white noise for others. The TR-808 improves on these designs, by using detuned square wave oscillators (for the cow bell and cymbal sounds) and analogue reverberation (for the handclap sound). The demand for the analog synth sound led to development of a variety of analog modeling synthesizers—which emulate analog VCOs and VCFs using samples, software, or specialized digital circuitry, and the construction of new analog keyboard synths such as the Alesis Andromeda, Prophet &#x27;08, and Moog&#x27;s Little Phatty, as well as semi-modular and modular units.

== Use in modern music ==

The lapse of patents in recent years, such as for the Moog synthesizer transistor ladder filter, has spurred a return of DIY and kit synthesizer modules, as well as an increase in the number of commercial companies selling analog modules. Reverse engineering has also revealed the secrets of some synthesizer components, such as those from ARP Instruments, Inc. In addition, despite the widespread availability during the 2000s of relatively inexpensive digital synthesizers that offered complex synthesis algorithms and envelopes, some musicians are attracted to the sounds of monophonic and polyphonic analog synths. While some musicians embrace analog synthesizers as preferable, others counter that analog and digital synthesis simply represent different sonic generation processes that both reproduce characteristics the other misses. Another factor considered to have increased use of analog synths since the 1990s is weariness with the complex screen-based navigation systems of digital synths, with the &quot;hands-on&quot;, practical controls of analog synths – potentiometer knobs, faders, and other features – offering a strong appeal.

<doc id="156470" wikidata="Q92878" url="?curid=156470" title="Andrei Alexandrescu">
<text>Tudor Andrei Cristian Alexandrescu (born 1969) is a Romanian-American C++ and D language programmer and author. He is particularly known for his pioneering work on policy-based design implemented via template metaprogramming. These ideas are articulated in his book &quot;Modern C++ Design&quot; and were first implemented in his programming library, Loki. He also implemented the &quot;move constructors&quot; concept in his MOJO library. He contributed to the &quot;C/C++ Users Journal&quot; under the byline &quot;Generic&lt;Programming&gt;&quot;. 

He became an American citizen in August 2014.

==Education and career==
Alexandrescu received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Polytechnic University of Bucharest (&quot;Universitatea Politehnica din București&quot;) in July 1994.

His first article was published in the &quot;C/C++ Users Journal&quot; in September 1998. He was a program manager for Netzip, Inc. from April 1999 until February 2000. When the company was acquired by RealNetworks, Inc., he served there as a development manager from February 2000 through September 2001.

Alexandrescu earned a M.S. (2003) and a PhD (2009) in computer science from the University of Washington.

In 2006 Alexandrescu began assisting Walter Bright on the development of the D programming language. He released a book titled &quot;The D Programming Language&quot; in May 2010. 

From 2010 to 2014, Alexandrescu, Herb Sutter, and Scott Meyers ran a small annual technical conference called &quot;C++ and Beyond&quot;.

Alexandrescu worked as a research scientist at Facebook for over 5 years, before departing the company in August 2015 in order to focus on developing the D programming language.

In January 2022, Alexandrescu began working at Nvidia as a Principal Research Scientist.

== Contributions ==

=== The D Programming Language ===
Along with Walter Bright, Andrei has been one of the two main designers of the D Programming Language, and the principal maintainer of the standard library Phobos from 2007 to 2019. He is the founder of the D Language Foundation. His contributions include the ranges module. He is the author of &quot;The D Programmming Language&quot; book.

=== Expected ===

Expected is a template class for C++ which is on the C++ Standards track. Alexandrescu proposes codice_1 as a class for use as a return value which contains either a T or the exception preventing its creation, which is an improvement over use of either return codes or exceptions exclusively. Expected can be thought of as a restriction of sum (union) types or algebraic datatypes in various languages, e.g., Hope, or the more recent Haskell and Gallina; or of the error handling mechanism of Google&#x27;s Go, or the Result type in Rust.

He explains the benefits of codice_1 as:
* Associates errors with computational goals
* Naturally allows multiple exceptions in flight
* Switch between &quot;error handling&quot; and &quot;exception throwing&quot; styles
* Teleportation possible across thread boundaries, across nothrow subsystem boundaries and across time (save now, throw later)
* Collect, group, combine exceptions

==== Example ====

For example, instead of any of the following common function prototypes:

codice_3

or

codice_4

he proposes the following:

codice_5

=== Scope guard ===

From 2000 onwards, Alexandrescu has advocated and popularized the scope guard idiom. He has introduced it as a language construct in D. It has been implemented by others in many other languages.

<text>Jean-Pierre Boyer (; 15 February 1776 – 9 July 1850) was one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution, and the president of Haiti from 1818 to 1843. He reunited the north and south of the country into the Republic of Haiti in 1820 and also annexed the newly independent Spanish Haiti (Santo Domingo), which brought all of Hispaniola under one Haitian government by 1822. Serving as president for just under 25 years, Boyer managed to rule for the longest period of time of any Haitian leader.

==Early life and education==
Boyer was born in Port-au-Prince and was the biracial son of a French tailor and an African mother, a former slave from the Congo. He was sent to France by his father for his education. During the French Revolution, he served as a battalion commander, and fought against Toussaint Louverture in the early years of the Haitian Revolution. He later allied himself with André Rigaud, also of mulatto ancestry, in the latter&#x27;s abortive insurrection against Toussaint to try to keep control of the southern region of Saint-Domingue.

After going into exile in France, Boyer and Alexandre Pétion returned in 1802 with the French troops led by General Charles Leclerc. After it became clear the French were going to try to reimpose slavery and restrictions on free &quot;gens de couleur&quot;, Boyer joined the patriots under Pétion and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who led the colony to independence. After Pétion rose to power in the Republic of Haiti in the South, he chose Boyer as his successor. He was reportedly under the influence of his (and his predecessor&#x27;s) lover, Marie-Madeleine Lachenais, who acted as his political adviser.

When Santo Domingo became independent late in 1821, Boyer was quick to occupy and gain control, uniting the entire island under his rule by 9 February 1822. Boyer ruled the island of Hispaniola until 1843, when he lost the support of the ruling elite and was ousted.

==Military career==
After the uprising of African slaves in the north of Saint-Domingue in 1791, Boyer joined with the French Commissioners and went there to fight against the &quot;grand blancs&quot; (plantation owners) and royalists. In 1794, Saint-Domingue was invaded by British forces trying to capitalize on the current unrest to capture the colony. Boyer went to Jacmel, where he joined forces with mulatto leader, General André Rigaud. While other mulatto leaders surrendered to Toussaint Louverture in southern Saint-Domingue, Boyer escaped to France with Rigaud and Alexandre Pétion.

At the time, the United States supported French efforts to re-establish control over the colony, and France dispatched 20,000 troops to Saint-Dominingue. Boyer traveled to Paris, where he stayed until 1801.

Next, he returned to Haiti to protest the independence that Toussaint Louverture had just achieved. By early 1802, Rigaud and other leaders learned that the French intended to take away the civil rights of mulattoes and re-institute slavery for former slaves in Saint-Domingue (as they had managed to do in Guadeloupe.) They sent General LeClerc to defeat the rebels, and over the next 21 months, added to his forces by 20,000 troops. Boyer collaborated with other native leaders to defeat the French. In November 1803, France withdrew its surviving 7,000 troops, less than one-third of the forces sent to the island. Most had died as a result of yellow fever, which was endemic to the island.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a former slave from the North, declared Haitian independence on 1 January 1804. He established himself as Emperor Jacques I. He was assassinated by opponents in 1806.

Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe competed to rule Haiti, and represented the split between the urban mulatto elite of the South and the black former slaves of the North, respectively. After years of warfare, they established separate states: Pétion continuing the Republic of Haiti in the southern part of Haiti, and Christophe creating the State (later Kingdom) of Haiti in the north.

==State of Haiti==

In 1818 Pétion died and Boyer replaced him as the second President of the Republic of Haiti. This was an arranged transition since Pétion had selected Boyer as his successor and the Senate approved his choice. The 1816 revised constitution provided for the President to select his successor as a measure to protect the nation from foreign intrusion. Joseph Balthazar Inginac also continued as the President&#x27;s secretary and right hand.

Boyer believed Haiti had to be acknowledged as an independent nation to maintain its independence, and that this could be established only by cutting a deal with France. On 11 July 1825, Boyer signed an indemnity treaty stipulating that Haiti would pay France indemnities to compensate for the lost property in slaves and trade in exchange for formal diplomatic recognition of its independence. The indemnities which continued until 1947 comprised up to 80 percent of the annual revenue of Haiti&#x27;s government and severely limited the government&#x27;s capacity to function and invest in infrastructure and development. 

As soon as Boyer came to power, he was confronted with the continuing competition with Henri Christophe and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Christophe&#x27;s autocratic rule created continued unrest in the Kingdom of Haiti. After his soldiers rebelled against him in 1820, in failing health and fearing assassination, Christophe committed suicide. Boyer reunited Haiti without a single battle.

==Unification of Hispaniola==

On 30 November 1821, Jose Nunez de Caceres, president of the Spanish side of Hispaniola, declared the independence of the Spanish side of the island. The new nation was known as the Republic of Spanish Haiti. On 1 December 1821, the leaders of the new nation resolved to unite it with Gran Colombia.

Boyer sought to protect his country from the danger of France or Spain re-taking the Spanish side of the island and using it as a foothold to attack or re-conquer Haiti. He wanted to maintain Haitian independence and secure the freedom of the slaves in Santo Domingo.

After promising protection to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance, in February 1822 Boyer annexed the newly independent state with a force of 50,000 soldiers. These forces encountered little resistance from the considerably smaller Dominican population. On 9 February 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo, where Jose Núñez de Cáceres handed over the keys to the city. Dominicans reacted uneasily to the Haitian invasion.

The island of Hispaniola was now united under one government from Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana. By awarding land to Haitian military officers at the expense of former members of the Spanish forces of Santo Domingo, Boyer reduced his influence with the Spanish-Haitian leadership. He continued the policy of Pétion, his former political mentor, of helping free blacks in other Spanish-American colonies to resist the Spanish crown. Boyer ignored Haitian political opponents who called for reforms, such as parliamentary democracy, and veteran generals of the War of Independence, who believed that the revolution was not complete and that they were being neglected.

Boyer, and his assistants, Joseph Balthazar Inginac and Jonathas Granville, were deeply involved with the massive migration of black Americans to Haiti in 1824. Yet, this event did not happen in a vacuum. Neither did the migrants respond reflexively to the promises the Haitian government offered. The migration is often called a failure because of the 6,000 (or more) migrants, a couple thousand of those emigrants returned to the U.S. However, those who stayed often had a different assessment of the migration. The term failure, then, should be applied to the prospects the Haitian government had with the migrants and the idea many white philanthropists in the U.S. had of relocating the entire black population out of the country. Neither of these two objectives were met. Yet, for the descendants of the migrants now living in the Peninsula of Samaná and those who also assimilated into the local culture, the migration gave them the opportunity to find new life on the island, and often, to interact in a wider black diaspora through commerce and industry—their knowledge of the English language gave them an edge in Haiti.

The American Colonization Society (ACS) noticed the recruitment effort. Concerned that free blacks could never assimilate to the United States, its members founded their society in 1816 to &quot;repatriate&quot; American blacks to Africa, regardless of where they had been born. It was an uneasy collaboration between abolitionists and slaveholders, who approached the issue from differing viewpoints. The ACS planned colonization in what became Liberia for former slaves. In 1817 Loring D. Dewey toured the East Coast to recruit emigrants, starting in New York. The organization hoped to resettle 100,000 free blacks within 10 years.

Dewey&#x27;s meetings with people in New York convinced him to abandon the idea of colonizing Liberia. Most American blacks did not want to leave what they considered was fully their native country. Dewey met with Haitian citizens in New York, most of whom were refugee ethnic French and free blacks who had fled the revolution. They recommended Haiti as the ideal black homeland, due to its moderate weather conditions and independent black government. After Dewey wrote to Boyer to determine if he was still interested in receiving American immigrants, Boyer proposed that Haiti would seek blacks exclusively from the United States.

The ACS sent Boyer questions related to its goal of a colony for American free blacks. Boyer was confident that his government would be able to receive these people. The ACS tried to negotiate to have the Haitian government pay transportation costs for the emigrants. Boyer responded that the government would pay for those who could not afford it, but the ACS would have to take care of the rest of the finances. Haiti was already in debt to the French, which had exacted high payment for lost properties of planters, in essence making Haiti pay for its independence. The government did not have funds to transport American families to Haiti.

Dewey proposed establishing a colony for American free blacks that would be separate from the rest of the island, with its own laws, legislature, etc. Boyer was opposed to the idea of an American colony on the island, since the Haitians already feared re-colonization by the French. He told Dewey that the laws of the Haitian government applied to everyone across Haiti.

Beginning in September 1824, nearly 6,000 Americans, mostly free blacks, migrated to Haiti within a year, with ships departing from New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Due to the poverty of the island and the inability of Boyer&#x27;s administration to help support the new immigrants in the transition, most returned to the United States within a short period of time.

==Payment of indemnity to France==
Boyer was anxious to eliminate the threat from France and opened negotiations. An agreement was reached on 11 July 1825, when Boyer signed an indemnity treaty. It stated that France would recognize Haiti as an independent country in return for 150 million francs paid within five years. While this sum was later reduced to 90 million francs (in 1838), it was a crushing economic blow to Haiti.

Boyer had to negotiate a loan from France of 30 million francs to pay the first part of the indemnity. Most of the largely rural Haitian population meanwhile was retreating into an agricultural subsistence pattern. He tried to enforce the semi-feudal &quot;fermage&quot; system in order to increase agricultural productivity on the island, but the people resisted being tied to other people&#x27;s lands. With the Rural Act, Boyer resurrected a land distribution program. He broke up some of the large plantations and distributed land to the small farmers. To try to produce enough products for export to generate revenue, the government &quot;tied&quot; the rural population to their smallholdings and established production quotas.

==Exile and death==
Boyer&#x27;s rule lasted until 1843, when the poor economic situation was worsened by the 1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake. The disadvantaged majority rural population rose up under Charles Rivière-Hérard in late January. On 13 February 1843, Boyer fled Haiti to nearby Jamaica. He eventually settled in exile in France, where he died in Paris in 1850. Descendants of Boyer still live in Haiti.

<text>The Volkswagen &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot; () is a light four-wheel drive amphibious car, used extensively by German ground forces during the Second World War. With over 15,000 units built, the &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot; is the most-produced amphibious car in history.

Prototyped as the Type 128, it entered full-scale production as the Type 166 in 1941 for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; – Nazi Germany&#x27;s military.

==Development==
The Porsche / Volkswagen Schwimmwagen used the engine and mechanicals of the VW Type 86 four-wheel drive prototype of the Kübelwagen, also used for the Type 87 four-wheel drive &#x27;Kübel/KDF&#x27; Command Car (Kommandeurswagen), which in turn were based on those of the civilian KDF-Wagen. Erwin Komenda, Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s first car-body designer, was forced to develop an all-new unitized bodytub structure, since the flat floorpan chassis of the existing VW vehicles was unsuited to smooth movement through water. Komenda patented his ideas for the swimming car at the German Patent office.

The initial Schwimmwagen, Type 128 prototype, was based on the full-length &quot;Kübelwagen&quot; wheelbase of . Pre-production units of the 128, fitted with custom welded bodytubs, demonstrated that this construction was too weak for off-road use. It had insufficient torsional rigidity, and easily suffered hull-ruptures at the front cross-member, as well as in the wheel-wells. This was unacceptable for an amphibious vehicle. The large-scale production models (Type 166) had a reduced wheelbase of which resolved these issues.

Schwimmwagens were produced by the Volkswagen factory at Fallersleben /Stadt des KdF-Wagens and Porsche&#x27;s facilities in Stuttgart; with the bodies (or rather hulls) produced by Ambi Budd in Berlin. 15,584 Type 166 Schwimmwagen were produced from 1941 through 1944; 14,276 at Fallersleben and 1,308 by Porsche; the VW 166 is the most-produced amphibious car in history.
Only 189 are known by the Schwimmwagen Registry to remain today, and only 13 have survived without restoration work.

==Technology==

All Schwimmwagens were four-wheel drive in first gear (and reverse gears on some models) only and had ZF self-locking differentials on the front and rear axles. As with the Kübelwagen, the Schwimmwagen had rear portal axles, which provided increased ground clearance, while at the same time reducing drive-line torque stresses with their gear reduction at the wheels. The Schwimmwagen had a top speed of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) on land.

When crossing a body of water a screw propeller could be lowered down from the rear deck/engine cover. When in place a simple coupling provided drive straight from an extension of the engine&#x27;s crankshaft. This meant that screw propulsion always drove forward. The Schwimmwagen had a top speed of in the water. For reversing in the water there was the choice of using the standard equipment paddle or running the land drive in reverse, allowing the wheel-rotation to slowly take the vehicle back. The front wheels doubled up as rudders, so steering was done with the steering wheel both on land and on water. The Schwimmwagen could also be steered by the passengers using the paddle(s).

<text>An amphibious vehicle (or simply amphibian) is a vehicle that works both on land and on or under water. Amphibious vehicles include amphibious bicycles, ATVs, cars, buses, trucks, railway vehicles, combat vehicles, and hovercraft.

Classic landing craft are not amphibious vehicles as they do not work on land, although they are part of amphibious warfare. Ground effect vehicles, such as &quot;ekranoplans&quot;, will likely crash on any but the flattest of landmasses so are also not considered to be amphibious vehicles.

== General technical notes ==
Two main categories of amphibious vehicles are those that travel on an air cushion (Hovercraft) and those that do not. Among the latter, many extend the off-road capabilities of land vehicles to all kinds of terrain, including ice, snow, mud, marsh, swamp etc. This explains why many designs use tracks in addition to or instead of wheels, and in some cases have articulated body configurations or other unconventional designs such as screw-propelled vehicles which use auger-like barrels which propel a vehicle through muddy terrain with a twisting motion.

Most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller. This is possible as a vehicle&#x27;s displacement is usually greater than its weight, and thus it will float. Heavily armoured vehicles however sometimes have a density greater than water (their weight in kilograms exceeds their volume in litres) and will need additional buoyancy, in the form of inflatable floatation devices, much like the sides of a rubber dinghy, or a waterproof fabric skirt raised from the top perimeter of the vehicle, to increase its displacement.

For propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply spin their wheels or tracks, while others use screw propeller(s) or water jet(s). Most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – few can hydroplane, skimming over the water like speedboats.

== Early history ==

Some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages, the invention of which is credited to the Neapolitan polymath Prince Raimondo di Sangro of Sansevero in July 1770 or earlier, or Samuel Bentham whose design of 1781 was built in June 1987.

The conestoga wagon, a type of a heavy covered wagon, was popular during the 18th and 19th century in the United States and Canada. The wagon was designed in such a way as to be able to cross rivers and streams.
The first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle, a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge, named the &quot;Orukter Amphibolos&quot;, was conceived and built by United States inventor Oliver Evans in 1805, although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam.

Inventor Gail Borden, better known for condensed milk, designed and tested a sail-powered wagon in 1849. On testing, it reportedly tipped over 50 feet (15 m) from shore, from an apparent lack of ballast to counteract the force of the wind in the sail.
In the 1870s, logging companies in eastern Canada and the northern United States developed a steam-powered amphibious tug called an &quot;Alligator&quot; which could cross between lakes and rivers. The most successful Alligator tugs were produced by the firm of West and Peachey in Simcoe, Ontario.

Until the late 1920s, the efforts to unify a boat and an automobile mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull, or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car&#x27;s frame. One of the first reasonably well-documented cases was the 1905 amphibious petrol-powered carriage of T. Richmond (Jessup, Iowa, USA). Just like the world&#x27;s first petrol-powered automobile (1885, Carl Benz), it was a three-wheeler. The single front wheel provided direction, both on land and in the water. A three-cylinder petrol combustion-engine powered the oversized rear wheels. In order to get the wheels to provide propulsion in the water, fins or buckets would be attached to the rear wheel spokes. Remarkably the boat-like hull was one of the first integral bodies ever used on a car.

Since the 1920s, many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications, including recreation, expeditions, search &amp; rescue, and military, leading to a myriad of concepts and variants. In some of them, the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose, whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle. The design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by Peter Prell of New Jersey. His design, unlike others, could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water. It combined a boat-like hull with tank-like tracks. In 1931, he tested a scaled down version of his invention.

==== Cycles ====

An amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water. &quot;Saidullah&#x27;s Bicycle&quot; uses four rectangular air filled floats for buoyancy, and is propelled using two fan blades which are attached to the spokes. Moraga&#x27;s &quot;Cyclo Amphibious&quot; uses a simple tricycle frame to support three floaters which provide both the floatation and thrust. The wings on the powered wheels propel the vehicle in a similar way to a paddle wheel.

The SBK Engineering Shuttle-Bike consists of two inflatable floats with straps that allow the carrying of a bicycle with a passenger. The ensemble, when deflated, fits in a backpack for carrying by the cyclist.

Several amphibious cycles have been created by engineering students as university projects.

Gibbs Sports Amphibians Inc. introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land. The model can reach up to 80 mph by land and 45 mph by water.

==== ATVs ====

Amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious ATVs (all-terrain vehicles). These saw significant popularity in North America during the 1960s and early 1970s. Typically an amphibious ATV (AATV) is a small, lightweight, off-highway vehicle, constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub, fitted with six (sometimes eight) driven wheels, with low pressure, balloon tires. With no suspension (other than what the tires offer) and no steering wheels, directional control is accomplished through skid-steeringjust as on a tracked vehicleeither by braking the wheels on the side in the direction of the desired turn or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side. Most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines, that will provide roughly 25 mph (40 km/h) top speed on land.

Constructed this way, an AATV will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps, ponds, and streams as well as dry land. On land these units have high grip and great off-road ability, that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels. Although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the wateralbeit slowlyoutboard motors can be added for extended water use.

In October 2013, Gibbs Amphibians introduced the long-awaited Quadski, the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 mph on land or water. The Quadski was developed using Gibbs&#x27; High-Speed Amphibian technology, which Gibbs originally developed for the Aquada, an amphibious car, which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues.

==== Cars ====

Amphibious automobiles have been conceived from ca. 1900; however, the Second World War significantly stimulated their development. Two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during World War II. The most proliferous was the German &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot;, a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the Porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in World War II. The amphibious bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, the firm&#x27;s body construction designer, using the engine and drive train of the &quot;Kübelwagen&quot;. An amphibious version of the Willys MB jeep, the Ford GPA or&quot; &#x27;Seep&#x27; &quot;(short for &quot;Sea jeep&quot;) was developed during World War II as well. A specially modified GPA, called Half-Safe, was driven and sailed around the world by Australian Ben Carlin in the 1950s.

One of the most capable post-war amphibious off-roaders was the German Amphi-Ranger, that featured a hull made of seawater-resistant AlMg2 aluminium alloy. Extensively engineered, this costly vehicle was proven seaworthy at a Gale force 10 storm off the North Sea coast (Pohl, 1998). Only about 100 were builtthose who own one have found it capable of crossing the English Channel almost effortlessly.

Purely recreational amphibian cars include the 1960s Amphicar and the contemporary Gibbs Aquada. With almost 4,000 pieces built, the Amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date. The Gibbs Aquada stands out due to its capability of high-speed planing on water. Gibbs built fifty Aquadas in the early 2000s after it was developed by a team assembled by founder Alan Gibbs before the company&#x27;s engine supplier, Rover, was unable to continue providing engines. Gibbs and new partner Neil Jenkins reconstituted the company and are now seeking U.S. regulatory approval for the Aquada.

In 2010, a Southern California-based company named WaterCar set the Guinness World Record for Fastest Amphibious Vehicle, with their prototype, The Python, which reached top land speeds of 204 km/h (127 mph) and water speeds of 96 km/h (60 mph; 52 knots). Since then, the company launched their first commercial vehicle, The Panther, which has been featured on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Bachelor&quot; as well as USA&#x27;s &quot;Royal Pains&quot;. The WaterCar can do 80 mph (129 km/h) on land, and 44 mph (38 knots; 71 km/h) on sea, and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds. Since its release, WaterCar has been popular in the Middle East, selling to the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, with six additional vehicles being sold to the Crown Prince of Dubai. The WaterCar has also been sold to tech enthusiasts and residents of Silicon Valley.

Other amphibious cars include the US Hydra Spyder and the Spira4u.

==== Buses ====
Amfibus amphibious buses made by Dutch Amphibious Transport (DAT) in Nijmegen, Netherlands are used to operate tours of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Lübeck, under the &quot;Splashtours&quot; brand. The buses have a Volvo chassis and carry 43 passengers. The operation started in 2010 in Katendrecht, Rotterdam, was copied in Amsterdam in 2011 but suspended in 2012 after technical problems, and then relaunched in 2019. A tour of Lübeck was launched in 2014. In 2010 it was tested as a replacement for the ferry at Renfrew, Scotland, but not adopted. A similar service, using different vehicles, operates in Porto.

====Boats====
Some amphibious vehicles, rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water, are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land. The distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water, with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality, rather than being the main function. Sealegs Amphibious Craft are an example of this, which are a range of aluminium three-wheeled fabricated boats (mostly RIBs) designed and manufactured in Auckland, New Zealand since 2005. These craft can travel up to 39 knots on water, but travel at only 7.5 km/h on land, showing the preference for water performance in design. Various versions of this type of amphibious boat design have been produced, including the French Iguana Yacht, an amphibious motorboat featuring all-terrain tracks (covered in the &quot;Tracked&quot; section below).

Recently, Gibbs Amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian, one capable of high speeds on both land and water. The vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells, allowing the vehicles to plane on water. These vehicles can transition between land and water modes in about five seconds. The first Gibbs fast amphibian is the Quadski, introduced in October 2012. It went on sale in January 2013.
=====Oyster boats=====
Since 1977, several boat builders in Brittany have built specialized amphibious vehicles for use in the area&#x27;s mussel and oyster farming occupations. The boats are made of aluminium, are relatively flat-bottomed, and have three, four, or six wheels, depending on the size of the boat. When the tide is out the boats can run on the tidal flats using their wheels. When the tide is in, they use a propeller to move through the water. Oyster farmers in Jersey make use of similar boats. Currently, &quot;Constructions Maritimes du Vivier Amphibie&quot; has a range of models.

====Cargo====
===== Trucks and barges =====

With more than 20,000 units produced, the DUKW was the most successful amphibious truck of World War II. This 6x6 truck was used to establish and supply beachheads. It was designed as a wartime project by Sparkman &amp; Stephens, a yacht design firm who also designed the hull for the Ford GPA &#x27;Seep&#x27;. Britain developed the Terrapin 8x8 amphibious cargo carrier which was used by 79th Armoured Division during the Walcheren campaign. While offering greater capacity than the DUKW, ease of operation favoured the DUKW. An improved version of the Terrapin never got beyond prototype stage. During the war, Germany produced the &quot;Landwasserschlepper&quot;. In the 1950s, the Soviets developed the GAZ-46, BAV 485, and PTS.

During the Vietnam War, the US Army used the amphibious articulated Gama Goat and the larger M520 Goer truck-series to move supplies through the canals and rice paddies of Southeast Asia. The latter was based on a 1950s civil construction vehicle and became the US Army&#x27;s standard heavy tactical truck before its replacement by the HEMTT. Although the vehicles&#x27; wheels were mounted without suspension or steering action, and land speeds over 20 mph (32 km/h) were ill-advised, its articulated design provided it with good maneuverability and helped it to keep all four wheels firmly in touch with uneven ground. Coupled with its amphibious capability, in the Vietnam War, the M520 Goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not.

For taking vehicles and supplies onto the beaches the US used the 1950s designed LARC-V and the huge LARC-LX which could carry 60 tons of cargo.

The British Army used the 6x6 wheeled Alvis Stalwart as their amphibious cargo carrier. In the water vectored thrust water-jet propulsion units drove it along at about 6 knots.

The M3 Amphibious Rig can be used as a ferry or as a floating bridge for trucks and heavy combat vehicles.

Gibbs has also developed other types of fast amphibians including the Phibian, a amphibian that is aimed at first responder market, and the Humdinga, a amphibian that is capable of traversing extreme terrain.

=== Armoured ===
Many modern military vehicles, ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance vehicles, through armoured personnel carriers (APCs), tanks and amphibious warfare ships, are manufactured with amphibious capabilities.

The French Panhard VBL is a compact, lightly armoured 4x4 all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at . The VAB is a French fully amphibious APC, powered in the water by two water jets, mounted one on either side of the rear hull (see detail picture above). It entered service in 1976 and around 5000 were produced in many configurations.

During the Cold War the Soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious APCs, fighting vehicles and tanks, both wheeled and tracked. Most of the vehicles the Soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water. Wheeled examples are the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 4x4 armoured scout cars, as well as the BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 and BTR-94 8x8 APCs and the BTR-90 infantry fighting vehicle.

==Tracked==
===Unarmored===
==== M29 Weasel ====
The M29 Weasel (Studebaker Weasel), whilst originally designed as a snow vehicle, operated successfully in an amphibious role by the addition of front and rear floats. The basic vehicle will float but its bow is square so the additional floats add stability and load carrying capacity.

=== Armored ===


Tracked armored vehicles with amphibious capabilities include those that are intended for use in amphibious assault. The United States started developing a long line of LVT (Landing Vehicle Tracked) designs from around 1940.

Many tracked armored vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, such as armoured fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers nevertheless also have amphibious ability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on destroyable and easily targeted bridges. To provide motive power, they use their tracks, sometimes with an added propeller or water jets. As long as the opposite bank has a shallow enough slope for the vehicle to climb out within a few miles, they can cross rivers and water obstacles. An American example is the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. Soviet examples are the PT-76 amphibious tank, and the BTR-50 and MT-LB APCs based on its chassis.

Some heavier tanks have an amphibious mode in which a fabric skirt is needed to add buoyancy. The Sherman DD tank used in the D-Day invasion had this setup. When in water the waterproof float screen was raised and propellers deployed. The M2 and M3 Bradleys also need such a skirt.

==== Tanks ====
At the end of World War I a Mark IX tank had drums attached to the side and front and was tested as an amphibious vehicle launched into Hendon Reservoir. A modified Medium Mark D successfully swam in a river near Christchurch.

By the early 1930s, Vickers had developed an amphibious tank. By using very thin armour, flotation could be achieved without external buoyancy aids. The British Army trialled the Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Amphibious Tank but did not adopt it for service use. An order was placed with Vickers by the USSR for a small number of tanks. After negotiations to purchase the Vickers tank by Poland failed, they developed their own design the PZInż 130 but dropped the idea of amphibious tanks as obsolete. A pontoon based tank, the L1E3, was produced by Vickers in 1939. It was tested but further work was halted during WW2. It was tested again at the end of the war.

In World War II the British further developed amphibious tanks. The Crusader was trialled with two pontoons that could be attached or removed, the tracks driving the tank in the water. The &quot;Medium Tank A/T 1&quot; was a tank with inbuilt buoyancy some long and tall. The Valentine, then the M4 Sherman medium tank were made amphibious with the addition of a rubberized canvas screen to provide additional buoyancy and propellers driven by the main engine to give propulsion. These were DD tanks (from &quot;Duplex Drive&quot;) and the Sherman DD was used on D-Day to provide close fire support on the beaches during the initial landings. The Sherman DD could not fire when afloat as the buoyancy screen was higher than the gun. A number swamped and sank in the operation, due to rough weather in the English Channel (with some tanks having been launched too far out), and to turning in the current to converge on a specific point on the battlefield, which allowed waves to breach over the screens. Those making it ashore, however, provided essential fire support in the first critical hours.

Before World War II, The Soviets produced light amphibious tanks called the T-37A and T-38. A third serial model, the T-40, started production after the beginning of the war. A 14-ton tank, the PT-1, was created but was not mass-produced. In addition, an attempt was made to attach pontoons to the T-26. While successful, the project was closed due to the high vulnerability and unwieldiness of the construction.

Some light tanks such as the PT-76 are amphibious, typically being propelled in the water by hydrojets or by their tracks. In 1969, the U.S. Army rushed the new M551 Sheridan to Vietnam. This 17-ton light tank was built with an aluminium hull, steel turret, and the 152 mm &quot;gun-launcher&quot; (which could fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh missile), and could swim across bodies of water. The M551 upon arrival in Vietnam began replacing the M48A3 Patton in all cavalry squadrons, leaving only the M48A3 in the U.S. Army&#x27;s three armored battalions in Vietnam, the 1/77th, 1/69th, and the 2/34th Armor. The Sheridan needed no modifications for river crossings: crewmen simply raised the cloth sides that were tucked inside rubber tubes along the hull&#x27;s upper edges, raised the driver&#x27;s front shield which had an acrylic glass window, the driver turned on his bilge pumps, shifted his transmission lever to water operations and the Sheridan entered the water. For newly arrived Sheridans, this might work as engineered. For &quot;war-weary&quot; M551s, the driver&#x27;s window was often &quot;yellowed&quot; or cracked as to obscure his vision, and the rubber tubes that contained the rolled up side sleeves were often cracked or frozen into place. The Sheridan could still cross a body of water, but like its swimming cousin, the M113 armoured personnel carrier, also built of aluminium) the river had to be narrow, less than . In all cases, the bilge pumps had to be working properly, and even then by the time the Sheridan or the APC reached the other side, water would often fill the insides up to their armoured roofs, spilling through the hatches&#x27; cracks and emptying onto the earth once safely ashore. Often a fold-down trim vane is erected to stop water washing over the bow of the tank and thus reducing the risk of the vehicle being swamped via the driver&#x27;s hatch.

During the Cold War, the Swedish Stridsvagn 103 main battle tank carried flotation gear all the time and was, therefore, theoretically, always amphibious.

=== Multi-unit ===
According to a 1999 article in &quot;Military Parade&quot; magazine, multi-unit, all-terrain transport vehicles were first proposed by the British in 1913, and by the 1950s, over 40 types of articulated tracked vehicles (ATV) were in production. The articulated tracked concept is chosen primarily for its combination of high maneuverability, cross-country abilities, and load-carrying capacity. In some cases the design is made amphibious, giving them all-terrain capability in the truest sense. Usually, the front unit houses at least the engine, gearboxes, fuel tank(s) and the driver&#x27;s compartment, and perhaps there is some space left for cargo or passengers, whereas the rear unit is the primary load carrier.

Examples of this concept are the Russian Vityaz, Swedish Volvo Bv202 and Hagglunds Bv206 designs, and the Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier of Singapore.

A highly specialised development is the ARKTOS Craft, that uses a linkage with two joints to connect the two units and each unit having independent drive systems, giving enhanced mobility and redundancy. They are capable of climbing large ice steps from open water.

== Deep fording ==

Some military vehicles are capable of &quot;wading&quot; using waterproof screens to keep the upper hull dry. In World War II the tanks following the Sherman DDs were given waterproofed hulls and trunking was fixed to the engine intakes and exhausts to allow them to come ashore from landing craft in shallow water. The Germans gave their Tiger tank a long snorkel, essentially a long tube on the commander&#x27;s hatch that allowed it to wade through four metres of water.

The Leopard 2 tank can use a series of rings to create a long tube. This tube is then fitted to the crew commander&#x27;s hatch and provides air and an escape route for the crew. The height of the tube is limited to around three meters.

The Russian T-90 tank is also able to perform deep fording operations. The Russian snorkel is only a few inches around and does not provide a crew escape path, but it can be stored on the tank.

Some civilian deep wading vehicles achieve their capability by means of legs or stilts to raise the body of the vehicle from its wheels. One example is the sea tractor, a motor vehicle that can travel through shallow water, with driver and passengers on a raised platform. Another is the Brighton and Rottingdean Seashore Electric Railway, a coastline railway that ran on submerged rails through the shallow coastal waters of the English Channel between 1896 and 1901.

== Hovercraft ==

An air-cushion vehicle (ACV) or hovercraft can travel over land or water supported by a cushion of air ejected downwards against the surface below it. In principle, a hovercraft can travel over any sufficiently smooth surface: solid, liquid, mixed, or anything in between. Large hovercraft, riding on an air-cushion contained by skirts several meters tall, can deal with obstacles 1 to 2 meters in height. The smallest personal hovercraft are nimble enough to follow some rolling of the terrain.

One of the benefits of this type of amphibious craft is the possibility of making them largethe British-built SR.N4 Mk.3 ferries could carry dozens of vehicles. ACVs have a high speed over water (an SR.N4 Mk.1 could do 83 knots (95 mph or 154 km/h)) and can make the transition between land and water at speedunlike most wheeled or tracked amphibians. Drawbacks are high fuel consumption and noise levels.

For some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft. The hovercraft&#x27;s ability to distribute its laden weight evenly across the surface below it makes it well suited to the role of amphibious landing craft. The US Navy LCAC can take troops and materials (if necessary an M1 Abrams tank) from ship to shore and can access more than 70% of the world&#x27;s coastline, as opposed to conventional landing craft, which are only capable of landing along 17% of that coastline.

== In media ==
The BBC television series &quot;Top Gear&quot; has, on several occasions, used amphibious vehicles as the basis for challenges. In S08E03, Clarkson, Hammond and May competed to see who could build the best amphibious car, starting with a used vehicle of their choice. Clarkson used a Toyota Hilux, which he nicknamed the &quot;Toybota&quot;, and powered it with a large outboard motor. Hammond used a Volkswagen Vanagon, which he combined with a boat hull to build a drivable cabin cruiser called the &quot;Dampervan&quot;. May started with a Triumph Herald and fitted it with a sail. During the challenge, which was to drive across a reservoir, the Toybota made it almost all the way to the end before capsizing, the Dampervan immediately sank, and the Triumph was the only vehicle to complete the trip, although it took a very long time to do so.

The show returned to the concept in S10E02, when the presenters built updated versions of their designs with lessons learned from the first time. Clarkson built his &quot;Nissank&quot; out of a Nissan Hardbody, the overall design being very similar to the Toybota, but now with oil drums as stabilizers. Hammond built a near-identical Dampervan, which had many of the same problems as its predecessor. May used the same actual vehicle as before, with only minor improvements (including a retractable daggerboard). The challenge was to drive the cars across the English Channel. Hammond&#x27;s vessel sank shortly after departing, and May&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t depart due to bad winds, and as such all three presenters ended up making the trip aboard Clarkson&#x27;s vehicle. Along the way, they attempted to beat Richard Branson&#x27;s world record for crossing the channel in an amphibious vehicle, but failed. The pickup truck successfully crossed the channel and landed in France, although they ended up in Sangatte instead of Calais, their intended destination.

&quot;Top Gear USA&quot; featured a very similar challenge in S04E06. Their vehicles were a Volkswagen Golf, which Rutledge Wood combined with a Sea Ray boat; a Jeep Wrangler YJ, which Adam Ferrara turned into an airboat; and a Plymouth Conquest, which Tanner Foust turned into a speedboat called the &quot;Turboat&quot;. In the initial tests, the VW had issues on both water and land, the Jeep worked well on water but not on land (the airboat motor left him stranded on the highway), and the Turboat performed well on land but sank immediately in the water. The Jeep sank as well after Foust and Ferrara got into an impromptu sea battle. All three presenters then attempted to cross Lake Ontario in the VW. Foust abandoned the trip halfway through, being picked up by a friend&#x27;s yacht. Wood and Ferrara made it to the Canadian border, but were turned away because they did not bring passports.

<doc id="156483" wikidata="Q688015" url="?curid=156483" title="Wyrd">
<text>Wyrd is a concept in Anglo-Saxon culture roughly corresponding to fate or personal destiny. The word is ancestral to Modern English &quot;weird&quot;, whose meaning has drifted towards an adjectival use with a more general sense of &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;uncanny&quot;, or simply &quot;unexpected&quot;.

The cognate term to &quot;wyrd&quot; in Old Norse is , with a similar meaning, but also personified as a deity: Urðr (anglicized as ), one of the Norns in Norse mythology. The word also appears in the name of the well where the Norns meet, Urðarbrunnr.

==Etymology==

The Old English term derives from a Proto-Germanic term . &quot;Wyrd&quot; has cognates in Old Saxon , Old High German , Old Norse , Dutch (to become), and German . The Proto-Indo-European root is meaning &#x27;to twist&#x27;, which is related to Latin &quot;vertere&quot; &#x27;turning, rotating&#x27;, and in Proto-Germanic is with a meaning &#x27;to come to pass, to become, to be due&#x27;. The same root is also found in , with the notion of &#x27;origin&#x27; or &#x27;worth&#x27; both in the sense of &#x27;connotation, price, value&#x27; and &#x27;affiliation, identity, esteem, honour and dignity&#x27;.

 is a noun formed from the Old English verb , meaning &#x27;to come to pass, to become&#x27;. Adjectival use of wyrd developed in the 15th century, in the sense &#x27;having the power to control destiny&#x27;, originally in the name of the &quot;Weird Sisters&quot;, i.e. the classical Fates, who in the Elizabethan period were detached from their classical background and given an English personification as &quot;fays&quot;.

The weird sisters notably appear as the Three Witches in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. To elucidate this, many editors of the play include a footnote associating the &quot;Weird Sisters&quot; with the Old English word or &#x27;fate&#x27;. 

The modern English usage actually developed from Scots, in which beginning in the 14th century, &quot;to weird&quot; was used as a verb with the sense of &#x27;to preordain by decree of fate&#x27;. This use then gave rise to the early nineteenth century adjective meaning &#x27;unearthly&#x27;, which then developed into modern English &quot;weird&quot;.

The modern spelling &quot;weird&quot; first appeared in Scottish and Northern English dialects in the 16th century and was taken up in standard literary English starting in the 17th century. The regular form ought to have been &quot;wird&quot;, from Early Modern English &quot;werd&quot;. The replacement of &quot;werd&quot; by &quot;weird&quot; in the northern dialects is &quot;difficult to account for&quot;.

The most common modern meaning of &quot;weird&quot;&#x27;odd, strange&#x27;is first attested in 1815, originally with a connotation of the supernatural or portentous (especially in the collocation &quot;weird and wonderful&quot;), but by the early 20th century increasingly applied to everyday situations.

==Fate in Germanic mythology==

According to J. Duncan Spaeth, &quot;Wyrd (Norse Urd, one of the three Norns) is the Old English goddess of Fate, whom even Christianity could not entirely displace.&quot;

 is a feminine noun, and its Norse cognate , besides meaning &#x27;fate&#x27;, is the name of one of the deities known as Norns. For this reason, has been interpreted by some scholars as a pre-Christian goddess of fate. Other scholars deny a pagan signification of in the Old English period, but allow that may have been a deity in the pre-Christian period. In particular, some scholars argue that the three Norns are a late influence from the three Moirai in Greek and Roman mythology, who are goddesses of fate.

The names of the Norns are Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld. means &#x27;that which has come to pass&#x27;, means &quot;that which is in the process of happening&quot; (it is the present participle of the verb cognate to ), and means &#x27;debt&#x27; or &#x27;guilt&#x27; (from a Germanic root &#x27;to owe&#x27;, also found in English &quot;should&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;).

Between themselves, the Norns weave fate or (from &#x27;out, from, beyond&#x27; and &#x27;law&#x27;, and may be interpreted literally as &#x27;beyond law&#x27;). According to &quot;Voluspa&quot; 20, the three Norns &quot;set up the laws&quot;, &quot;decided on the lives of the children of time&quot; and &quot;promulgate their &quot;. Frigg, on the other hand, while she &quot;knows all ørlǫg&quot;, &quot;says it not herself&quot; (&quot;Lokasenna&quot; 30). Lawless that is &quot;&quot; occurs in &quot;Voluspa&quot; 17 in reference to driftwood, that is given breath, warmth and spirit by three gods, to create the first humans, Ask and Embla (&#x27;Ash&#x27; and possibly &#x27;Elm&#x27; or &#x27;Vine&#x27;).

Mentions of in Old English literature include &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Fate remains wholly inexorable&#x27;) and &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Fate goes ever as she shall!&#x27;). In &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, is irrepressible and relentless. She or it &quot;snatches the earls away from the joys of life,&quot; and &quot;the wearied mind of man cannot withstand her&quot; for her decrees &quot;change all the world beneath the heavens&quot;.

==Other uses==

The Wyrd Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after an &quot;Anglo-Saxon weaving goddess&quot;. Frank Herbert used the word &quot;weird&quot; in his science-fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; to connote power, e.g. a martial art is referred to as &quot;the Weirding Way&quot;, which takes place at the speed of thought. This was modified by director David Lynch, in his 1984 film version of the book, to become a system of sonic weapons called &quot;weirding modules.&quot;

<text>:Ireland is an island in Northern Europe in the north Atlantic Ocean. The island, of up to around north-south, and east-west, lies near the western edge of the European continental shelf, part of the Eurasian Plate. Its main geographical features include low central plains surrounded by coastal mountains. The highest peak is Carrauntoohil (), which is above sea level. The western coastline is rugged, with many islands, peninsulas, headlands and bays, while the southern and northern coasts feature a smaller number of substantial sea inlets, such as Lough Foyle and Cork Harbour; no part of the land is more than around from the sea. It was administratively divided into 32 counties, gathered in 4 provinces, though current arrangements, especially in Northern Ireland, differ from this model. The island is almost bisected by the River Shannon, which at with a estuary is the longest river in Ireland and flows south from County Cavan in the province of Ulster to form the boundary between Connacht and Leinster, and later Munster, and meet the Atlantic just south and west of Limerick. There are a number of sizeable lakes along Ireland&#x27;s rivers, of which Lough Neagh is the largest.

Politically, the island consists of the Republic of Ireland, with jurisdiction over about five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a constituent part of the United Kingdom, with jurisdiction over the remaining sixth. Located west of the island of Great Britain, Ireland lies at approximately . It has a total area of and is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea, bounded to the north and south respectively by the North Channel and St George&#x27;s Channel, and from mainland Europe by the Celtic Sea. Ireland forms the second largest landmass in the British Isles, together with Great Britain and the Isle of Man.

The island has a temperate oceanic climate, mild and humid, and is warmer than other landmasses at the same latitude due to its position vis-a-vis the winds on the Atlantic Ocean, and ocean currents and circulations. The island is one of the least forested areas in Europe, though afforestation is growing, but has a strong agricultural sector. It has a limited range of mineral resources, and has only had two major gas finds, and none in the oil sector. Hydroelectric energy is actively used, and wind farms are extending; neither solar nor tidal energy is as yet much exploited.

==Geological development==
The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks belonging to different geological periods, dating back almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on Inishtrahull Island off the north coast of Inishowen and on the mainland at Annagh Head on the Mullet Peninsula. The newer formations are the drumlins and glacial valleys as a result of the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.

Ireland&#x27;s geological history includes a wide range of elements, from volcanism and tropical seas to the last glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts, which slowly joined, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics and the effect of ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country, the rocks which formed can be seen as a result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. The variation between the two areas, along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas, led to a range of soils. There are extensive bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.

Most of Ireland was probably above sea level during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and weathering on land. Protracted erosion also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There has been some controversy regarding the origin of the planation surfaces found in Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation, others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene may have made Ireland&#x27;s western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today&#x27;s glacier-smoothened landscapes.

==Physical geography==

===Mountain ranges===

Ireland consists of a mostly flat low-lying area in what are known as the Midlands. It is ringed by mountain ranges such as—beginning in County Cork and working clockwise—the Boggeragh Mountains, Derrynasaggart Mountains, Caha Mountains, MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, Slieve Mish Mountains, Mullaghareirk Mountains, the Twelve Bens/Maumturks group, Nephinbeg Mountains, Ox Mountains, Bluestack Mountains, Derryveagh Mountains, Sperrin Mountains, the Mournes, Wicklow Mountains, Blackstairs Mountains, Comeragh Mountains and Knockmealdown Mountains. Some mountain ranges are further inland in the south of Ireland, such as the Galtee Mountains (the highest inland range), Silvermine and Slieve Bloom Mountains. There is an area of raised land near the northeastern coast, the Antrim Plateau, which contains the Glens of Antrim; this area is sometimes called the Mountains of Antrim. The highest peak Carrauntoohil, at high, is in the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains. Only three peaks on the island are over and another 457 exceed . There are a number of walking trails in the mountains, with the longest being that through the Wicklow Mountains. In the Mourne Mountains, with multiple walking trails, a wall was built between the 13 major peaks, the Mourne Wall.

Ireland is sometimes known as the &quot;Emerald Isle&quot; because of its green landscape.

===Rivers and lakes===
Waterbodies accounted for around 2% of the land area of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland are over of rivers and streams, more than of lake and over of reservoirs; these are not evenly distributed—over 30% of the watercourse length is found in Counties Cork, Donegal and Mayo, while Counties Mayo and Galway hold over 40% of the total lake area. Almost all of the reservoir area lies in just two counties, Wicklow (2/3) and Cork (1/3). In Northern Ireland, Lough Neagh is by far the leading source of water.

The River Shannon, at in length, is the longest river in Ireland and Britain. With a drainage area of , the Shannon River Basin covers one-fifth of the island. The Shannon crosses 11 counties and divides the west of Ireland from the south and east. The river develops into three large lakes along its course, Lough Allen, Lough Ree, and Lough Derg. The River Shannon enters the Atlantic Ocean at Limerick city along the Shannon Estuary.

Other major rivers include the River Liffey and its leading tributary, the River Dodder, and the nearby Tolka River, River Slaney, the Three Sisters (the Rivers Nore, Suir and Barrow), River Lee, River Erne, Foyle River, River Bann, River Lagan, and River Boyne. There are also multiple River Blackwaters, the most significant being the Munster Blackwater. The river with the greatest output volume is the Shannon but the second-greatest volume is in the short but powerful River Corrib.

Lough Neagh, in Ulster, is the largest lake in Ireland and Britain with an area of . The largest lake in the Republic of Ireland is Lough Corrib . Other large lakes, besides the three major Shannon examples, include the two linked lakes known as Lough Erne, Lough Mask and Lough Corrib, and Lough Conn.

===Inlets===


In County Donegal, Lough Swilly separates the western side of the Inishowen peninsula from the wider county. Lough Foyle on the other side, is one of Ireland&#x27;s larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry. Clockwise round the coast is Belfast Lough, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is Strangford Lough, actually an inlet partially separating the Ards peninsula from the mainland. Further south, Carlingford Lough is situated between Down and County Louth.

Dublin Bay is the next sizeable inlet. The east coast of Ireland has no major inlets until Wexford Harbour at the mouth of the River Slaney. On the south coast, Waterford Harbour is situated at the mouth of the River Suir, into which the other two of the Three Sisters (the Rivers Nore and Barrow) flow. The next major inlet is Cork Harbour, at the mouth of the River Lee, in which Great Island is situated.

Dunmanus Bay, Kenmare estuary and Dingle Bay are all inlets between the peninsulas of western County Cork and County Kerry. North of these is the Shannon Estuary. Between north County Clare and County Galway is Galway Bay. Clew Bay is located on the coast of County Mayo, south of Achill Island, while Broadhaven Bay, Blacksod Bay and Sruth Fada Conn bays are situated in northwest Connacht, in North Mayo. Killala Bay is on the northeast coast of Mayo. Donegal Bay is a major inlet between County Donegal and County Sligo.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were of tidal flats in Ireland, making it the 43rd-ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

===Headlands===
Malin Head is the most northerly point in Ireland, while Mizen Head is one of the most southern points, hence the term &quot;from Malin to Mizen&quot; (or the reverse) is used for anything applying to the island of Ireland as a whole. Carnsore Point is another extreme point of Ireland, being its southeasternmost point. Hook Head and the Old Head of Kinsale are two of many headlands along the south coast. Loop Head is the headland at which County Clare comes to a point on the west coast of Ireland, with the Atlantic on the north, and the Shannon estuary to the south. Hag&#x27;s Head is another headland further up Clare&#x27;s north/western coastline, with the Cliffs of Moher along the coastline north of the point.

===Islands and peninsulas===
Achill Island, off the west coast, is the largest of Ireland&#x27;s offshore islands. Achill is inhabited, and is permanently connected to the mainland by a bridge. Some of the next largest islands are the Aran Islands, off the coast of southern Connacht, host to an Irish-speaking community, or Gaeltacht. Valentia Island off the Iveragh peninsula is also one of Ireland&#x27;s larger islands, and is relatively settled, as well as being connected by a bridge at its southeastern end. Omey Island, off the coast of Connemara, is a tidal island.

Some of the best-known peninsulas in Ireland are in Counties Cork and Kerry: the Dingle peninsula, the Iveragh peninsula and the Beara peninsula. Other promontories outside the southwest include the Fanad (Fannet Head), Mullet Peninsula, the Old Head of Kinsale, Hook Head, Howth Head and the Cooley Peninsula. The Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal includes Ireland&#x27;s most northerly point, Malin Head, and several towns, including Buncrana on Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on Lough Foyle.

Ireland&#x27;s most northerly undisputed land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. Rockall Island lies farther north but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. The most southerly point is the Fastnet Rock.

The Hebrides off Scotland and Anglesey off Wales were grouped with Ireland (&quot;Hibernia&quot;) by the Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy.
===Forests===
Ireland, like the neighbouring Great Britain, was once covered in forest. Clearing of forests began in the Neolithic Age and accelerated following the Tudor Conquest, resulting in forest cover of only 1% by the start of the twentieth century. As of 2017, total tree cover in the Republic of Ireland stood at 11% of land area but the figure for native forest stood at just 2% in 2018, the third lowest in Europe, behind Iceland and Malta. Of the 172 countries assessed, Ireland has the sixth most degraded forest landscape in the world.

===Marina geography===
The coastline of Ireland is long. As the continental shelf extends far to the west and southwest, the larger of the two jurisdictions on the island has extensive seabed claims, exceeding , more than 10 times the land area.

==Climate==
The climate of Ireland is mild, humid and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Ireland&#x27;s climate is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or &quot;Cfb&quot; on the Köppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. The country receives generally warm summers and mild winters. It is considerably warmer than other areas at the same latitude on the other side of the Atlantic, such as in Newfoundland, because it lies downwind of the Atlantic Ocean, and is also warmer than maritime climates near the same latitude, such as the Pacific Northwest, as a result of heat released by the Atlantic overturning circulation that includes the North Atlantic Current and Gulf Stream. For comparison, Dublin is 9 °C warmer than St. John&#x27;s in Newfoundland in winter.

The influence of the North Atlantic Current also ensures the coastline of Ireland remains ice-free throughout the winter. The climate in Ireland does not experience extreme weather, with tornadoes and similar weather features being rare. However, Ireland is prone to eastward moving cyclones which come in from the North Atlantic.

The prevailing wind comes from the southwest, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast. Rainfall is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with Valentia Island, off the west coast of County Kerry, getting over twice as much annual rainfall as Dublin on the east ( vs. ).

The overall mean temperature (measured 1990–2020) is . January and February are the coldest months of the year, with mean daily air temperatures of during these months. July and August are the warmest, with mean daily temperatures of , whilst mean daily maximums in July and August are , lower near the coast, higher inland. The sunniest months are May and June, with an average of five to seven hours sunshine per day.

Though extreme weather events in Ireland are comparatively rare when compared with other countries in the European Continent, they do occur. Atlantic depressions, occurring mainly in the months of December, January and February, can occasionally bring winds of up to to Western coastal counties; while the summer months, and particularly around late July/early August, thunderstorms can develop.

The tables below show mean 30-year climate averages for Ireland&#x27;s two largest cities, taken from the weather stations at Dublin Airport and Belfast International Airport respectively. The state metrological service for the Republic of Ireland is Met Éireann, while the Met Office monitors climate data for Northern Ireland.

==Political and human geography==
Ireland is divided into four provinces—Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster—and 32 counties. Six of the nine Ulster counties form Northern Ireland and the other 26 form the state, Ireland. The map shows all 32 counties.

From an administrative viewpoint, 23 of the counties in the Republic of Ireland are local government areas. Three contain more than one local government areas: the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names, and the remaining part of County Dublin is divided into Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin. There are therefore a total of 31 local authorities.

County Tipperary had two ridings, North Tipperary and South Tipperary, originally established in 1838, renamed in 2001 and amalgamated in 2014. The cities of Limerick and Waterford were merged with their respective county councils in 2014 to form new city and county councils.

In making its recommendations on changes to Dáil constituencies, the Electoral Commission is required to avoid breaching county boundaries as far as practicable.

In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) by 26 single-tier districts, which, apart from Fermanagh, cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as Lieutenancy. In November 2005, proposals were announced which would see the number of local authorities reduced to seven.
The island&#x27;s total population was nearly 7 million people concentrated in the east and south, particularly in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and their surrounding areas in the 2011 (RoI) and 2012 (NI) Census. That figure had increased to 7,054,314 in the 2012 (NI) and 2022 (RoI) census.

==Natural resources==

===Fens and bogs===

Ireland has 12,000 km2 (about 4,600 sq miles) of bog land, consisting of two distinct types: blanket bogs and raised bogs. There is also a modest amount of surviving fen, a related landform.

Raised bogs, most commonly found in the Shannon basin, are scarcer than blanket bogs. They formed when depressions left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer of at the bottom of the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.

Blanket bogs are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate, having formed on sites where Neolithic farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment for the growth of heather and rushes. The debris from these plants accumulated and a layer of peat formed. One of the largest expanses of Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland is to be found in County Mayo.

====Usage and concerns====
Since the 17th century, peat has been cut for fuel for domestic heating and cooking, and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale harvesting became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used in a number of industries, producing peat briquettes for domestic fuel and milled peat for electricity generation. More recently peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.

In recent years, the destruction of bogs has raised environmental concerns. The issue is particularly acute for raised bogs which were more widely mined as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.

===Oil, natural gas and minerals===

Ireland is the largest European producer of zinc, with one zinc-lead mine currently in operation at Tara, which is Europe&#x27;s largest and deepest active mine. Other mineral deposits with actual or potential commercial value include gold, silver, gypsum, talc, calcite, dolomite, roofing slate, limestone aggregate, building stone, sand, and gravel.

====Hydrocarbons====
Offshore exploration for natural gas began in 1970. The first major discovery was the Kinsale Head gas field in 1971. Next were the smaller Ballycotton gas field in 1989, and the Corrib gas field in 1996. Gas from these fields is pumped ashore and used for both domestic and industrial purposes. The Helvick oil field, estimated to contain over of oil, was discovered in 2000, and Barryroe, estimated to contain 1.6 billion barrels (250,000,000 m3) of oil, was discovered in 2012, although neither have been exploited. 
In May 2007 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (now replaced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources) reported that there may be volumes over of petroleum and of natural gas in Irish waters – worth trillions of Euro, if true. The minimum confirmed amount of oil in the Irish Atlantic waters is , worth over €450 billion. There are also areas of petroleum and natural gas on shore, for example the Lough Allen basin, with of gas and of oil, valued at €74.4 billion. Already some fields are being exploited, such as the Spanish Point field, with of gas and of oil, valued at €19.6 billion. The Corrib Basin is also quite large, worth anything up to €87 billion, while the Dunquin gas field, initially estimated to have of natural gas and of petroleum but 2012 revised estimates suggest only of natural gas and of oil condensate.

In March 2012, the first commercial oil well was drilled off the Cork coast by Providence Resources, renamed Barryroe Offshore. At the time, Providence&#x27;s executive Tony O&#x27;Reilly Jr. said, &quot;It&#x27;s a defining moment for the Irish offshore oil and gas industry.&quot; The Barryroe oil well was yielding 3,500 barrels per day in exploratory drilling; at oil prices of $120 a barrel, Barryroe oil well was worth in excess of €2.14bn annually in 2012. However, in 2023, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications declined approval of the &quot;Lease Undertaking&quot; that would be necessary to finish appraisal drilling, and Barryroe Offshore Energy will now wind down their business by a voluntary liquidation so the field may not be developed. Legal action may be taken by investors against the Irish government including the minor 20% investor Lansdowne Oil &amp; Gas.

===Renewable energy===
Under the original 2009 Renewable Energy Directive the Republic of Ireland had set a target of producing 16% of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020 but in 2018 the second Renewable Energy Directive increased the target to 32% by 2030. Between 2005 and 2014 the percentage of energy from renewable energy sources grew from just 3.1% to 8.6% of total final consumption. By 2020 the overall renewable energy share was 13.5%, short of its Renewable Energy Drive target of 16%. Renewable electricity accounted for 69% of all renewable energy used in 2020, up from two thirds (66.8%) in 2019.

====Wind====
While hydro generated power contributed most to Ireland&#x27;s renewable energy during the 20th century, so far in the 21st century there has been a significant increase in the production of energy by wind spurred by climate change concerns.

Bellacorick wind farm, built by Bord na Móna in 1992, was the first Irish wind farm with an individual turbine capacity of 0.3MW which compared with the current capacity of 4–5MW means that when turbines age out, replacements will produce significantly more power per installation. the Republic of Ireland had more than 300 wind farms but the number will have to double by 2030 if the current 40% of renewable energy is to double. Most of the energy will have to come from inshore wind farms because the sole offshore wind farm, Arklow Bank Wind Park, only produces 0.6% of the nation&#x27;s total wind energy. The 80% target is an ambitious aspect of the Climate Action Plan some impediments, such as planning permission and the age of existing wind farms, may hinder this aspiration.

A floating 400MW wind farm off the coast of Northern Ireland was proposed for the North Channel in 2022 to be operating by 2029. Another northern project, opened in October 2023, was set up under a corporate power purchase agreement in which Amazon, who backed the project, will be the off-taker of all the power produced by the 16-MW Ballykeel 7-turbine wind farm in County Antrim.

In November 2023, EDF Renewables announced their Carrowkeel Wind Farm which will be a 30MW project for County Roscommon for completion in 2028 which should power more than 20,000 homes.

====Solar energy====
As of the 2020 Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report &quot;Energy in Ireland&quot;, solar energy was only contributing 1% of renewable energy. Opposition to the visual impact of solar farms, and other forms of renewable energy, was noted as hindering some projects. DIT School of Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering&#x27;s Professor Barry McMullin suggests that: &quot;So while it&#x27;s the cheapest form of electricity you can get that&#x27;s only true if your demand for it happens to match when it&#x27;s available. But if what you actually want is electricity on tap, then solar PV doesn&#x27;t give you that&quot;.

Solar energy for about 3,600 homes has been in production with 33,600 solar modules installed on 25 hectares near Ashford, County Wicklow since April 2022. It is the first such venture at scale in the Republic of Ireland, with a capacity of 8MW. A forecast from ESB Networks suggests that by the end of 2023, the country will be producing 1GW. This is up from the 700MW being produced in mid-summer from 60,000 micro-generation customers, adding to the 371MWs of utility-scale installations. 2013 saw a new 50 million Euro solar panel scheme specially for schools in eleven counties of the Republic, that should save typical schools between €1,200 to €1,600 per year. Connected to the grid, the up-to 6 kilowatt installation will be most efficient when the schools are not in use.

The first ground-based solar farm on the island is situated in the townland of Crookedstone, County Antrim, and is connected to Belfast International Airport, providing 27% of the airport&#x27;s annual energy needs. This wind farm was built by Lightsource and BP bought full control of the company in November 2023 having first invested in the company in 2017.

====Hydroelectric power====

The first Shannon hydroelectric scheme was constructed in 1929 within seven years of independence. Built by Siemens-Schuckert with Irish engineers doing much of the design and using mostly Irish labour, it has an 86MW capacity and has an annual generation capacity of 332GWh. This was followed up by the much larger Turlough Hill Power Station, the only pumped-storage built into a mountain with a capacity of 292MW. It was completed in 1974 after 6 years of construction. A few other smaller hydroelectric stations exist around the Republic of Ireland, such as Pollaphuca and Inniscarra Dam. Catherine Halpin, Ardnacrusha&#x27;s plant manager, suggests the four main hydro plants are availing of about 70% of the country&#x27;s water resources.

A tidal energy system is in operation since 2008 in Strangford Lough producing 1.2MW using an underwater windmill, whose rotors at driven by the tidal currents. The power is bought for ESB Independent&#x27;s Republic and Northern Ireland consumers. The system has a capacity to produce enough electricity for about 1,000 homes. Also in Northern Ireland, an Evopod tidal energy system has been tested and connected to the Marine Laboratory of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast that should be connected to the electric grid.

<text>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the fifth and longest novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. It follows Harry Potter&#x27;s struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic in the United States, and Raincoast in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; won several awards, including the American Library Association Best Book Award for Young Adults in 2003. The book was also made into a 2007 film, and a video game by Electronic Arts.

==Plot==
During the summer, Harry is frustrated by the lack of communication from his friends and by Dumbledore&#x27;s refusal to let him help in the struggle against Lord Voldemort. One evening, Dementors attack him and his cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive at the Dursley residence and take Harry to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Number 12 is Sirius Black&#x27;s family home and the headquarters of the Order, which is a secret organisation founded by Dumbledore to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry wants to join the Order, but is too young. 

Under the leadership of Cornelius Fudge, the Ministry of Magic is waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, claiming they are lying about the return of Voldemort. Harry faces legal charges for the Patronus Charm he performed, but is exonerated and returns to Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. She implements a textbook-only curriculum and forbids the students from practicing defensive spells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a secret student group called Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, which meets in the Room of Requirement to practice defensive magic under Harry&#x27;s instruction.

One night, Harry dreams that Arthur Weasley is attacked by Voldemort&#x27;s snake, Nagini. The attack actually occurred, and Dumbledore realises that Harry&#x27;s mind is connected to Voldemort. He orders Professor Snape to teach Harry Occlumency to keep Voldemort out of his mind. When Umbridge discovers Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, Dumbledore saves Harry from expulsion by claiming he formed the group. To avoid arrest, he goes into hiding. Umbridge is appointed headmistress and begins enacting strict rules and regulations.

During exams, Harry has a vision of Voldemort torturing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries. He attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, but Umbridge catches and interrogates him. Hermione intervenes and convinces Umbridge to go with her and Harry into the Forbidden Forest. When Umbridge provokes the centaurs who live there, they take her captive. Harry and his friends fly to the Ministry to rescue Sirius, but he is not there. Instead, they find shelves containing glass spheres, one of which bears Harry&#x27;s name. Harry picks it up and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy reveals that Harry was lured to the Ministry by a false vision from Voldemort, who wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses to give it to him. 

The students fight the Death Eaters with help from several Order of the Phoenix members. Neville accidentally knocks the sphere down some steps, destroying it. Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius by knocking him through a mysterious stone archway. Voldemort appears and tries to kill Harry, but Dumbledore arrives and thwarts him. Fudge and other Ministry of Magic employees arrive on the scene and witness Voldemort just before he flees. Back at Hogwarts, Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy was made by Professor Trelawney, who predicted the birth of a child with the power to vanquish Voldemort. This prophecy caused Voldemort to murder Harry&#x27;s parents, and it is why he wishes to kill Harry as well. Harry feels overwhelmed by the prophecy and the loss of Sirius, but the wizarding community now believes him and respects him. Motivated by his friends, Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer..

==Publication and release==
&quot;Potter&quot; fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books. Before the release of the fifth book, 200 million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55 languages in 200 countries. As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003 to secure copies at midnight. Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.

<text>Trinity College (occasionally referred to as The University of Trinity College) is a federated college of the University of Toronto. The college was founded in 1851 by Bishop John Strachan. Strachan originally intended Trinity as a university of strong Anglican alignment, after the University of Toronto severed its ties with the Church of England. After five decades as an independent institution, Trinity joined the university in 1904 as a member of its collegiate federation.

Today, Trinity College consists of a secular undergraduate section and a postgraduate divinity school which is part of the Toronto School of Theology. Through its diploma granting authority in the field of divinity, Trinity maintains legal university status. Trinity hosts three of the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Sciences&#x27; undergraduate programs: international relations; ethics, society and law; and immunology.

More than half of Trinity students graduate from the University of Toronto with distinction or high distinction. The college has produced 43 Rhodes Scholars as of 2020. Among the college&#x27;s more notable collections are a seventeenth-century Flemish tapestry, two first-edition theses by Martin Luther, numerous original, signed works by Winston Churchill, a 1491 edition of Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy censored by the Spanish Inquisition, and Bishop Strachan&#x27;s silver epergne.

Among the University of Toronto Colleges, Trinity is notable for being the smallest by population, and for its trappings of Oxbridge heritage. Trinity manages its student government through direct democracy, and hosts a litany of clubs and societies.

==History==
===Founding===

The Reverend John Strachan (1778–1867) was an Anglican priest, Archdeacon of York, and staunch supporter of Upper Canada&#x27;s conservative Family Compact. Strachan was interested in education, and as early as 1818 petitioned the colonial House of Assembly for the formation of a theological university. In 1826, Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland commissioned Strachan to visit England and obtain a royal charter for a provincial university. Strachan was successful, and returned in 1827 with a charter from King George IV to establish King&#x27;s College in Upper Canada. King&#x27;s College was effectively controlled by the Church of England and members of the elite Family Compact, and at first reflected Strachan&#x27;s ambition for an institution of conservative, High Anglican character. Strachan objected to proposals for the provincial university to be without a religious affiliation, dubbing such a suggestion &quot;atheistical, and so monstrous in its consequences that, if successfully carried out, it would destroy all that is pure and holy in morals and religion, and would lead to greater corruption than anything adopted during the madness of the French Revolution.&quot;

In 1849, over strong opposition from Strachan, Robert Baldwin&#x27;s Reformist government took control of the college and secularized it to become the University of Toronto. Incensed by this decision, Strachan immediately began raising funds for the creation of a new university. Strachan canvassed Great Britain and Upper Canada for donations, and although he fell short of his goal of £30,000, he received significant commitments from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Duke of Wellington, William Gladstone, and Oxford University. Despite Strachan&#x27;s public anti-Americanism, the project for a new Anglican university attracted substantial donations from a fundraising campaign in the United States by The Reverend William McMurray.

On April 30, 1851, now-Bishop Strachan led a parade of clergy, schoolboys, and prospective faculty from the Church of St George the Martyr to the site of the new Trinity College. There, Strachan delivered a speech repeating his condemnation of the &quot;destruction of King&#x27;s College as a Christian institution,&quot; and promised that Trinity would fulfil the role of a church university. The Provincial Parliament incorporated Trinity College as an independent university on August 2, 1851. The following year, Strachan, now in his 70s, obtained a Royal Charter for Trinity from Queen Victoria. The college opened to students on January 15, 1852. Most of the first class of students and faculty came from the Diocesan Theological Institute, an Anglican seminar in Cobourg also founded by Strachan in 1842, which dissolved itself in favour of Trinity. 

Unlike the University of Toronto, all of Trinity&#x27;s students and faculty were required to be members of the Anglican Church. This was actually a stronger condition than the original King&#x27;s College, which only held a religious test for faculty members and students of divinity. Applicants to Trinity&#x27;s Faculty of Arts were required to pass exams in biblical history, Latin, Greek, arithmetic, algebra, and Euclid. Applicants for the divinity school were required to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in arts, and to pass oral exams from the Provost in the New Testament, church catechism, Latin, and Greek.

At the opening of the college, Bishop Strachan used the metaphor of the family to describe Trinity. Per Strachan, Trinity would &quot;constitute a great Christian household, the domestic home of all who resort to it for instruction, framing them in the Christian graces, and in all sound learning, and sanctifying their knowledge, abilities and attainments to the service of God and the welfare of their fellow-men.&quot; The usage of the family metaphor was common at the time, and reflected a common view in Upper Canada that schools were extensions of the family model.

===Early years===
Designed by Kivas Tully, the original Trinity College building was constructed in 1851 on Queen Street West, in what was then an undeveloped western end outside the Toronto city bounds. The building featured Gothic Revival design, and was inspired by St. Aidan&#x27;s Theological College, Birkenhead.

Discipline in the early years was strict. All students were subject to a rigid curfew, and daily chapel attendance was mandatory. If a student wished to leave college grounds, they were required to wear a cap and gown. The college was deliberately built away from the temptations of the city proper. This was all part of Strachan&#x27;s plan to counteract the University of Toronto&#x27;s secularism through modelling his vision of conservative Anglican education. Strachan was supported in these efforts by George Whitaker, a clergyman from Cambridge University who served as Trinity&#x27;s divinity professor and first Provost. Strachan&#x27;s hatred of the secular university was so great that Trinity&#x27;s student athletes were forbidden to compete against students from the University of Toronto. It is not well known what the general student body thought of these rules, although there are records of students having cached their formal garb in the college ravine and clandestinely visiting town in informal clothes. Despite the rigid rules and church culture, beer consumption formed an important element of student life, and students purchased over 100 gallons of ale a year from a nearby brewery.

Bishop Benjamin Cronyn of Huron led an attack on the teaching of Trinity College in the early 1860s. Cronyn was an evangelical low church Anglican, who accused Provost Whitaker of spreading &quot;dangerous&quot; Romish doctrines. The College Corporation struck an investigatory committee to investigate Cronyn&#x27;s claims. After the committee published its findings, Provost Whitaker received votes of confidence from the corporation, the Synod of Toronto, the Synod of Ontario, and the House of Bishops. Bishop Cronyn responded by resigning from the corporation, withdrawing all connections between the Diocese of Huron and Trinity College, and founding Huron College (today affiliated with Western University). In 1877, Evangelical Anglicans affiliated with St. James Cathedral founded Wycliffe College as a low-church alternative to Trinity within Toronto.

Bishop Strachan died on November 1, 1867 (All Saints&#x27; Day). Provost Whitaker committed to maintaining Strachan&#x27;s vision for the university, and continued to run the institution in strict conformity with conservative church principles. While Whitaker slowly permitted new courses to be offered, Trinity&#x27;s core subjects remained theology, classics, and mathematics. Despite the urges of the College Council and some students, Whitaker steadfastly rejected federation with the University of Toronto. To Whitaker, the benefits of joining the larger, secular University were outweighed by the &quot;priceless benefits of such an education as can be given only on Christian principles, and under the hallowed shelter of the Church of Christ.&quot;

In 1879, Provost Whitaker lost a contentious election to become Bishop of Toronto. This was his third failure seeking the position, and after the loss he resolved to return to his home in England. Whitaker left in 1881, and in his place the College Council appointed the Reverend Charles Body, another clergyman from Cambridge. Body was thirty at the time of his appointment, and significantly reformed the curriculum and policies of Trinity College. Under Provost Body, religious entry-requirements were abolished for non-divinity students, and the first female students were admitted to study. The requirement to wear a cap and gown while leaving College grounds was dropped, although chapel attendance remained mandatory for both divinity and arts students. Body&#x27;s reforms succeeded in attracting new students, and within a decade enrollment more than doubled.

The original College building suffered from architectural defects. The building was cold in winter, and fireplaces filled the residence rooms with smoke. Until 1888, the college used coal for heating, which generated noxious fumes. Over time, additional wings were added to the college, such as a convocation hall added in 1877 in memory of John Strachan. A designated chapel was built in 1883; previously, chapel had been held in a room originally intended for the college&#x27;s library. Enrolment grew substantially under Provosts Body and Welch, such that in 1894 the college erected an east wing devoted entirely to student residences. 

Under Provost Body and his successor Edward Welch, Trinity College gradually expanded its teaching beyond arts and divinity. By the end of the 19th century Trinity offered degrees in a variety of disciplines, including medicine, law, music, pharmacy and dentistry. The connections between the professional faculties and the college proper were however somewhat tenuous, as students generally took classes elsewhere in Toronto, and only came to the Queen Street campus to write exams and accept degrees. Trinity was founded with a medical school run by six Toronto doctors, and the first lecture ever given at Trinity was on &quot;medical jurisprudence&quot;. However, the medical faculty dissolved itself in 1856 in protest of the religious entry requirements. Trinity Medical School re-founded itself in 1871, and taught students in a separate building in Toronto&#x27;s east end. The school (renamed Trinity Medical College in 1888) existed as an independent legal body in voluntary association with Trinity College. Trinity&#x27;s Faculty of Music started offering degrees in the 1880s, and offered examinations for degrees in London, England, and New York City, as well as Toronto.

In 1884, Helen Gregory enrolled as the first female student at Trinity College. Gregory graduated with three degrees, and later became a judge in the Vancouver Juvenile Court. St. Hilda&#x27;s College was created in 1888 as Trinity&#x27;s women&#x27;s residence. For the first six years of its existence, female students lived and took all their classes in St. Hilda&#x27;s. Under Provost Welch, co-education came to Trinity, and the two teaching staffs and sets of courses merged into one.

===Federation===
Federation with the University of Toronto was first suggested in 1868, when a financial crisis compelled the College Council to consider uniting with the university to stave off bankruptcy. Provost Body ultimately eschewed federation, favouring significant reforms to encourage applications. Body&#x27;s reforms were successful, and the college entered a strong financial position across his thirteen-year term. Body retired as Provost in 1894, and his successor Reverend Edward Welch arrived at the beginning of an economic depression. Under Provost Welch, enrollment declined steeply, and by the turn of the century Trinity had returned to financial crisis.

Provost Thomas C. S. Macklem succeeded Welch in 1900, and entered office in favour of federation with the University of Toronto. In a newspaper interview, Reverend Macklem declared that &quot;the time has come when neither the University of Toronto nor Trinity University can afford to stand aloof from one another any longer without sacrificing a great national ideal.&quot; Macklem was Trinity&#x27;s first Canadian-born Provost, and proved an ardent reformer, who quickly banned beer and hazing over the strong opposition of the student body. In 1901, the Provincial Legislature amended the University of Toronto Act to facilitate a possible federation with Trinity. Trinity celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1902, still an independent university, but undergoing negotiations with the University of Toronto on federation. To mark the occasion, Trinity conferred honorary degrees to Premier George William Ross, and renowned physician William Osler. The next year, after what Macklem described as a &quot;long-drawn and bitter&quot; series of debates, the College Corporation voted 121 to 73 in favour of federation with the University of Toronto. Opponents of federation sought a judicial injunction against the agreement, but were unsuccessful. The University of Toronto made a concession to allow Trinity to grant its own degrees in theology, which required the university to remove the restriction from its governing charter.
On October 1, 1904, Trinity became a member college of the University of Toronto and relinquished to the university its authority to grant degrees in subjects other than theology. At first, Trinity students were required to commute from the Queen Street residence to main University campus for classes, a distance of some three and a half kilometres. While Trinity had been intentionally built in a quiet environment away from the bustle of Toronto, the city had expanded, and the college was now located in a seedy outskirt. Trinity resolved to relocate closer to the main University campus, and so abandoned plans for a significant expansion at its Queen Street site. The college acquired its present property near Queen&#x27;s Park at the university grounds in 1913, but construction of the new college buildings, modeled after the original buildings by Kivas Tully, was not completed until 1925 due to World War I. Five hundred and forty-three Trinity students, staff, and alumni fought in the War, of whom fifty-six died and eighty-six were wounded.

Trinity College&#x27;s original campus became Trinity Bellwoods Park. The original building was torn down in the 1950s. Of the original campus, only the St. Hilda&#x27;s women&#x27;s residence and the entrance gates, constructed in 1904, remain standing.

===On Hoskin Avenue===
When Trinity College moved to its present site on Hoskin Avenue in 1925, there was no space for student residences. Not only had the financial pressure of the War delayed construction of the building, it also necessitated a significant scaling back of the design. While the college originally planned for a campus with two quadrangles, a chapel, and a convocation hall, finances only permitted the construction of the south wing by 1925. The building had no residence space, and so the college rented separate buildings on St. George Street for the male and female students. An increasingly large proportion of students chose not to stay on College residence, and the student culture began slowly to be influenced by the larger University.

To counteract the perceived diluting influence of the University of Toronto on Trinity culture, concerned students insisted on wearing College gowns and blazers around campus to classes. In 1949, some students proposed a ban on freshmen joining fraternities, but this was defeated on grounds of impeding on individualism. Trinity engaged in rivalries with nearby Colleges, starting with a series of violent raids from University College in the 1920s. Across the 1950s, Trinity entered into a fierce, yet good-natured rivalry with its immediate neighbour (and competing Anglican divinity school) Wycliffe College. This rivalry included reciprocal raids between the colleges, thefts of college artifacts, and one instance in November 1953 when Wycliffe students filled up Trinity&#x27;s entryway with bricks from the under-construction chapel.

In 1937, construction began on the new St. Hilda&#x27;s building, located on the east side of Devonshire Place, a short walk from the main Trinity building. Construction was swift, and female students moved in the next year. St. Hilda&#x27;s Cartwright Hall became the primary stage for dramatics at Trinity for the subsequent four decades. In 1941, the college added an east wing, allowing male students to move out of the temporary accommodations on St. George and onto the college grounds. The same year, the college added a west wing, complete with the Strachan Dining Hall and the Junior Common Room. This substantial expansion was funded by donations from Gerald Larkin of the Salada Tea Company. After the War, Larkin also funded the construction of the Trinity College chapel in 1953. Previously, the college had used Seeley Hall, located over the front entrance and originally intended as the library, as the chapel.

One thousand and eighteen Trinity students, staff, and alumni served in the Second World War. Sixty-six were killed, and thirty-seven wounded. Two were made Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, two Officers of the Order of Orange-Nassau, and two granted the Croix de Guerre. In 1940, one hundred and sixty pupils and fifteen teachers from St. Hilda&#x27;s School for Girls at Whitby in England were sent to Trinity to escape the German wartime bombings, where they were housed at St. Hilda&#x27;s College.

In 1961, Trinity College completed a new multi-purpose building to its north-west, named after benefactor Gerald Larkin. The Trinity College quadrangle was completed in 1963, when a completed north wing enclosed the land. In 1979, a theater was added to the Larkin Building, named after Provost George Ignatieff, which quickly replaced Cartwright Hall as the primary forum for student drama.

In January 1966, Trinity College hosted the &quot;Trinity College Conference on the Canadian Indian.&quot; The Conference included presentations from on and off-reserve indigenous persons, and is believed to be Canada&#x27;s first student-organized forum on indigenous issues.

George Ignatieff, Canada&#x27;s former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, NATO, and the United Nations, became Provost in 1972; he was Trinity&#x27;s first Provost without a theological background. Under Ignatieff, the college integrated its academic programming with the wider University of Toronto to an unprecedented degree. When Ignatieff came to office, the college was deeply in debt. While enrollment remained high, the college was suffering from the policies of the Provincial Government which denied public funds to religious institutions. Due to Trinity&#x27;s divinity school, it was therefore ineligible for government assistance. As Provost, Ignatieff relieved much of Trinity&#x27;s faculty, and in 1974 he signed a memorandum of understanding with the university&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Science, ending much of Trinity&#x27;s independent academics. Where previously Trinity students had taken many of their courses in College, thenceforth most courses were taken with students from other colleges under general University departments. Similarly, the Faculty of Divinity joined the Toronto School of Theology in 1978, granting its students access to courses at all the university&#x27;s theological colleges. One exception to this trend of academic integration was the international relations program, founded at the college in 1976.

===Recent years===
Trinity College suffered from a spate of negative media stories across the 1990s. In 1991 students began campaigning against Episkopon, a long-standing Trinity student society. Episkopon was founded in 1858 with the objective of providing &quot;gentle chastisement&quot; to errant members of college. By the 1980s, some students began accusing the society of singling out students for racist, sexist, and homophobic attacks. This campaign attracted considerable press, and a statement of support from Marion Boyd, Ontario&#x27;s Minister for the Status of Women. In fall 1991, an outspoken student critic of Episkopon was doused in a bucket of urine and feces in what was reported as an act of retribution. In 1992, the College Council voted to dissociate Trinity from Episkopon, denying it student funds, official status, and the use of college property.

In 1996, Trinity&#x27;s Dean of Divinity David Holeton resigned his position after admitting to multiple claims of sexual abuse. Three years later, newspapers reported that Episkopon had returned to holding events, now simply off Trinity grounds.

The turn of the century brought substantial changes to Trinity College. In 2005, Provost Margaret MacMillan, a famed historian and herself a Trinity graduate, ended the practice of gender-segregated residences. Whereas previously all women lived in St. Hilda&#x27;s College and all men in the main Trinity building, under MacMillan co-education came to both buildings, with individual floors being designated single-sex.

==Buildings and environs==
Trinity College is today located on Hoskin Avenue within the University of Toronto, directly north of Wycliffe College. The primary College grounds are bounded to the North by Varsity Stadium, and to the west by Devonshire House (owned by Trinity College but mostly leased to the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy). Directly to its east, the college overlooks Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, with the University of Toronto Faculty of Law on the opposite side of the ravine.

===Trinity proper===
====South wing====
The front wing of the main building (often referred to as &quot;Trinity Proper&quot;) was completed in 1925 by architectural firm Darling and Pearson, among whose other projects include the university&#x27;s Convocation Hall and Varsity Arena. The architects were required to faithfully preserve the familiar characteristics of the original Trinity College building in the design of the front wing, which is hence of predominantly Jacobethan architectural construction. This is particularly apparent in the characteristic roofline and stone towers of the building, while Tudor Revival styles are employed in the construction of the Angel&#x27;s Roost tower in the college&#x27;s west wing. Prominent faces are carved into the doorposts at the entrance to the college, the entrance to Strachan Hall, as well as the gate under the east wing&#x27;s Henderson Tower. The door from the entrance hall into the Trinity quadrangle is also carved with the signs of the zodiac, while figures of scholars adorn the hallway.

By 1941, immediately prior to the imposition of wartime restrictions on building materials, Trinity College had undertaken the construction of the eastern and western wings under Toronto architectural firm George &amp; Moorhouse. The western wing provides an academic wing containing many of the college&#x27;s public rooms and services, including Strachan Hall, while the eastern wing comprises expanded residence space for the burgeoning college.
====Dining hall====
The largest component of the western wing, as well as the central dining hall and social space for students residing at Trinity College, Strachan Hall was built in elaborate wood and stone with the intention of matching the aesthetics of the existing college. It is replete with decorations intended to extol the history and values of the college, with heraldric artist A. Scott Carter commissioned to execute paintings and carvings of the coats of arms belonging to founder John Strachan, Queen Victoria, St Hilda&#x27;s College, the Trinity Medical College, Provost Cosgrave, and Gerald Larkin. Adorning the walls of the Strachan Hall are portraits of the College Provosts, the founder John Strachan, and Sir John Beverley Robinson - Chief Justice of Upper Canada and the college&#x27;s first chancellor. The largest portraits, which hang from the north wall, are of Bishop Strachan and George Whitaker, the college&#x27;s first provost from 1852 to 1880. Hanging on the front wall prominently behind the High Table is a large medieval tapestry provenant of Gerald Larkin&#x27;s enthusiastic patronage, believed to have been woven in Flanders in the sixteenth century to depict the coming of the Queen of Sheba to the court of King Solomon.

====Junior Common Room====

Situated in the western wing not far from Strachan Hall, the Junior Common Room (JCR) is used extensively by Trinity College&#x27;s student organisations as a social and event space. It most prominently houses the Trinity College Literary Institute, whose coat of arms adorns the mantle. A portrait of C. Allan Ashley, professor of commerce at the University of Toronto, and a long-time resident of Trinity College, hangs to the left of the door.

====Chapel====

The Trinity College Chapel was built with funds donated by Gerald Larkin, head of the Salada Tea Company from 1922 to 1957. It was designed in the modified perpendicular Gothic style by renowned English architect Giles Gilbert Scott, who was also responsible for the Liverpool Cathedral and the ubiquitous red telephone boxes seen throughout Britain. The chapel extends to the reredos and is high at the vault bosses. Using only stone, brick, and cement, Italian stonemasons employed ancient building methods; the only steel in the construction is in the hidden girders supporting the slate roof, with the exterior walls being sandstone. The Chapel contains several architectural sculptures, including a tympanum by Emmanuel Hahn as well as a carved lintel and tympanum by Jacobine Jones, who also carved the wooden angels on the baptistry. The Lady Chapel&#x27;s altar was preserved from the original Queen Street location chapel, while the matching sedilia was donated by Robertson Davies&#x27; widow in his memory. 
In the chapel a memorial tablet in Indiana limestone designed by Allan George, with lettering and medallions by A. Scott Carter, is dedicated to the members of Trinity College who gave their lives in the First and Second World Wars. A number of bronze memorial plaques also honour alumni who died during the First World War. On the wall outside the entrance to the chapel, a memorial Triptych illuminated manuscript in three frames is an Honour Roll erected by Trinity College in 1942 dedicated to the approximately 1000 men and women of Trinity College who died while serving their country; Canadian artist Jack McNie completed the lettering by hand.

====Quadrangle====

The college&#x27;s northern wing was completed by architects Somerville, McMurrich and Oxley in 1963, thereby completely enclosing the college quadrangle.
The Trinity quadrangle has long been a focal point of student life at the college. The site is home to Shakespeare in the Quad, an annual tradition dated to 1949 famed for its of hosting of open-air Shakespeare performances and artistic exhibits. The quadrangle design features footpaths and patterns based on the Greek letter Chi, representing Christ, writ large and intricate flagstones. It was outfitted with a sundial until the quadrangle&#x27;s renovation in the summer of 2007.

===St. Hilda&#x27;s College===

St. Hilda&#x27;s College, the Trinity College&#x27;s second residential building and historically the college&#x27;s female counterpart, was constructed in 1938. Prior to its completion, the women of college resided in three converted homes on St. George Street. Architects George and Moorhouse had built St. Hilda&#x27;s College in the Georgian style popular at the time at the time, paying particular emphasis to the provision of domestic facilities and spaces to provide a &quot;home-like influence&quot; for young women then expected to adopt traditionally feminine roles and virtues. Originally envisioned as a complementary but separate institution, St. Hilda&#x27;s only briefly had its own classes, but it retained a separate administrative and social existence until the 21st century. In 2004 St. Hilda&#x27;s was converted into a mixed residential space inclusive of all students of the college. North and south wings were added later to the building, and in 2010 the college undertook the installation of a green roof.

===Library===

Trinity&#x27;s John W. Graham Library traces its origins to 1828, when John Strachan secured a collection of some four hundred books from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to stock the library of the fledgling King&#x27;s College. When Trinity moved to its present-day location on Hoskin Avenue, the library was initially housed in the basement of the main building. In 2000, the library moved into the east wing of the Devonshire House, a heritage building purpose-renovated for the library, alongside the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Also in 2000, Wycliffe College&#x27;s theological collection merged with the Trinity library, which was renamed after Toronto lawyer and Anglican churchman John W. Graham (also father of Canadian entrepreneur Ted Rogers).

Trinity&#x27;s library contains some 200,000 volumes, computing resources, and approximately 200 study spaces. The Library primarily serves Trinity&#x27;s undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts and Science and the graduate Divinity students and faculty of Trinity and Wycliffe Colleges, as well as the Munk School and Anglican Church communities. Subject strengths reflect Trinity&#x27;s academic programs and interests: international relations, ethics, English literature, philosophy, theology, Anglican church history, and biblical studies. All Trinity students also have access to the other libraries of the University of Toronto Libraries system.

The Trinity College Friends of the Library promotes the expansion and well-being of the Graham Library. Each year, the Friends put on a book sale in Trinity&#x27;s Seeley Hall. The book sale attracts visitors from across the continent, and is considered one of Toronto&#x27;s best. The book sale routinely raises over $100,000 for the Library.

===Gerald Larkin Building===

The Gerald Larkin Building opened in 1962, while the George Ignatieff Theatre, named for then-provost George Ignatieff, was added to the northwest corner of the Larkin Building in 1979. The Larkin Building is home to the university&#x27;s Center for Ethics, as well as several classrooms and offices. The ground floor is dominated by &quot;The Buttery,&quot; a cafe and student lounge space. In the basement, there is an abandoned, yet perfectly preserved language lab from the 1960s.

Gerald Larkin was President of the Salada Tea Company, and one of Trinity&#x27;s most generous benefactors. The college&#x27;s dining hall and chapel were made possible through his donations. Larkin bequeathed Trinity almost $4 million in his will, which the college used to construct the building bearing his name.

=== Lawson Centre For Sustainability ===
In 2018, Trinity College announced construction of a new building, the Lawson Centre for Sustainability. When complete, the building will house 342 new residence beds, seminar and lecture rooms, and a new dining facility.

==Academics==
Trinity consists of an undergraduate division that is part of the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science, and a postgraduate Faculty of Divinity that is part of the Toronto School of Theology. Undergraduate students are admitted to Trinity in line with a common framework established by the University of Toronto, which sets the general principles and procedures for admission observed by its colleges. Applicants to Trinity are required to place the college first when ranking their preferences in colleges, and must complete a supplemental application. The college aims to have the fewest undergraduate students among the university&#x27;s colleges, and limits first-year enrollment limited to about 450 students. In 2018, Trinity&#x27;s first-year class had an entrance average of 94.6 per cent. In 2020, 63.7% of Bachelor of Science (BSc) graduates and 61.7% of Bachelor of Arts (BA) graduates from Trinity College achieved high distinction (defined by the University of Toronto as a cumulative GPA &gt;3.5) compared to 33.7% and 28.5% (respectively) of total University of Toronto graduates.

===Unique programs===

Trinity College offers undergraduate programs in immunology, international relations, and ethics, society, and law. The college also hosts first year seminar courses within the &quot;Margaret MacMillan Trinity One Program&quot;, named after former Trinity Provost Margaret MacMillan. Admission to the Trinity One program is open to all students at the University of Toronto, but requires a supplemental application. There are six Trinity One streams, each capped at 20-25 students: Policy, Philosophy &amp; Economics; Ethics, Society, &amp; Law; International Relations; Biomedical Health; Environmental Sustainability; and Medicine &amp; Global Health.

Trinity&#x27;s undergraduate programs benefits from the presence of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, which is housed in Devonshire House on college grounds. Many Trinity faculty members have offices in the Munk School. The Munk School also houses specialized research centers, such as the Asian Institute and the Centre for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies. The Munk School and its associated institutes host frequent lectures, panels, and events which are open to the Trinity community.

===Faculty of Divinity===

Beginning in 1837, representatives of the United Church of England and Ireland in Upper Canada met with the Society for Propagation of the Gospel to solicit support for fellowships to enable the education of local clergy. With a guarantee of support, in 1841 Bishop Strachan requested his chaplains, Henry James Grasett and Henry Scadding of St. James&#x27; Cathedral, and Alexander Neil Bethune, then Rector of Cobourg, to prepare a plan for a systematic course in theology for those to be admitted to Holy Orders. On January 10, 1842, the first lecture was given at the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg. In 1852, teaching was transferred to Toronto in the new Faculty of Divinity at Trinity College. Trinity College absorbed the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg in 1852.

The Anglican seminary remains active in college life, with approximately a dozen worship services held weekly in the chapel. In recent years, the Orthodox School of Theology has also begun using the chapel for weekly services.

The approximately 100 graduate students enrolled in Trinity&#x27;s Faculty of Divinity may take courses at other colleges at the Toronto School of Theology. At the basic degree level, Trinity offers several Master of Divinity programs - a basic program, a &quot;collaborative learning&quot; model with self-directed study components, and an honours programme, which includes a thesis. For students not seeking Holy Orders, a Master of Theological Studies is offered, as well as a Certificate in Theological Studies. At the advanced degree level, students may pursue the Master of Arts in Theology, the Master of Theology, the Doctor of Theology and the Doctor of Ministry. Applicants to the Ph.D. must hold an M.Div. Students can also enroll jointly in the M.Div. and MA.

In 2006, the Faculty of Divinity began offering an Orthodox and Eastern Christian Studies program. In 2015, this program developed into the Orthodox School of Theology, which offers courses on Eastern Orthodoxy within the Masters of Divinity program.

The Trinity College Faculty of Divinity is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, and publishes a statement of educational effectiveness. Trinity College is the only college or university in Canada accredited to offer Orthodox theological education.

The Faculty of Divinity&#x27;s Arms and Badge are registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

==Student life==
Trinity College enjoys a rich student life, with multiple college events held on a weekly basis. Trinity students maintain a diverse range of clubs and societies, and celebrate numerous traditions. The college hosts two black tie balls annually, and continue to celebrate British holidays including Guy Fawkes and Robbie Burns Days.

===Literary Institute===
The Trinity College Literary Institute (colloquially, &quot;the Lit&quot;) is a satirical debating society that holds weekly meetings. The Lit is a successor body to the Diocesan Theological Institute&#x27;s Debating Society, and thus technically pre-dates Trinity College itself. The Lit claims to be the oldest debating society in Canada but this is contested by the Queen&#x27;s Debating Union. In its early decades, the Lit debated issues of serious important to College life, such as compulsory chapel attendance and Sunday street cars. The tone of the debates shifted starting around the end of World War I; today, a typical meeting of the Lit usually includes satirical debates on a humorous topic, updates on college news, and satirical poetry from the Poet Laureate. While the meetings are typically crass student affairs, sitting faculty, distinguished alumni and even Provosts have been known to attend and debate on occasion. Beyond weekly meetings, the Lit organizes other events, historically including the annual Guy Fawkes bonfire, Oktoberfest, Chess in the Quad, Robbie Burns and &quot;Bubbly&quot; - a champagne themed formal ball. The institute&#x27;s executive is modeled after Canadian parliament, and consists of a Prime Minister, Speaker, Opposition Leader, and Deputy Speaker. Lists of former Speakers and Prime Ministers going back over a century are prominently displayed in the east hall between the chapel and Strachan Hall.

===Balls===

Formal dances are held twice annually at Trinity. The Saints Ball is held annually in the fall semester around November at St. Hilda&#x27;s College, and the Conversazione (&quot;Conversat&quot;) ball is held at Trinity College in the winter semester. Traditionally, the Saints Ball was hosted by women of college in their residence, while Conversat was hosted by men of college in theirs. In recent years, the growing size of the student body has necessitated moving the balls to off-campus venues. Conversat was historically organized by a committee of the Literary Institute. The first recorded Conversat occurred in 1869, but it was not until 1883 that the event became associated with dancing. Conversat has been held annually since 1869, and has become a key part of social life at Trinity. The ball used to be a central component of Toronto social life, and attracted dignitaries from across the province. The Governor General Lord Stanley attended the 1891 Conversat. While the residences have been desegregated since 2005, the tradition remains that the women of college ask their date to Saints, and the men ask their date to Conversat.

===Student Publications===
Trinity students publish a magazine called &quot;Salterrae&quot; (Latin, meaning &quot;The Salt of the Earth&quot;) which was founded as &quot;Trinlight&quot; in 1981. The annual yearbook is &quot;Stephanos&quot; (Greek, meaning &quot;Crown&quot;). There is also a bi-annual journal of students&#x27; short stories, photographs and poetry, called the &quot;Trinity University Review&quot;; it was first published in 1880 as &quot;Rouge et Noir&quot; (French, meaning &quot;Red and Black&quot;). In its early days, the Review published student essays, including on contentious debates at the college such as federation and the status of female students. 
More recently, there is also &quot;Trinity Times&quot;, a student published newspaper which was founded around the time of the pandemic.

===Dramatics===
 The Trinity College Dramatic Society (TCDS) was established in 1919, and since 1921 has put on at least one full-length production each year. In recent years the TCDS has produced four shows per season, including a spring musical, selected by the college-elected TCDS committee. The TCDS used Hart House as a performance venue from 1921 until 1979, when the George Ignatieff Theatre (GIT) was constructed at Trinity. While most productions are now in the GIT, plays have also been staged in other rooms at Trinity and outside in the quadrangle, most notably the annual Shakespeare in the Quad production - a continuation of the oldest outdoor Shakespeare festival in Canada. The TCDS frequently performs student-written productions. Prior TCDS student playwrights include the Canadian film director Atom Egoyan and the journalist John Ibbitson.

===Student government===
At Trinity, the final student government authority is the Trinity College Meeting (TCM), a direct democracy body in which all students have equal standing (conditional on the wearing of gowns at meetings). The TCM directly governs major policy questions and the allocation of student funds, and convenes a series of committees to provide recommendations on all aspects of student life. The TCM delegates responsibility for daily affairs to six student Heads, following annual elections. There are two Heads of college, two Heads of Arts (social), two Heads of Non-Residents and one to two Head(s) of Divinity; in each case, one Head is female and one male. Students of the Faculty of Divinity additionally elect one or two Heads each year, although they do not serve as officers of the TCM.

===Chapel choir===

The Trinity College Chapel Choir, which grew out of the Trinity Choral Club established in the 1890s, consists of about 30 singers of mixed voice, selected by audition. Trinity College awards choral scholarships to roughly one third of the choir, tenable for private voice coaching, from an endowment of $125,000. Since the construction of the chapel in 1955, the Chapel Choir has sung an Evensong service every Wednesday night during term, in the tradition of Oxford and Cambridge choral foundations. The Chapel Choir sings from the loft at the rear of the chapel, approximately above the main chapel floor, where the Casavant pipe organ is also located. Accompaniment is provided by the Bevan Organ Scholar, typically an undergraduate music student, who is appointed for three years and paid from a $100,000 endowment. A Director of Music conducts the choir, mentors the organ scholar, and occasionally plays the organ during services. Since 2006, the Director of Music has been Prof. John Tuttle, who is also Professor of Organ at the Faculty of Music, sometime Choirmaster and Organist at St. Thomas&#x27;s Anglican Church (from 1989 to 2016), and conducted the Exultate Chamber Singers until his retirement in 2010.

===Residential life===

Trinity is the last undergraduate college at the University of Toronto that continues the tradition of Formal Hall during the academic year; High Table dinners are usually held after Evensong on Wednesdays. Before the meal, one of the Student Heads or another positioned member of college (in order of precedence determined by seniority) is responsible for saying the Latin grace: &quot;Quae hodie sumpturi sumus, benedicat Deus, per Iesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. Amen.&quot; (May God bless what we are about to receive this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.) Formal Hall is marked by the enforcement of a number of regulations known as “Strachan Hall Etiquette.” The most evident of these is the dress code, of which Trinity&#x27;s distinctive academic gowns are the essential element for all members of college. In addition to the wearing of the gown, men were historically required to wear a jacket, collared shirt, long pants and a tie, as well as close-toed shoes. If a member of college has had the honour of being &quot;&quot;, they are then permitted to wear their tie tied on the remains of his gown. For women of college, the dress code consists of a similar prohibition on open-toed shoes. The dress code is not longer enforced on all students, though there still is a healthy encouragement to &#x27;dress up&#x27; if at all possible.

The various points of etiquette are enforced by the second-year students, led by the Heads of Second Year. The Second Year students act as “deputies of the hall” and are in charge of enforcing the dress code as well as maintaining discipline during the meal. Any student in violation of the dress code will not be allowed to enter the hall until they are dressed appropriately; this regulation is relaxed for non-resident students. The second year students also have the authority to physically eject any student who causes a ruckus during the meal.

In parody of the college&#x27;s Oxbridge traditions, the first year students would occasionally disrupt the formality of the meal by hurling buns at their fellow undergraduates. When this occurred, it was the job of the second years to eject all offending first years, or occasionally fellow upper years, from the hall. This was generally done with much struggle, however with little injury to any of the parties concerned. As the artillery was traditionally limited to simple bread rolls, no significant damage results from these incidents. This tradition has since fallen into abeyance, as formal dinners went from a daily to a weekly event.

===Traditions and lore===
Until 1993, weekday dinners at Trinity College were punctuated by the tradition of &quot;&quot;. This tradition was a tongue-in-cheek way of imposing &quot;discipline&quot; on errant male members of college. The name &quot;&quot; relates to the &quot;poor&quot; behaviour of the targeted student. Often spurious or humorous reasons would be given for a . Under this tradition, members of second year would attempt to expel an &quot;errant&quot; student from the dining hall during the first 15 minutes of dinner. The targeted student would lie across the dinner table, and was usually defended by three fellow students who linked together to form a strong a defensive shell over the table and on top of the targeted student. Upon a publicly announced &quot;call&quot; as to the alleged transgression, the assembled members of second year would stampede from their seats to the defenders, where they were given one minute to pull the targeted student off the table. On the rare occasion that a defence did prevail for more than one minute, the defendant was permitted to leave the dining hall on his own feet. Otherwise, the head of second year (or delegate) would drag the defendant out of the hall.

In 1992 a campaign was organised against out by a vocal minority of students who claimed victimisation. College authorities banned out on the basis of legal liability in 1993. Rather than simply disappearing, the tradition of the has merely evolved to suit the contemporary climate. Today, out is an honour generally reserved for students elected to prominent positions in the college, particularly the Student Heads. Both men and women may now be ; however the actual practice is most often gender segregated. For example, a man of college is defended by men and by men, while a woman of college is defended by women and by women. On account of the administration&#x27;s aforementioned hostility to the practice, they are no longer supposed to take place on college grounds and are absolutely forbidden in Strachan Hall. Rather, now often occur during The Lit. However, their actual form has changed little. The student selected to be lies across a table while three of his fellow students lie across him to defend him. The assemblage is then rushed by the upper year students, who shred the gown of the person, while removing his or her defenders. Once a student has been , they wear the remains of their gown bound as a sash. The gown is never to be washed, mended or sewn and must be worn in its original state as a sign of pride for the experiences of the student whilst at Trinity.
Prior to the desegregation of residences in 2005, St. Hilda&#x27;s College maintained a distinct residence life for the women of college, with its own institutions and traditions. These included an independent student government, literary institute, and dramatic society. Through till the 1950s, St. Hilda&#x27;s students were required to attend services in the makeshift college chapel, as well as volunteer in the university settlement house. Other St. Hilda&#x27;s-specific traditions included the wearing of halos, a reference to the nickname &quot;Saints&quot; given by the men of Trinity to the women of St. Hilda&#x27;s. The men of Trinity often performed &quot;Saints Serenades,&quot; which generally involved singing late at night outside the windows of St. Hilda&#x27;s. Male students were strictly limited in their access to the residence for its first decades of existence. These restrictions were eventually loosened to reflect the changing moral norms of Toronto. Trinity men often found creative ways to sneak into the building after hours, or occasionally engaged in forceful panty raids, to the consternation of the administration.

Episkopon is a controversial student society at Trinity College, with a male branch founded in 1858
and a female branch founded in 1899. The society operated mostly in public, and often with official support and encouragement until it was banned from Trinity grounds by the college administration in the 1990s. Episkopon has since gone underground, and continues to operate as a pseduo-secret society.

==College governance==
Trinity College was incorporated under an act of the United Province of Canada in 1851, and granted the privileges of a university by a Royal Charter of Queen Victoria of July 16, 1852. The college federated with the University of Toronto under an agreement of 1903, and its present legal status as a federated university is governed under The University of Toronto Act, 1971, as amended. Governance at Trinity College operates according to the College Statutes and regulations, first consolidated in 1982 and substantially revised in 1996.

In its early years, governance at Trinity College was essentially dominated by Bishop Strachan, who held a statutory veto power over the then-unicameral College Council.

Today, the highest governing body at Trinity is the College Corporation. The Corporation presently consists of over 500 elected and statutory members, including alumni, faculty, staff, student leaders, the Anglican Bishops of Ontario, and representatives from each Diocese. Corporation meets biannually, and receives reports from the Provost and chairs of other College bodies, such as the board of trustees and the Senate. Corporation also formally elects the College Chancellor, Provost, Secretary, and the ceremonial Public Orator and Esquire Bedells.

The College Senate and Board of Trustee are under the authority of the corporation, and meet regularly to oversee the governing of the college. The Board of Trustees sets the college budget, approves academic appointments, sets student residence fees, recommends a candidate for Provost to Corporation, and is generally responsible for all business and affairs of the college not vested in the Senate. The Senate is primarily responsible for approving academic courses and programs to be offered by the college, as well as maintaining policies for student life, safety, and admissions.

The Council of the Faculty of Divinity is a committee of the College Senate, and is responsible for all advising on all matters relating to the Faculty of Divinity.

===Chancellors and Provosts===
The Chancellor is the ceremonial head of the Trinity College. They chair meetings of the corporation, and hands out degrees at the Divinity Convocation. The Chancellor is elected by Corporation for five year terms, may be re-elected without restriction, and must be a member of the Anglican Church of Canada.

The Provost is the day-to-day chief executive of the college, and serves as Vice Chancellor. The Provost serves for five year terms, and may be re-elected once. The Provost lives in College in a designated &quot;Provost&#x27;s Lodge.&quot;


==Notable alumni==
Trinity has graduated notable academics including theologian William Robinson Clark, Michael Ignatieff, and former Trinity provost Margaret MacMillan, numerous politicians including the aforementioned Michael Ignatieff, his father George Ignatieff, former leader of the opposition and interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada Bill Graham (Trinity&#x27;s chancellor from 2007 until his death in 2022), former leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent, and former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as well as numerous notable diplomats including former Trinity Chancellor and Canadian Ambassador to the United States Michael Wilson. Stephen Harper, Canada&#x27;s 22nd Prime Minister, attended Trinity for a brief period before dropping out in his first semester.

To the field of business, Trinity has contributed Ted Rogers, president and CEO of Rogers Communications, and Jim Balsillie, former co-CEO of Research In Motion. To the arts, Trinity has contributed poets Archibald Lampman and Dorothy Livesay, architect Frank Darling, and filmmaker Atom Egoyan. Numerous high-ranking officials in the Anglican Church are also former Trinity students, including Andrew Hutchison, retired Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. Forty-three graduates of Trinity having been awarded Rhodes Scholarships.

<text>The SR.N4 (Saunders-Roe Nautical 4) hovercraft (also known as the &quot;Mountbatten&quot; class hovercraft) was a combined passenger and vehicle-carrying class of hovercraft. The type has the distinction of being the largest civil hovercraft to have ever been put into service.

Work on the SR.N4 was initiated in 1965 by Saunders-Roe. By the time that the vehicle&#x27;s first trials took place in early 1968, Saunders-Roe had merged with Vickers&#x27; hovercraft division to form the British Hovercraft Corporation, who continued development. Power was provided by four Rolls-Royce Proteus marine turboshaft engines each driving its own lift fan and pylon-mounted steerable propulsion propeller. The SR.N4 was the largest hovercraft then built, designed to carry 254 passengers in two cabins besides a four-lane automobile bay which held up to 30 cars. Cars were driven from a bow ramp just forward of the wheelhouse. The first design was long, weighed , was capable of and could cruise at over .

The SR.N4s operated regular services across the English Channel between 1968 and 2000. In response to operator demands, stretched versions of the SR.N4 were developed, culminating in the Mk.III variant, which had almost double the capacity for carrying both cars and passengers as the Mk.I. While interest was expressed in military applications for the type, no vehicles were ultimately used for such purposes. Following the fleet&#x27;s withdrawal from cross-channel services, a single remaining Mk.III example, GH-2007 &quot;Princess Anne&quot;, remains on static display at the Hovercraft Museum at Lee-on-Solent as of August 2021.

==Development==
===Origins===
In August 1962, the original concept for the SR.N4, which had been conceived at the same time as the SR.N2 was being designed, was abandoned. This original concept had effectively been a pair of elongated SR.N2 fixed together in a side-by-side placement and would have been powered by an arrangement of four pairs of Blackburn A.129 turboshaft engines. In its place, a new proposed hovercraft, which was referred to as the SR.N4 as well, was considerably larger and heavier, and powered by three pairs of Rolls-Royce Proteus marinised gas turbine engine. However, during early 1963, work on the SR.N4 was put on hold due to a greater priority having been placed on the completion of the SR.N5 instead. In late 1964, it was decided to recommence design work on the proposed SR.N4.

By the end of 1964, it had been concluded that, due to the improved projected performance of the craft&#x27;s flexible skirt having lowered the power requirements involved, only two pairs of Proteus engines would be required instead of three. At this stage, the proposed design for the SR.N4 had a displacement of 165 tons and a payload of up to 33 cars and 116 passengers; this would not substantially differ from the final design adopted for the type.

Experience gained from the SR.N5 and SR.N6 would contribute to the design of aspects of the larger SR.N4, which would be four times the size of any preceding hovercraft. This approach is credited with having been less expensive and having resulted in a more commercially viable hovercraft than would have been if it had been constructed as per the earlier incarnation of the SR.N4 and then required to perform modifications to improve the capabilities of aspects such as the skirt, which had been considerably advanced by development of the SR.N5 and SR.N6. Specific improvements included the adoption of triangular rubber &#x27;finger&#x27;-like attachments to the curtain which provided for a better seal between the hovercraft and the water&#x27;s surface as well as being cheaper and easier to maintain than previous configurations.

During the mid-1960s, some management figures within British Rail had become interested in the potential for operating a fleet of hovercraft for scheduled services that would link up to Britain&#x27;s national rail system. In November 1965, Frank Cousins, the Minister of Technology, announced that British Rail would participate in the development of the SR.N4 and would be a customer for the type. While orders had already been placed for the SR.N4 by this point, the British Railways Board had decided to commit to taking delivery of the first craft to be produced; this was particularly convenient as the two orders which had been placed by Swedish operator Cross-Channel Hover Services specifically excluded accepting delivery of the first example. By the end of 1965, having acquired three firm orders, it was now plausible for production of the SR.N4 to proceed.

===Prototype and testing===
Having realised that the market for large hovercraft was not yet large enough to sustain a number of competing companies at that time, in 1966, the hovercraft divisions of both Saunders-Roe and Vickers Supermarine merged to form a new united entity, known as the British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC), which was headquartered on the Isle of Wight. In autumn 1966, production work commenced on the structure of the first SR.N4, which was internally designated &quot;001&quot;. The vehicle was assembled in the same hangar in which the three Saunders-Roe Princess flying boats had been constructed 15 years before. During 1967, as 001 was taking shape, it was announced that the SR.N4 had been named the &quot;Mountbatten-class&quot;. Throughout the development and production of 001, both Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed carefully monitored progress on the project.

In October 1967, the completed 001 was officially presented to gathered members of the press and to various representatives and dignitaries. On 20 November 1967, the first engine run was performed, after which 11 weeks of intense test runs on land were performed and the exposed faults were addressed. On 4 February 1968, 001 was launched onto water for the first time. The launch, while successful, had involved some risk due to the lack of space to manoeuvre with an untested control system. Later that same day, 001 conducted its maiden flight.

As experience with the prototype accumulated, the control arrangement proved to be quite effective even within confined spaces; incidents involving a loss of control did occur during the test programme, but these were mainly due to error on the part of the operator. Ray Wheeler, BHC&#x27;s chief engineer, was reportedly very pleased with the progress made during the initial trials. At the same time, 001 required substantial refinement and alteration in order to become a commercially viable craft. The air intakes had to be substantially modified in order to minimise salt ingestion, and a revised skirt system was also developed.

==Design==

The SR.N4 was the biggest hovercraft to have been completed upon its introduction. Its primary structure comprised a large modular buoyancy tank, the internal structure of which was divided into 24 watertight compartments. It had an identical platform shape to the smaller SR.N5, being rectangular with a semi-circular bow and a beam-to-length ratio of 1:1.66. The SR.N4 had a dual radar system for navigation, allowing the craft to operate in zero visibility - Type Racal Decca Bridgemaster. A GPS navigation system was fitted.

The SR.N4 was powered by four Rolls-Royce Proteus turboprop engines. The Proteus engines each drove a set of diameter steerable Dowty Rotol propellers, arranged in two pairs on pylons positioned on top of the craft&#x27;s roof; upon the SR.N4&#x27;s introduction to service, these were the largest propellers in the world. Six independent electrohydraulic systems, each driven from the main gearboxes, powered the movement of the fins and pylons, while a further four units were used to actuate the variable-pitch propellers.

The control cabin of the SR.N4 resembled the flight deck of an aircraft, being relatively cramped in comparison with the bridge of a typical vessel. It housed a crew of three, comprising a captain, first officer/flight engineer, and a second officer/navigator; the main role of the second officer was to avoid collisions, primarily using a Decca 629 radar to do so. The flying controls appeared broadly similar to a typical aircraft, using an assortment of rudder pedals, joysticks, yokes, separate propeller pitch levels, and engine speed controls; however, their functionality often differed substantially, such as the ability for the yoke to command the pitch of all four propellers.

The SR.N4 is fitted with a 12-ton skirt which runs under the perimeter of the whole craft and employs a complex structure. On the underside of the buoyancy tanks, five 21-inch platforms (known as &#x27;elephant feet&#x27;) were positioned so that the craft could stably rest on three of them.

Fuel was contained within flexible bags located at all four corners; the craft could be trimmed by redistributing fuel between the fore and aft tanks to better match the load and prevailing weather conditions. The craft would consume 1,000 gallons per hour at a cruise of 50 knots before refuelling with an approximate range of . Maximum fuel capacity was ; about 29 tons.

The stern of the craft featured a sizeable set of doors for the loading and unloading of vehicles onto the car deck as well as all four of the exhausts for the Proteus engines. Another set of loading doors was located at the bow.

The SR.N4 could operate up to gale force 8 wind on the beaufort scale and 3.5m swell seas.

==Operational service==
Upon completion of the prototype SR.N4, Charles Anthony Brindle, the Managing Director of British Rail Hovercraft, was responsible for establishing the first cross-Channel route for scheduled services by the type. In October 1966, Brindle and several engineers surveyed several potential sites on both the British and French sides of the English Channel using an SR.N6 to determine their suitability for the hovercraft service, which had been given the name Seaspeed. Amongst the most suitable candidates had been Dover or Folkestone on the English side and Calais or Boulogne on the French side.

It was soon determined that Dover and Boulogne would be the preferable option for the maiden route, a decision that had been motivated in part by the local Chamber of Commerce having agreed to build a suitable hoverport to readily facilitate such operations. As there was no funding available for pre-service passenger trials, the opening season of active operations effectively served as a continuation of the trials activities as well. Brindle was aware that BHC would not be paid until the SR.N4 was in service, and thus there was a considerable emphasis placed on getting the craft ready for commercial use right at the point of delivery.

In August 1968, the first SR.N4 entered commercial service with the GH-2006 &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; being initially operated by Seaspeed between Dover and Boulogne. Rival operator Hoverlloyd built the world&#x27;s first purpose-built hoverport at Ramsgate Hoverport, specifically designed for the SR.N4, to also serve the Calais route.

The journey time from Dover to Boulogne was roughly 35 minutes, with six trips per day being conducted at peak times. The fastest ever crossing of the English Channel by a commercial car-carrying hovercraft was 22 minutes, achieved on 14 September 1995 by the SR.N4 Mk.III GH-2007 &quot;Princess Anne&quot; on its 10:00 a.m. service.

In 1972, the first SR.N4s were temporarily withdrawn for conversion to Mk.II specification which would provide for seven further car spaces and 28 more passengers. The first of the enlarged craft, the &quot;Swift&quot;, entered service at the beginning of February 1973. The capacity increase was achieved by removing an inner passenger cabin in order to accommodate the extra cars and widening the outer passenger cabin: this was achieved without changing the overall footprint of the craft. New aircraft-style forward-facing seats created an atmosphere of enhanced sophistication, and a redesigned skirt was intended to reduce window spray, enhancing the view out for passengers, and to give a smoother ride in rough seas: contemporary reports nevertheless commented on the &quot;unsprung&quot; nature of the ride.

After 1976, a pair of SR.N4s were refitted with new deep skirts and stretched by almost , increasing capacity to 418 passengers and 60 cars at the cost of a weight increase to roughly . To maintain speed, the engines were upgraded to four models, which were fitted with four diameter steerable Dowty Rotol propellers. The work cost around £5 million for each craft, and they were designated Mark IIIs; the improvements allowed them to operate in seas up to high and with winds.

The two main commercial operators (Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed) merged in 1981 to form Hoverspeed, which operated six SR.N4 of all marks. The last of the craft was withdrawn from service in October 2000 and Hoverspeed itself ceased operations in November 2005.

=== Accidents ===
Most incidents were benign and resulted in little more than the vehicles towed back to shore. In 1978, the GH-2007 &quot;Princess Anne&quot; lost much of her air-cushion skirt in heavy seas 7 miles off Dover, resulting in a MAIB investigation. However, in March 1985, 4 passengers lost their lives when GH-2006 &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; crashed into a pier at the entrance of Dover Harbour from Calais in force 6 to 7 heavy seas.

===Military interest===
The Royal Navy considered a mine sweeping version of the SR.N4, hovercraft being almost invulnerable to mines. A minesweeping version of the SR.N4 was thought to be capable of carrying the same equipment as a Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel, while being cheaper to purchase, although more expensive to operate. The use of hovercraft for minesweeping never got further than the concept stage, although an SR.N3 was used by the Inter-Service Hovercraft Unit for trials.

==Surviving examples==
The two remaining Mk.III examples of the craft (GH-2006 &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; and GH-2007 &quot;Princess Anne&quot;) were bought by Wensley Haydon-Baillie for £500,000 and were stored at Lee-on-Solent, next to the Hovercraft Museum. Haydon-Baillie is the owner of the super yacht &quot;Brave Challenger&quot; which uses the same Rolls-Royce Proteus Marine engines as the SR.N4s. The purchase included seven years worth of spares including engines.

As of winter 2015 all engines and APUs had been removed from the craft. The SR.N4s were put up for sale and Hover Transit Services of Bolton, Ontario, proposed putting the hovercraft back in operation (following a purchase and refurbishment) on Lake Ontario with service between Rochester, New York, and Toronto, Ontario. The plan did not come to fruition, with government officials concluding that the organisation lacked the experience necessary to be viable.

The land on which the Hovercraft Museum stands is owned by the Homes and Communities Agency. The proposed redevelopment of the site has led to the two craft being threatened with scrapping, but a petition was launched with the aim of preserving one of the craft, which led into a 3-year lease of the hovercraft to the museum in August 2016 with the intention of subsequently permanently handing over the hovercraft to the museum, The &quot;Princess Anne&quot; was the craft chosen to be kept and will be restored in a former Seaspeed livery.

In March 2018, GH-2006 &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; was broken up at Lee-on-Solent by her last owners, Homes England. GH-2007 The &quot;Princess Anne&quot; remains on site leased to the Hovercraft Museum.

<doc id="156496" wikidata="Q490844" url="?curid=156496" title="Gukurahundi">
<text>The Gukurahundi was a series of mass killings and genocide in Zimbabwe which were committed from 1983 until the Unity Accord in 1987. The name derives from a Shona language term which loosely translates to &quot;the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains&quot;.

During the Rhodesian Bush War, two rival nationalist parties, Robert Mugabe&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Joshua Nkomo&#x27;s Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), had emerged to challenge Rhodesia&#x27;s government. ZANU initially defined &quot;Gukurahundi&quot; as an ideological strategy aimed at carrying the war into major settlements and individual homesteads. Following Mugabe&#x27;s ascension to power, his government remained threatened by &quot;dissidents&quot; – disgruntled former guerrillas and supporters of ZAPU.

ZANU recruited mainly from the majority Shona people, whereas ZAPU was neither a tribal nor a regional party. While ZAPU had its greatest support in Matebeleland, amongst the Ndebele, Kalanga, Sotho, Venda, Tonga, Xhosa and other tribes found in Matebeleland, it also enjoyed significant support within the Shona communities in Midlands, Mashonaland, Manicaland and Masvingo provinces. This is signified by the large number of people of Shona origin within the top ZAPU leadership structures prior to, and after independence in 1980. These included the vice presidents of ZAPU, who originated mainly from Shona speaking areas. In early 1983, the North Korean-trained 5th Brigade, an infantry brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), began a crackdown on dissidents in the Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, and Midlands provinces, home of the Ndebele and Kalanga. Over the following two years, thousands of Ndebele and Kalanga were detained by government forces and either marched to re-education camps, tortured, raped and/or summarily executed. Reporting on the death toll of the campaign is sharply divided. The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe confirmed a minimum death toll of 2,750, noting that potential deaths could reach 8,000. The consensus of the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) is that more than 20,000 people were killed, the figure first reported by Nkomo.

==Background==
Before the Rhodesian Bush War, the main black nationalist organisation in Southern Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), split into two groups in 1963, the split-away group being the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Though these groups had a common origin they gradually grew apart, with the split away group, ZANU, recruiting mainly from the Shona regions, while ZAPU recruited mainly from Ndebele-speaking regions in the west.

There is a much earlier source for Ndebele hostility to the Shona, going back to the arrival in 1837 of Mzilikazi and his Matabeleland kingdom. Mzilikazi carved out a territory for himself by fighting and dispossessing the local VaRozvi led by Changamire Chirisamhuru, the then patriach.

The armies of these two groups, ZAPU&#x27;s Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and ZANU&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), developed rivalries for the support of the people and would fight each other. When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, following the Lancaster House Agreement, the two armies so distrusted each other that it was difficult to integrate them both into the national army. In the elections held in April 1980, ZANU received 57 out of 100 seats and Robert Mugabe became prime minister.

Dr. Stuart Doran, a historian specialising in Zimbabwe, using historical documents, in the article “New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings”: 

===Entumbane uprisings===
In November 1980 Enos Nkala made remarks at a rally in Bulawayo, in which he warned ZAPU that ZANU would deliver a few blows against them. This preceded the first outbreak of fighting in Entumbane Bulawayo, during which ZIPRA and the Zimbabwe National Army fought a pitched battle for two days.

In February 1981 there was a second uprising, which spread to Glenville and also to Connemara in the Midlands. ZIPRA troops in other parts of Matabeleland headed for Bulawayo to join the battle, and the Zimbabwean National army units had to come in to stop the fighting. The government asked Justice Enoch Dumbutshena, the former Chief Justice of Zimbabwe, to hold an inquiry into the uprising – ZIPRA was found to be preparing for war. Many ZIPRA cadres defected after Entumbane, fearing retribution.

===1982===
This situation became worse after the government claimed to have found arms caches in February 1982. ZANU now openly accused ZAPU of plotting another war and ZAPU leaders were arrested or removed from cabinet. However, the treason trial in 1982 involving Dumiso Dabengwa, Lookout Masuku, and four others failed to prove a case against them. All were released although Dabengwa and Masuku were re-detained without trial for four years. As a result, ex-ZIPRA cadres deserted the army after this. They did this out of necessity to stay alive. With their leaders all locked up or in exile, they felt there was nobody to protect them within the army. &quot;We were threatened, that was why I decided to desert,&quot; said one dissident.

The army integration scheme saw former ZIPRA recruits being harassed and accused of sympathising with their deserted colleagues. They were no longer trusted and were being constantly harassed. However, Joshua Nkomo publicly disowned the deserted soldiers and thus discouraged any others from leaving the army.

==Fifth Brigade==
Robert Mugabe, then prime minister, had signed an agreement with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in October 1980 to have the North Korean military train a brigade for the Zimbabwean army. This was soon after Mugabe had announced the need for a militia to &quot;combat malcontents.&quot; Mugabe replied by saying dissidents should &quot;watch out,&quot; announcing the brigade would be called &quot;Gukurahundi.&quot; This brigade was named the Fifth Brigade. The members of the Fifth Brigade were drawn from 3,500 ex-ZANLA troops at Tongogara Assembly Point, named after Josiah Tongogara, the ZANLA general. There were a few ZIPRA (ZAPU) troops in the unit for a start, but they were withdrawn before the end of the training. The training of 5th Brigade lasted until September 1982, when Minister Sekeramayi announced training was complete.

The first Commander of the Fifth Brigade was Colonel Perrance Shiri. The Fifth Brigade was different from all other Zimbabwean army units in that it was directly subordinated to the Prime Minister office, and not integrated to the normal army command structures. Their codes, uniforms, radios and equipment were not compatible with other army units. Their most distinguishing feature in the field was their red berets.

==Conflict and killings==
In January 1983, a crackdown by the Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland North was initiated to purge the dissidents, and its participation lasted until late 1984. The brigade&#x27;s directives apparently specified a search for local ZAPU officials and veterans of ZAPU&#x27;s armed wing, the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). Seizure or detention by the Fifth Brigade was arbitrary. In Bulawayo, for instance, Ndebele men of fighting age were considered potential dissidents and therefore, guilty of subversive activities. Most detained were summarily executed or marched to re-education camps.

Most of the victims were shot in public executions, often after being forced to dig their own graves in front of family and fellow villagers. On occasion the Fifth Brigade also massacred large groups of Ndebele, seemingly at random—the largest such incident occurred in March 1983, when 62 young men and women were shot on the banks of the Cewale River, Lupane. Seven survived with gunshot wounds, the other 55 died. Another way 5 Brigade used to kill large groups of people was to burn them alive in huts. They did this in Tsholotsho and also in Lupane. They also would throw victims alive in disused mine, case in point at Bhalagwe camp which was close to the Antelope mines near Maphisa, Kezi. They would routinely round up dozens, or even hundreds, of civilians and march them at gun point to a central place, like a school or bore-hole. There they would be forced to sing Shona songs praising ZANU, at the same time being beaten with sticks. These gatherings usually ended with public executions. Those killed could be ex-ZIPRAs, ZAPU officials, or anybody chosen at random. The Zimbabwe government repudiated these allegations and accused the hostile foreign press of fabricating stories. Zimbabwean Minister for National Security Sydney Sekeramayi countered that allegations of atrocities were part of a ZAPU disinformation programme to discredit the army.

The government characterised such allegations as irresponsible, contrived propaganda because it failed to give proper weight to the violence by dissidents, who targeted ZANU officials. It is estimated that 700–800 people were murdered by dissident gangs in rural regions. In August 1985, dissidents massacred 22 Shona civilians in Mwenezi. On a mission farm in Matobo, dissidents massacred 16 people.

===Death estimates===
The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe documented at least 2,000 deaths, and speculated that the actual number could be as high as 8,000. Locals from the affected regions put the figure between 20,000 and 40,000. Journalist Heidi Holland referred to a death toll of 8,000 as a typical conservative estimate. In February 1983 the International Red Cross disclosed that 1,200 Ndebele had been murdered that month alone. In a unanimously adopted resolution in 2005, the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimated the death toll at 20,000. 

===Reactions===
In 1992, serving Defence Minister Moven Mahachi became the first ZANU official who publicly apologised for the execution and torture of civilians by the Fifth Brigade. Five years later, Enos Nkala, former defence minister, described his involvement in the &quot;Gukurahundi&quot; as &quot;eternal hell&quot; and blamed President Mugabe for having orchestrated it. Speaking at Nkomo&#x27;s memorial service on 2 July 2000, Mugabe admitted &quot;thousands&quot; had been killed during the campaign, calling it a &quot;moment of madness&quot;.

==Unity Accord of 1987==

Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo signed the Unity Accord on 22 December 1987. This effectively merged ZAPU and ZANU into the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF). On 18 April 1988, Mugabe announced an amnesty for all dissidents, and Nkomo called on them to lay down their arms. A general ordinance was issued saying all those who surrendered before 31 May would get a full pardon. This was extended not just to dissidents but to criminals of various types serving jail terms. Over the next few weeks, 122 dissidents surrendered. In June, the amnesty was extended to include all members of the security forces who had committed human rights violations.

===Aftermath===
By the 1990s, the disturbances were finally at an end. This brought relief nationwide, but in parts of the country it left behind many problems that remain unsolved. These include poor health, poverty, practical and legal problems and a deep-rooted suspicion of government officials.

With the emergence of a &#x27;new dispensation&#x27; under Emmerson Mnangagwa, there was a general expectation that for the first time the government would publicly apologise for the atrocities. However, like his predecessor, Mnangagwa has not done anything that can be accepted by the victims as bringing closure. This comes after Mnangagwa set up a seven-member Commission of Inquiry in early 2019 chaired by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe which critics like the Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP) argue, will not solve the underlying problems. There is general discontent and people from the affected communities do not believe that the Government is sincere in its commitments towards the &quot;Gukurahundi&quot; genocide issue.

==In popular culture==
Zimbabwean author Christopher Mlalazi wrote a novel on the Gukurahundi killings from a child&#x27;s perspective, &quot;Running with Mother&quot; (2012). It is also covered in NoViolet Bulawayo&#x27;s Booker-shortlisted &quot;Glory&quot;.

<text>Alfred Spiro Moisiu (; born 1 December 1929) is a former Albanian military general, diplomat and politician, who was the president of Albania from 2002 to 2007. He is the oldest son of Albanian Army general Spiro Moisiu.

== Early life, education and career ==
Moisiu was born into the family of General Spiro Moisiu. In 1946 he was sent to the Soviet Union as a student. In 1948 he graduated from the military engineering school in Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad). He served in Tirana as a platoon-commander at the United Officers&#x27; School (1948–1949) and as a teacher at the Skanderbeg Military Academy (1949–1951). From 1952 to 1958 he attended the Academy of Military Engineering in Moscow.

Back in Albania, Moisiu continued his military career in the engineers&#x27; department of the Ministry of Defense. From 1967 to 1968 he attended the higher courses of general staff at the Defense Academy of Tirana. At the same time he commanded a pontoon brigade in Kavajë (1966–1971). In 1971 he became the chief of the Bureau of Engineering and Fortifications of the Ministry of Defense (under Enver Hoxha, when thousands of concrete casements were built as defense against states held to be hostile).

In 1979, Moisiu received a PhD in military science. From 1981 he was Deputy Minister of Defense. Under the ministers Beqir Balluku, Mehmet Shehu and Kadri Hasbiu he held this post until October 1982 (Shehu died violently in December 1981). He was appointed by Enver Hoxha to fill Albania with bunkers. Hoxha sent Moisiu to Burrel, where he served as the commander of an engineers&#x27; company from 1982 to 1984. Moisiu left active service as a general.

== Post-communist politics ==
He returned to public life in December 1991 when he was appointed Minister of Defense in Vilson Ahmeti&#x27;s technocratic government. He held that post until April 1992 when the first Government of the Democratic Party, led by Aleksander Meksi, was formed. The new executive invited Moisiu to work as a counselor to the Minister of Defense. In 1994, Safet Zhulali appointed him the deputy minister charged with elaborating the defence politics of Albania. Moisiu&#x27;s advice was to concentrate efforts on the reconstruction of the armed forces, which were in bad condition, and to start preparations for joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In 1994 he founded the Albanian North Atlantic Association and was elected as its president. On January 24, 1995, he signed an individual association treaty binding Albania with NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace project. From 1995, Moisiu attended to the VIPs&#x27; courses of the NATO College in Rome.

When the Albanian Socialist Party came to power in 1997, Moisiu lost his post in the Ministry. In the following years, he took an active part in extra-governmental activity, organizing international and all-Albanian conferences where issues of security and defense in South East Europe, armament control and collecting arms from civil persons were discussed.

== Re-emergence in politics ==
In 2002, under pressure from international organizations, Moisiu was chosen by Sali Berisha and Fatos Nano as a consensus candidate for the presidency after the end of Rexhep Meidani&#x27;s term. Moisiu was elected by the People&#x27;s Assembly by a vote of 97 to 19 (with 14 abstentions) and he was sworn in for a five-year term as president on July 24, 2002. After the constitutional reform of November 1998, politics is mainly the task of the government. Moisiu promised to contribute to the strengthening of parliamentary democracy, the stabilization of the judiciary system and the integration of Albania into Euro-Atlantic structures. The day after the beginning of Moisiu&#x27;s presidency, Socialist Prime Minister Pandeli Majko resigned, and the president appointed Fatos Nano, the leader of the Socialist Party, the new Prime Minister of Albania.

<text>Korçë (; ) is the eighth most populous city of Albania and the seat of Korçë County and Korçë Municipality. The total population of the city is 51,152 and 75,994 of Korçë municipality (2011 census), in a total area of . It stands on a plateau some above sea level, surrounded by the Morava Mountains.

The area of the Old Bazaar, including Mirahori Mosque, is considered as the urban core of the city. Founded by the local Ottoman Albanian nobleman Ilias Bey Mirahori, the urban area of Korçë dates back to the late 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century, however its actual physiognomy was realized in the 19th century, during a period that corresponds with the rapid growth and development of the city. The Old Bazaar has played a dominant role in Albania&#x27;s market history. Korçë is the largest city of eastern Albania and an important cultural and industrial centre.

== Name ==
Korçë is named differently in other languages: , , or ; Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian: Горица, &quot;Goritsa&quot;; , &quot;Korytsa&quot;; ; or ; . 
The current name is of Slavic origin. The word &quot;gorica&quot; means &quot;hill&quot; in South Slavic languages, and is a very common toponym in Albania and Slavic countries (e.g. Podgorica in Montenegro, Gorizia, Dolna Gorica in the Pustec municipality, and so on). It is diminutive of the Slavic toponym &quot;gora&quot;, meaning mountain, which is also found in placenames throughout Slavic countries as well as non-Slavic countries like Albania, Greece and Italy.

== History ==
=== 15th century ===
Korçë&#x27;s foundation is closely related with the actions of Ilias Bey Mirahori, a Muslim Albanian convert born in the village of Panarit in the Korçë area, who acquired large properties in the location of present-day Korçë. Ilias Bey was the &#x27;Master of the Stables&#x27; of Sultan Bayezid II, and the first equerry and conqueror of Psamathia in the Ottoman capture of Constantinople. In 1484 Ilias Bey received, as a reward from the Sultan, seven villages located in the Korçë area: Leshnjë, Vithkuq, Peshkëpi, Boboshticë, Panarit, Treska, and Trebicka. This accord was finalized gradually through four firmans. In the first firman Leshnjë and Vithkuq were accorded to Ilias Bey as mülk (land tenure). However he met difficulties while collecting the incomes and after twelve years these villages turned into their earlier status of timars, being substituted through a second firman in the year 1497 by the locality &quot;Piskopiye&quot;, which included two sections. In the third firman (1497) the boundaries of Piskopiye were defined, establishing its demarcation between Mborje, Barç and Bulgarec, a site area corresponding to the territory of today&#x27;s Korçë city. As a product of this process, the town of Korçë dates from the end of the 15th century.

The name &quot;Gorica&quot; corresponded to an older fortified settlement, and was later attached to Piskopiye, which was a separate community, and as suggested by its name, a bishop&#x27;s residence. Ilias Bey founded his works of charity in Piskopiye, building a mosque, an imaret and a muallim-hane and a hammam. Built between 1484 and 1495, the mosque, named after him, represents one of the most important examples of Islamic architecture of Albania and its second oldest mosque after the Sultan&#x27;s Mosque of Berat. The name &quot;Episkopi&quot; in Greek signifies a sacred place for the Orthodox faith, however, it is not certain if it was a coincidence or an intended strategy to build a mosque on the site of an older Orthodox church or monastery. With the establishment of the religious, educational and charitable institutions in the area, Ilias Bey must have planned to make the village a local Islamic centre and to raise it to the rank of &quot;kasaba&quot; (&quot;town&quot;), through the registration of its inhabitants as citizens instead of farmers. Being subjected to the Kaza of Korça, the villages of Episkopi, Boboshtica, Leshnjë and Vithkuq were used in 1505 as sources of income on behalf of the five institutions of Ilias Bey&#x27;s vakfa. The vakfa he founded also served the purpose of organizing the settlement of Muslim inhabitants in an area that was recently abandoned by the original Christian inhabitants.

The new town must have been dominated initially by the old castle of Mborje. Throughout the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century the castle was maintained by the Ottomans. The Tapu Defter of 1519 records a cemaat of Christian &quot;müsellems&quot; in the castle. According to this document the village of Mborje (&quot;Emboryo&quot;), which depended on Korçë (&quot;Görice&quot;), numbered 88 households of Christians and 18 households of Muslims.

Korça was divided into two great neighborhoods: Varosh and Kasaba. In the 16th century Muslims constituted the 21% of the population of the town and inhabited Kasaba, which was subdivided into the smaller neighborhoods of Çarshi, Ratak, Qoshk and Dere, including the institutions established by Ilias Bey. The Christian population inhabited Varosh, which was subdivided in Varosh i Sipërm (Upper Varosh) and Varosh i Poshtëm (Lower Varosh). Varosh i Sipërm was further subdivided into the smaller neighborhoods of Mano, Barç, Jeni-Mahallë, Qiro, Penço, Manço, Manto and Kala, while Varosh i Poshtëm consisted only of Katavarosh, which was known also as &quot;Lagja e Shën Mërisë&quot;, named after the Church that was located there.

Görice was incorporated as a sandjak in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

=== 18th century ===
When the nearby town of İskopol (Moscopole or Moschopolis or Voskopojë) was destroyed by Ali Pasha&#x27;s men in 1789, some of its commerce shifted to Görice (Korçë) and Arnavud Belgrad (Berat). Korçë grew as part of its population came from nearby Moscopole. Greek sources (Liakos and Aravandinos) have noted of the Korçë Aromanian populations&#x27; origins that in addition to many being from Moscopole, others settled during a time of calm and were from the village of Shalës, Kolonjë and established the market district of Korçë known as Varosh. Aromanians from the Arvanitovlach subgroup that in the early 19th century arrived to the Korçë area played a significant role in establishing the Korçë Christian urban class. In Psalidas&#x27; work &quot;Geography&quot; from 1830 noted that in the district of Varosh in Korçë, 100 Aromanian families lived there.

According to French diplomat François Pouqueville there were 1,300 families living in the city in 1805 with two thirds of them being Christian. Korçë went from having a population of 8,200 (1875) to 18,000 (1905) and of those 14,000 adhered to Orthodox Christianity. Of those considered as &quot;Greek&quot; in Korçë, this was because they adhered to Orthodox Christianity, but Michael Palairet argues that most were probably Aromanians (Vlachs). Sources of the early 20th century report that the population was primarily ethnic Albanian. Greek was the language of the elite and the majority of the Aromanian population engaged in commerce, crafts and international trade becoming one of the wealthiest communities in Epirus and Macedonia. Albanians of Korçë engaged mostly in stockbreeding, agriculture and were poor. The inhabitants of the city spoke both Albanian and Greek.

Korçë&#x27;s cultural isolation was reduced due to Greek schools, the first one being founded in the city at 1724. Subsequently, Muslim Albanian revolutionary intellectuals from the city emerged in the 1840s that wanted to preserve a Muslim Albania within a reformed Ottoman state. Due to increasing Hellenisation by the 1870s, those sentiments became replaced with the concept of an Albanian nation based on linguistic and cultural factors through struggle against a collapsing Ottoman Empire. During the late Ottoman era, Orthodox Albanians involved in the Albanian National Awakening came mainly from Korçë and its surrounding areas. On the other hand, the city council of Korçë, known as demogerontia (), and the metropolitan bishop of the city who identified as Greeks sent a secret memorandum to the foreign office department of Greece suggesting various ways to tackle activities by Albanian nationalists. In 1885, Jovan Cico Kosturi became the founder of a committee called the Albanian Cultural Society, along with co-founders Thimi Marko and Orhan Pojani, but the formation of the organization was suppressed by both the Ottoman and Orthodox Church authorities, so it went underground and carried on its activities as the Secret Committee of Korça (), and two years later, in March 1887, with the help of the Frashëri brothers, the Secret Committee set up the first Albanian school.

In the late Ottoman period, inhabitants from Korçë and surrounding areas emigrated abroad for economic opportunities, often by the Orthodox community who mainly as qualified craftsmen went to Romania, Greece and Bulgaria while Muslims went to Istanbul performing mainly menial labour work. Late nineteenth century Albanian migration to the United States consisted mainly of Orthodox Albanians from Korçë and surrounding areas who went to work there, save money and intending to eventually return home.

=== Rilindja ===

At beginning of the 18th century the inhabitants of Korçë attended the schools of nearby Moscopole. The first school, a Greek language school, in the city was established in 1724 with the support of residents of nearby Vithkuq. This school was destroyed during the Greek War of Independence but it reopened in 1830. In 1857 a Greek school for girls was operating in the city. During the 19th century various local benefactors such as Ioannis Pangas and Anastas Avramidhi-Lakçe donated money for the promotion of Greek education and culture in Korçë, such as the Bangas Gymnasium. Greek education was also financed by members of the diaspora in Egypt. Similarly, kindergartens, boarding and urban schools, were also operating in the city during this period. Under these developments, a special community fund, named the Lasso fund, was established in 1850 by the local Orthodox bishop Neophytos, in order to support Greek cultural activity in Korçë. At the eve of the Balkan Wars (1912) the total number of students attending Greek education in the city numbered 2,115.

Around 1850, Naum Veqilharxhi created an Albanian alphabet in which a few small books were published and the script briefly flourished in Korçë. At the end of the 19th century local Albanians expressed a growing need to be educated in their native language. The Albanian intellectual diaspora from Istanbul and Bucharest initially tried to avoid antagonism towards the notables of Korçë, who were in favor of Greek culture. Thus they suggested the introduction of Albanian language in the existing Greek Orthodox schools, a proposal which was discussed with the local bishop and the city council, the &quot;demogeronteia&quot;, and finally rejected by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the late 1870s the Albanian Committee of Patriots devised a Latin-based Albanian script which was also adopted by British and U.S. Protestant missionaries 

The Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights founded in the late 1870s promoting Albanian cultural development set up an Albanian secondary school for boys. The founding in 1884 of the boy&#x27;s secondary school is regarded as the first Albanian school in Korçë and established in 1887 by the &quot;Drita&quot; () organization and funded by notable local individuals. Its first director was Pandeli Sotiri. Naim Frashëri, the national poet of Albania played a great role in the opening of the school. As a high-ranking statesman in the ministry of education of the Ottoman Empire he managed to get official permission for the school. The Ottoman authorities gave permission only for Christian children to be educated in Albanian, but the Albanians did not follow this restriction and allowed also Muslim children to attend. It survived until 1902 under the teachers Leonidis and Naum Naça who were arrested and declared as traitors by Ottoman authorities at the request of Greek clergy with the school being closed down, vandalised and wrecked. Albanian efforts for an Albanian school are represented in Greek sources as a failure due to weak demand and limited funding, but Palairet notes that Greek interference undermined the school. In the late 1880s Gjerasim Qiriazi began his Protestant mission in the city. He and fellow members of the Qiriazi family established Albanian speaking institutions in Korçë, with his sister Sevasti Qiriazi founding the first Albanian girls school in 1891. It was started by Gjerasim Qiriazi and later run by his sisters, Sevasti and Parashqevi Qiriazi, together with Polikseni Luarasi (Dhespoti). Later collaborators were the Rev. &amp; Mrs. Grigor Cilka and Rev &amp; Mrs. Phineas Kennedy of the Congregational Mission Board of Boston. Both schools were closed by the Ottoman authorities during 1902–1904.

When the city was under French administration in 1916 (the Republic of Korçë), Greek schools were closed and 200 Albanian schools were opened. In the city of Korçë itself, four primary schools opened, and one secondary school opened and functioned quite successfully. A plebiscite was held and voters indicated that they wanted the Albanian schools to stay open. However, a few months later Greek schools were reopened as a reward and result of Greece&#x27;s adherence to the Entente alliance along with France. Particularly relevant was the opening in 1917 of the Albanian National Lyceum.
=== 1878–1914===
The rule of the Ottoman Empire over Korçë lasted until 1912 when Albania declared its independence. The city and its surroundings were supposed to become part of the Principality of Bulgaria, according to the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, while the Treaty of Berlin of the same year returned the area to Ottoman rule. In 1910, the Church Alliance of local Orthodox Albanians led to the proclamation of an Albanian church by Mihal Grameno, but this effort was too isolated to affect the population. The armed Albanian bands, or çeta groups, of Sali Butka, Spiro Bellkameni and Kajo Babjeni briefly liberated Korçë from the Ottomans in August 1912.

Korçë&#x27;s proximity to Greece, which claimed the entire Orthodox population as Greek, led to its being fiercely contested in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. Greek forces captured Korçë from the Ottomans on 6 December 1912 and afterwards proceeded to imprison the Albanian nationalists of the town.

Its incorporation into Albania in 1913 was disputed by Greece, who claimed it as part of the region called Northern Epirus, and resulted in a rebellion by the Greek population residing in the region of Korçë, who asked the intervention of the Greek army. This rebellion was initially suppressed by the Dutch commanders of the Albanian gendarmerie, that consisted of 100 Albanians led by the Orthodox Albanian nationalist Themistokli Gërmenji, and as a result the local Greek-Orthodox bishop Germanos and other members of the town council were arrested and expelled by the Dutch.

Under the terms of the Protocol of Corfu (May 1914), the city became part of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus inside the borders of the principality of Albania, but on 10 July 1914 the Greek Northern Epirote forces took over the city. Under Greek occupation, for the purpose of convincing the Congress of London of Greek expansionist claims, the Greek authorities took a census, which counted 15,453 inhabitants in the city, of which 11,453 were designated as &quot;Greeks&quot; and the rest 4,000 as &quot;Albanians&quot;, however, the census did not inquire about ethnicity, but rather instead explicitly had all Christians renamed &quot;Greeks&quot; and all Muslims changed to &quot;Albanians&quot;, by religious criteria alone.

At the time, even ethnographers sympathetic to the Greek claims considered the city Albanian. Since the passes over the Pindus mountain range were much difficult, the Greeks wished to retain this city after the 1914 occupation of parts of southern Albania because only Korçë granted the successful maintenance of communications by land between the territories of Epirus and Macedonia that were acquired by Greece in 1913.

=== 20th century ===
In October 1914 the city came again under Greek administration. During the period of the National Schism (1916) in Greece, a local revolt broke out, and with military and local support Korçë came under the control of Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27; Movement of National Defence, overthrowing the royalist forces. However, due to developments in the Macedonian Front of World War I the city came soon under French control (1916–1920).

The French initially awarded control of Korçë and the surrounding area to Greek allies, but Albanian &quot;çeta&quot; guerilla bands led by Themistokli Gërmenji and Sali Butka fought against Venizelist forces for Albanian self-administration. In response to the French administration supporting the Greek demands of Eleftherios Venizelos for the partition of southern Albania, Sali Butka - accompanied by Themistokli Gërmenji&#x27;s small armed band - led 1,500 men towards Korçë and surrounded the city. Sali Butka&#x27;s Albanian band burned Moscopole in response to the pro-Greek behaviour of the French administration, and threatened that Korçë would share the same fate. Meanwhile, the Venizelos Movement of National Defence was unable to dispatch reinforcements to the region, and French General Maurice Sarrail demanded the withdrawal of the local Greek garrison.

While Gërmenji negotiated with the French in the city, Butka continued the encirclement; eventually, Butka and the Albanians sent their demands to the French, which ultimately culminated in the creation of the Autonomous Province of Korçë. After coming to the conclusion that the local Albanians thoroughly disliked the Greek administration of the area, on 8 December 1916, Sarrail cabled that French military policy should change to support the Albanian nationalist uprising; by converting the Albanian uprising to the Allied cause, Sarrail hoped to protect his left flank and enable it to join up with the Italians in Vlorë and discourage the Austrians from trying to advance through Albania. Furthermore, a peaceful and stable allied Korçë under French influence would reduce the number of troops the French army needed to commit to hold the area.
On the 10th of December 1916, fourteen Albanian delegates, including seven Muslims and seven Christians, proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë. The French agreed to these demands and the fourteen representatives of Korçë and Colonel Descoins signed a protocol that proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army and with Themistokli Gërmenji as president. The French pursued policies which strengthened expressions of Albanian nationalism. Greek schools were closed down, Greek clergy and pro-Greek notables expelled while allowing Albanian education and promoting Albanian self-government through the autonomous Korçë republic, although Greek schools were reopened after a year and two months in February 1918. Another factor that reinforced Albanian sentiments among the population was the return of 20–30,000 Orthodox Albanian emigrants mainly to Korçë and the surrounding region who had attained Albanian nationalist sentiments abroad. The change in French policy to support the Albanians did create some tensions between France and Italy; the French assured the Italians that they did not have any territorial claims on either Korçë; General Sarrail&#x27;s reports insisted that the local Albanians had proclaimed the republic, then asked for it to be put under French protection, and that Descoins had merely complied with the wishes of the local population.

On 16 February 1918, Sarrail&#x27;s successor officially abrogated the proclamation, and following the re-entry of Greece into the war, made concessions to Greek interests including the reopening of Greek schools, but the Albanians were assured that this did not threaten their independence. The Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë remained a reality on the ground, continuing to rule its territory and fly its flag, while inter-religious cooperation was also maintained with both Muslims and Christians being grateful to the French for allowing them to continue their self-governance without much interference.

The Autonomous Republic of Korçë was greatly important for the Albanian nationalist movement, as it demonstrated to the world a resurgence in power for Albanian nationalism in one of the areas where it had been the strongest before the war, and it also demonstrated the successful cooperation of Albanian Christians and Muslims in governance. The government is considered to have been a successful experiment in Albanian self-administration, as the French allowed the entity to &quot;act as if it were an independent state&quot;, minting its own coinage, introducing its own flag, and printing its own stamps. According to Stickney, the republic gave Albanians the opportunity for self-government under the light tutelage of the French, and they were able to build a state in the absence of the great power rivalry that had beset King Wilhelm&#x27;s earlier government. However, this French initiative of Albanian self-rule ended without success and the head of this Republic was shot on the accusations of being an Austrian spy. It later became clear that the military tribunal had made a grave judicial error, its members having been led astray by Greek informers who wished Gërmenji removed since he was a powerful Albanian leader. The severity of this decision seems to indicate that the French military authorities favored the movement of Eleftherios Venizelos and their Greek allies who entered the war alongside the Entente on 12 June 1917, and were against the Albanian national movement led by Gërmenji.

In response to the French turning on the Albanians and the subsequent execution of Themistokli Gërmenji, Sali Butka gathered a force of 20,000 Albanians and surrounded Korçë yet again. He sent the French forces an ultimatum, and Korçë was once again handed over to the Albanians rather than the Greeks, as the French wanted to place Korçë under Greek administration. The Conference of ambassadors, considering Albania&#x27;s claims to the area, commissioned a League of Nations report consisting of three on the ground commissioners in December 1921. One commissioner, Finnish professor Jakob Sederholm noted in 1922 that Korçë&#x27;s population was &quot;entirely Albanian; the numbers of Greeks being insignificant&quot; and continued that &quot;there are, however, amongst the population two parties, — one nationalist and the other Grecophile&quot; Sederholm also stated that the Orthodox inhabitants of Korçë abstained from the elections, and criticized the Albanian government for drawing electoral districts in such a way so as to practically disenfranchise the Christian inhabitants. It ultimately remained part of Albania, as determined by the International Boundary Commission, which affirmed the country&#x27;s 1913 borders. Although assurances were given in the Paris Peace Conference by Albanian officials for the recognition of the Greek minority, Greek speech was prohibited in local education, religious life and in private within Korçë in the 1920s. At November 1921 the Albanian authorities expelled the Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishop Jakob. This event triggered demonstrations by the Orthodox community of the city. Immigration quotas during 1922-4 restricted former migrants returning to the United States and Korçë residents instead migrated to Australia to Moora, Western Australia and Shepperton, Victoria working in farming and agriculture related employment.

==== Communist Albania ====
Italian forces occupied Korçë in 1939, along with the rest of the country. During the Greco-Italian War it became the main forward base of the Italian air force. Nevertheless, the city came under the control of the advancing Greek forces, on 22 November 1940, during the first phase of the Greek counter-offensive. Korçë remained under Greek control until the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. After Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the war in 1943, the Germans occupied the town until 24 October 1944.

During the occupation, the city became a major centre of Communist-led resistance to the Axis occupation of Albania. The establishment of the Albanian Party of Labour—the Communist Party—was formally proclaimed in Korçë in 1941. Albanian rule was restored in 1944 following the withdrawal of German forces.

Right after World War II many people fled to Boston, United States joining a community of the Albanian-Americans, who had previously emigrated there.

After 1990 Korçë was one of the six cities where the New Democratic Party won all the constituencies. Popular revolts in February 1991 ended with the tearing down of Hoxha&#x27;s statue.

====Post-communist Albania====
After the fall of communism, the city fell into disregard in many aspects. However following the 2000s, the city experienced a makeover as main streets and alleys started to be reconstructed, locals began to renovate their historic villas, a calendar of events was introduced, building façades painted, and city parks reinvigorated. The European Union is financing the renovation of the Korça Old Bazaar while the city centre was redesigned, and a watch tower constructed.

With the prohibition of Greek education in the city, at c. 1922, there was a constant demand for the reopening a Greek school. After the collapse of the Socialist Republic, part of the local communities expressed a growing need to revive their cultural past, in particular with the reopening of Greek language institutions. In April 2005 the first bilingual Greek-Albanian school opened in Korçë after 60 years of prohibition of Greek education. In addition, a total of 17 Greek language tutoring centres function in the city. Students of the local Greek minority attend either private Greek institutions or Albanian public schools.

== Demography ==
Korçë is the 7th populous city in Albania and the largest city in the Korçë County. In 2007, the population of the city was about 86,176 inhabitants. According to the Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), the city of Korçë include 51,683 (25,478 male; 26,205 female) people as of the 2011 Census. The city of Korçë was one of the major centres of the Greek minority in southern Albania, the other being Gjirokastër. A Greek minority is still found in Korçë.

Aromanians of Korçë live mainly in one neighborhood of the city where they speak Aromanian, have Aromanian cultural associations that are divided between pro-Romanian and pro-Greek factions, receive church liturgy in Aromanian and maintain cultural and economic connections to Romania and Greece.

Romani also inhabit the city, in particular the &quot;Kulla e Hirit&quot; neighborhood and their presence in the city mainly dates to the early 20th century when they migrated from Turkey to Florina and ultimately Korçë.

For centuries Korçë has been an important religious centre for both Orthodox Christians and Muslims, hosting a significant Orthodox community as well as significant Sunni and Bektashi communities in and around the city. The main centre of the Bektashis of the area is the Turan Takya. In modern days, there are also smaller numbers of Catholics and Protestants in the city, as well the irreligious. The second Albanian Protestant church was opened in Korçë. In 1940, Korçë&#x27;s Evangelical Church was closed down by the Italian fascist forces.

Even before the foundation of the modern town, the Korçë district was initially part of the Metropolis of Kastoria (15th century), but in the early 17th century became the seat of an Orthodox bishop and in 1670 was elevated to metropolitan bishopric. The city remained entirely Christian until the first half of the 16th century. The Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George, a significant landmark in the city, was demolished by the authorities of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania during the atheistic campaign. The St. Sotir Church serves the Aromanian community of Korçë. It was built from 1995 to 2005. The church had already existed in the early 20th century, having been completed in 1925, but it was demolished by the Albanian communist authorities in 1959.

Islam entered the city in the 15th century through Iljaz Hoxha, an Albanian janissary, who actively participated in the Fall of Constantinople. One of the oldest mosques in Albania was built by Iljaz Hoxha in 1484, the Iliaz Mirahori Mosque.

<text>Fanny Marguerite Judith Ardant (born 22 March 1949) is a French actress and film director. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two César Awards and a Lumières Award.

== Early life ==
Ardant was born on 22 March 1949, in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, France, to a military attaché father. She grew up in Monaco until age 17, when she moved to Aix-en-Provence to study at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence. In her early twenties, her interest turned to acting and in 1974 she made her first appearance on stage.

== Career ==

By the early 1980s, Ardant was a major film star, gaining international recognition for her role opposite Gérard Depardieu in &quot;La Femme d&#x27;à côté&quot; (&quot;The Woman Next Door&quot;). The film, directed by François Truffaut, brought Ardant her first César Award nomination for best actress in 1982 and in 1984 she was nominated again for &quot;Vivement dimanche!&quot;. Eventually, she became Truffaut&#x27;s partner, giving birth to their daughter, Joséphine Truffaut, on 28 September 1983. Initially, her youthful beauty brought popularity but over time her sophistication and acting skills made her one of France&#x27;s most admired actresses. She proved her versatility, playing a comedic role in &quot;Pédale douce&quot; for which she won the 1997 César Award for Best Actress.

Fluent in English and Italian, Ardant has starred in several Hollywood and British films. Her most recent English-language film was the 2002 Franco Zeffirelli production &quot;Callas Forever&quot;, in which she portrayed opera diva Maria Callas. It opened the 14th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival on 9 January 2003. In 2003, Ardant received the Stanislavsky Award at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival (for the outstanding achievement in the career of acting and devotion to the principles of Stanislavsky&#x27;s school).

In 2009, she became a director and screenwriter, with &quot;Cendres et sang&quot; (&quot;Ashes and Blood&quot;). She also took part in a rare performance of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;La Haine&quot; on 19 July 2009 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Gérard Depardieu, the concert broadcast on France Musique.

In 2010, she directed a short feature, &quot;Absent Chimeras&quot; (&quot;Chimères absentes&quot; in French), in which she also stars. She made this short film in order to raise public awareness to the plight of Romani people in Europe, a cause she personally defends. In 2011, she starred in the music video for &quot;Elle me dit&quot;, the first French single by Lebanese singer Mika, and appeared in the play based on Joan Didion&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; in the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier, Paris. She also starred in &quot;Interno Giorno&quot; that same year by Tommaso Rossellini, acting in both French and Italian. In 2013, she made a cameo appearance as herself in &quot;The Great Beauty&quot;.

In 2018, Ardant starred in the Swiss drama film &quot;Shock Waves – Diary of My Mind&quot; by Ursula Meier. It was screened in the Panorama section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2019, Ardant directed the opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; at the Greek National Opera.

== Personal life ==
Fanny Ardant was the youngest of five children born to a cavalry officer and his wife. She was raised in Monte Carlo where she was educated at a convent school. A voracious reader, she discovered Proust at age 15 and felt as though his writings were for her.

When she was 27, her father died and the shock of his loss never left her. Ardant had started acting on stage shortly before his death. However after his death, she followed his advice and went to university in Aix-en-Provence, where she read Political Science. Upon graduation, she took a job working for the French embassy in London, from which she was sacked for poor time keeping and for being dishevelled. The latter was attributed to the social whirl she enjoyed in London.

Ardant continued working odd jobs in London before deciding, almost on a whim, to go to drama school. She returned to France for her studies and before long began acting on stage and then on television. At the age of 31 she was contacted by François Truffaut, who had spotted her in a television drama and wanted to cast her in &quot;The Woman Next Door&quot;. While working together, Ardant and Truffaut fell in love, and in 1983 she gave birth to their daughter Josephine. Truffaut died a year later from a brain tumour.

In August 2007, Ardant expressed her &quot;admiration&quot; for the Red Brigades leader as a &quot;hero&quot;, adding she &quot;considered the Red Brigades phenomenon to be very moving and passionate&quot;. For her comments, the actress was sued in the Italian courts by Piero Mazzola, the son of an Italian policeman killed by the Red Brigades.

In 2009, Ardant signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski. While traveling to a film festival, Polanski had been detained in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges. The petition argued that detaining Polanski would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

<text>Geraldo Rivera (born Gerald Rivera; July 4, 1943) is an American journalist, attorney, author, and political commentator who worked at the Fox News Channel from 2001 to 2023. He hosted the tabloid talk show &quot;Geraldo&quot; from 1987 to 1998. He gained publicity with the live 1986 TV special &quot;The Mystery of Al Capone&#x27;s Vaults&quot;. Rivera hosted the news magazine program &quot;Geraldo at Large&quot;, hosts the occasional broadcast of &quot;Geraldo Rivera Reports&quot; (in lieu of hosting &quot;At Large&quot;). He served as a rotating co-host of &quot;The Five&quot; from 2022 to 2023. As of February 2024, Rivera retains the spot of correspondent-at-large with NewsNation.

==Early life==
Rivera was born at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, the son of Lillian (née Friedman; 1924–2018) and Cruz &quot;Allen&quot; Rivera (1915–1987), a restaurant worker and taxicab driver respectively. He is of Galician ancestry through his father, who was from Puerto Rico. His mother was Ashkenazi Jewish, while his father was Roman Catholic. Rivera was raised &quot;mostly Jewish&quot; and had a bar mitzvah ceremony. He grew up in Brooklyn and West Babylon, New York, where he attended West Babylon High School. Rivera&#x27;s family was sometimes subjected to prejudice and racism, and his mother took to spelling their surname as &quot;Riviera&quot; to avoid having bigotry directed at them, although Riviera, Ribeira, Rivera, and Ribera are variations of the same name as spelled by Galician, Italian and Portuguese families. Rivera is a common family name in Puerto Rico, which received a significant population of colonists from Galicia, Spain, in the 16th century. The name Rivera is also very common among Sephardic Jews.

When I was born, my mother filled in my birth certificate with the name Gerald Riviera, adding an extra &quot;i&quot; to my father&#x27;s surname. She did the same thing for my sister Irene. Later, she would drop the pretense for my sister Sharon, only to pick it up again with the birth of my baby brother Craig. Whenever we asked about the inconsistencies, she would shrug shyly and joke her way out of it. &quot;I just forgot how to spell it&quot;, she would say, and leave it at that. Underneath, I came to realize, she was deeply embarrassed over what was a clumsy attempt at an ethnic cover-up.

From 1961 to 1963, he attended the State University of New York Maritime College in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx, where he was a member of the rowing team. Afterwards, he transferred to the University of Arizona, where he received a B.S. in business administration in 1965.

Following a series of jobs ranging from clothing salesman to short-order cook, Rivera enrolled at Brooklyn Law School in 1966. While a law student, he held internships with the New York County District Attorney under crime-fighter Frank Hogan and Harlem Assertion of Rights (a community-based provider of legal services) before receiving his J.D. near the top of his class in 1969. He then held a Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in the summer of 1969 before being admitted to the New York State Bar later that year.

After working with such organizations as the lower Manhattan-based Community Action for Legal Services and the National Lawyers Guild, Rivera became a frequent attorney for the East Harlem-based New York City chapter of the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican activist group, eventually precipitating his entry into private practice. This work attracted the attention of WABC-TV news director Al Primo when Rivera was interviewed about the group&#x27;s occupation of a neighborhood church in 1969. Primo offered Rivera a job and he began to study introductory broadcast journalism under Fred Friendly in the Ford Foundation-funded Summer Program in Journalism for Members of Minority Groups at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1970.

==Career==

===ABC News===
Rivera was hired by WABC-TV in 1970 as a reporter for &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. In 1972, he garnered national attention and won a Peabody Award for his report on the neglect and abuse of patients with intellectual disabilities at Staten Island&#x27;s Willowbrook State School and Rockland County&#x27;s Letchworth Village, and he began to appear on ABC national programs such as &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; upon their launches in 1978 and 1979 respectively. After John Lennon watched Rivera&#x27;s report on the patients at Willowbrook, he and Rivera put on a benefit concert called &quot;One to One&quot; on August 30, 1972, at Madison Square Garden in New York City (which Yoko Ono released posthumously in 1986, as &quot;Live in New York City&quot;).

In July 1973, Rivera taped the pilot episode of &quot;Good Night America&quot;, a late-night newsmagazine that he hosted (and executive produced). It began its semi-regular airing from April 1974 to June 1977 as part of the &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Entertainment&quot; program block. The show featured Ringo Starr&#x27;s &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot; as the theme. &quot;Good Night America&quot; tackled controversial topics of the era, including marijuana usage and the status of Vietnam War draft dodgers. The March 6, 1975 episode of the program, featuring Dick Gregory and Robert J. Groden, showed the first national telecast of the historic Zapruder film. All 33 episodes of &quot;Good Night America&quot; may be viewed and downloaded on Rivera&#x27;s web site.

On May 19, 1983, Rivera broadcast the first U.S. network television mention of &quot;AIDS&quot; by this name. (Other names had been used in the previous two years, as the disease was poorly understood at the time.) On &quot;20/20&quot;, he interviewed New York City lighting designer Ken Ramsauer. Ramsauer died aged 28, four days later; Rivera delivered a eulogy at Ramsauer&#x27;s Central Park memorial service.

In October 1985, ABC&#x27;s Roone Arledge refused to air a report done by Sylvia Chase for &quot;20/20&quot; on the relationship between Marilyn Monroe and John and Robert F. Kennedy. Rivera publicly criticized Arledge&#x27;s journalistic integrity, claiming that his friendship with the Kennedy family (for example, Pierre Salinger, a former Kennedy aide, worked for ABC News at the time) had caused him to spike the story; as a result, Rivera was fired. During a Fox News interview with Megyn Kelly aired May 15, 2015, Rivera stated the official reason given for the firing was that he violated ABC policy when he donated $200 to a non-partisan mayoral race candidate.

===Talk shows, specials, and guest appearances===

On April 21, 1986, Rivera hosted &quot;The Mystery of Al Capone&#x27;s Vaults&quot;. The special broadcast was billed as the unearthing of mobster Al Capone&#x27;s secret vaults, located under the old Lexington Hotel in Chicago. Millions of people watched the 2-hour show, which ultimately did not uncover any valuables from beneath the hotel. In a 2016 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Rivera commented, &quot;It was an amazingly high profile program—maybe the highest profile program I&#x27;ve ever been associated with.&quot;

In 1987, Rivera began producing and hosting the daytime talk show &quot;Geraldo&quot;, which ran for 11 years. The show featured controversial guests and theatricality, which led to the characterization of his show as &quot;trash TV&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot; and two United States senators. In another special in 1988, Rivera&#x27;s nose was broken in a well-publicized brawl during a show whose guests included white supremacists, antiracist skinheads, black activist Roy Innis, and militant Jewish activists.

In 1999, Rivera received an offer to host the game show &quot;Winning Lines&quot; on CBS, which was set to premiere in January 2000, but Rivera could not agree on the contract at the last minute and was replaced by Dick Clark.

From 1994 to 2001, Rivera hosted &quot;Rivera Live&quot;, a CNBC evening news and interview show which aired on weeknights.

In 1998, Rivera played himself in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; finale.

In 2009, Rivera played himself in the &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; episodes &quot;Inside Probe&quot; (parts 1 and 2). In the same year Rivera lent his voice to &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, playing newscaster Morty Williams in the episode &quot;Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!&quot;.

===Fox News===
Rivera left CNBC in November 2001—two months after the September 11 terrorist attacks—to become a Fox News war correspondent. Rivera&#x27;s brother Craig accompanied him as a cameraman on assignments in Afghanistan.

In 2001, during the War in Afghanistan, Rivera was derided for a report in which he claimed to be at the scene of a friendly fire incident; it was later revealed he was actually 300 miles away. Rivera blamed a minor misunderstanding for the discrepancy.

Controversy arose in early 2003, while Rivera was traveling with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq. During a Fox News broadcast, Rivera began to disclose an upcoming operation, even going so far as to draw a map in the sand for his audience. The military immediately issued a firm denunciation of his actions, saying it put the operation at risk; Rivera was expelled from Iraq. Two days later, he announced that he would be reporting on the Iraq conflict from Kuwait.

In 2005, Rivera engaged in a feud with &quot;The New York Times&quot; over their allegations that he pushed aside a member of a rescue team in order to be filmed &quot;assisting&quot; a woman in a wheelchair down some steps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In the ensuing controversy, Rivera appeared on television and demanded a retraction from the &quot;Times&quot;. He further threatened to sue the paper if one was not provided. The &quot;Times&quot; later acknowledged that Rivera did not push the woman aside.

In 2007, Rivera was involved in a dispute with fellow Fox colleague Michelle Malkin. Malkin announced that she would not return to &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, claiming that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements Rivera had made about her in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; interview. Rivera, while objecting to her views on immigration, said, &quot;Michelle Malkin is the most vile, hateful commentator I&#x27;ve ever met in my life. She actually believes that neighbors should start snitching out neighbors, and we should be deporting people.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s good she&#x27;s in D.C., and I&#x27;m in New York. I&#x27;d spit on her if I saw her.&quot; Rivera later apologized for his comments.

In 2008, Rivera&#x27;s book, titled &quot;HisPanic: Why Americans Fear Hispanics in the U.S.&quot;, was released.

On January 3, 2012, Rivera began hosting a weekday radio talk show on WABC (770 AM) in New York, N.Y. The show was scheduled in the two hours between &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; on WABC. On January 30, 2012, Rivera also began hosting a weekday show on KABC (790 AM) in Los Angeles.

On March 23, 2012, Rivera made comments regarding Trayvon Martin&#x27;s hoodie and how the hoodie was connected to Martin&#x27;s shooting death, specifically claiming that Martin would not have been shot if he was not wearing the hoodie, repeating them on subsequent occasions. Rivera apologized for any offense that he caused with the comments. His son Gabriel said that he was &quot;ashamed&quot;. Some people found the apology disingenuous; among those who did not accept it was Rivera&#x27;s longtime friend Russell Simmons. He later apologized to Trayvon Martin&#x27;s parents as well.

In 2015, Rivera competed on the 14th season of the television series &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, where he ultimately placed second to TV personality Leeza Gibbons. However, Rivera still raised the highest amount of money out of any contestant in the season, with $726,000, $12,000 more than Gibbons.

Rivera hosted the newsmagazine program &quot;Geraldo at Large&quot; and appears regularly on Fox News. On November 13, 2015, Rivera revealed on Fox that his daughter, Simone Cruickshank, was at the Stade de France when the attacks and explosions occurred; she and her friends made it out alive and would be returning safely home.

He continued to host a weekday talk radio show on WABC (770 AM) until a leadership change at parent company Cumulus Media resulted in his contract not being renewed in November 2015; Geraldo would later sue Cumulus for what he claimed was the reneging of a &quot;handshake agreement&quot; between him, previous chairman Lew Dickey and executive vice president John Dickey.

Rivera competed on season 22 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Edyta Śliwińska. On March 28, 2016, Rivera and Śliwińska were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition. On November 29, 2017, Rivera defended Matt Lauer, who had been fired by NBC after inappropriate sexual behavior was alleged, by saying, &quot;News is a flirty business.&quot; He later apologized after receiving heavy criticism. Part of the controversy stemmed from his 1991 book &quot;Exposing Myself&quot;, which bragged about his active social life in the 1960s and 1970s. In a 1991 interview with Barbara Walters, actress Bette Midler accused Rivera and one of his producers of having drugged and groped her during the early 1970s. The allegation resurfaced during the 2017 #MeToo movement. He issued a statement in November 2017 that claimed a different recollection of events than Midler&#x27;s and apologized for the incident.

The 2017 Kendrick Lamar song &quot;YAH.&quot; on his fourth studio album &quot;DAMN.&quot; mentions Rivera, who criticized Lamar&#x27;s performance of &quot;Alright&quot; at the BET Awards 2015. The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;DNA.&quot; also features Rivera&#x27;s negative comments about Lamar.

On September 22, 2018, Geraldo and WTAM (1100 AM) in Cleveland, Ohio announced that he would join the station to host a daily one-hour talk show, &quot;Geraldo in Cleveland&quot;, in addition to a weekly podcast on the parent iHeartRadio app, effective September 24. (Rivera resides in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights.)

On March 13, 2020, during a segment of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; discussing the coronavirus pandemic, Rivera stated, &quot;If you can&#x27;t hold your breath for 10 seconds. Everyone should do that. Hold your breath for 10 seconds. If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds then you don&#x27;t have this disease.&quot; This false claim has been debunked by medical experts.

On July 22, 2020, Rivera called President Trump &quot;brave&quot; for wishing Ghislaine Maxwell &quot;well&quot;, after a reporter questioned Trump over Maxwell&#x27;s charges of helping Jeffrey Epstein traffic and abuse children. Rivera called the fact that Maxwell had been denied bail and given solitary confinement an example of &quot;woke politics&quot;. Rivera had previously accused the judge who had denied bail to Maxwell of caving to the &quot;mob&quot;.

On September 6, 2020, Fox News presented a one-hour special segment, &quot;I Am Geraldo&quot;, on Rivera&#x27;s 50-year television career, which began with accolades for such from President Trump.

On April 8, 2021, during a discussion on St. Louis mayor-elect Tishaura Jones, Rivera asked fellow contributor Leo Terrell, a black man, &quot;when was the last time you were in the ghetto?&quot; Terrell then became outraged, with the two escalating into a shouting match. Rivera later apologized to Terrell on Twitter, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t mean it personally&quot;.

On December 14, 2021, Rivera called to account texts sent by Fox news anchors, including Sean Hannity to then-President Donald J. Trump asking for a forceful response to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol Building. Imploring, &quot;I beg you, Sean [Hannity], to remember the frame of mind you were in when you wrote that text on January 6th. And when Laura [Ingraham] did. And when Brian [Kilmeade] did. And when Don Jr. did. Remember that concern you had.&quot;

In January 2022, Rivera joined &quot;The Five&quot; as a rotating liberal co-host alongside Jessica Tarlov and Harold Ford Jr.. He announced on June 21, 2023, that he would be departing the program on June 30 but remaining with the network. A week later Rivera announced that he had been fired from &quot;The Five&quot; hours before his scheduled June 29 appearance. As a result he quit Fox News after 23 years, citing &quot;growing tension that goes beyond editorial differences and personal annoyances and gripes.&quot;

===NewsNation===

In February 2024, &quot;NewsNation&quot; announced Rivera would join the network as a correspondent-at-large. This followed him appearing on the network as a guest repeatedly in the months prior to the announcement.

==Personal life==
Rivera has been married five times:
# Linda Coblentz (1965–1969, divorced)
# Edith Vonnegut (December 14, 1971 – 1975, divorced)
# Sherryl Raymond (December 31, 1976 – 1984, divorced)son: Gabriel Miguel (born July 1979)

# Erica Michelle Levy (since August 2003)one daughter

Rivera has admitted to having a multi-year affair with Marian Javits, wife of New York Senator Jacob Javits, until 1985.

In a 1991 interview with Barbara Walters, actress and singer Bette Midler accused Rivera of groping her. In a 2017 tweet, Midler renewed the accusation. Rivera later tweeted a response, saying he recalled the incident &quot;much differently,&quot; and apologized, &quot;in the very least, publicly embarrassing her all those years ago.&quot;

Rivera is a resident of Shaker Heights, Ohio. He previously resided in Middletown Township, New Jersey, at Rough Point, an 1895 shingle-style estate.

Rivera is an active sailor. As owner and skipper of the sailing vessel &quot;Voyager&quot;, he participated in the Marion–Bermuda Cruising Yacht Race in 1985, 2005, 2011, and 2013. In 2013, his vessel finished in 12th place out of 34 finishers. He also sailed &quot;Voyager&quot; 1,400 miles up the Amazon river and around the world, going so far as to meet the King of Tonga on the international dateline in time for the new millennium. The adventures were chronicled in six one-hour-long specials on The Travel Channel, and some of this footage remains available on his website.

He has been a longtime resident of the Edgewater Colony, a community located along the Hudson River in Edgewater, New Jersey.

===Politics===
Rivera is a Republican. He has described himself as pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, and pro-immigration reform. Rivera supports some gun control. Following the Uvalde school shooting, he criticized the National Rifle Association (NRA) for saying that 18-year-olds should have the ability to purchase assault weapons, questioning why an 18-year-old is able to buy an assault weapon but not a beer.

In 2002, Rivera described himself as being a Zionist who would die for Israel. However, he also said that Palestinian suffering was turning him into a Palestinianist. Rivera has also frequently criticized Israeli treatment of Palestine. In 2017, Rivera criticized Israel for its military attacks on Gaza which killed civilians and babies. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Rivera said it was &quot;abhorrent&quot; that Palestinian children died in bombings from Israel retaliating against Hamas. That same year Rivera criticized the United States for providing arms to Israel which it used to bomb the Gaza Strip and sided with Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib in opposing the sale.

In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Rivera supported Democratic candidate Barack Obama, while in the 2012 election he supported Republican Mitt Romney. Despite his friendship with Donald Trump, Rivera has nevertheless confirmed that he did not vote for the Republican candidate in the 2016 election because of &quot;spousal influence&quot;. He had also previously said he would not vote for Trump because of comments made by the latter regarding Mexicans. He announced in 2024 that he would be voting for Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election due to his personal objections to the January 6 Capitol riots and his opposition to Trump&#x27;s economic policies.

Rivera considered running as a Republican in the 2013 U.S. Senate special election in New Jersey to fill the Senate seat left vacant by the death of Frank Lautenberg. He eventually decided not to stand for election. Rivera also considered running in the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Ohio after incumbent Senator Rob Portman announced he would not seek re-election for his seat in the Senate. He eventually decided not to.
