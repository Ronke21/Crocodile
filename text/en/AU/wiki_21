<text>Danbury ( ) is a city in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, located approximately northeast of New York City. Danbury&#x27;s population as of 2020 was 86,518. It is the third-largest city in Western Connecticut, and the seventh-largest city in Connecticut. Located within the heart of the Housatonic Valley region, the city is a commercial hub of western Connecticut, an outer-ring commuter suburb of New York City, and an historic summer colony of the New York metropolitan area and New England.

Danbury is nicknamed the &quot;Hat City&quot;, because it was once the center of the American hat industry, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The mineral danburite is named after Danbury, while the city itself is named for Danbury in Essex, England.

Danbury is home to Danbury Hospital, Western Connecticut State University, Danbury Fair Mall, and Danbury Municipal Airport.

==History==

Danbury was settled by colonists in 1685, when eight families moved from what are now Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut. The Danbury area was then called &quot;Pahquioque&quot; by its namesake, the Algonquian-speaking Pahquioque Native Americans (they are believed to have been a band of the Paugusset people), who occupied lands along the Still River. Bands were often identified by such geographic designation but they were associated with the larger nation by culture and language).

One of the original settlers in Danbury was Samuel Benedict, who bought land from the Paquioque in 1685, along with his brother James Benedict, James Beebe, and Judah Gregory. This area was also called Paquiack (&quot;open plain&quot; or &quot;cleared land&quot;) by the Paquioque. In recognition of the wetlands, the settlers chose the name Swampfield for their town. In October 1687, the general court decreed the name Danbury. The general court appointed a committee to lay out the new town&#x27;s boundaries. A survey was made in 1693, and a formal town patent was granted in 1702.

During the Revolutionary War, Danbury was an important military supply depot for the Continental Army. Sybil Ludington, 16-year-old daughter of American Colonel Henry Ludington, is said to have made a 40-mile ride in the early hours of the night on April 26, 1777, to warn the people of Danbury and her father&#x27;s forces in Putnam County, New York, of the approach of British regulars, helping them muster in defense; these accounts, originating from the Ludington family, are questioned by modern scholars.

During the following day on April 26, 1777, the British, under Major General William Tryon, burned and sacked Danbury, but fatalities were limited due to Ludington&#x27;s warning. The central motto on the seal of the City of Danbury is &quot;Restituimus&quot;, (Latin for &quot;We have restored&quot;), a reference to the destruction caused by the Loyalist army troops. The American General David Wooster was mortally wounded at the Battle of Ridgefield by the British forces which had raided Danbury, but at the beginning of the battle, the Americans succeeded in driving the British forces down to Long Island Sound. Wooster is buried in Danbury&#x27;s Wooster Cemetery; the private Wooster School in Danbury also was named in his honor.

In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, a group expressing fear of persecution by the Congregationalists of that town, in which he used the expression &quot;Separation of Church and State&quot;. It is the first known instance of the expression in American legal or political writing. The letter is on display at the Unitarian-Universalist Congregation of Danbury.

The first Danbury Fair was held in 1821. In 1869, it became a yearly event; the last edition was in 1981. The fairgrounds were cleared to make room for the Danbury Fair Mall, which opened in autumn 1986.


In 1835, the Connecticut Legislature granted a rail charter to the Fairfield County Railroad, but construction was delayed because of lack of investment. In 1850, the organization&#x27;s plans were scaled back, and renamed the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad. Work moved quickly on the railroad line. In 1852, the first railroad line in Danbury opened, with two trains making the 75-minute trip to Norwalk.

The central part of Danbury was incorporated as a borough in 1822. The borough was reincorporated as the city of Danbury on April 19, 1889. The city and town were consolidated on January 1, 1965.

The first dam to be built on the river, to collect water for the hat industry, impounded the Kohanza Reservoir. This dam broke on January 31, 1869, under pressure of ice and water. The ensuing flood of icy water killed 11 people within 30 minutes, and caused major damage to homes and farms.

As a busy city, Danbury attracted traveling shows and tours, including Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show in 1900. It featured young men of the Oglala Sioux nation, who re-enacted events from frontier history. Oglala Sioux Albert Afraid of Hawk died on June 29, 1900, at age 21 in Danbury during the tour. He was buried at Wooster Cemetery. In 2012, employee Robert Young discovered Afraid of Hawk&#x27;s remains. The city consulted with Oglala Sioux leaders of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and arranged repatriation of the remains to the nation. This meeting occurred in the Health Sciences Library of Danbury Hospital with assistance of the Chaplain. Wrapped in a bison skin, the remains were transported to Manderson, South Dakota, to Saint Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery, for reburial by tribal descendants.

In 1928 local plane pilots bought a tract near the Fairgrounds, known as Tucker&#x27;s Field, and leased it to the town. This was developed as an airport, which is now Danbury Municipal Airport .

Connecticut&#x27;s largest lake, Candlewood Lake (of which the extreme southern part is in Danbury), was created as a hydroelectric power facility in 1928 by building a dam where Wood Creek and the Rocky River meet near the Housatonic River in New Milford.

During World War II, Danbury&#x27;s federal prison was one of many sites used for the incarceration of conscientious objectors. One in six inmates in the United States&#x27; federal prisons was a conscientious objector, and prisons like Danbury found themselves suddenly filled with large numbers of highly educated men skilled in social activism. Due to the activism of inmates within the prison, and local laborers protesting in solidarity with the conscientious objectors, Danbury became one of the nation&#x27;s first prisons to desegregate its inmates.

On August 18–19, 1955, the Still River, which normally meandered slowly through downtown Danbury, overflowed its banks when Hurricane Diane hit the area, dropping six inches of rain on the city. This was in addition to the nine inches that fell from Hurricane Connie five days earlier. The water flooded stores, factories and homes along the river from North Street to Beaver Brook, causing $3 million in damages. Stores downtown on White Street between Main and Maple were especially hard hit. On October 13–16, another 12 inches of rain fell on Danbury, causing the worst flooding in the city&#x27;s history. This time, the river damaged all bridges across it, effectively cutting the city in half for several days. Flooding was more widespread than in August, and the same downtown areas hit in August were devastated once again. The resulting damage was valued at $6 million, and two people lost their lives. The City determined the river in the downtown area had to be tamed. $4.5 million in federal and state funding were acquired as part of a greater urban renewal project to straighten, deepen, widen, and enclose the river in a concrete channel through the downtown. At the same time, roads were relocated and rebuilt, 123 major buildings were razed and 104 families were relocated. This began various efforts by the City through 1975 towards urban renewal, using another $22 million of federal funding. However, these efforts failed to reinvigorate the central business district.

On February 13, 1970, brothers James and John Pardue detonated time bombs (injuring 26 people) at the police station, Union Savings Bank and in their getaway car to cover their escape from robbing the bank at gunpoint, the culmination of a two-year crime spree that included four bank robberies and five murders.

The flawed primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope was ground and polished in Danbury by Perkin-Elmer&#x27;s Danbury Optical System unit from 1979 to 1981. It was mistakenly ground to the wrong shape due to the use of a miscalibrated testing device. The mistake was not discovered until after the telescope was in orbit and began to be used. The effects of the flaw were corrected during the telescope&#x27;s first servicing mission in 1993.

In the August 1988 issue of &quot;Money&quot; magazine, Danbury topped the magazine&#x27;s list of the best U.S. cities to live in, mostly due to low crime, good schools, and location.
A case that would make national headlines and play out for over four years began on September 19, 2006, when eleven day laborers, who came to be known as the &quot;Danbury 11&quot;, were arrested in Danbury. A sting operation had been set up where day laborers were lured into a van whose driver, a disguised Danbury police officer posing as a contractor, promised them work. The laborers were driven to a parking lot where, if it was determined they were in the US illegally, were arrested by agents of ICE and the Danbury police. Yale University law students represented the men pro bono and filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city on their behalf. On March 8, 2011, it was confirmed a settlement had been reached in the case whereby Danbury agreed to pay the laborers $400,000 (Danbury&#x27;s insurance carrier paid the settlement plus legal fees of close to $1,000,000, less a $100,000 deductible). The federal government agreed to pay them $250,000. As part of the settlement, the City did not admit any wrongdoing and there were no changes in the city&#x27;s policies or procedures.

===Hatmaking in Danbury===

In 1780, what is traditionally considered to be the first hat shop in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict. (Hatmaking had existed in Danbury before the Revolution.) The Benedict shop had three employees, and they made 18 hats weekly. By 1800, Danbury was producing 20,000 hats annually, more than any other city in the U.S. Due to the fur felt hat coming back into style for men and increasing mechanization in the 1850s, by 1859 hat production in Danbury had risen to 1.5 million annually. By 1887, thirty factories were producing 5 million hats per year. Around this time, fur processing was separated from hat manufacturing when the P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company (1884) on Oil Mill Road and the White Brothers&#x27; factory began operation.

By 1880, workers had unionized, beginning decades of labor unrest. They struggled to achieve conditions that were more fair, going on strike; with management reacting with lockouts. Because of the scale of the industry, labor unrest and struggles over wages affected the economy of the entire town. In 1893, nineteen manufacturers locked out 4000 union hatters. In 1902, the American Federation of Labor union called for a nationwide boycott of Dietrich Loewe, a Danbury non-union hat manufacturer. The manufacturer sued the union under the Sherman Antitrust Act for unlawfully restraining trade. In the 1908 Danbury Hatters&#x27; Case the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the union was liable for damages. In the 1930s and 1940s, there were a number of violent incidents during several strikes, mostly involving scab workers brought in as strikebreakers.

Beginning in 1892, the industry was revolutionized when the large hat factories began to shift to manufacturing unfinished hat bodies only, and supplying them to smaller hat shops for finishing. While Danbury produced 24% of America&#x27;s hats in 1904, the city supplied the industry with 75% of its hat bodies. The turn of the century was the heyday of the hatting industry in Danbury, when it became known as the &quot;Hat City&quot; and the &quot;Hatting Capitol of the World&quot;. Its motto was &quot;Danbury Crowns Them All&quot;.

==== Mercury poisoning ====

The use of mercuric nitrate in the felting process poisoned many workers in the hat factories, creating a condition called erethism, also called &quot;mad hatter disease.&quot; The condition, known locally as the &quot;Danbury shakes&quot;, was characterized by slurred speech, tremors, stumbling, and, in extreme cases, hallucinations. The effect of mercury on the workers&#x27; health was first noted in the late 19th century. While workers in the Danbury factories lobbied for controls on mercury in the early 20th century, a government study on the health effects of mercury was not conducted until 1937. The State of Connecticut announced a ban on mercury in hatmaking in 1941.

While Danbury hat factories stopped using mercury in the 1940s, the mercury waste has remained in the Still River and adjacent soils, and has been detected at high levels in the 21st century.

==== Industry decline ====

By the 1920s, the hat industry was in decline. By 1923, only six manufacturers were left in Danbury, which increased the pressure on workers. After World War II, returning GIs went hatless, a trend that accelerated through the 1950s, dooming the city&#x27;s hat industry. The city&#x27;s last major hat factory, owned by Stetson, closed in 1964. The last hat was made in Danbury in 1987 when a small factory owned by Stetson closed.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, Danbury has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.94%, is water. The city is located in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains on low-lying land just south of Candlewood Lake (the City includes the southern parts of the lake). It developed along the Still River, which flows generally from west to east through the city before joining the Housatonic River. The city&#x27;s terrain includes rolling hills and not-very-tall mountains to the west and northwest called the Western Highland. Ground elevations in the city range from 378 feet to 1,050 feet above sea level.

A geologic fault known as Cameron&#x27;s Line runs through Danbury.

=== Pollution ===
The hatmaking fur-removal process was based on the use of mercury nitrate. The waste caused serious water pollution as the hat manufacturers dumped it into the Still River throughout the late 19th century and into the 1940s. This toxic product flowed into the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound, affecting water quality and various fish and other organisms.

Field studies conducted in the Still River basin in the 21st century have detected the continuing presence of high levels of mercury in the river sediments and nearby soils.

=== Climate ===
Danbury has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), with four distinct seasons, resembling Hartford more than coastal Connecticut or New York City. Summers are hot and humid, while winters are cold with significant snowfall. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July; on average, temperatures reaching occur on 18 and 3.1 days of the year, respectively. The average annual precipitation is approximately , which is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year; snow averages per season, although this total may vary considerably from year to year. Extremes in temperature range from on July 22, 1926, and July 15, 1995 (the highest temperature recorded in Connecticut) down to on February 9, 1934.

Danbury is the site of a low-security men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prison, the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution, located near the border with New Fairfield. Built in the 1940s to house men, the facility was converted to a women&#x27;s prison in 1994 to address a shortage of beds for low-security female inmates in other facilities. However, overcrowding at federal facilities for low-security males prompted a reconversion to a male prison, beginning in 2013, and relocation of the female inmates from the low-security Pembroke Road facility to other locations. As of 2016, an adjacent satellite camp houses up to 193 women. A new $25 million women&#x27;s facility was completed and began accepting female inmates in December 2016.

In October 2020, the city renamed its water pollution control plant the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant after John Oliver, the host of the late-night comedy program &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; jokingly insulted the city. Oliver attended the unveiling ceremony in person as a condition of Mayor Boughton.

==Transportation==
===Highways===

Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 7 are the main highways in the city. I-84 runs west to east from the lower Hudson Valley region of New York to Waterbury and Hartford. US 7 runs south to north from Norwalk (connecting to I-95) to the Litchfield Hills region. The two highways overlap in the downtown area. The principal surface roads through the city are Lake Avenue, West Street, White Street, and Federal Road.

===Buses===

Local bus service is provided by Housatonic Area Regional Transit (HART), and connects the entire Greater Danbury region as well as various train stations along the Harlem Line in Putnam County and Westchester County. A shuttle also operates between Downtown Danbury and Norwalk.

===Railroad===

Danbury is the terminus of the Danbury branch line of the MTA Metro-North Railroad which begins in Norwalk. The Danbury Branch provides commuter rail service from Danbury, to South Norwalk, Stamford, and Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The line was first built by the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad which was later bought by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company. Danbury was an important junction between the Danbury Branch and the Maybrook Line. The Maybrook line was the New Haven&#x27;s main freight line which terminated in Maybrook, New York, where the New Haven exchanged traffic with other railroads. After the ill-fated Penn Central took over the New Haven, the Maybrook line was shut down when a fire on the Poughkeepsie Bridge made the line unusable. Today, the historic station is part of the Danbury Railway Museum. The Providence and Worcester Railroad, along with the Housatonic Railroad provide local rail freight service in Danbury.

Frequent direct rail access to New York City is also available from Brewster station along Metro-North&#x27;s Harlem Line. The station is located just over the New York state line, roughly 8 miles from downtown. Plans are also being made to connect Danbury station to the Harlem Line, utilizing existing Maybrook Line track which is owned by the MTA. This plan has been dubbed the &quot;Fast track to NYC&quot;, as it will provide more frequent access between Danbury and Grand Central Terminal. In June 2022, a $2 million federal grant was approved to study the environmental impacts of the project.

=== Sports ===
====Ice hockey====

The United Hockey League (UHL) expanded to Danbury in 2004. The Danbury Trashers played their first season at the Danbury Ice Arena in October 2004. Among those on the roster included Brent Gretzky (brother of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky) and Scott Stirling (son of former New York Islanders coach Steve Stirling). Scott&#x27;s older brother, Todd, coached the Trashers in the 2004–2005 season. The team folded in 2006 after its owner, coach and management were charged (and later convicted) of several charges of wire fraud and racketeering.

On December 27, 2009, Danbury was named the first city to officially have a team in the newly formed Federal Hockey League (FHL). The team was named the Danbury Whalers, bringing back the name &quot;Whalers&quot; to Connecticut for the first time since 1997 when the Hartford Whalers of the WHA/NHL moved to North Carolina and became the Carolina Hurricanes. At the end of the 2014–2015 season, the Danbury Ice Arena evicted the Danbury Whalers. However, a new FHL Danbury team called the Danbury Titans was approved for the 2015–2016 season, owned by local car dealership owner Bruce Bennett. The Titans folded after two seasons.

The Danbury Ice Arena was sold and put under new management in 2019. The arena then added a third FPHL franchise called the Danbury Hat Tricks, a Tier III junior team called the Danbury Colonials, and the relocation of the Premier Hockey Federation&#x27;s Connecticut Whale.

<text>Darien ( ) is a coastal town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. With a population of 21,499 and a land area of just under , it is the smallest town on Connecticut&#x27;s Gold Coast.

Situated on the Long Island Sound between the cities of Stamford and Norwalk, Darien is a commuter town for New York City. There are two railroad stations in Darien, Noroton Heights and Darien, linking the town to Grand Central Terminal.

==History==

According to early records, the first clearings of land were made by men from the New Haven and Wethersfield colonies and from Norwalk in about 1641. It was not until 1739, however, that the Middlesex Society of the Town of Stamford built the first community church, now the First Congregational Church of Darien, which stands on the original site at the corner of Brookside Road and the Boston Post Road.

Tories raided the town several times during the American Revolution; at one point, they took 26 men in the parish prisoner for five months, including the Reverend Moses Mather, pastor of the parish. The Loyalist-Patriot conflict in Darien is the setting for the novel &quot;Tory Hole&quot;, the first book by children&#x27;s author Louise Hall Tharp. Middlesex Parish was incorporated as the Town of Darien in 1820.

According to the Darien Historical Society, the name Darien was decided upon when the residents of the town could not agree on a name to replace Middlesex Parish, many families wanting it to be named after themselves. Some proposed naming the town &quot;Belleville&quot; in honor of Thaddeus Bell, a veteran of the revolutionary war. He apparently rejected the honor while supporting the Darien option. A sailor who had traveled to Isthmus of Darien, then part of the Spanish Empire, suggested the name Darien, which was eventually adopted by the people of the town. The town name is pronounced (like &quot;Dairy-Ann&quot;), with stress on the last syllable, and has been referred to as such at least as far back as 1913.

Darien was mostly white Protestant through the middle of the twentieth century, but by the twenty-first century it had become a multi-ethnic town with residents of many religions and backgrounds. One of seven households report speaking a language other than English at home. The town&#x27;s exclusive policies in the early 20th century were similar to other segregated suburbs of the time, including Beverly Hills, California, and Tuxedo Park, New York. There were events involving anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism in the 1930s and 1940s, with Darien being a prototypical sundown town.

<doc id="149536" wikidata="Q138345" url="?curid=149536" title="Liberal Party of Canada">
<text>The Liberal Party of Canada (LPC; , PLC) is a federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with their main rival, the Conservative Party, positioned to their right and the New Democratic Party positioned to their left. The party is described as &quot;big tent&quot;, practicing &quot;brokerage politics&quot;, attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. The Liberal Party is the longest-serving and oldest active federal political party in the country, and has dominated federal politics of Canada for much of its history, holding power for almost 70 years of the 20th century. As a result, it has sometimes been referred to as Canada&#x27;s &quot;natural governing party&quot;.

Founded in 1867, the party first came into power in 1873 under Alexander Mackenzie, but were voted out five years later due to the economic conditions at the time. They would not come back to office until 1896; Wilfrid Laurier was prime minister from that year until the party&#x27;s defeat in 1911 and his tenure was marked by several compromises between English and French Canada. The party then governed again from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and from 1935 to 1957 first under William Lyon Mackenzie King and then Louis St. Laurent, both of whom gradually built a Canadian welfare state. Lester B. Pearson expanded the welfare state during his tenure as prime minister from 1963 to 1968, while his successor, Pierre Trudeau, continued this expansion while promoting economic nationalism, social progressivism, and a more independent foreign policy during his governance from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. After electoral defeats in 1984 and 1988, the party returned to power in 1993 under Jean Chrétien, who combined social liberalism with fiscal conservatism through a Third Way philosophy, a tradition which continued under his successor, Paul Martin, until the party lost power in 2006. The party regained power under Justin Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015.

The Liberals&#x27; signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, gun control, the patriation of the Constitution of Canada and the establishment of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and expanded access to abortion.

==History==
===19th century===

====Origins====

The Liberals are descended from the mid-19th century Reformers who advocated for responsible government throughout British North America. These included George Brown, Alexander Mackenzie, Robert Baldwin, William Lyon Mackenzie and the Clear Grits in Upper Canada, Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia, and the Patriotes and Rouges in Lower Canada led by figures such as Louis-Joseph Papineau. The Clear Grits and sometimes functioned as a united bloc in the legislature of the Province of Canada beginning in 1854, but a united Liberal Party combining both English and French Canadian members was not formed until 1867.

====Confederation====
At the time of Confederation of the former British colonies of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, the radical Liberals were marginalized by the more pragmatic Conservative coalition assembled under Sir John A. Macdonald. In the 29 years after Confederation, the Liberals were consigned to opposition, with the exception of one stint in government. Alexander Mackenzie was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Official Opposition after Confederation and finally agreed to become the first official leader of the Liberal Party in 1873. He was able to lead the party to power for the first time in 1873, after the Macdonald government resigned over the Pacific Scandal. Mackenzie subsequently won the 1874 election and served as prime minister for an additional four years. During the five years the Liberal government brought in many reforms, including the replacement of open voting by secret ballot, confining elections to one day and the creation of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Royal Military College of Canada, and the Office of the Auditor General; however, the party was only able to build a solid support base in Ontario and in 1878 lost the government to Macdonald. The Liberals would spend the next 18 years in opposition.

====Wilfrid Laurier====

In their early history, the Liberals were the party of continentalism and opposition to imperialism. The Liberals also became identified with the aspirations of Quebecers as a result of the growing hostility of French Canadians to the Conservatives. The Conservatives lost the support of French Canadians because of the role of Conservative governments in the execution of Louis Riel and their role in the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and especially their opposition to French schools in provinces besides Quebec.

It was not until Wilfrid Laurier became leader that the Liberal Party emerged as a modern party. Laurier was able to capitalize on the Conservatives&#x27; alienation of French Canada by offering the Liberals as a credible alternative. Laurier was able to overcome the party&#x27;s reputation for anti-clericalism that offended the still-powerful Quebec Roman Catholic Church. In English-speaking Canada, the Liberal Party&#x27;s support for reciprocity made it popular among farmers, and helped cement the party&#x27;s hold in the growing prairie provinces.

Laurier led the Liberals to power in the 1896 election (in which he became the first Francophone Prime Minister) and oversaw a government that increased immigration to settle Western Canada. Laurier&#x27;s government created the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta out of the North-West Territories and promoted the development of Canadian industry.

===20th century===

====Organization====

Until the early part of the century, the Liberal Party was a loose coalition of local, provincial, and regional bodies with a strong national party leader and caucus, but with an informal and regionalized extra-parliamentary organizational structure. There was no national membership of the party. An individual became a member by joining a provincial Liberal party. Laurier called the party&#x27;s first national convention in 1893 to unite Liberal supporters behind a programme and build the campaign that successfully brought the party to power in 1896, but no efforts were made to create a formal national organization outside Parliament.

As a result of the party&#x27;s defeats in the 1911 and 1917 federal elections, Laurier attempted to organize the party on a national level by creating three bodies: the Central Liberal Information Office, the National Liberal Advisory Committee, and the National Liberal Organization Committee. However, the advisory committee became dominated by members of Parliament and all three bodies were underfunded and competed with both local and provincial Liberal associations and the national caucus for authority. The party did organize the national party&#x27;s second convention in 1919 to elect William Lyon Mackenzie King as Laurier&#x27;s successor (Canada&#x27;s first leadership convention), yet following the party&#x27;s return to power in the 1921 federal election the nascent national party organizations were eclipsed by powerful ministers and local party organizations largely driven by patronage.

As a result of both the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1930 federal election and the Beauharnois scandal, which highlighted the need for distance between the Liberal Party&#x27;s parliamentary wing and campaign fundraising, a central coordinating organization, the National Liberal Federation, was created in 1932 with Vincent Massey as its first president. With the Liberal return to power, the national organization languished except for occasional national committee meetings, such as in 1943 when Mackenzie King called a meeting of the federation (consisting of the national caucus and up to seven voting delegates per province) to approve a new platform for the party in anticipation of the end of World War II and prepare for a post-war election. No national convention was held, however, until 1948; the Liberal Party held only three national conventions prior to the 1950s – in 1893, 1919 and 1948. The National Liberal Federation remained largely dependent on provincial Liberal parties and was often ignored and bypassed the parliamentary party in the organization of election campaigns and the development of policy. With the defeat of the Liberals in the 1957 federal election and in particular 1958, reformers argued for the strengthening of the national party organization so it would not be dependent on provincial Liberal parties and patronage. A national executive and Council of presidents, consisting of the presidents of each Liberal riding association, were developed to give the party more co-ordination and national party conventions were regularly held in biennially where previously they had been held infrequently. Over time, provincial Liberal parties in most provinces were separated from provincial wings of the federal party and in a number of cases disaffiliated. By the 1980s, the National Liberal Federation was officially known as the Liberal Party of Canada.

====Canadian sovereignty====

Under Laurier, and his successor William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberals promoted Canadian sovereignty and greater independence within the British Commonwealth. In Imperial Conferences held 
throughout the 1920s, Canadian Liberal governments often took the lead in arguing that the United Kingdom and the dominions should have equal status, and against proposals for an &#x27;imperial parliament&#x27; that would have subsumed Canadian independence. After the King–Byng Affair of 1926, the Liberals argued that the Governor General of Canada should no longer be appointed on the recommendation of the British government. The decisions of the Imperial Conferences were formalized in the Statute of Westminster, which was actually passed in 1931, the year after the Liberals lost power.

The Liberals also promoted the idea of Canada being responsible for its own foreign and defence policy. Initially, it was Britain which determined external affairs for the dominion. In 1905, Laurier created the Department of External Affairs, and in 1909 he advised Governor General Earl Grey to appoint the first Secretary of State for External Affairs to Cabinet. It was also Laurier who first proposed the creation of a Canadian Navy in 1910. Mackenzie King recommended the appointment by Governor General Lord Byng of Vincent Massey as the first Canadian ambassador to Washington in 1926, marking the Liberal government&#x27;s insistence on having direct relations with the United States, rather than having Britain act on Canada&#x27;s behalf.

====Social safety net====
In the period just before and after the Second World War, the party became a champion of &#x27;progressive social policy&#x27;. As prime minister for most of the time between 1921 and 1948, King introduced several measures that led to the creation of Canada&#x27;s social safety net. Bowing to popular pressure, he introduced the mother&#x27;s allowance, a monthly payment to all mothers with young children. He also reluctantly introduced old age pensions when J. S. Woodsworth required it in exchange for his Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party&#x27;s support of King&#x27;s minority government.

Louis St. Laurent succeeded King as Liberal leader on August 7, 1948 and as prime minister on November 15, 1948. In the 1949 and 1953 federal elections, St. Laurent led the Liberal Party to two large majority governments. As prime minister he oversaw the joining of Newfoundland in Confederation as Canada&#x27;s tenth province, he established equalization payments to the provinces, and continued with social reform with improvements in pensions and health insurance. In 1956, Canada played an important role in resolving the Suez Crisis, and contributed to the United Nations force in the Korean War. Canada enjoyed economic prosperity during St. Laurent&#x27;s premiership and wartime debts were paid off. The Pipeline Debate proved the Liberal Party&#x27;s undoing. Their attempt to pass legislation to build a natural gas pipeline from Alberta to central Canada was met with fierce disagreement in the House of Commons. In 1957, John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives won a minority government and St. Laurent resigned as prime minister and Liberal leader.
Lester B. Pearson was easily elected Liberal leader at the party&#x27;s 1958 leadership convention. However, only months after becoming Liberal leader, Pearson led the party into the 1958 federal election that saw Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives win the largest majority government, by percentage of seats, in Canadian history. The Progressive Conservatives won 206 of the 265 seats in the House of Commons, while the Liberals were reduced to just 48 seats. Pearson remained Liberal leader during this time and in the 1962 election managed to reduce Diefenbaker to a minority government. In the 1963 election Pearson led the Liberal Party back to victory, forming a minority government. Pearson served as prime minister for five years, winning a second election in 1965. While Pearson&#x27;s leadership was considered poor and the Liberal Party never held a majority of the seats in parliament during his premiership, he left office in 1968 with an impressive legacy. Pearson&#x27;s government introduced Medicare, a new immigration act, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, the Canada Assistance Plan, and adopted the Maple Leaf as Canada&#x27;s national flag.

====Pierre Trudeau====

Under Pierre Trudeau, the mission of a progressive social policy evolved into the goal of creating a &quot;just society&quot;. In the late 1970s, Trudeau stated that his Liberal Party adhered to the &quot;radical centre&quot;.

The Liberal Party under Trudeau promoted official bilingualism and passed the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;, which gave French and English languages equal status in Canada. Trudeau hoped that the promotion of bilingualism would cement Quebec&#x27;s place in Confederation, and counter growing calls for an independent Quebec. The party hoped the policy would transform Canada into a country where English and French Canadians could live together, and allow Canadians to move to any part of the country without having to lose their language. Although this vision has yet to fully materialize, official bilingualism has helped to halt the decline of the French language outside of Quebec, and to ensure that all federal government services (including radio and television services provided by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Radio-Canada) are available in both languages throughout the country.

The Trudeau Liberals are also credited with support for state multiculturalism as a means of integrating immigrants into Canadian society without forcing them to shed their culture, leading the party to build a base of support among recent immigrants and their children. This marked the culmination of a decades-long shift in Liberal immigration policy, a reversal of pre-war racial attitudes that spurred discriminatory policies such as the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 and the MS St. Louis incident.

The most lasting effect of the Trudeau years has been the patriation of the Constitution of Canada and the creation of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals supported the concept of a strong, central government, and fought Quebec separatism, other forms of Quebec nationalism, and the granting of &quot;distinct society&quot; status to Quebec; however, such actions served as rallying cries for sovereigntists, and alienated many Francophone Quebeckers.

The other primary legacy of the Trudeau years has been financial. Net federal debt in fiscal 1968, just before Trudeau became prime minister, was about $18 billion CAD, or 26 percent of gross domestic product; by his final year in office, it had ballooned to over 200 billion—at 46 percent of GDP, nearly twice as large relative to the economy.

====John Turner====

After Trudeau&#x27;s retirement in 1984, many Liberals, such as Jean Chrétien and Clyde Wells, continued to adhere to Trudeau&#x27;s concept of federalism. Others, such as John Turner, supported the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown Constitutional Accords, which would have recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; and would have increased the powers of the provinces to the detriment of the federal government.

Trudeau stepped down as prime minister and party leader in 1984, as the Liberals were slipping in polls. At that year&#x27;s leadership convention, Turner defeated Chrétien on the second ballot to become party leader and (following Trudeau&#x27;s resignation) prime minister. Immediately, upon taking office, Turner called a snap election, citing favourable internal polls. However, the party was hurt by numerous patronage appointments, many of which Turner had made supposedly in return for Trudeau retiring early. Also, they were unpopular in their traditional stronghold of Quebec because of the constitution repatriation which excluded that province. The Liberals lost power in the 1984 election, and were reduced to only 40 seats in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority of the seats in every province, including Quebec. The 95-seat loss was the worst defeat in the party&#x27;s history, and the worst defeat at the time for a governing party at the federal level. What was more, the New Democratic Party, successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, won only ten fewer seats than the Liberals, and some thought that the NDP under Ed Broadbent would push the Liberals to third-party status.

The party began a long process of reconstruction. A small group of young Liberal MPs, known as the Rat Pack, gained fame by criticizing the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney at every turn. Also, despite public and backroom attempts to remove Turner as leader, he managed to consolidate his leadership at the 1986 review.

The 1988 election was notable for Turner&#x27;s strong opposition to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement negotiated by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Although most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, Mulroney&#x27;s &quot;Tories&quot; were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal. The Liberals recovered from their near-meltdown of 1984, however, winning 83 seats and ending much of the talk of being eclipsed by the NDP, who won 43 seats.

====Jean Chrétien====

Turner announced that he would resign as leader of the Liberal Party on May 3, 1989. The Liberal Party set a leadership convention for June 23, 1990, in Calgary. Five candidates contested the leadership of the party, with former Deputy Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, who had served in every Liberal cabinet since 1965, and Paul Martin, MP and former CEO of Canada Steamship Lines, as the frontrunners. A key moment in that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal, where the discussion quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord. Martin, favouring Meech, attempted to force Chrétien to abandon his nuanced position on the deal and declare for or against it. When Chrétien refused to endorse the deal, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant &quot;vendu&quot; (&quot;sellout&quot; in French) and &quot;Judas&quot; at Chrétien. The incident damaged Chrétien&#x27;s reputation in Quebec, and lead to a lasting animosity between Chrétien and Martin. Chrétien won on the first ballot.

Chrétien&#x27;s Liberals campaigned in the 1993 election on the promise of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and eliminating the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Just after the writ was dropped for the election, they issued the Red Book, an integrated and coherent approach to economic, social, environmental and foreign policy. This was unprecedented for a Canadian party. Taking full advantage of the inability of Mulroney&#x27;s successor, Kim Campbell, to overcome a large amount of antipathy toward Mulroney, they won a strong majority government with 177 seats—the third-best performance in party history, and their best since 1949. The Progressive Conservatives were cut down to only two seats, suffering a defeat even more severe than the one they had handed the Liberals nine years earlier. The Liberals were re-elected with a considerably reduced majority in 1997, but nearly tied their 1993 total in 2000.

For the next decade, the Liberals dominated Canadian politics in a fashion not seen since the early years of Confederation. This was because of the splintering of the Progressive Conservative&#x27;s electoral coalition. The PCs&#x27; Western support, for all practical purposes, transferred &quot;en masse&quot; to the Western-based Reform Party, which replaced the PCs as the largest right-wing party in Canada; however, the party was unable to overcome perceptions of extremism and that it was merely a Western protest party, and was virtually non-existent east of Manitoba. Meanwhile, the Quebec nationalists who had once supported the Tories largely switched their support to the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois, while the Tories&#x27; Ontario support largely moved to the Liberals. With a divided opposition, the Liberals were able to reap large majorities—especially in Ontario, where the party won all but one seat in 1993, all but two in 1997 and all but three in 2000. However, there was some disappointment as Liberals were not able to recover their traditional dominant position in Quebec, despite being led by a Quebecer.
While the Chrétien Liberals campaigned from the left, their time in power is most marked by the cuts made to many social programs, including health transfers, in order to balance the federal budget. Although Chrétien had supported the Charlottetown Accord while in opposition, in government he opposed major concessions to Quebec and other provincialist factions. In contrast to their promises during the 1993 campaign, they implemented only minor changes to NAFTA, embraced the free trade concept and—with the exception of the replacement of the GST with the Harmonized Sales Tax in some Atlantic provinces—broke their promise to replace the GST.

After a proposal for Quebec independence was narrowly defeated in the 1995 Quebec referendum, the Liberals passed the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, which outlines the federal government&#x27;s preconditions for negotiating provincial independence. In Chrétien&#x27;s final term, he supported same-sex marriage, decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of marijuana, and ratified the Kyoto Protocol. On March 17, 2003, Chrétien announced that Canada would not support the invasion of Iraq, which caused friction with the United States. However, a poll conducted by EKOS for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;La Presse&quot; shortly afterwards showed widespread approval of Chrétien&#x27;s decision by the Canadian public: 71 percent of those questioned approved of the government&#x27;s decision to not enter the United States-led invasion, with 27 percent expressing disapproval.

In Chrétien&#x27;s final weeks as prime minister, he introduced legislation to reduce the maximum allowable donation to a political party or candidate to $5,000. The move came as a surprise even to Liberal supporters, as Chrétien had not done anything about election financing at any other point in his ten years in office. Political observers suggested that the move allowed Chrétien to retire on a positive note while saddling Martin, his longstanding rival and successor, with the burden of having to fight an election under the strict new rules.

===21st century===
====Paul Martin====

Martin succeeded Chrétien as party leader and prime minister in 2003. Despite the personal rivalry between the two, Martin was Minister of Finance during the 1990s and was the architect of the Liberals&#x27; economic policies. Chrétien left office with a high approval rating and Martin was expected to make inroads into Quebec and Western Canada, two regions of Canada where the Liberals had not attracted much support since the 1980s and 1990s, respectively.

The political situation changed with the revelation of the sponsorship scandal, in which advertising agencies supporting the Liberal Party received grossly inflated commissions for their services. Having faced a divided conservative opposition for the past three elections, Liberals were seriously challenged by competition from the newly united Conservative Party led by Stephen Harper. The infighting between Martin and Chrétien&#x27;s supporters also dogged the party. Nonetheless, by criticizing the Conservatives&#x27; social policies, the Liberals were able to draw progressive votes from the NDP, which made the difference in several close races. In the 2004 election, the Liberals retained enough support to continue as the government, though they were reduced to a minority.

In the midst of various court rulings in 2003 and 2004 that allowed for the legalization of same-sex marriage in seven provinces and one territory, the Martin government proposed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage across Canada. The House of Commons passed the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in late June 2005 in a late-night, last-minute vote before Parliament closed down, the Senate passed it in July 2005, and it received Royal Assent on July 20. This made Canada the fourth country in the world to allow same-sex marriages. In November 2005, the Martin government brokered a deal between first ministers and aboriginal leaders known as the Kelowna Accord, which sought to improve the education, skills training, housing and health care of aboriginal peoples by providing $5 billion in funding over five years.

Following the release of the first Gomery Report, the Liberals dropped in polls. Nonetheless, Martin turned down the NDP&#x27;s conditions for continued support, as well as rejecting an opposition proposal which would schedule a February 2006 election in return for passing several pieces of legislation. The Liberals thus lost a confidence vote on November 28, and Martin advised Governor General Michaëlle Jean to dissolve Parliament and call an election for January 2006.

The Liberal campaign was dogged from start to finish by the sponsorship scandal, which was brought up by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) criminal investigation into the leak of the income trust announcement. Numerous gaffes, contrasting with a smoothly run Conservative campaign, put Liberals as many as ten points behind the Conservatives in opinion polling. They managed to recover some of their momentum by election night, but not enough to retain power. They won 103 seats, a net loss of 30 from when the writs were dropped, compared to 124 for the Conservatives. Martin resigned as Liberal leader on March 18.

====Struggles in opposition====
The ensuing leadership election was set for December 2, 2006, in Montreal. Eight candidates entered the contest, but only Michael Ignatieff, Bob Rae, Stéphane Dion and Gerard Kennedy were considered to be the capable of garnering enough support to be able to win the leadership, with Ignatieff and Rae being considered the front-runners. Although Ignatieff lead on the first two ballots, on the third ballot Dion picked up enough support from the eliminated Kennedy to leapfrog both Rae and Ignatieff, eliminating Rae. On the fourth and final ballot, Dion defeated Ignatieff to become leader of the Liberal Party.

Dion campaigned on environmental sustainability during the leadership race, which later evolved into the &quot;Green Shift&quot;: a proposal for a national carbon tax that would be offset by reductions to income tax rates. The plan was a key policy for the party in the 2008 federal election, but it was not well received and was continuously attacked by both the Conservatives and NDP. On election night, the Liberal Party won 26.26 percent of the popular vote and 77 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons. At that time, their popular support was the lowest in the party&#x27;s history, and weeks later Dion announced he would step down as Liberal leader once his successor was chosen.

However, the 2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute made Dion&#x27;s continued leadership untenable: an agreement to form a coalition government between the with NDP faced public opposition if it meant Dion was to be become prime minister, even if only until the leadership election. Dion thus resigned as leader on December 8, with caucus selecting Ignatieff as interim leader. However, Harper prorogued Parliament before a confidence vote could be scheduled. When parliament resumed on January 28, 2009, the Ignatieff Liberals agreed to support the budget as long as it included regular accountability reports, which the Conservatives accepted. This ended the possibility of the coalition government with the New Democrats. Ignatieff was formally named leader on May 2, 2009.
By the time Ignatieff was confirmed as party leader, the Liberal Party had a comfortable lead over the governing Conservatives. Support fell over the summer as Ignatieff was characterized of &quot;missing in action&quot;, and Ignatieff announced on August 31, 2009, that the Liberals would not support the minority Conservative government when Parliament resumed. A month later, on October 1, the Liberals put forth a non-confidence motion; however, the NDP abstained from voting and the Conservative government survived. The attempt to force an election, just a year after the previous one, was viewed as a miscalculation, as polls showed that most Canadians did not want another election. Afterwards, popularity for Ignatieff and his party continued to fall. Over the next year and a half, with the exception of a brief period in early 2010, support for the Liberals remained below 30 percent, and behind the Conservatives.
Shortly after the Harper government was found to be in Contempt of Parliament over the Canadian Afghan detainee issue, Ignatieff successfully introduced a motion of no confidence against the government, beginning the 2011 election. The Liberals had considerable momentum when the writ was dropped, and Ignatieff successfully squeezed NDP leader Jack Layton out of media attention by issuing challenges to Harper for one-on-one debates. However, opponents frequently criticized Ignatieff&#x27;s perceived political opportunism, particularly during the Leaders&#x27; debates when Layton criticized Ignatieff for having a poor attendance record for Commons votes: &quot;You know, most Canadians, if they don&#x27;t show up for work, they don&#x27;t get a promotion.&quot; Ignatieff failed to defend himself against these charges, and the debates were said to be a turning point in the campaign.

On election day, the Liberals took the biggest loss in their history. The result was a third-place finish, with only 19 percent of the vote and returning 34 seats in the House of Commons. Notably, their support in Toronto and Montreal, their power bases for the last two decades, all but vanished. The Conservatives won 40 percent of the vote and formed a majority government, while the NDP won 31 percent of the vote and formed the Official Opposition. It marked the first time the Liberals were unable to form either government or the official opposition. Ignatieff was defeated in his own riding and announced his resignation as Liberal leader shortly after. Bob Rae was chosen as the interim leader on May 25, 2011.

Pundits widely viewed the 2011 election as a political realignment and questioned the Liberal Party&#x27;s viability.&quot;The Economist&quot; said, &quot;the election represents the biggest realignment of Canadian politics since 1993&quot;; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; writer Andrew Coyne wrote that &quot;the Conservatives are now in a position to replace the Liberals as the natural governing party in Canada.&quot; Books such as &quot;The Big Shift&quot; by John Ibbitson and Darrell Bricker, and Peter C. Newman&#x27;s &quot;When the Gods Changed: The Death of Liberal Canada&quot;, asserted that the Liberals had become an &quot;endangered species&quot;.

====Justin Trudeau====

On April 14, 2013, Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was elected leader of the Liberal Party on the first ballot, winning 80% of the vote. Following his win, support for the Liberal Party increased considerably, and the party moved into first place in public opinion polls. In response, the Conservatives ran a series of ads attempting to &quot;[paint] him as a silly dilettante unfit for public office&quot; and the surge levelled off in the following year.

In 2014, Trudeau removed all Liberal senators from the Liberal Party caucus. In announcing this, Trudeau said the purpose of the unelected upper chamber is to act as a check on the power of the prime minister, but the party structure interferes with that purpose. Following this move, Liberal senators chose to keep the designation &quot;Liberal&quot; and sit together as a caucus, albeit not one supported by the Liberal Party of Canada. This independent group continued to refer to itself in publications as the Senate Liberal Caucus until 2019.

By the time the 2015 federal election was called, the Liberals had fallen back to third place. Trudeau and his advisors mounted a campaign based on economic stimulus in the hopes of regaining the mantle of being the party that best represented change from the New Democrats. The campaign was successful, and the Liberals won the election in a dramatic fashion: with 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, it was the first time a party had won a parliamentary majority after placing third in a previous general election. Chantal Hébert deemed the result &quot;a Liberal comeback that is headed straight for the history books&quot;, while Bloomberg&#x27;s Josh Wingrove and Theophilos Argitis similarly described it as &quot;capping the biggest political comeback in the country’s history.&quot; Spencer McKay, writing for the &quot;National Post&quot;, suggested that &quot;maybe we&#x27;ve witnessed a revival of Canada&#x27;s &#x27;natural governing party&#x27;&quot;.

At the 2019 federal election, Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party lost 20 seats in the House of Commons (lowering its total from 177 to 157) from the time of dissolution, they still won the most seats of any party—enough seats to allow Trudeau to form a minority government. For the first time since 1979, the party that garnered the largest share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats; the Liberals under Trudeau had 33.1 per cent of the popular vote, while the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer had 34.4 per cent. It was also the first time a government took power with less than 35 per cent of the national popular vote since the Conservatives of John A. Macdonald, in 1867, who had 34.8 per cent of the votes.

In the 2021 federal election, Trudeau and the Liberals secured a third mandate and his second minority government after winning 160 seats. However, the Liberals again came in second in the national popular vote, behind the Conservatives. They received 32.6 percent of the popular vote, the lowest percentage of the national popular vote for a governing party in Canadian history.

In March 2022, Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party agreed to a confidence and supply deal with the New Democratic Party. In September 2024, Jagmeet Singh announced that he was ending the confidence-and-supply agreement, with NDP sources saying they had &quot;achieved all they could from the agreement.&quot; Throughout the year, the Liberals have faced declining poll numbers and disappointing results in by-elections, including losses in safe seats such as Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s in Toronto and LaSalle—Émard—Verdun in Montreal, and battleground seats such as Cloverdale—Langley City in Vancouver. The months following these losses saw frequent media stories about internal frustration and discontent with Trudeau&#x27;s leadership. This appeared to culminate in a caucus meeting where multiple members called on Trudeau to resign. Trudeau emerged from this meeting stating that the party remained &quot;strong and united&quot;. On January 6, 2025, Trudeau prorogued parliament and announced his intent to resign as both party leader and Prime Minister following a leadership election.

===Systems and realignment model===
Scholars and political experts have recently used a political realignment model to explain what was considered a collapse of a dominant party and put its condition in long-term perspective. According to recent scholarship, there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, patronage relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies. Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada&#x27;s political history:
* The first party system emerged from pre-Confederation colonial politics, had its &quot;heyday&quot; from 1896 to 1911 and lasted until the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and was characterized by local patronage administered by the two largest parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives.
* The second system emerged following the First World War, and had its heyday from 1935 and 1957, was characterized by regionalism and saw the emergence of several protest parties, such as the Progressives, the Social Credit Party, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
* The third system emerged in 1963 and had its heyday from 1968 to 1983 and began to unravel thereafter. The two largest parties were challenged by a strong third party, the New Democratic Party (successor to the CCF). Campaigns during this era became more national in scope because of electronic media, and involved a greater focus on leadership. The dominant policy of the era was Keynesian economics.
* The fourth party system has involved the rise of the Reform Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives. Most parties moved to one-member-one-vote leadership contests, and campaign finance laws were reformed in 2004. The fourth party system has been characterized by market-oriented policies that generally abandoned Keynesian policies but maintained the welfare state.

Stephen Clarkson (2005) shows how the Liberal Party has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a &quot;clientelistic approach&quot; under Laurier, which evolved into a &quot;brokerage&quot; system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under Mackenzie King. The 1950s saw the emergence of a &quot;pan-Canadian system&quot;, which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election – categorized by Clarkson as an electoral &quot;earthquake&quot; which &quot;fragmented&quot; the party system, saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past-the-post system, has chiefly benefited the Liberals.

==Principles and policies==
The principles of the party are based on liberalism as defined by various liberal theorists and include individual freedom for present and future generations, responsibility, human dignity, a just society, political freedom, religious freedom, national unity, equality of opportunity, cultural diversity, bilingualism, and multilateralism. From the early twentieth century, the Liberal party has favoured a variety of &quot;big tent&quot; policies from both right and left of the political spectrum. When it formed the government from 1993 to 2006, it championed balanced budgets, and eliminated the budget deficit completely from the federal budget in 1995 by reducing spending on social programs or delegating them to the provinces, and promised to replace the Goods and Services Tax in the party&#x27;s famous Red Book. It also legalized same-sex marriage.

===2021 party platform===
During the 2021 federal election, the Liberal Party of Canada introduced their platform, which included a &quot;Gender and Diversity Impact Summary&quot; for each chapter, as well as six key categories. These included: the pandemic, housing, health care, the economy, climate change, and reconciliation.

Key Liberal policies of the 2021 platform included:

*Requiring travelers on interprovincial trains, commercial flights, cruise ships, and other federally regulated vessels be vaccinated against COVID-19.
*Making an investment of $6 billion—on top of $4 billion already committed—to support the elimination of health system waitlists.
*Providing various investments in order to build, preserve, or revitalize 1.4 million new homes by 2025–26.
*Allocating funds to spend $2 billion over the next five years on measures to address the legacy of residential schools with &quot;truth, justice, and healing&quot; initiatives.
*Re-introducing legislation within the first 100 days in office to eliminate the practice of gay conversion therapy for everyone.
*Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
*Presenting a National Action Plan on Combating Hate by 2022 as part of a renewed Anti-Racism Strategy, including the Black Canadians Justice Strategy.
*Updating the committed number to receive 40,000 Afghan refugees.
*Creating a minimum tax rule so that everyone who earns enough to qualify for the top bracket pays at least 15% each year (the tax rate paid by people earning less than $49,000), removing their ability to artificially pay no tax through excessive use of deductions and credits.
*Establishing a permanent Council of Economic Advisors to provide independent advice to government on long-term growth. The council will be gender- balanced and reflect Canada&#x27;s diversity.
*Reform economic immigration programs to expand pathways to permanent residence for temporary foreign workers and former international students through the Express Entry points system.
*Setting aside a minimum of $1 billion to support provinces or territories who implement a ban on handguns across their jurisdiction.

==Provincial parties==
Seven provinces and one territory in Canada have a Liberal Party in their legislatures, although not all of them are actually affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada. Neither Nunavut nor the Northwest Territories have party-based electoral and governing systems (both operate with consensus democracy). British Columbia had a Liberal Party whose name and ideology have shifted, BC United; Saskatchewan also had a Liberal Party whose name has changed, Saskatchewan Progress Party. Yukon, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec each have a Liberal Party that may align ideologically with the federal party but operates as a completely separate entity (though at one time were affiliated): Those provincial parties have separate policies, finances, memberships, constituency associations, executives, conventions and offices. The New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island provincial Liberals are each politically and organizationally affiliated with the federal Liberal Party.

<text>Cascade Parent Limited, doing business as Alludo ( ), is a Canadian software company headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, specializing in graphics processing. Formerly called the Corel Corporation ( ; from the abbreviation &quot;Cowpland Research Laboratory&quot;), the company is known for producing software titles such as CorelDRAW, and for acquiring AfterShot Pro, PaintShop Pro, Painter, Video Studio and WordPerfect.

== History ==

Corel was founded by Michael Cowpland in 1985 as a research laboratory. Michael Cowpland was CEO of Mitel. Mitel needed writing and creative design programs to enhance the company product line. Corel products were born. Additional products were added. The company had great success early in the high-tech boom of the 1990s and early 2000s with the product CorelDRAW, and became, for a time, the biggest software company in Canada. In 1996, it acquired Novell WordPerfect and started competing with the thought of being &quot;Pepsi to Microsoft&#x27;s Coke&quot; as Microsoft Word was the top-used word processing software at the time. Corel was in a difficult position as Microsoft pushed pre-loaded copies of its software onto new computers. This mainly consisted of Microsoft Works office applications, but a variant called Works Suite also bundled the Microsoft Word software.

The company held the naming rights to the home arena for the NHL&#x27;s Ottawa Senators from February 1996 until January 2006 as the &quot;Corel Centre&quot;, a venue currently known as the Canadian Tire Centre.

In 1996, Corel created a full motion video game called Mode.

In 1997, Corel sold its Corel ChemLab studio and its &quot;CD Home Collection&quot; consisting of over 60 multimedia titles to Hoffmann + Associates, a Toronto-based company. As part of the deal, Corel acquired a minority interest in Hoffmann + Associates and received royalties.

In August 2000, Cowpland was accused of insider trading and left. A new board of directors was then appointed and Derek Burney Jr., announced that the product line would be split into several brands—DeepWhite, ProCreate, and Corel. However, these plans were scrapped, and only the Corel brand remained. Corel acquired the graphics software company Micrografx in late 2001.

In August 2003, Corel was bought out by the private equity firm Vector Capital for $1.05 a share (slightly more than the cash in the company). The company was voluntarily delisted from the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchanges. Some U.S. shareholders alleged the management benefited from the buyout personally while the buyout price was too low. A lawsuit was filed in the U.S. to stop the buyout and was unsuccessful.

In March 2005, Corel announced that the United States Justice Department purchased 50,000 licenses of WordPerfect (adding to the worldwide user base of 20 million) and that WordPerfect was adding 4 million new users per year thanks to bundling deals with Dell. Corel contended that WordPerfect was the only viable alternative to Microsoft Office, with sales 70 times more than Lotus&#x27; SmartSuite. On April 26, 2006, Corel completed its return to the public market with an initial public offering on NASDAQ, the same day finalizing the acquisition of WinZip, an archiving software title.

On December 12, 2006, Corel completed its acquisitions of InterVideo and Ulead. The InterVideo acquisition was valued at around $196 million. In May 2008, CEO David Dobson announced that he was leaving the company to take a senior strategy role at Pitney Bowes. Dobson was replaced on May 8 by former Symantec executive Kris Hagerman. In November 2009, it was announced that Vector Capital would be purchasing the remaining shares of common stock in Corel Corporation. Upon completion, this made Corel once again privately owned. On January 29, 2010, the shareholders of Corel approved its previously announced stock consolidation, completing the transfer to Corel Holdings, L.P., a limited partnership controlled by an affiliate of Vector Capital.

In January 2012, Corel acquired Roxio from Rovi Corporation for an undisclosed amount. Subsequently, on July 2, 2012, Corel announced its acquisition of Pinnacle Systems, a developer of consumer-oriented video editing products (such as the Pinnacle Studio series) owned by Avid.

Having suffered layoffs in 2003 and 2008, Corel began a near yearly culture of restructuring beginning in 2010, when in the latter part of that year the company&#x27;s finance department was restructured and moved to their Taipei office, resulting in significant layoffs at its Ottawa HQ. Restructuring in 2012 resulted in more layoffs. In December 2013, the company&#x27;s restructuring resulted in the layoffs of the Taipei location&#x27;s engineering and quality assurance team. Corel&#x27;s Taipei office was the core development centre of PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio, one of the company&#x27;s most well-known photo- and video-editing bundles. The 2013 restructuring led to a partial handover of product development to outsourced companies, resulting in more rapid, low-cost development across its product lines. The company continued with layoffs in 2014 and once again at the beginning of 2015 with the change of the company&#x27;s CEO to Patrick Nichols, previously the head of Corel&#x27;s WinZip business unit.

In August 2016, Corel announced the acquisition of the Mindjet MindManager business from Spigit.

In June 2018, Corel announced the acquisition of Gravit GmbH.

In December 2018, Corel announced the acquisition of Parallels.

On July 3, 2019, Corel was acquired by KKR for a reported $1 billion.

In September 2020, Christa Quarles was named the CEO of the company.

In 2021, Prashant Ketkar was named the Chief Technology and Product Officer of the company.

In September 2022, Corel was rebranded to Alludo (wordplay on the phrase &quot;All You Do&quot;).

==Corel World Design Contest==
The annual Corel World Design Contest first ran from 1990 through 1998. The competition intended to recognize and encourage an international community of graphic artists from over 50,000,000 registered Corel users. Two finalists for each of the eight categories were awarded a trip to Ottawa, Canada to participate in the Corel World Design Contest gala and awards ceremony. The finalists from each of the eight categories received an issue of the &quot;Corel Crystal Award&quot;. The collection of artworks were later released in a catalogue with bundled CD, under the name of &quot;Corel Artshow&quot;. The contest was reinitiated in 2009 on the 20th Anniversary of CorelDRAW&#x27;s launch and now runs every two years. The 2013 and 2015 contests each had a prize pool with a total value of US$100,000.

<text>Molecular phylogenetics () is the branch of phylogeny that analyzes genetic, hereditary molecular differences, predominantly in DNA sequences, to gain information on an organism&#x27;s evolutionary relationships. From these analyses, it is possible to determine the processes by which diversity among species has been achieved. The result of a molecular phylogenetic analysis is expressed in a phylogenetic tree. Molecular phylogenetics is one aspect of molecular systematics, a broader term that also includes the use of molecular data in taxonomy and biogeography.

Molecular phylogenetics and molecular evolution correlate. Molecular evolution is the process of selective changes (mutations) at a molecular level (genes, proteins, etc.) throughout various branches in the tree of life (evolution). Molecular phylogenetics makes inferences of the evolutionary relationships that arise due to molecular evolution and results in the construction of a phylogenetic tree.

==History==

The theoretical frameworks for molecular systematics were laid in the 1960s in the works of Emile Zuckerkandl, Emanuel Margoliash, Linus Pauling, and Walter M. Fitch. Applications of molecular systematics were pioneered by Charles G. Sibley (birds), Herbert C. Dessauer (herpetology), and Morris Goodman (primates), followed by Allan C. Wilson, Robert K. Selander, and John C. Avise (who studied various groups). Work with protein electrophoresis began around 1956. Although the results were not quantitative and did not initially improve on morphological classification, they provided tantalizing hints that long-held notions of the classifications of birds, for example, needed substantial revision. In the period of 1974–1986, DNA–DNA hybridization was the dominant technique used to measure genetic difference.

==Theoretical background==
Early attempts at molecular systematics were also termed chemotaxonomy and made use of proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, and other molecules that were separated and characterized using techniques such as chromatography. These have been replaced in recent times largely by DNA sequencing, which produces the exact sequences of nucleotides or &quot;bases&quot; in either DNA or RNA segments extracted using different techniques. In general, these are considered superior for evolutionary studies, since the actions of evolution are ultimately reflected in the genetic sequences. At present, it is still a long and expensive process to sequence the entire DNA of an organism (its genome). However, it is quite feasible to determine the sequence of a defined area of a particular chromosome. Typical molecular systematic analyses require the sequencing of around 1000 base pairs. At any location within such a sequence, the bases found in a given position may vary between organisms. The particular sequence found in a given organism is referred to as its haplotype. In principle, since there are four base types, with 1000 base pairs, we could have 41000 distinct haplotypes. However, for organisms within a particular species or in a group of related species, it has been found empirically that only a minority of sites show any variation at all, and most of the variations that are found are correlated, so that the number of distinct haplotypes that are found is relatively small.

In a molecular systematic analysis, the haplotypes are determined for a defined area of genetic material; a substantial sample of individuals of the target species or other taxon is used; however, many current studies are based on single individuals. Haplotypes of individuals of closely related, yet different, taxa are also determined. Finally, haplotypes from a smaller number of individuals from a definitely different taxon are determined: these are referred to as an outgroup. The base sequences for the haplotypes are then compared. In the simplest case, the difference between two haplotypes is assessed by counting the number of locations where they have different bases: this is referred to as the number of &quot;substitutions&quot; (other kinds of differences between haplotypes can also occur, for example, the &quot;insertion&quot; of a section of nucleic acid in one haplotype that is not present in another). The difference between organisms is usually re-expressed as a &quot;percentage divergence&quot;, by dividing the number of substitutions by the number of base pairs analysed: the hope is that this measure will be independent of the location and length of the section of DNA that is sequenced.

An older and superseded approach was to determine the divergences between the genotypes of individuals by DNA–DNA hybridization. The advantage claimed for using hybridization rather than gene sequencing was that it was based on the entire genotype, rather than on particular sections of DNA. Modern sequence comparison techniques overcome this objection by the use of multiple sequences.

Once the divergences between all pairs of samples have been determined, the resulting triangular matrix of differences is submitted to some form of statistical cluster analysis, and the resulting dendrogram is examined in order to see whether the samples cluster in the way that would be expected from current ideas about the taxonomy of the group. Any group of haplotypes that are all more similar to one another than any of them is to any other haplotype may be said to constitute a clade, which may be visually represented as the figure displayed on the right demonstrates. Statistical techniques such as bootstrapping and jackknifing help in providing reliability estimates for the positions of haplotypes within the evolutionary trees.

==Techniques and applications==
Every living organism contains deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and proteins. In general, closely related organisms have a high degree of similarity in the molecular structure of these substances, while the molecules of organisms distantly related often show a pattern of dissimilarity. Conserved sequences, such as mitochondrial DNA, are expected to accumulate mutations over time, and assuming a constant rate of mutation, provide a molecular clock for dating divergence. Molecular phylogeny uses such data to build a &quot;relationship tree&quot; that shows the probable evolution of various organisms. With the invention of Sanger sequencing in 1977, it became possible to isolate and identify these molecular structures. High-throughput sequencing may also be used to obtain the transcriptome of an organism, allowing inference of phylogenetic relationships using transcriptomic data.

The most common approach is the comparison of homologous sequences for genes using sequence alignment techniques to identify similarity. Another application of molecular phylogeny is in DNA barcoding, wherein the species of an individual organism is identified using small sections of mitochondrial DNA or chloroplast DNA. Another application of the techniques that make this possible can be seen in the very limited field of human genetics, such as the ever-more-popular use of genetic testing to determine a child&#x27;s paternity, as well as the emergence of a new branch of criminal forensics focused on evidence known as genetic fingerprinting.

==Molecular phylogenetic analysis==
There are several methods available for performing a molecular phylogenetic analysis. One method, including a comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing a phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models), and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at Nature Protocol.

Another molecular phylogenetic analysis technique has been described by Pevsner and shall be summarized in the sentences to follow (Pevsner, 2015). A phylogenetic analysis typically consists of five major steps. The first stage comprises sequence acquisition. The following step consists of performing a multiple sequence alignment, which is the fundamental basis of constructing a phylogenetic tree. The third stage includes different models of DNA and amino acid substitution. Several models of substitution exist. A few examples include Hamming distance, the Jukes and Cantor one-parameter model, and the Kimura two-parameter model (see Models of DNA evolution). The fourth stage consists of various methods of tree building, including distance-based and character-based methods. The normalized Hamming distance and the Jukes-Cantor correction formulas provide the degree of divergence and the probability that a nucleotide changes to another, respectively. Common tree-building methods include unweighted pair group method using arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and Neighbor joining, which are distance-based methods, Maximum parsimony, which is a character-based method, and Maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, which are character-based/model-based methods. UPGMA is a simple method; however, it is less accurate than the neighbor-joining approach. Finally, the last step comprises evaluating the trees. This assessment of accuracy is composed of consistency, efficiency, and robustness.

MEGA (molecular evolutionary genetics analysis) is an analysis software that is user-friendly and free to download and use. This software is capable of analyzing both distance-based and character-based tree methodologies. MEGA also contains several options one may choose to utilize, such as heuristic approaches and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is an approach that is commonly used to measure the robustness of topology in a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrates the percentage each clade is supported after numerous replicates. In general, a value greater than 70% is considered significant. The flow chart displayed on the right visually demonstrates the order of the five stages of Pevsner&#x27;s molecular phylogenetic analysis technique that have been described.

==Limitations==
Molecular systematics is an essentially cladistic approach: it assumes that classification must correspond to phylogenetic descent, and that all valid taxa must be monophyletic. This is a limitation when attempting to determine the optimal tree(s), which often involves bisecting and reconnecting portions of the phylogenetic tree(s).

The recent discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer among organisms provides a significant complication to molecular systematics, indicating that different genes within the same organism can have different phylogenies. HGTs can be detected and excluded using a number of phylogenetic methods (see ).

In addition, molecular phylogenies are sensitive to the assumptions and models that go into making them. Firstly, sequences must be aligned; then, issues such as long-branch attraction, saturation, and taxon sampling problems must be addressed. This means that strikingly different results can be obtained by applying different models to the same dataset. The tree-building method also brings with it specific assumptions about tree topology, evolution speeds, and sampling. The simplistic UPGMA assumes a rooted tree and a uniform molecular clock, both of which can be incorrect.

<text>Below is a list of the premiers of the province of Ontario, Canada, since Confederation in 1867. Ontario uses a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Ontario&#x27;s head of government. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Ontario, and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.

This article only covers the time since the Canadian Confederation was created in 1867. For the premiers of Canada West from 1840 to 1867, see List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada.

The 26th and current premier of Ontario is Doug Ford of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario since June 29, 2018.

<text>Charles L. &quot;Sonny&quot; Liston ( – December 30, 1970), nicknamed &quot;The Big Bear&quot;, was an American professional boxer who competed from 1953 to 1970. A dominant contender of his era, he became the undisputed world heavyweight champion in 1962 after knocking out Floyd Patterson in the first round, repeating the knockout the following year in defense of the title; in the latter fight he also became the inaugural WBC heavyweight champion. Often regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, Liston is known for his immense strength, formidable jab, long reach, toughness, and is widely regarded as the most intimidating man in the history of combat sports.

Although Liston was widely regarded as unbeatable, he lost the title in 1964 to Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay), who entered as an 8:1 underdog. Liston retired in his corner due to an inflamed shoulder. Controversy followed with claims that Liston had been drinking heavily the night before the fight and had entered the bout with a lame shoulder. In his 1965 rematch with Ali, Liston suffered an unexpected first-round knockout that led to unresolved suspicions of a fix. He was still a world-ranked boxer when he died in mysterious circumstances in 1970. 

&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine ranks Liston as the tenth greatest heavyweight of all time, while boxing writer Herb Goldman ranked him second and Richard O&#x27;Brien, Senior Editor of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, placed him third. Alfie Potts Harmer in &quot;The Sportster&quot; also ranked him the third greatest heavyweight and the sixth greatest boxer at any weight. Liston was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

===Family===
Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; Liston was born circa 1930 into a sharecropping family that farmed the poor land of Morledge Plantation near Johnson Township, St. Francis County, Arkansas. His father, Tobe Liston, was in his mid 40s when he and his wife, Helen Baskin, who was almost 30 years younger than Tobe, moved to Arkansas from Mississippi in 1916. Helen had one child before she married Tobe, and Tobe had 13 children with his first wife. Tobe and Helen had 12 children together; Sonny was the second youngest child.

===Date of birth===
There is no official record of Liston&#x27;s birth as his family&#x27;s home state of Arkansas did not make birth certificates mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Charles (or Sonny) Liston, can be found in the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself may not have known what year he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. Liston believed his date of birth to be May 8, 1932, and used this for official purposes but by the time he won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston&#x27;s most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.

===Youth===
Tobe Liston inflicted whippings so severe on Sonny that the scars were still visible decades later. &quot;The only thing my old man ever gave me was a beating,&quot; Liston said. In 1946, Helen Baskin, along with some of her children, moved to St. Louis to seek factory work. Liston—aged around 13, according to his later reckonings—remained in Arkansas with his father. The following year, Sonny—determined to reunite with his mother and siblings—thrashed the pecans from his brother-in-law&#x27;s tree and sold them in Forrest City, Arkansas. With the proceeds, he traveled to St. Louis to live with his mother. Liston tried going to school but quickly left after jeers about his illiteracy; the only employment he could obtain was sporadic and exploitative.

Liston turned to crime and led a gang of thugs who committed muggings and armed robberies. Because of the shirt he wore during robberies, the St. Louis police called Liston the &quot;Yellow Shirt Bandit.&quot; When caught in January 1950, Liston gave his age as 20, while the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; reported that he was 22. Convicted and sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary, Liston started his prison time on June 1, 1950.

Liston never complained about prison, saying he was guaranteed three meals every day. The athletic director at Missouri State Penitentiary, Rev. Alois Stevens, suggested to Liston that he try boxing, and his obvious aptitude, along with an endorsement from Stevens, who was also a priest, aided Liston in getting an early parole. Stevens organized a sparring session with a professional heavyweight named Thurman Wilson to showcase Liston&#x27;s potential. After two rounds, Wilson had taken enough. &quot;Better get me out of this ring,&quot; exclaimed Wilson, &quot;he is going to kill me!&quot;

==Amateur career==
After Liston was released from prison on October 31, 1952, he had a brief amateur career that spanned less than a year. Liston captured the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions on March 6, 1953, with a victory over 1952 Olympic Heavyweight Champion Ed Sanders. He then outpointed Julius Griffin, winner of the New York Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, to capture the Intercity Golden Gloves Championship on March 26 (representing Chicago). Liston was knocked down in the first round, but came back to control the next two rounds and had Griffin hanging on at the end.

Liston competed in the 1953 United States National Championships at Boston Garden and passed the preliminaries, stopping Lou Graff in the second round on April 13, but lost in the quarterfinals to 17-year-old Jimmy McCarter on April 15. He would later employ McCarter as a sparring partner.

On June 23, 1953, a team consisting of ten recent St. Louis Golden Gloves champions of all weight classes, with Liston on top as the heavyweight, was gathered to represent the United States in an International Golden Gloves (USA vs. West Europe) competition at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis. Liston knocked out Hermann Schreibauer of West Germany at 2:16 of the first round. The previous month, Schreibauer had won a bronze medal in the European Championships. At this time, the head coach of the St. Louis Golden Gloves team, Tony Anderson, stated that Liston was the strongest fighter he had seen.

==Professional career==
===Early fights===
Liston signed a contract in September 1953, proclaiming: &quot;Whatever you tell me to do, I&#x27;ll do.&quot; The only backers willing to put up the necessary money for him to turn professional were close to underworld figures, and Liston supplemented his income by working for racketeers as an intimidator-enforcer. The connections to organized crime were an advantage early in his career but were later used against him.

Liston made his professional debut on September 2, 1953, knocking out Don Smith in the first round in St. Louis, where he fought his first five bouts. He was , and had an exceptionally powerful physique, with a disproportionately long reach at . His fists measured around, the largest of any heavyweight champion. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Mort Sharnik said his hands &quot;looked like cannonballs when he made them into fists.&quot; Liston&#x27;s noticeably more muscular left arm, crushing left jab and powerful left hook lent credence to the widely held belief that he was left-handed, although he fought in an orthodox stance.

Early in his career, Liston faced capable opponents. In his sixth bout, he faced ranked heavyweight Johnny Summerlin (18–1–2) on national television and won in an eight-round decision. In his next fight, he had a rematch with Summerlin and again won an eight-round decision. Both fights were in Summerlin&#x27;s hometown of Detroit.

On September 7, 1954, Liston suffered defeat for the first time in his eighth professional fight, losing to Marty Marshall, a journeyman with an awkward style. In the third round, Marshall nailed Liston—reportedly while he was laughing—and broke his jaw. A stoic Liston finished the fight, but lost in an eight-round split decision. On April 21, 1955, he defeated Marshall in a rematch, dropping him four times en route to a sixth-round knockout. They fought for a third time on March 6, 1956, which Liston won by a ten-round unanimous decision.

Liston&#x27;s criminal record, compounded by a personal association with a notorious labor racketeer, led to the police&#x27;s stopping him on sight, and he began to avoid main streets. On May 5, 1956, a policeman confronted Liston and a friend about a cab parked near Liston&#x27;s home. Liston assaulted the officer, breaking his knee and gashing his face. He also took his gun. He claimed the officer used racial slurs. A widely publicized account of Liston resisting arrest—even after nightsticks were allegedly broken over his skull—added to the public perception of him as a nightmarish &quot;monster&quot; impervious to physical punishment. He was paroled after serving six months of a nine-month sentence, and was not prohibited from boxing during 1957. After repeated overnight detention by the St. Louis police and a thinly veiled threat to his life, Liston left for Philadelphia.

===March to the title===
In 1958, Liston returned to boxing. He won eight fights that year, six by knockout. Liston was training in the stable of Eddie Yawitz, who along with Bernie Glickman, managed the welterweight champion Virgil Akins. Yawitz and Glickman would be subpoenaed to testify in the grand jury trial of mafia soldier Frankie Carbo. The same year, he was shifted to a new manager, Joseph &quot;Pep&quot; Barone, who was a front man for Frankie Carbo and Frank &quot;Blinky&quot; Palermo. The year 1959 was a banner one for Liston: after knocking out contender Mike DeJohn in six rounds he faced Cleveland Williams, a fast-handed fighter who was billed as the hardest-hitting heavyweight in the world against whom he showed durability, power and skill, nullifying Williams&#x27; best work before stopping him in the third round. This victory is regarded by some as Liston&#x27;s most impressive performance. He rounded out the year by stopping Nino Valdez and Willi Besmanoff.

In 1960, Liston won five more fights, including a rematch with Williams, who lasted only two rounds. Roy Harris, who had gone 13 rounds with Floyd Patterson in a title match, was crushed in one round by Liston. Top contender Zora Folley was stopped in three rounds. After demolishing these top-ranked fighters in the heavyweight division, Liston was regarded as the top-contender champion-in-waiting.

Liston&#x27;s streak of nine straight knockout victories ended when he won a unanimous twelve-round decision against Eddie Machen on September 7, 1960. Machen&#x27;s mobility enabled him to go the distance but he was clearly outpointed despite Liston being penalised for a low blow in the 11th round. Machen&#x27;s taunting and his spoiling tactics of dodging and grappling—at one point almost heaving Liston over the ropes—so alienated the audience that Liston received unaccustomed support from the crowd. Before his bout with Liston, Muhammad Ali consulted Machen and was advised that the key to survival was to make Liston lose his temper.

===Title challenge delay===
Liston became the No. 1 contender in 1960, but the handlers of world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson refused to give him a shot at the title citing Liston&#x27;s links to organized crime. While Liston began working into shape with hopes for a heavyweight title shot, he also continued his criminal behavior. Two more arrests—for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and another for impersonating a cop—led to Liston being suspended by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission on July 14, 1961. The suspension was honored in all states. Ironically, Patterson&#x27;s manager, Cus D&#x27;Amato, associated with racketeers and had his manager&#x27;s license revoked by the New York State Athletic Commission for alleged misconduct in connection with the Floyd Patterson–Ingemar Johansson title fight in June 1959.

Civic leaders were also reluctant, worrying that Liston&#x27;s unsavory character would set a bad example for youth. The NAACP had urged Patterson not to fight Liston, fearing that a Liston victory would hurt the civil rights movement. Many African-Americans disdained Liston. Asked by a young white reporter why he was not fighting for freedom in the South, Liston deadpanned, &quot;I ain&#x27;t got no dog-proof ass.&quot;, referring to the use of police dogs against protesters. However, in 1963 in the aftermath of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, Liston broke off a European boxing exhibition tour to return home and was quoted as saying he was &quot;ashamed to be in America.&quot;

U.S. President John F. Kennedy also did not want Patterson to fight Liston. When Patterson met with the president in January 1962, Kennedy suggested that Patterson avoid Liston, citing Justice Department concerns over Liston&#x27;s ties to organized crime.

Jack Dempsey spoke for many when he was quoted as saying that Sonny Liston should not be allowed to fight for the title. Liston angrily responded by questioning whether Dempsey&#x27;s failure to serve in World War I qualified him to moralize. Frustrated, Liston changed his management in 1961 and applied pressure through the media by remarking that Patterson, who had faced mostly white challengers since becoming champion, was drawing the color line against his own race. Patterson maintained, however, that he desperately wanted to fight Liston all the while, but was blocked by aforementioned trainer Cus D&#x27;Amato, subsequently contributing to his firing.

=== Patterson vs. Liston ===

Patterson finally signed to meet Liston for the world title on September 25, 1962, in Comiskey Park in Chicago. Leading up to the fight, Liston was an 8:5 betting favorite, although many picked Patterson to win. In an Associated Press poll, 64 of 102 reporters picked Patterson. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; predicted a Patterson victory in 15 rounds, stating: &quot;Sonny has neither Floyd&#x27;s speed nor the versatility of his attack. He is a relatively elementary, one-track fighter.&quot; Former champions James J. Braddock, Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, Rocky Marciano and Ingemar Johansson all picked Patterson to win. Muhammad Ali (at the time a rising contender named Cassius Clay), however, predicted a knockout by Liston in the first five rounds.

The fight turned out to be a mismatch. Liston, with a 25-pound weight advantage, to , knocked out Patterson at 2:06 of the first round, putting him down for the count with a powerful left hook to the jaw. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Gilbert Rogin wrote that &quot;that final left hook crashed into Patterson&#x27;s cheek like a diesel rig going downhill, no brakes.&quot; It was the third-fastest knockout in a world heavyweight title fight, and the first time the defending champion had been knocked out in round one.

Rogin wrote that Patterson backers expected him to &quot;go inside on Liston, fire away and then run like a thief in the night. He would not close in until the accumulated inside damage and Liston&#x27;s own frustration had sapped the challenger&#x27;s strength and will.&quot; Patterson&#x27;s fatal mistake was that he &quot;did not punch enough and frequently tried to clinch with Liston. ... In these feckless clinches he only managed to tie up one of Liston&#x27;s arms. A grateful Liston found there was no need to give chase. The victim sought out the executioner.&quot; Rogin discounted speculation that Patterson had thrown the fight, writing: &quot;The genesis of all this wide-eyed theorizing and downright baloney was the fact that many spectators failed to see the knockout blows.&quot;

===World heavyweight champion===

Upon winning the world heavyweight title, Liston had a speech prepared for the crowd that friends had assured him would meet him at the Philadelphia airport. But upon arrival, Liston was met by only a handful of reporters and public-relations staff. Writer Jack McKinney said, &quot;I watched Sonny. His eyes swept the whole scene. ... You could feel the deflation, see the look of hurt in his eyes. ... He had been deliberately snubbed. Philadelphia wanted nothing to do with him.&quot; People describe Sonny&#x27;s disappointment further, recalling his shoulders slumping and all joy being removed from his demeanor. This point, the absence of a crowd or parade upon his arrival, is marked by many as Sonny&#x27;s abandonment of any hope of being accepted as a champion. From this point forward, he would play into the stereotypes that reporters bestowed on him, departing from any efforts to appear amiable and affectionate to the public.

During an era when white journalists still described black athletes in stereotypes, Liston had long been a target of racially charged slurs; he was called a &quot;gorilla&quot; and &quot;a jungle beast&quot; in print. Larry Merchant, then a writer with the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, wrote: &quot;A celebration for Philadelphia&#x27;s first heavyweight champ is now in order. ... Emily Post would probably recommend a ticker-tape parade. For confetti we can use torn-up arrest warrants.&quot; He also wrote that Liston&#x27;s win over Patterson proved that &quot;in a fair fight between good and evil, evil must win.&quot; Some writers thought Liston brought bad press on himself by a surly and hostile attitude toward journalists. He also had a reputation for bullying people such as porters and waitresses.

Liston&#x27;s run-ins with the police had continued in Philadelphia. He particularly resented a 1961 arrest by a black patrolman for loitering, claiming to have merely been signing autographs and chatting with fans outside a drugstore. A month later, Liston was accused of impersonating a police officer by using a flashlight to wave down a female motorist in Fairmount Park, although all charges were later dropped. Subsequently, Liston spent some months in Denver where a Catholic priest who acted as his spiritual adviser attempted to help bring his drinking under control. After he won the title, Liston relocated to Denver permanently, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be a lamppost in Denver than the mayor of Philadelphia.&quot;

====Liston vs. Patterson II====

Patterson and Liston had a rematch clause in their contract. Patterson wanted a chance to redeem himself, so they met again on July 22, 1963, in Las Vegas. It was the first million-dollar purse with both fighters receiving $1,434,000 each. Patterson, a 4:1 betting underdog, was knocked down three times and counted out at 2:10 of the first round. The fight lasted four seconds longer than the first one. Liston&#x27;s victory was loudly booed. &quot;The public is not with me. I know it&quot;, Liston said afterward. &quot;But they&#x27;ll have to swing along until somebody comes to beat me.&quot;

===Liston vs. Clay===
Liston made his second title defense on February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach, Florida against Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali). Liston was a heavy favorite. In a pre-fight poll, 43 of 46 sportswriters picked Liston to win by knockout. Odds makers gave Liston 8:1 to win. Clay countered in verse, &quot;If you want to lose your money, then bet on Sonny!” Liston was supremely confident of easily beating Clay, trained minimally for the fight and went ahead with it despite an injury to his left shoulder.

From the opening bell Liston attempted to close with Clay, looking to land a hard punch to the head to end the fight quickly and decisively. Although Clay often carried his gloves down at his waist, seemingly open to attack, he proved very difficult to hit. With Clay quickly ducking his head left, right or away, Liston&#x27;s leading left jabs largely failed to land. As Liston pursued his target Clay retreated, using his foot speed to slip away into open space in the ring, largely circling to the left and away from the threat of a Liston left hook. Although the opening round saw Clay largely on the defensive, it was soon established that Clay could reverse roles quickly and take to the offensive with a remarkably fast series of combinations delivered to Liston&#x27;s head. A sudden violent combination delivered with 30 seconds left in the round electrified the crowd. The opening round was fought an extra eight seconds, since both fighters and referee Barney Felix apparently did not hear the bell.

The second round saw Liston continue to pursue Clay. At one point, Liston had Clay against the ropes and landed a hard left hook. Clay confessed later he had been hurt by the punch, but Liston was unable to press his advantage home. Two of the three official scorers, or judges, awarded the round to Liston, and the other scored the round even.

In the third round, Clay began to take control of the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston&#x27;s right eye and a cut under his left, which eventually required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston was rocked as he was driven to the ropes. A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round when Clay seemed tired, delivering punishing body shots. It was probably Liston&#x27;s best moment in the entire fight. Sitting on his stool between rounds, however, Liston was breathing heavily as his cornermen worked on his cut.

During the fourth round Liston appeared dominant as Clay coasted, keeping his distance. Joe Louis commenting on TV at ringside said &quot;It&#x27;s looking good for Sonny Liston&quot;. However, when Clay returned to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what the heck was going on&quot;, Angelo Dundee, Clay&#x27;s trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. &quot;He said, &#x27;Cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there&#x27;s dirty work afoot.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Whoa, whoa, back up, baby. C&#x27;mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!&#x27; So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever&#x27;s there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes.&quot;
Biographer Wilfrid Sheed wrote in his book, &quot;Muhammad Ali: A Portrait in Words and Photographs&quot;, that Clay&#x27;s protests were heard by ringside members of the Nation of Islam who initially suspected Dundee had blinded his fighter, and that the trainer deliberately wiped his own eyes with the corner sponge to demonstrate to Clay&#x27;s approaching bodyguards that he had not intentionally blinded him.

The commotion was not lost on referee Barney Felix, who was walking toward Clay&#x27;s corner. Felix later said Clay was seconds from being disqualified. The challenger, his arms held high in surrender, was demanding that the fight be stopped and Dundee, fearing the fight might indeed be halted, gave his charge a one-word order: &quot;Run!&quot;

It was later theorized that a substance used on Liston&#x27;s cuts by Joe Pollino, his cut man, may have caused the irritation.

Clay later said that in round five he could only see a faint shadow of Liston during most of the round, but by circling and moving frantically he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive. At one point, Clay was wiping his eyes with his right hand while extending his left arm—&quot;like a drunk leaning on a lamppost&quot; Bert Sugar wrote—to keep Liston at bay.
But by the sixth round his sight had cleared, and a clearly enraged Clay fought a blisteringly aggressive round landing numerous combination punches.

Liston failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by technical knockout. At that point, the fight was scored as even on the official scorecards. It was the first time since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book &quot;King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero&quot;, interviewed one of Liston&#x27;s cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: &quot;[The shoulder] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you say your guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout? We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot.&quot; Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match.

There is ample evidence that Liston did carry an injury to his left shoulder into the fight. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Tex Maule wrote that Liston&#x27;s shoulder injury was legitimate. He cited Liston&#x27;s inability to lift his arm: &quot;There is no doubt that Liston&#x27;s arm was damaged. In the sixth round, he carried it at belt level so that it was of no help in warding off the right crosses with which Clay probed at the cut under his left eye.&quot; He also cited medical evidence: &quot;A team of eight doctors inspected Liston&#x27;s arm at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach and agreed that it was too badly damaged for Liston to continue fighting. The torn tendon had bled down into the mass of the biceps, swelling and numbing the arm.&quot; Those findings were confirmed in a formal investigation immediately after the fight by Florida State Attorney Richard Gerstein, who also noted that there was little doubt that Liston went into the fight with a sore or lame shoulder. Despite Liston carrying an injury and being undertrained, Ali stated in 1975 that the first fight with Liston was the toughest of his career.

===Ali vs. Liston II===
Liston trained hard for the rematch, which was scheduled to take place November 13, 1964, in Boston. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said Liston had worked himself into the best shape of his career. However, there were again rumors of alcohol abuse in training. The extent to which Liston&#x27;s heavy drinking and possible drug use may have contributed to his surprisingly poor performances against Ali is not known.

Three days before the fight, Ali needed emergency surgery for a strangulated hernia. The bout would need to be delayed by six months. The new date was set for May 25, 1965. But as it approached, there were fears that the promoters were tied to organized crime and Massachusetts officials, most notably Suffolk County District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne, began to have second thoughts. Byrne sought an injunction blocking the fight in Boston because Inter-Continental Promotions was promoting the fight without a Massachusetts license. Inter-Continental said local veteran Sam Silverman was the promoter. On May 7, backers of the rematch ended the court battle by pulling the fight out of Boston. The promoters needed a new location quickly, whatever the size, to rescue their closed-circuit television commitment around the country. Governor John H. Reed of Maine stepped forward, and within a few hours the promoters had a new site: Lewiston, Maine, a mill town with a population of about 41,000 located north of Boston.

The ending of the fight remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. He rolled over, got to his right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into chaos. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former world heavyweight champion, had a hard time getting Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, &quot;Get up and fight, sucker!&quot; and &quot;Nobody will believe this!&quot;

When Walcott got back to Liston and looked at the knockdown timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. &quot;The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, &#x27;I counted him out—the fight is over,&#x27;&quot; Walcott said after the fight. &quot;Nat Fleischer [editor of &quot;The Ring&quot;] was sitting beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over.&quot; Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. Strict interpretation of the knockdown/count rule states it is the referee&#x27;s count and not the timekeeper&#x27;s that is the official count. Furthermore, that count cannot be started until the fighter scoring the knockdown goes to and remains in a neutral corner. Ali did neither. Walcott never began a count in the ring because of Ali&#x27;s non-compliance and his physical struggle with getting Ali to go to that neutral corner. The interference of ringside reporters regarding interpretation of the rules, the fight stoppage and the controversy after the fight had not been seen since The Long Count Fight between champion Gene Tunney and challenger Jack Dempsey in 1927.

The fight ranks as one of the shortest heavyweight title bouts in history. Many in the small crowd had not even settled in their seats when the fight was stopped. The official time of the stoppage was announced as 1:00 into the first round, which was wrong. Liston went down at 1:44, got up at 1:56, and Walcott stopped the fight at 2:12.

Numerous fans booed and started yelling, &quot;Fix!&quot; Many did not see the punch land, and some who did questioned that it was powerful enough to knock Liston out. Skeptics called the knockout blow &quot;the phantom punch.&quot; Ali called it &quot;the anchor punch.&quot; He said it was taught to him by comedian and film actor Stepin Fetchit, who learned it from Jack Johnson.

There were some, however, who believed the fight was legitimate. World light-heavyweight champion José Torres said, &quot;It was a perfect punch.&quot; Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;no phantom punch.&quot; And Tex Maule of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote, &quot;The blow had so much force it lifted Liston&#x27;s left foot, upon which most of his weight was resting, well off the canvas.&quot;

Still, some found it hard to believe that the punch could have floored a man like Liston. Hall of Fame announcer Don Dunphy said, &quot;Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn&#x27;t knock him down.&quot; But others contend he just was not the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the &quot;New York Times&quot; said Liston &quot;looked awful&quot; in his last workout before the fight. Arthur Daley of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that Liston&#x27;s handlers knew he &quot;didn&#x27;t have it anymore,&quot; and allegedly they had secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take it easy on him – – the same man, incidentally, that Liston dismissed in less than two rounds a full three years later.

Former champions Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Floyd Patterson and Gene Tunney, as well as contender George Chuvalo all declared they considered the fight to be a fake. Some felt the knockdown was real but the knockout was fake. Ali biographer Wilfrid Sheed wrote, in his &quot;Muhammad Ali: A Portrait in Words and Photographs&quot;, that Liston planned to throw the fight for reasons unknown and used the legitimate first-round knockdown for that end. Sheed says that the punch and the knockdown &quot;may have been genuine, but when referee Joe Walcott blew the count and gave him all evening to get up, Liston&#x27;s rendition of a coma wouldn&#x27;t have fooled a possum.&quot;

Ali clearly did not think he knocked Liston out. In his own words in Thomas Hauser&#x27;s 1991 biography: &quot;The punch jarred him. It was a good punch, but I didn&#x27;t think I hit him so hard that he couldn&#x27;t have gotten up. Once he went down, I got excited. I forgot about the rules.&quot; In that same book Liston was quoted two years after the fight: &quot;Ali knocked me down with a sharp punch. I was down but not hurt, but I looked up and saw Ali standing over me. … Ali is waiting to hit me, the ref can&#x27;t control him.&quot;

While Liston publicly denied taking a dive, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Mark Kram said that years later Liston told him, &quot;That guy [Ali] was crazy. I didn&#x27;t want anything to do with him. And the Muslims were coming up. Who needed that? So I went down. I wasn&#x27;t hit.&quot; The fact that Liston did not complain about the clear breach of boxing rules (being declared knocked out without a count) and Ali&#x27;s obvious state of bewilderment, shouting at Liston &quot;Nobody will believe this&quot; and asking his handlers &quot;Did I hit him?&quot;, confirmed most people&#x27;s belief that Liston had taken a dive. There have been a number of unproven theories as to the background to the purported dive including that Liston was threatened by associates of Ali, or agreed to lose in return for a share in the more marketable Ali&#x27;s future purses. Credence to the latter theory is provided by the fact that Liston, immediately after his fight with Chuck Wepner, seemed more concerned about supporting the proposed Ali-Frazier bout and Ali&#x27;s claims to be champion than promoting his own career.

===Subsequent fights===
After the second loss to Ali, Liston stayed out of the ring for more than a year. He returned with four consecutive knockout victories in Sweden between July 1966 and April 1967, all four co-promoted by former world heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson. One of the victories was over Amos Johnson, Liston&#x27;s former sparring partner, who had recently defeated British champion Henry Cooper. He was denied entry to the 1967 WBA tournament to find a successor to Ali who had been stripped of his title following his refusal to be drafted into the US military during the Vietnam war.

Liston returned to the United States and won seven fights, all by knockout, in 1968, increasing his string to eleven. America&#x27;s first look at Liston since the Ali rematch was when he fought fifth–ranked Henry Clark in a nationally broadcast bout in July 1968. He won by a seventh-round technical knockout, and seemed on the verge of making a comeback to the big time. He talked of a fight with Joe Frazier, claiming, &quot;It&#x27;d be like shooting fish in a barrel.&quot; Liston won 14 consecutive bouts, 13 by knockout, before fighting third-ranked Leotis Martin, previously beaten by Clark, in December 1969. Liston decked Martin with a left hook in the fourth round and dominated most of the fight, but Martin came back and knocked Liston out cold in the ninth round. Unfortunately for Martin, however, his career ended after that fight due to a detached retina he suffered during the bout.

Liston won his final fight, a tough but one-sided match against future world title challenger Chuck Wepner in June 1970. The bout was stopped after the ninth round due to cuts over both of Wepner&#x27;s eyes. Wepner needed 72 stitches and suffered a broken cheekbone and nose. Wepner, who also fought George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, said after his career was over that Liston was the hardest puncher he faced.

==Boxing style==
Writer Gilbert Rogin assessed Liston&#x27;s style and physique after his win over Zora Folley. He said that Liston was not quick with his hand or footwork, that he relied too much on his ability to take a punch, and that he could be vulnerable to an opponent with more hand speed. &quot;But can he hit!&quot; Rogin wrote. &quot;There is power in both his left and his right, even though the fists move with the languor of motoring royalty or as if passing through a gaseous envelope more dense than air.&quot; Rogin called Liston&#x27;s physique &quot;awesome—arms like fence posts, thighs like silos.&quot; His defense was described as &quot;the gate-crossing of arms &quot;à la&quot; Archie Moore.&quot;

Future world heavyweight champion George Foreman, who sparred with Liston after Foreman&#x27;s amateur career, assessed Liston&#x27;s jab as the most formidable he faced and Liston as the strongest man he encountered in the ring, describing Liston as having the most natural talent and skill. Foreman stated: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t anything missing from Sonny Liston. He had the whole package.&quot; While much has been written about the effectiveness of his left jab, others have commented favorably on Liston&#x27;s wide range of boxing skills. These include Muhammad Ali, who stated in a 1975 interview that he was a great admirer of Liston&#x27;s talents: &quot;Liston had a tremendous jab, could punch with either hand, was smart in the ring and as strong as any heavyweight I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Ali also stated in his autobiography that in his prime the only two heavyweights who would have caused him serious trouble were &quot;Ezzard Charles and a young Sonny Liston&quot;.

Liston is ranked second in the ESPN.com list of &quot;The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History.&quot; Johnny Tocco, a trainer who worked with George Foreman and Mike Tyson as well as Liston, said Liston was the hardest hitter of the three. Herb Goldman stated that Liston, when in his prime between 1958 and 1963, was the most feared fighter in boxing history.

==Personal life==
Liston married Geraldine Chambers in St. Louis, Missouri, on September 3, 1957. Geraldine had a daughter from a previous marriage, and the Listons subsequently adopted a boy from Sweden. Liston biographer Paul Gallender claims that Liston fathered several children, though none with his wife. Geraldine remembered her husband as &quot;Great with me, great with the kids. He was a gentle man.&quot; Although largely illiterate through lack of schooling, though not innumerate, Liston was a more complex and interesting individual than has often been acknowledged. Former light-heavyweight champion José Torres said, &quot;I have never met an athlete in baseball, basketball or football who is smarter, more intelligent than Sonny Liston&quot;.

==Death==
Liston was found dead by his wife, Geraldine, in their Las Vegas home on December 30th, 1970. On returning home from a two-week trip Geraldine smelt a foul odor emanating from the main bedroom. Upon entering the room, she saw him slumped up against the bed, and broken foot bench on the floor. Authorities theorized that he was undressing for bed when he fell over backward with such force that he broke the rail of the bench. Geraldine called Liston&#x27;s attorney and his doctor, but did not notify the police until two to three hours later.

Following an investigation, Las Vegas police concluded there were no signs of foul play and declared Liston&#x27;s death a heroin overdose. &quot;It was common knowledge that Sonny was a heroin addict,&quot; said Sgt. Caputo, one of the investigating police officers, &quot;The whole department knew about it.&quot; The date of death listed on his death certificate is December 30, 1970, which police estimated by judging the number of milk bottles and newspapers around the front door of the property. Coroner Mark Herman said traces of heroin byproducts were found in Liston&#x27;s system, but not in amounts large enough to have caused his death. Also, scar tissue, possibly from needle marks, was found in the bend of Liston&#x27;s left elbow. The toxicology report said his body was too decomposed for the tests to be conclusive. Officially, Liston died of lung congestion and heart failure. He had been suffering from hardening of the heart muscle and lung disease before his death. Liston had been hospitalized in early December, complaining of chest pains.

Liston was buried at Paradise Memorial Gardens in Las Vegas, Nevada. The grave&#x27;s marker-plate bears the dedication: &quot;A Man.&quot;

===Theories regarding death circumstances===
Sgt. Dennis Caputo of the Clark County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was one of the first officers on the scene. He found a quarter-ounce of heroin in a balloon in the kitchen, and a half-ounce of marijuana in Liston&#x27;s pants pocket, but no syringes or needles. Some found it suspicious that authorities could not locate any drug paraphernalia that Liston presumably would have needed to inject the fatal dose, such as a spoon to cook the heroin or a tourniquet to wrap around his arm. However, according to former Las Vegas police Sergeant Gary Beckwith, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for family members in these cases to go through and tidy up ... to save family embarrassment.&quot;

Many people who knew Liston insisted he was afraid of needles and never would have used heroin. &quot;He had a deadly fear of needles,&quot; said Davey Pearl, a boxing referee and friend of Liston&#x27;s. &quot;There was nothing Sonny feared more than a needle. I know!&quot; said Liston&#x27;s Philadelphia dentist, Dr. Nick Ragni. &quot;He was afraid of needles,&quot; echoed Father Edward Murphy. &quot;He would do everything to avoid taking shots.&quot; According to Liston&#x27;s trainer, Willie Reddish, Liston cancelled a planned tour to Africa in 1963 because he refused to get the required inoculations. Liston&#x27;s wife also recalled that her husband would refuse basic medical care for common colds because of his dislike of needles.

&quot;The month before he died, some guy ran into Sonny while he was making a left turn. He had a whiplash, so they took him to the hospital,&quot; said boxing trainer Johnny Tocco. &quot;He said: &#x27;Look what they did!&#x27; and he was pointing at some little bandage over the needle mark in his arm. He was more angry about that shot than he was about the car wreck. A couple weeks later, he was still complainin&#x27; about that needle mark. To this day, I&#x27;m convinced that&#x27;s what the coroner saw in his exam—that hospital needle mark.&quot;

However, some individuals have claimed that Liston was murdered. There are several theories as to why. Publicist Harold Conrad and others believed that Liston had been deeply involved as a bill collector for a loansharking ring in Las Vegas. When he allegedly tried to claim a bigger share, Conrad theorizes that his employers got him very drunk, took him home and injected him with an overdose. Professional gambler Lem Banker insists that Liston was murdered by drug dealers with whom he had become involved. Banker said he was told by police that Liston had been seen at a house that would be the target of a drug raid. Banker stated that &quot;Sheriff [Ralph] Lamb told me, &#x27;Tell your pal Sonny to stay away from the West Side because we&#x27;re going to bust the drug dealers.&#x27;&quot; Banker later learned that the police told Liston the same thing to his face. Liston was allegedly present at dealer Earl Cage&#x27;s residence during a raid by narcotics detectives. Because of that, Cage may have thought Sonny was an informant and injected him with a &quot;hot dose&quot; as retribution. Another theory is that the mob promised Liston some money to throw the second Ali fight, but they never paid him. As the years passed and Liston&#x27;s financial situation worsened, he got angry and told the mob he would go public with the story unless they gave him the money, leading to his murder. Yet another version is that Liston was supposed to take a dive when he fought Chuck Wepner six months earlier, and killing him was payback for his failure to do so.

On January 1, Liston&#x27;s wife, Geraldine, called Johnny Tocco and said she had not heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he allegedly told one of his good friends, Tony Davi, that he went to Liston&#x27;s house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Liston lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Tocco left the house before the police did. &quot;Johnny wasn&#x27;t a braggart,&quot; Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. &quot;He told me in the strictest confidence, but it was like he wanted to get it off his chest.&quot; Gallender claimed, &quot;A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot.&quot;

==Tributes==
Despite being effectively blacklisted by the boxing establishment and press during his lifetime, Liston achieved a level of public awareness that is rare for a sportsperson. This has endured. His reputation as a great boxer with a unique though daunting persona has grown steadily over the decades following his death. A bronze copy of a marble statue of Liston sculpted by Alfred Hrdlicka in 1964 was erected in 2008 between Old Castle and Karlsplatz in Stuttgart, Germany. A successful racehorse which won the Irish St Leger classic race in 2021 was named Sonnyboyliston. Another unconnected and unrelated horse named Sonny Liston finished 2nd in the Royal Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot in 2023 and 2024.

==Life outside boxing==

Thom Jones titled his 2000 collection of short stories &quot;Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine&quot;.

Sonny Liston was featured in a novel &quot;Girl Fighter&quot; with a brief reference to his early life, his rise to WBC heavyweight champion and his eventual losses to Clay/Ali.

===Music===
Liston has been referenced in many songs by artists such as Curtis Eller, Sun Kil Moon, the Animals, Tom Petty, Mark Knopfler, Phil Ochs, Morrissey, Freddy Blohm, Chuck E. Weiss, This Bike is a Pipe Bomb, the Roots, Wu-Tang Clan, Gone Jackals, Billy Joel, the Mountain Goats, Lil Wayne, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and the Killers. Mark Knopfler&#x27;s tribute to Liston, &quot;Song for Sonny Liston&quot;, appeared on his 2004 album &quot;Shangri-La&quot;.

A wax model of Liston appears in the front row of the iconic sleeve cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. He is seen in the far left part of the row, wearing a white and gold robe, standing beside the original-look Beatle wax figures.

Singer/songwriter Rod Picott wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Sonny Liston&quot; for his 2022 album &quot;Paper Hearts and Broken Arrows.&quot;

Shaun Assael wrote &quot;The Murder of Sonny Liston: Las Vegas, Heroin, and Heavyweights&quot;, published in 2016. The book suggests that Sonny Liston may have been murdered and a possibility that the crime was never investigated. In The Devil and Sonny Liston by Nick Tosches, published in 2000, when many of Liston&#x27;s former acquaintances were still alive, Tosches posits that Liston&#x27;s idol Joe Louis introduced him to heroin, and that he ultimately overdosed.

===Activism===
On July 28, 1963, Liston joined a group of 500 African Americans in Denver who marched to a post office to mail letters urging the Colorado congressional delegation to pass the Kennedy administration&#x27;s civil rights package.

<text>Viscaceae is a taxonomic family name of flowering plants. In this circumscription, the family includes the several genera of mistletoes. This family name is currently being studied and under review as in past decades, several systems of plant taxonomy recognized this family, notably the 1981 Cronquist system.

However, the APG II system of 2003 does not recognize the family, treating it as a synonym of Santalaceae. This did not end the taxonomic debate among botanists and there are many that still think Viscaceae should be an accepted family name. According to the APG IV system, Der and Nickrent (2008) found seven well supported clades in Santalaceae, but relationships between these clades are still poorly understood. The traditional and cultural uses of species within the Viscaceae merit further attention.

Clades or genera treated as belonging to the currently debated family name Viscaceae include:
*&quot;Arceuthobium&quot;
*&quot;Dendrophthora&quot;
*&quot;Ginalloa&quot;
*&quot;Korthalsella&quot;
*&quot;Notothixos&quot;
*&quot;Phoradendron&quot;
*&quot;Viscum&quot;

<text>Loranthaceae, commonly known as the showy mistletoes, is a family of flowering plants. It consists of about 75 genera and 1,000 species of woody plants, many of them hemiparasites. The three terrestrial species are &quot;Nuytsia floribunda&quot; (the Western Australian Christmas tree), &quot;Atkinsonia ligustrina&quot; (from the Blue Mountains of Australia), and &quot;Gaiadendron punctatum&quot; (from Central/South America.) Loranthaceae are primarily xylem parasites, but their haustoria may sometimes tap the phloem, while &quot;Tristerix aphyllus&quot; is almost holoparasitic.
For a more complete description of the Australian Loranthaceae, see Flora of Australia online ., for the Malesian Loranthaceae see Flora of Malesia.

Originally, Loranthaceae contained all mistletoe species, but the mistletoes of Europe and North America (&quot;Viscum&quot;, &quot;Arceuthobium&quot;, and &quot;Phoradendron&quot;) belong to the family Santalaceae. The APG II system 2003 assigns the family to the order Santalales in the clade core eudicots.

== Phylogeny==
Molecular phylogenetics suggests the following relationships of tribes, subtribes and genera: &quot;Nuytsia&quot; is sister to the rest of the Loranthaceae, with many characters, including its pollen, its fruit (dry and three winged), and the number of its cotyledons, differing substantially from all other Loranthaceae genera. The root parasitic habit is thought to be the basal condition of the family., with the stem/branch parasitic habit evolving ca. 28-40 million years ago. However, Grimsson &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) estimate this as occurring somewhat earlier (ca. 40-52 million years ago).

<text>Donna Adrian Gaines (December 31, 1948May 17, 2012), known professionally as Donna Summer, was an American singer and songwriter. She gained prominence during the disco era of the 1970s and became known as the &quot;Queen of Disco&quot;, while her music gained a global following.

Influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, Summer became the lead singer of a psychedelic rock band named Crow and moved to New York City. In 1968, she joined a German adaptation of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; in Munich, where she spent several years living, acting, and singing. There, she met music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and they went on to record influential disco hits together such as &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; and &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, marking Summer&#x27;s breakthrough into international music markets. Summer returned to the United States in 1976, and more hits such as &quot;Last Dance&quot;, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;, &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot;, &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; with Barbra Streisand, and &quot;On the Radio&quot; followed.

A hitmaker on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two decades, Summer recorded 32 chart singles on the chart, with 14 top ten singles and four number ones. Her first top ten hit, &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;, peaked at number two in 1976, while her last top ten single, &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot;, reached number seven in 1989, spanning thirteen years. Summer also made chart history in 1979 by being the first female solo recording artist to record three number one singles in the same calendar year (&quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and &quot;No More Tears (Enough is Enough&quot;)&quot;). Summer sent a song to the top 40 for nine consecutive years (1976-1984). Summer&#x27;s last Hot 100 hit, &quot;I Will Go with You (Con te partirò)&quot;, charted in 1999. Summer was mostly successful on the magazine&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Songs chart where she recorded 16 number one singles.

Summer died in 2012 from lung cancer, at her home in Naples, Florida. In her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, she was described as the &quot;undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom&quot; who reached the status of &quot;one of the world&#x27;s leading female singers.&quot; Moroder described Summer&#x27;s work on the song &quot;I Feel Love&quot; as &quot;really the start of electronic dance&quot; music. In 2013, Summer was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her sixth on its list of the &quot;Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists&quot;.

==Early life==
Donna Adrian Gaines, the third of seven children, was born in Boston on December 31, 1948, to Andrew and Mary Gaines. She was raised in the Boston neighborhood of Mission Hill. Her father was a butcher, and her mother was a schoolteacher.

Summer&#x27;s performance debut occurred at church when she was ten years old, replacing a vocalist who failed to appear. She attended Boston&#x27;s Jeremiah E. Burke High School where she performed in school musicals and was considered popular. In 1967, just weeks before graduation, Summer left for New York City, where she joined the blues rock band Crow. After a record label passed on signing the group since it was only interested in the band&#x27;s lead singer, the group agreed to dissolve.

Summer stayed in New York and auditioned for a role in the counterculture musical, &quot;Hair&quot;. She landed the part of Sheila and agreed to take the role in the Munich production of the show, moving there in August 1968 after getting her parents&#x27; reluctant approval. It turned out to be the best decision she could have made. The show was so successful, that it didn&#x27;t just rocket-start her career but also many of her castmates&#x27;. The cast included: Helga Charlotte Tolle, Reiner Schöne, Ron Williams, Gudrun &quot;Su&quot; Kramer, Elke Koska, Jürgen Markus, Jutta Weinhold, Peter Kent, who all starred alongside Summer in the musical Hair. She eventually became fluent in German, singing various songs in that language, and participated in the musicals &quot;&quot; (the German version of &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot;), &quot;Godspell&quot;, and &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Within three years, she moved to Vienna, Austria, and joined the Vienna Volksoper.

In 1968, Summer released (as Donna Gaines) on Polydor her first single, a German version of the title &quot;Aquarius&quot; from the musical (&quot;Hair&quot;), followed in 1971 by a second single, a remake of the Jaynetts&#x27; 1963 hit, &quot;Sally Go &#x27;Round the Roses&quot;, from a one-off European deal with Decca Records. In 1969, she issued the single &quot;If You Walkin&#x27; Alone&quot; on Philips Records.

She married Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer in 1973, and gave birth to their daughter Natalia Pia Melanie &quot;Mimi&quot; Sommer, the same year. She provided backing vocals for producer-keyboardist Veit Marvos on his Ariola Records release &quot;Nice to See You&quot;, credited as &quot;Gayn Pierre&quot;. Several subsequent singles included Donna performing with the group, and the name &quot;Gayn Pierre&quot; was used while performing in &quot;Godspell&quot; with Helmuth Sommer during 1972. Their marriage subsequently ended in divorce, and she married singer-guitarist Bruce Sudano in 1980.

==Music career==
===1974–1979: Initial success===

While working as a model part-time and backing singer in Munich, Summer met producer Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte during a recording session for Three Dog Night at Musicland Studios. The trio forged a working partnership, and Donna was signed to their Oasis label in 1974. A demo tape of Summer&#x27;s work with Moroder and Bellotte led to a deal with the European-distributed label Groovy Records. Due to an error on the record cover, Donna Sommer became Donna Summer; the name stuck. Summer&#x27;s first album was &quot;Lady of the Night&quot;. It became a hit in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Belgium on the strength of two songs, &quot;The Hostage&quot; and the title track &quot;Lady of the Night&quot;. &quot;The Hostage&quot; reached the top of the charts in France, but was removed from radio playlists in Germany because of the song&#x27;s subject matter: a high ranking politician that had recently been kidnapped and held for ransom. One of her first TV appearances was in the Dutch television show, &quot;Van Oekel&#x27;s Discohoek&quot;, which started the breakthrough of &quot;The Hostage&quot;, and in which she gracefully went along with the scripted absurdity and chaos in the show.

In 1975, Summer passed on an idea for a song to Moroder who was working with another artist; a song that would be called &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;. Summer, Moroder and Bellotte wrote the song together, and together they worked on a demo version with Summer singing the song. Moroder decided that Summer&#x27;s version should be released. Seeking an American release for the song, it was sent to Casablanca Records president Neil Bogart. Bogart played the song at one of his extravagant industry parties, where it was so popular with the crowd, they insisted that it be played over and over, each time it ended. Bogart requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discothèques. Moroder, Bellotte, and Summer returned with a 17-minute version. Bogart tweaked the title and Casablanca signed Summer, releasing the single in November 1975. The shorter 7&quot; version of the single was promoted by radio stations, while clubs regularly played the 17-minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album).

By early 1976, &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; had reached No. 2 on the US Hot 100 chart and had become a Gold single, while the album had sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer&#x27;s moans and groans, which emulated lovemaking, and some American stations, like those in Europe with the initial release, refused to play it. Despite this, &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban. Casablanca Records wasted no time releasing the follow-up album &quot;A Love Trilogy&quot;, featuring &quot;Try Me, I Know We Can Make It&quot;.

In 1977, Summer released the concept album &quot;I Remember Yesterday&quot;. The song &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. and No. 1 in the UK. She received her first American Music Award nomination for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Artist. The single would attain Gold status and the album went Platinum in the US. Another concept album, also released in 1977, was &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, a double album which told of a modern-day Cinderella &quot;rags to riches&quot; story. This album would attain Gold status. Summer recorded the song &quot;Down Deep Inside&quot; as the theme song for the 1977 film &quot;The Deep&quot;. In 1978, Summer acted in the film &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot;, the film met with modest success; the song &quot;Last Dance&quot;, reached No. 3 on the Hot 100. The soundtrack and single both went Gold and resulted in Summer winning her first Grammy Award, for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Its writer, Paul Jabara, won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for the composition. Summer also had &quot;With Your Love&quot; and &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot;, on the soundtrack. Her version of the Jimmy Webb ballad, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 chart. It was also the only No. 1 hit for songwriter Jimmy Webb; the single went Gold and topped the charts for three weeks. She received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song was featured on Summer&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live and More&quot;, which also became her first album to hit number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went double-Platinum, selling over 2 million copies. The week of November 11, 1978, Summer became the first female artist of the modern rock era to have the No. 1 single on the Hot 100 and album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, simultaneously. The song &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;, which featured Brooklyn Dreams singer Joe &quot;Bean&quot; Esposito; reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 and became another Gold single.

In 1979, Summer won three American Music Awards for Single, Album and Female Artist, in the Disco category at the awards held in January. Summer performed at the world-televised Music for UNICEF Concert, joining contemporaries such as ABBA; Olivia Newton-John; the Bee Gees; Andy Gibb; Rod Stewart; John Denver; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Rita Coolidge; and Kris Kristofferson for a TV special that raised funds and awareness for the world&#x27;s children. Artists donated royalties of certain songs, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. Summer began work on her next project with Moroder and Bellotte, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;. Moroder brought in Harold Faltermeyer, with whom he had collaborated on the soundtrack of film &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, to be the album&#x27;s arranger.

In 1979, Summer gained five big hits: &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; and &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;, &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot;, and No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;. The week of June 16, 1979, Summer would again have the number-one single on the Hot 100 chart, and the number-one album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart; when &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; regained the top spot on the Hot 100 chart. The following week, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; would be on top of the US Top R&amp;B albums chart. 
===1980–1985: &quot;She Works Hard For The Money&quot;, unreleased album, new record label===
Summer received four nominations for the 7th Annual American Music Awards in 1980, and took home awards for Female Pop/Rock and Female Soul/R&amp;B Artist; and well as Pop/Rock single for &quot;Bad Girls&quot;. In 1980, her single &quot;On the Radio&quot;, reached No. 5, selling over a million copies in the US alone, making it a Gold single. &quot;The Wanderer&quot; reached #3 on the Hot 100. Summer would again receive a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Just over a week after the awards, Summer had her own nationally televised special, &quot;The Donna Summer Special&quot;, which aired on ABC network on January 27, 1980. After the release of the &quot;On the Radio&quot; album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and Casablanca Records. Casablanca wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President Neil Bogart over the early release of the single &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;, because Casablanca didn&#x27;t wait until her previous single, &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot;, had peaked; she had penned &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with Geffen Records, the new label started by David Geffen. Summer filed a $10 million lawsuit against Casablanca; the label counter-sued. In the end, she did not receive any money, but won the rights to her own lucrative song publishing.

Summer&#x27;s first Geffen album, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, featured an eclectic mixture of sounds, bringing elements of rock, rockabilly, new wave, and gospel music. The album continued Summer&#x27;s streak of Gold albums with the &quot;title track&quot; peaking at 3 on the Hot 100 chart. Its follow-up singles were, &quot;Cold Love&quot;, 33; and &quot;Who Do You Think You&#x27;re Foolin&#x27;&quot;, 40. Summer was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Cold Love&quot;, and Best Inspirational Performance for &quot;I Believe in Jesus&quot; at the 1981 Grammy Awards.

She would soon be working on her next album. It was to be another double album set. When David Geffen stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned that it was a work in progress, but it was almost done. That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He heard enough to tell producers that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title &quot;I&#x27;m a Rainbow&quot;. Over the years, a few of the tracks would be released. The song &quot;Highway Runner&quot; appears on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. &quot;Romeo&quot; appears on the &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack. Both, &quot;I&#x27;m a Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; would be on her 1993 anthology album.

David Geffen hired top R&amp;B and pop producer Quincy Jones to produce Summer&#x27;s next album, the eponymously titled &quot;Donna Summer&quot;. During the recording of the project, Neil Bogart died of cancer in May 1982 at age 39. Summer would sing at his funeral. The album included the top-ten hit &quot;Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)&quot;; for which she received a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Summer was also nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Protection&quot;, penned for her by Bruce Springsteen. Other singles included a cover of the Jon and Vangelis song &quot;State of Independence&quot; ( 41 pop) and &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; (No. 33 pop).

By then Geffen Records had been notified by Polygram Records, which now owned Casablanca, that Summer still needed to deliver to them one more album to fulfill her contract. Summer had her biggest success in the 1980s while on Geffen&#x27;s roster with her next album &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot; and its title song—which were released by Mercury Records in a one-off arrangement to settle Summer&#x27;s split with the soon-to-be-defunct Casablanca Records, whose catalogue now resided with Mercury and Casablanca&#x27;s parent company PolyGram.

Summer recorded and delivered the album &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot; and Polygram released it on its Mercury imprint in 1983. The title song became a major hit, reaching 3 on the US Hot 100, as well as No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B chart for three weeks. It also garnered Summer another Grammy nomination, for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. &quot;Unconditional Love&quot;, which featured the British group Musical Youth, and &quot;Love Has a Mind of Its Own&quot; did not crack the top 40. The album itself was certified Gold, and climbed to 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart; the highest chart position of any female artist in male-dominated 1983. The song &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; would win Summer her third Grammy Award, this time for Best Inspirational Performance.

British director Brian Grant was hired to direct Summer&#x27;s video for &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot;. It eventually aired on MTV and entered heavy rotation in August 1983, marking one of the first times a black female artist have a video achieve heavy rotation. The video was a success, being nominated for Best Female Video and Best Choreography at the 1984 MTV Music Video Awards. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer&#x27;s Costa Mesa HBO concert special, &quot;A Hot Summers Night&quot;. Grant, who was a fan of the song &quot;State of Independence&quot;, had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. According to Grant, &quot;It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there.&quot; He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). &quot;It&#x27;s a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn&#x27;t be filmed in the end&quot;. When the final sequence was filmed, Summer&#x27;s daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for &quot;State of Independence&quot;.

In late 1983, David Geffen enlisted &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&#x27;s&quot; producer Michael Omartian to produce &quot;Cats Without Claws&quot;. Summer was happy that Geffen and his executives stayed out of the studio during the recording and thanked him in the album&#x27;s liner notes, but her request for the lead single would be rejected. &quot;Cats Without Claws&quot; was not successful, peaking at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was also the first Summer album to not at least ship gold in the US. The leading single, a cover of &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, peaked at number 21, which made it the first time since 1977 in which Summer had not scored a top ten single on an album. The follow-up, &quot;Supernatural Love&quot;, peaked at number 75. Despite the downturn in record sales and chart fortunes, Summer won another Grammy for the song &quot;Forgive Me&quot; in the Best Inspirational Performance category.
On January 19, 1985, Summer&#x27;s sang at the nationally televised 50th Presidential Inaugural Gala the day before the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan.

===1986–1989: &quot;All Systems Go&quot;, &quot;Another Place and Time&quot;===
In 1986, Harold Faltermeyer wrote the title song for a German ski movie called &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, and thought Summer would be ideal to sing the song. He decided to reach out to Summer and, although she was not interested in singing the song, she was very much interested in working with Faltermeyer again. After a meeting with David Geffen he was on board with the project. Summer&#x27;s main objective for the album was that it have stronger R&amp;B influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Fletch&quot;, was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not think there were enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce &quot;Dinner with Gershwin&quot;, but he was already busy with another project, so another producer was found. They also substituted a previous recording called &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, songs like &quot;Fascination&quot;, fell by the wayside. Geffen had shared the vision of moving Summer into the R&amp;B market as a veteran artist, but these expectations were not met. Faltermeyer, in a 2012 interview with &quot;Daeida Magazine&quot;, said, &quot;She was an older artist by then and the label&#x27;s priority may have been on the youth market. The decision was made afterward by executives who were looking for a radio hit for 1987 and not something that would perhaps last beyond then.&quot; The label&#x27;s President Ed Rosenblatt would later admit: &quot;The company never intended to focus on established superstars&quot;. The album &quot;All Systems Go&quot; became Summer&#x27;s lowest charting studio album to date and also failed to go gold, continuing Summer&#x27;s career downturns. The single &quot;Dinner with Gershwin&quot; (written by Brenda Russell) stalled at 48 in the US, though it became a hit in the UK, peaking at 13. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;All Systems Go&quot;, was released only in the UK, where it peaked at 54.

For Summer&#x27;s next album, Geffen Records hired the British hit production team of Stock Aitken Waterman (or &quot;SAW&quot;), who enjoyed incredible success writing and producing for such acts as Kylie Minogue, Bananarama, and Rick Astley, among others. The SAW team describe the working experience as a labour of love, and said it was their favourite album of all that they had recorded. Geffen decided not to release the album &quot;Another Place and Time&quot;, and Summer and Geffen Records parted ways in 1988. The album was released in Europe in March 1989 on Warner Bros. Records, which had been Summer&#x27;s label in Europe since 1982. The single &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; became a top ten hit in several countries in Europe, prompting Warner Bros.&#x27; sister company, Atlantic Records, to sign Summer in the US. The single peaked at 7 on the US Hot 100 and became her 12th Gold single in America. She scored two more UK hits from the album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Get Hurt&quot; (UK 7) and &quot;Love&#x27;s About to Change My Heart&quot; (UK 20).

In 1989, Summer and her husband, Bruce Sudano, had been in talks to do a new kind of reality-based sitcom. It would be based on their own hectic household. At the time, they lived with their children Amanda, Brooklyn and Mimi, two sets of in-laws, and a maid. The television network started changing the premise of the show, making it less funny, says Sudano, &quot;And because we were an interracial couple, they didn&#x27;t want us to be married anymore&quot;. In 1989, this was &quot;an issue. So with that mentality we just backed out of it.&quot;

===1990–1999: &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, acting, and &quot;Live &amp; More Encore&quot;===
In 1990, a Warner compilation, &quot;The Best of Donna Summer&quot;, was released (no US issue). The album went Gold in the UK after the song &quot;State of Independence&quot; was re-released there to promote the album. A remix of the &quot;Another Place and Time&quot; track &quot;Breakaway&quot; was released from the same album, becoming a major hit in Latin America. Despite this success, Summer rejected Sudano&#x27;s advice that she should record a second album with SAW, insisting that she wanted to make an R&amp;B record.

The following year, Summer worked with producer Keith Diamond emerged with the album &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, which included elements of R&amp;B as well as new jack swing. &quot;When Love Cries&quot; became a top 20 hit on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart, reaching 18. However, the album was commercially unsuccessful, becoming the first Donna Summer release to not reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and every other chart worldwide, with its only chart appearance being at the Top R&amp;B Albums chart, where it peaked at number 97. In 1992, Summer embarked on a world tour and later that year received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She reunited with Giorgio Moroder, for the song &quot;Carry On&quot;, which was included on the 1993, Polygram issued &quot;The Donna Summer Anthology&quot;, it contained 34 tracks of Summer&#x27;s material with Casablanca and Mercury Records, and from her tenures with Atlantic and Geffen.

Summer signed with Mercury/Polygram that same year, and in 1994 she re-teamed with producer Michael Omartian to record a Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Spirit,&quot; which included classic Christmas songs such as &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot; and three Summer-penned songs, &quot;Christmas is Here&quot;, &quot;Lamb of God&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track. Summer was accompanied by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. Another hits collection, &quot;Endless Summer: Donna Summer&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, was released featuring eighteen songs. There were two new tracks &quot;Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)&quot; and &quot;Any Way at All&quot;. In 1994, she also contributed to the &quot;Tribute to Edith Piaf&quot; album, singing &quot;La Vie En Rose&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)&quot; went No. 1 on the US dance charts, and No. 21 in the UK. In 1996, Summer recorded a duet with Bruce Roberts, &quot;Whenever There Is Love&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Daylight&quot;. In 1996, Summer also recorded &quot;Does He Love You&quot; with Liza Minnelli, which appeared on Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Gently&quot;.

During this time, Summer had role on the sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; as Steve Urkel&#x27;s (Jaleel White) Aunt Oona. She made two appearances, season 5&#x27;s &quot;Aunt Oona&quot; and season 8&#x27;s &quot;Pound Foolish&quot;. In 1998, Summer received the first Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, after a remixed version of her 1992 collaboration with Giorgio Moroder, &quot;Carry On&quot;, was released in 1997. In 1999, Summer was asked to do the Divas 2 concert, but when she went in and met with the producers, it was decided that they would do Donna in concert by herself. Summer taped a live television special for VH1 titled &quot;Donna Summer – Live &amp; More Encore&quot;, producing the second-highest ratings for the network that year, after their annual &quot;Divas&quot; special. A CD of the event was released by Epic Records and featured two studio recordings, &quot;I Will Go with You (Con te partirò)&quot; and &quot;Love Is the Healer&quot;, both of which reached No. 1 on the US dance charts.

===2000–2009: Later recordings and &quot;Crayons&quot;===

In 2000, Summer participated in VH1&#x27;s third annual &quot;Divas&quot; special, dedicated to Diana Ross; she sang the Supremes hit Reflections, and her own material for the show. &quot;The Power of One&quot; is a theme song for the movie &quot;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&quot;. The dramatic ballad was produced by David Foster and dance remixes were also issued to DJs and became another dance floor success for Summer, peaking at No. 2 on the same chart in 2000. In 2003, Summer issued her autobiography, &quot;Ordinary Girl: The Journey,&quot; and released a best-of set titled &quot;The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer&quot;. In 2004, Summer was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame as an artist, alongside the Bee Gees and Barry Gibb. Her classic song, &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, was inducted that night as well. In 2004 and 2005, Summer&#x27;s success on the dance charts continued with the songs &quot;You&#x27;re So Beautiful&quot; and &quot;I Got Your Love&quot;. In 2004, Summer re-recorded &#x27;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&#x27; with the Irish pop band Westlife (with a live performance) for the compilation album, &quot;DiscoMania&quot;.

In 2008, Summer released her first studio album of fully original material in 17 years, entitled &quot;Crayons&quot;. Released on the Sony BMG label Burgundy Records, it peaked at No. 17 on the US Top 200 Album Chart, her highest placing on the chart since 1983. The songs &quot;I&#x27;m a Fire&quot;, &quot;Stamp Your Feet&quot; and &quot;Fame (The Game)&quot; all reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart. The ballad &quot;Sand on My Feet&quot; was released to adult contemporary stations and reached No. 30 on that chart. Summer said, &quot;I wanted this album to have a lot of different directions on it. I did not want it to be any one baby. I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world. There&#x27;s a touch of this, a little smidgeon of that, a dash of something else, like when you&#x27;re cooking.&quot; On December 11, 2009, Donna Summer appeared at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert for Barack Obama.

===2010–present: Final recordings and posthumous releases===
On July 29, 2010, Summer gave an interview with Allvoices.com wherein she was asked if she would consider doing an album of standards. She said, &quot;I actually am, probably in September. I will begin work on a standards album. I will probably do an all-out dance album and a standards album. I&#x27;m going to do both and we will release them however we&#x27;re going to release them. We are not sure which is going first.&quot;

In August 2010, Summer released the single &quot;To Paris With Love&quot;, co-written with Bruce Roberts and produced by Peter Stengaard. The single went to No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart in October 2010. That month, Summer also appeared on the PBS television special &quot;Hitman Returns: David Foster and Friends&quot;. In it, Summer performed with Seal on a medley of the songs &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and &quot;On the Radio&quot; before closing the show with &quot;Last Dance&quot;.

On September 15, 2010, Summer appeared as a guest celebrity, singing alongside contestant Prince Poppycock, on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

Also in 2010, Summer recorded a version of the Dan Fogelberg song &quot;Nether Lands&quot; for a Fogelberg tribute project. According to a comment on Fogelberg&#x27;s website, the song had great personal significance for Summer.

On June 6, 2011, Summer was a guest judge on the show &quot;Platinum Hit&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Dance Floor Royalty&quot;. In July of that same year, Summer was working at Paramount Recording Studios in Los Angeles with her nephew, the rapper and producer O&#x27;Mega Red. Together they worked on a track titled &quot;Angel&quot;.

On December 11, 2012, after four prior nominations, Summer was posthumously announced to be one of the 2013 inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was inducted on April 18, 2013, at Los Angeles&#x27; Nokia Theater.

A remix album titled &quot;Love to Love You Donna&quot;, containing new remixes of some of Summer&#x27;s classics, was released in October 2013. &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; was remixed by Laidback Luke for the remix collection; it was also remixed by Ralphi Rosario, which version was released to dance clubs all over America and successfully peaked at No. 1, giving Summer her first posthumous number-one single, and her sixteenth number-one on the charts.

In 2021, Summer&#x27;s estate released a reedited version of her ninth studio album &quot;I&#x27;m a Rainbow&quot;, subtitled &quot;Recovered &amp; Recoloured&quot;. The new edition is reduced to 10 tracks (15 on vinyl and streaming releases), with each song remixed by contemporary producers and remixers.

Her self-titled album was re-released in 2022 by Summer&#x27;s estate subtitled as &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot;.

In 2023, Summer&#x27;s &quot;She Works Hard For The Money&quot; album was re-released with additional mixes to commemorate the album&#x27;s 40th Anniversary. That same year, a documentary revolving around Summer and her career, &quot;Love to Love You, Donna Summer&quot;, directed by her daughter, Brooklyn Sudano and Roger Ross Williams had its world premiere at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2023, and was released in May 2023, on HBO.

==Controversy==
In the mid-1980s, Summer was embroiled in a controversy when she allegedly made anti-gay remarks about the relatively new disease AIDS. Summer publicly denied ever making such comments and in a letter to the AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989 said it was &quot;a terrible misunderstanding&quot;. In explaining why she had not responded to ACT UP sooner, Summer stated, &quot;I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters. If I have caused you pain, forgive me.&quot; She closed her letter with Bible quotes (from Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians).

In 1989, Summer told &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine, &quot;A couple of the people I write with are gay and they have been ever since I met them. What people want to do with their bodies is their personal preference&quot;. A few years later, she filed a lawsuit against &quot;New York&quot; magazine when it printed an old story about the rumors as fact, just as she was about to release her album &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; in 1991. According to a &quot;Biography&quot; television program dedicated to Summer in which she participated in 1995, the lawsuit was settled out of court although neither side wanted to divulge any details.

==Personal life==
Summer was raised in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Summer married Brooklyn Dreams singer Bruce Sudano on July 16, 1980. They had two daughters together, Brooklyn Sudano and Amanda Sudano. Summer was also one of the founding members of Oasis Church in Los Angeles.

Summer and her family moved from the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1995, where she took time off from show business to focus on painting, a hobby she had developed in the 1980s.

==Death==
Summer died on May 17, 2012, aged 63, at her home in Naples, Florida, from lung cancer. Being a nonsmoker, Summer thought that the cancer had been caused by inhaling toxic fumes and dust from the September 11 attacks in New York City; she was in her apartment near Ground Zero when the attacks occurred. However, some reports have instead attributed the cancer to Summer&#x27;s smoking during her younger years, her continued exposure to second-hand smoking while performing in clubs well after she had herself quit the habit, and a predisposition to this disease in the family.

Summer&#x27;s funeral service was held in Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, on the afternoon of May 23, 2012. The exact location and time of the service were kept private. Several hundred of Summer&#x27;s friends and relatives attended the funeral, according to CNN. The funeral was a private ceremony, and cameras were not allowed inside the church. She was interred in the Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens cemetery in Nashville.

===Reactions===

Singers and music industry professionals around the world reacted to Summer&#x27;s death. Gloria Gaynor said she was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; and that Summer was &quot;a fine lady and human being&quot;. Liza Minnelli said, &quot;She was a queen, The Queen Of Disco, and we will be dancing to her music forever.&quot; She said that her &quot;thoughts and prayers are with her family always.&quot; Dolly Parton said, &quot;Donna, like Whitney, was one of the greatest voices ever. I loved her records. She was the disco queen and will remain so. I knew her and found her to be one of the most likable and fun people ever. She will be missed and remembered.&quot; Janet Jackson wrote that Summer &quot;changed the world of music with her beautiful voice and incredible talent.&quot; Barbra Streisand wrote, &quot;I loved doing the duet with her. She had an amazing voice and was so talented. It&#x27;s so sad.&quot; Quincy Jones wrote that Summer&#x27;s voice was &quot;the heartbeat and soundtrack of a generation.&quot;

Aretha Franklin said, &quot;It&#x27;s so shocking to hear about the passing of Donna Summer. In the 1970s, she reigned over the disco era and kept the disco jumping. Who will forget &#x27;Last Dance&#x27;? A fine performer and a very nice person.&quot; Chaka Khan said, &quot;Donna and I had a friendship for over 30 years. She is one of the few black women I could speak German with and she is one of the few friends I had in this business.&quot; Gloria Estefan averred that &quot;It&#x27;s the end of an era&quot;, and posted a photo of herself with Summer. Mary J. Blige tweeted &quot;RIP Donna Summer !!!!!!!! You were truly a game changer !!!&quot; Lenny Kravitz wrote &quot;Rest in peace Donna, You are a pioneer and you have paved the way for so many of us. You transcended race and genre. Respect. Lenny&quot;.

Beyoncé wrote a personal note: &quot;Donna Summer made music that moved me both emotionally and physically to get up and dance. You could always hear the deep passion in her voice. She was so much more than the queen of disco she became known for, she was an honest and gifted singer with flawless vocal talent. I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan and was honored to sample one of her songs. She touched many generations and will be sadly missed. My love goes out to her family during this difficult time. Love, B&quot;.

David Foster said, &quot;My wife and I are in shock and truly devastated. Donna changed the face of pop culture forever. There is no doubt that music would sound different today if she had never graced us with her talent. She was a super-diva and a true superstar who never compromised when it came to her career or her family. She always did it with class, dignity, grace and zero attitude. She lived in rare air ... She was the most spectacular, considerate, constant, giving, generous and loving friend of 35 years. I am at a total loss trying to process this tragic news.&quot;

US President Barack Obama said, &quot;Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Donna Summer. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Donna truly was the &#x27;Queen of Disco.&#x27; Her voice was unforgettable and the music industry has lost a legend far too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Donna&#x27;s family and her dedicated fans.&quot;

Summer was honored at the 2012 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards ceremony. Singer Natasha Bedingfield honored Summer, calling her &quot;a remarkable woman who brought so much light and who inspired many women, including myself, through her music. And if we can remember her through her music, this will never really be the last dance.&quot; After her statement, she began to sing &quot;Last Dance&quot;, Summer&#x27;s Academy Award-winning song. As she sang the song, photos of Summer were displayed on a screen overhead.

Fans paid tribute to Summer by leaving flowers and memorabilia on her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. A few days after her death, her album sales increased by 3,277%, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that the week before she died, Summer sold about 1,000 albums. After her death that number increased to 26,000.

==Legacy==
According to singer Marc Almond, Summer&#x27;s collaboration with producer Giorgio Moroder &quot;changed the face of music&quot;. Summer was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart: &quot;Live and More&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and &quot;On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I &amp; II&quot;. She became a cultural icon and her prominence on the dance charts, for which she was referred to as the Queen of Disco, made her not just one of the defining voices of that era, but also an influence on pop artists from Madonna to Beyoncé. Unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular in the early 1980s, Summer was able to grow beyond the genre and segued to a pop-rock sound. She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with &quot;She Works Hard For the Money&quot;, which became another anthem, this time for women&#x27;s rights. Summer was the first black woman to be nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. Summer remained a force on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play Songs chart throughout her career and notched 16 number one singles. Her last studio album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Crayons&quot;, spun off three No. 1 dance/club hits with &quot;I&#x27;m a Fire&quot;, &quot;Stamp Your Feet&quot; and &quot;Fame (The Game)&quot;. In May 2012, it was announced that &quot;I Feel Love&quot; was included in the list of preserved recordings at the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry. Her Rock and Roll Hall of Fame page listed Summer as &quot;the Diva De Tutte Dive, the first true diva of the modern pop era&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;&quot;, a biographical musical featuring Summer&#x27;s songs, began performances on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, following a 2017 world premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.

In the 2019 film &quot;How to Build a Girl&quot;, Summer is among the figures featured in Johanna&#x27;s wall collage.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Summer at number 122 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2023, HBO released the documentary &quot;Love to Love You, Donna Summer&quot;, directed by filmmaker Roger Ross Williams and Brooklyn Sudano, daughter of Donna Summer.

<doc id="149564" wikidata="Q355009" url="?curid=149564" title="Jackson Browne">
<text>Clyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American rock musician, singer, songwriter, and political activist who has sold over 30 million albums in the United States.

Emerging as a teenage songwriter in mid-1960s Los Angeles, he had his first successes writing songs for others. He wrote &quot;These Days&quot; as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and Andy Warhol protégé Nico in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (of which he was briefly a member in 1966) and Eagles, the latter of whom had their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song &quot;Take It Easy&quot;.

Encouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his self-titled debut album in 1972, which included two Top 40 hits of his own, &quot;Doctor, My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Rock Me on the Water&quot;. For his debut album, as well as the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started to work closely with The Section, a prolific session band which also worked with a number of other prominent singer-songwriters of the era. His second album, &quot;For Everyman&quot;, was released in 1973. His third album, &quot;Late for the Sky&quot; (1974), was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. His fourth album, &quot;The Pretender&quot; (1976), continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and included the hit singles &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot; and &quot;The Pretender&quot;.

Browne&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, however, is his signature work; it rose to number 3 on the album chart and remained there for over a year. Both live and a concept album, it explores in its songs the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving tour bus. The album produced two Top 40 singles, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; and &quot;The Load-Out/Stay&quot;, and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the AOR format.

Browne had successful albums through the 1980s, including the 1980 album &quot;Hold Out&quot;, which was his only number 1 album; the non-album single &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Lawyers in Love&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;. In 1986, he released &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;, which had several radio hits and included the introspective &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot;, which was inspired by the suicide of his first wife a decade prior. His string of hit albums came to an end at that point, as his next several albums failed to produce a gold or platinum RIAA rating.

He released two compilation albums, &quot;The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne&quot; in 1997, and &quot;The Very Best of Jackson Browne&quot;, released in conjunction with his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2004. His most recent studio album is 2021&#x27;s &quot;Downhill from Everywhere&quot;, the follow-up to 2014&#x27;s &quot;Standing in the Breach&quot;, which included the first fully realized version of his song &quot;The Birds of St. Marks&quot;, a song he had written at age 18. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him as 37th in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Browne was born October 9, 1948, in Heidelberg, Germany, where his father Clyde Jack Browne, an American serviceman, was stationed for his job assignment with the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper. Browne&#x27;s mother, Beatrice Amanda (née Dahl), was from Minnesota of Norwegian ancestry.

Browne has three siblings: Roberta &quot;Berbie&quot; Browne, born in 1946 in Nuremberg, Germany; Edward Severin Browne, born in 1949 in Frankfurt, Germany; and his younger sister, Gracie Browne, born a number of years later. At the age of three, Browne and his family moved to his grandfather&#x27;s house, Abbey San Encino which is in the Highland Park district of Los Angeles. In his teens, he began singing folk songs in local venues including Ash Grove and The Troubadour Club. He attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, California, graduating in 1966.

===Songwriter for others===
After graduating from high school Browne joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, performing at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California, where they opened for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. Later the band recorded a number of Browne&#x27;s songs, including &quot;These Days&quot;, &quot;Holding&quot;, and &quot;Shadow Dream Song&quot;. He was in his friend Pamela Polland&#x27;s band, Gentle Soul for a short time. 

He left the Dirt Band after a few months and moved to Greenwich Village, New York, where he became a staff writer for Elektra&#x27;s publishing company, Nina Music, before he was eighteen. He reported on musical events in New York City with his friends Greg Copeland and Adam Saylor. For the remainder of 1967 and also 1968 he was in Greenwich Village, where he backed Tim Buckley and singer Nico of the Velvet Underground. In 1967, Browne and Nico were romantically linked; he became a significant contributor to her debut album, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, writing and playing guitar on several of the songs (including &quot;These Days&quot;). In 1968, following his breakup with Nico, Browne returned to Los Angeles, where he formed a folk band with Ned Doheny and Jack Wilce. This is when he first met Glenn Frey.

Browne&#x27;s first songs, such as &quot;Shadow Dream Song&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot;, were recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Tom Rush, Nico, Steve Noonan, Gregg Allman, Joan Baez, the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, the Byrds, Iain Matthews, and others. Browne did not release his own versions of these early songs until years later. Soon &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; mentioned Browne as a &quot;new face to look for&quot; and praised his &quot;mind-boggling melodies&quot;.

===Classic period===

In 1971, Browne signed with his manager David Geffen&#x27;s Asylum Records and released &quot;Jackson Browne&quot; (1972) produced and engineered by Richard Orshoff, which included the piano-driven &quot;Doctor My Eyes&quot;, which entered the Top Ten in the US singles chart. &quot;Rock Me on the Water&quot;, from the same album, also gained considerable radio airplay, while &quot;Jamaica Say You Will&quot; and &quot;Song for Adam&quot; (written about his friend Adam Saylor&#x27;s death) helped establish Browne&#x27;s reputation. Touring to promote the album, he shared the bill with Linda Ronstadt and Joni Mitchell.

His next album, &quot;For Everyman&quot; (1973)—while considered of high quality—was less successful than his debut album, although it still sold a million copies. The upbeat &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, cowritten with Eagles&#x27; Glenn Frey, had already been a major success for that group, while his own recording of &quot;These Days&quot; reflected a sound representing Browne&#x27;s angst.

&quot;Late for the Sky&quot; (1974) consolidated Browne&#x27;s fan base, and the album peaked at No. 14, the 84th-best-selling album of 1974. Browne&#x27;s work began to demonstrate a reputation for memorable melody, insightful, often very personal lyrics, and a talent for his arrangements in composition.
It featured a Magritte-inspired cover. Highlights included the title song, the elegiac &quot;For a Dancer&quot;, &quot;Before the Deluge&quot;, and &quot;Fountain of Sorrow&quot;. The arrangements featured the violin and guitar of David Lindley, Jai Winding&#x27;s piano, and the harmonies of Rosemary Butler and Doug Haywood. The title track was also featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. During this period, Browne began his fractious but lifelong professional relationship with singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, mentoring Zevon&#x27;s first two Asylum albums through the studio as a producer (working closely with Waddy Wachtel and Jorge Calderón).

When touring in 1975, Browne was accompanied by his wife Phyllis and one-year-old son Ethan. Browne also added keyboardist Wayne Cook to the tour. They toured in a converted Greyhound bus. In the autumn of 1975, Browne performed shows with the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Toots and the Maytals.

Browne&#x27;s character was even more apparent in his next album, &quot;The Pretender&quot;. It was released during 1976, after the suicide of his first wife, Phyllis Major, and features production by Jon Landau and a mixture of styles, ranging from the mariachi-inspired &quot;Linda Paloma&quot; to the country-driven &quot;Your Bright Baby Blues&quot; and the downbeat &quot;Sleep&#x27;s Dark and Silent Gate&quot;.

A year after Major&#x27;s untimely death, &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot;—which he co-wrote with Nancy Farnsworth, the mother of his deceased wife—peaked at No. 23 on the Hot 100.

&quot;Running on Empty&quot; (1977), recorded entirely on tour, became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, Browne used only new material and combined live concert performances with recordings made on buses, in hotel rooms, and backstage. &quot;Running on Empty&quot; contains some of his most popular songs, such as the title track, &quot;Rosie&quot;, and &quot;The Load-Out/Stay&quot;, Browne&#x27;s send-off to his concert audiences and tribute to his roadies.

===Activism and music===
In spring of 1978, Browne appeared near a nuclear reprocessing plant in Barnwell, South Carolina, to perform a free concert the night before a civil disobedience action; he did not participate in the action. In June 1978 he performed on the grounds of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant construction site in New Hampshire for 20,000 opponents of the reactor.

Shortly after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, during March 1979, Browne joined with several musician friends to found the antinuclear organization Musicians United for Safe Energy. He was arrested while protesting against the Diablo Canyon Power Plant near San Luis Obispo. His next album, &quot;Hold Out&quot; (1980), was commercially successful and his only number 1 record on the U.S. pop albums chart. The album generated &quot;Boulevard&quot;. In 1982, he released the single &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot; from the &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; soundtrack, which became his biggest hit, peaking at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The 1983 &quot;Lawyers in Love&quot; followed, signaling a discernible change in lyrics from the personal to the political. In 1985, he sang a duet with Clarence Clemons in a song called &quot;You&#x27;re a Friend of Mine&quot;.

Political protest is featured in Browne&#x27;s music in the 1986 album, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;, an explicit condemnation of U.S. policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with many Browne fans, although not with mainstream audiences. The title track, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;, with its Andean pan pipes—and lines like, &quot;There&#x27;s a shadow on the faces / Of the men who fan the flames / Of the wars that are fought in places / Where we can&#x27;t even say the names&quot;—was an outcry against U.S.-backed wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The song was used at several points in the award-winning 1987 PBS documentary, &quot;The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis,&quot; by journalist Bill Moyers, and was part of the soundtrack of &quot;Stone&#x27;s War&quot;, a 1986 &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode focusing on American involvement in Central America.

During the 1980s, Browne performed frequently at benefit concerts for causes he supported, including Farm Aid, Amnesty International (making several appearances on the 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope tour), post-Somoza revolutionary Nicaragua, and the Christic Institute. The album &quot;World in Motion&quot;, released in 1989, contains a cover of Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s &quot;I am a Patriot&quot;, a song which he has performed at numerous concerts.

Browne also performed alongside Roy Orbison in &quot;A Black and White Night&quot; in 1988 along with Bruce Springsteen, k.d. lang, and several others. The special originally aired on Cinemax.

===1990s===

Browne wrote and recorded the song &quot;The Rebel Jesus&quot; with the Chieftains, which appeared on their 1991 Christmas album &quot;The Bells of Dublin&quot;. In 1993, four years after his previous album, Browne returned with &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, a critically acclaimed album with a more personal style that did not have any successful singles but still sold respectably—indeed, the ninth track from the album, &quot;Sky Blue and Black&quot;, was used during the pilot episode of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. In 1994 he collaborated with Kathy Mattea to contribute &quot;Rock Me on the Water&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

The performance was originally broadcast on Turner Network Television, and issued on CD and video in 1996. He sang a duet with Jann Arden, &quot;Unloved&quot;, on her 1995 album &quot;Living Under June&quot;. Browne&#x27;s own album, &quot;Looking East&quot; (1996), was released soon after, but was not as successful commercially.

===2000–present===
Browne released his first album in six years, &quot;The Naked Ride Home&quot; in 2002, with a performance on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, featuring the recording with older familiar songs. During 2003, he guest-starred as himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Brake My Wife, Please&quot;, performing a parody of his song &quot;Rosie&quot; with lyrics altered to reference the plot involving Homer and Marge.

In 2004, Browne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Bruce Springsteen gave the induction speech, commenting to Browne that although the Eagles were inducted first, he said, &quot;You wrote the songs they wished they had written.&quot; Browne had written quite a few hit songs that many artists, including the Eagles, had recorded over the span of his career. The previous year, three of Browne&#x27;s albums—&quot;For Everyman&quot;, &quot;Late for the Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Pretender&quot;—had been selected by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as among its choices for the 500 best albums of all time.

A liberal Democrat, Browne appeared in several rallies for presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, singing &quot;I Am a Patriot&quot; and other songs. He participated in the Vote for Change tour during October 2004, playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org to mobilize people to vote for John Kerry in the presidential election. Browne appeared with Bonnie Raitt and Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, and once with Bruce Springsteen. During late 2006, Browne performed with Michael Stanley and JD Souther at a fundraiser for Democratic candidates in Ohio.

The album consists of live recordings of 11 previously released tracks including &quot;The Birds of St. Marks&quot;, a song written in 1967, that appears on his 2014 album, &quot;Standing in the Breach&quot;. &quot;Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2007 in the category of Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album. A live follow-up album, &quot;Solo Acoustic, Vol. 2&quot;, was released on March 4, 2008.

In addition, the album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.

During August 2008, Browne sued John McCain, the Ohio Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee for using his 1977 hit, &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, in an attack advertisement against Barack Obama without his permission. In July 2009, the matter was settled under an undisclosed financial agreement with an apology from the McCain campaign and other parties.

On May 31, 2008, Browne performed at the Artist for the Arts Foundation benefit at Barnum Hall, Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica. Performing live alongside Heart, Venice (&quot;Crazy on You&quot;) and over 70 members of the Santa Monica High School (SaMoHi) Orchestra and Girls Choir (&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;), the benefit helped to provide funds for the continuation of music education in public schools. Browne again performed there with Heart and other musician guest stars in 2009.

<text>Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev () ( – ) was a Russian mathematician and considered to be the founding father of Russian mathematics.

Chebyshev is known for his fundamental contributions to the fields of probability, statistics, mechanics, and number theory. A number of important mathematical concepts are named after him, including the Chebyshev inequality (which can be used to prove the weak law of large numbers), the Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem, Chebyshev polynomials, Chebyshev linkage, and Chebyshev bias.

==Transcription==


The surname Chebyshev has been transliterated in several different ways, like Tchebichef, Tchebychev, Tchebycheff, Tschebyschev, Tschebyschef, Tschebyscheff, Čebyčev, Čebyšev, Chebysheff, Chebychov, Chebyshov (according to native Russian speakers, this one provides the closest pronunciation in English to the correct pronunciation in old Russian), and Chebychev, a mixture between English and French transliterations considered erroneous. It is one of the most well known data-retrieval nightmares in mathematical literature. Currently, the English transliteration &quot;Chebyshev&quot; has gained widespread acceptance, except by the French, who prefer &quot;Tchebychev.&quot; The correct transliteration according to ISO 9 is &quot;Čebyšëv&quot;. The American Mathematical Society adopted the transcription &quot;Chebyshev&quot; in its Mathematical Reviews.

His first name comes from the Greek Paphnutius (Παφνούτιος), which in turn takes its origin in the Coptic Paphnuty (Ⲡⲁⲫⲛⲟⲩϯ), meaning &quot;that who belongs to God&quot; or simply &quot;the man of God&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
One of nine children, Chebyshev was born in the village of Okatovo in the district of Borovsk, province of Kaluga. His father, Lev Pavlovich, was a Russian nobleman and wealthy landowner. Pafnuty Lvovich was first educated at home by his mother Agrafena Ivanovna Pozniakova (in reading and writing) and by his cousin Avdotya Kvintillianovna Sukhareva (in French and arithmetic). Chebyshev mentioned that his music teacher also played an important role in his education, for she &quot;raised his mind to exactness and analysis&quot;.

Trendelenburg&#x27;s gait affected Chebyshev&#x27;s adolescence and development. From childhood, he limped and walked with a stick and so his parents abandoned the idea of his becoming an officer in the family tradition. His disability prevented his playing many children&#x27;s games and he devoted himself instead to mathematics.

In 1832, the family moved to Moscow, mainly to attend to the education of their eldest sons (Pafnuty and Pavel, who would become lawyers). Education continued at home and his parents engaged teachers of excellent reputation, including (for mathematics and physics) the senior Moscow University teacher , who had taught, among others, the future writer Ivan Turgenev.

=== University studies ===

In summer 1837, Chebyshev passed the registration examinations and, in September of that year, began his mathematical studies at the second philosophical department of Moscow University. His teachers included N.D. Brashman, N.E. Zernov and D.M. Perevoshchikov of whom it seems clear that Brashman had the greatest influence on Chebyshev. Brashman instructed him in practical mechanics and probably showed him the work of French engineer J.V. Poncelet.
In 1841 Chebyshev was awarded the silver medal for his work &quot;calculation of the roots of equations&quot; which he had finished in 1838. In this, Chebyshev derived an approximating algorithm for the solution of algebraic equations of &quot;nth&quot; degree based on Newton&#x27;s method. In the same year, he finished his studies as &quot;most outstanding candidate&quot;.

In 1841, Chebyshev&#x27;s financial situation changed drastically. There was famine in Russia, and his parents were forced to leave Moscow. Although they could no longer support their son, he decided to continue his mathematical studies and prepared for the master examinations, which lasted six months. Chebyshev passed the final examination in October 1843 and, in 1846, defended his master thesis &quot;An Essay on the Elementary Analysis of the Theory of Probability.&quot; His biographer Prudnikov suggests that Chebyshev was directed to this subject after learning of recently published books on probability theory or on the revenue of the Russian insurance industry.

=== Adult years ===
In 1847, Chebyshev promoted his thesis &quot;pro venia legendi&quot; &quot;On integration with the help of logarithms&quot; at St Petersburg University and thus obtained the right to teach there as a lecturer. At that time some of Leonhard Euler&#x27;s works were rediscovered by P. N. Fuss and were being edited by Viktor Bunyakovsky, who encouraged Chebyshev to study them. This would come to influence Chebyshev&#x27;s work. In 1848, he submitted his work &quot;The Theory of Congruences&quot; for a doctorate, which he defended in May 1849. He was elected an extraordinary professor at St Petersburg University in 1850, ordinary professor in 1860 and, after 25 years of lectureship, he became merited professor in 1872. In 1882 he left the university and devoted his life to research.

During his lectureship at the university (1852–1858), Chebyshev also taught practical mechanics at the Alexander Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo (now Pushkin), a southern suburb of St Petersburg.

His scientific achievements were the reason for his election as junior academician (adjunkt) in 1856. Later, he became an extraordinary (1856) and in 1858 an ordinary member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In the same year he became an honorary member of Moscow University. He accepted other honorary appointments and was decorated several times. In 1856, Chebyshev became a member of the scientific committee of the ministry of national education. In 1859, he became an ordinary member of the ordnance department of the academy with the adoption of the headship of the commission for mathematical questions according to ordnance and experiments related to ballistics. The Paris academy elected him corresponding member in 1860 and full foreign member in 1874. In 1893, he was elected honorable member of the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society, which had been founded three years earlier.

Chebyshev died in St Petersburg on 8 December 1894.

== Mathematical contributions ==

Chebyshev is known for his work in the fields of probability, statistics, mechanics, and number theory. The Chebyshev inequality states that if formula_1 is a random variable with standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; &gt; 0, then the probability that the outcome of formula_1 is formula_3 or more away from its mean is at most formula_4:

: formula_5

The Chebyshev inequality is used to prove the weak law of large numbers.

The Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem (1845, 1852) states that for any formula_6, there exists a prime number formula_7 such that formula_8. This is a consequence of the Chebyshev inequalities for the number formula_9 of prime numbers less than formula_10:

: for formula_11 sufficiently large, formula_12

Fifty years later, in 1896, the celebrated prime number theorem was proved, independently, by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin:

: formula_13

using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann.

Chebyshev is also known for the Chebyshev polynomials and the Chebyshev bias – the difference between the number of primes that are congruent to 3 (modulo 4) and 1 (modulo 4).

Chebyshev was the first person to think systematically in terms of random variables and their moments and expectations.

== Legacy ==
Chebyshev is considered to be a founding father of Russian mathematics. Among his well-known students were the mathematicians Dmitry Grave, Aleksandr Korkin, Aleksandr Lyapunov, and Andrei Markov. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Chebyshev has 17,533 mathematical &quot;descendants&quot; as of January 2025.

The lunar crater &quot;Chebyshev&quot; and the asteroid 2010 Chebyshev were named to honor his major achievements in the mathematical realm.

<doc id="149569" wikidata="Q1126287" url="?curid=149569" title="Mott the Hoople">
<text>Mott the Hoople were an English rock band formed in Hereford, Herefordshire in 1969. Originally named the Doc Thomas Group, the band changed their name after signing with Island Records in 1969. The band released albums at the beginning of the 1970s but failed to find any success. On the verge of breaking up, the band were encouraged by David Bowie to stay together. Bowie wrote their glam-style signature song &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; for them, which became their first hit in 1972. Bowie subsequently produced their album of the same name, which added to their success.

Despite membership changes, the band experienced further commercial success with &quot;Mott&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Hoople&quot; (1974). Lead singer Ian Hunter departed the band in 1974, after which the band&#x27;s commercial fortunes began to diminish. They remained together with continuing membership changes until their break-up in 1980. The band have had reunions in 2009, 2013, 2018 and 2019.

==History==
===Pre-Mott===
The Doc Thomas Group were formed in 1966 with Mick Ralphs on guitar, Stan Tippins on vocals, and Pete Overend Watts on bass. Ralphs and Tippins had been in a local Hereford band, the Buddies, and Watts had been in a local Ross-on-Wye band the Soulents with Dale &quot;Buffin&quot; Griffin on drums. The Doc Thomas Group had a concert residency at a nightclub in a resort town in Italy. The group were offered a recording contract with the Italian label Dischi Interrecord, and released an eponymous album in January 1967. By 1968, Griffin and organist Verden Allen had joined the band.

Although the group toured and recorded in Italy as the Doc Thomas Group, their gigs in the UK were played under the names of the Shakedown Sound and, later, Silence. Silence recorded demos at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, which were offered to EMI, Polydor, Immediate and Apple but with no success.

===Early years===
The group came to the attention of Guy Stevens at Island Records, who liked the group but not with Tippins as lead singer. Advertisements were placed (&quot;Singer wanted, must be image-minded and hungry&quot;), and Ian Hunter was selected as lead singer and piano player. Tippins assumed the role of road manager.
While in prison for a drug offence, Stevens read the Willard Manus novel &quot;Mott the Hoople&quot;, about an eccentric who works in a circus freak show, and decided to use it as a band name. Silence reluctantly agreed to change the band&#x27;s name to Mott the Hoople following their audition for Stevens in early 1969. Manus&#x27;s novel&#x27;s title was in turn a reference to &quot;Martha Hoople&quot;, which was the name of character from a comic strip called Our Boarding House, which was widely syndicated in American newspapers from 1921 to 1984.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mott the Hoople&quot; (1969), recorded in only a week, was a cult success. Their repertoire included cover versions of &quot;Laugh at Me&quot; (Sonny Bono) and &quot;At the Crossroads&quot; (Doug Sahm&#x27;s Sir Douglas Quintet), and an instrumental cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; (The Kinks).

The second album, &quot;Mad Shadows&quot; (1970), sold poorly and received generally negative reviews. &quot;Wildlife&quot; (1971) fared even worse, despite gaining the highest UK album chart position of the band&#x27;s pre-Glam years. It featured an overtly country-hippie stance and more acoustic instrumentation on some Ralphs-penned songs. 

On 10 October 1970, Mott the Hoople, the Senator (aka the Walrus), and Bridget St John were showcased on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Disco 2&quot;. Even though the group were building a decent following, &quot;Brain Capers&quot; (1971) failed to sell well. The group decided to split following a depressing concert in a former gas holder in Switzerland. When their UK tour with The Lothringers was aborted, the band were close to breaking up.

===Glam years===
David Bowie had long been a fan of the band. After learning from Watts that they were about to split, he persuaded them to stay together and offered them &quot;Suffragette City&quot; which later appeared on his &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; album. They turned it down. Bowie also penned &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; for them and it became their biggest hit. Released as a single in July 1972, it was a success in the UK, with the band using Tippins – who by this time was their tour manager – to sing backing vocals during concerts. Bowie produced an album, also called &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, which included a Mick Ronson strings and brass arrangement for &quot;Sea Diver&quot;. It sold well, but stalled at No. 21 in the UK Albums Chart. A casualty in the wake of &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; was Verden Allen, who departed before the release of their next album, &quot;Mott&quot;.

&quot;Mott&quot; climbed into the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart, and became the band&#x27;s best-seller to date in the US. It yielded two UK hits, &quot;Honaloochie Boogie&quot; and &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot;, both featuring Andy Mackay of Roxy Music on saxophone. &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot; is also featured in the movie &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;.

In May 1973, following Verden Allen&#x27;s departure, the band were augmented by two keyboard players. Former Love Affair and Morgan member Morgan Fisher joined as keyboardist and Mick Bolton joined on Hammond Organ. Bolton left at the end of 1973 and was replaced on tour by Blue Weaver, while Fisher stayed on to become Allen&#x27;s official replacement in the band. Ralphs left in August 1973 to form Bad Company and was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor. For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul for his stint with the band. According to Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary &quot;Ballad of Mott the Hoople&quot;, the band were in Germany with de Paul for a TV show when Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase &quot;aerial bender&quot; which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name.

At the end of 1973, the band had a chart success in the UK with &quot;Roll Away the Stone&quot; recorded before Mick Ralphs left the band. Ralphs played lead guitar and the Thunderthighs provided female vocal backing and a bridge. It reached No.8 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1974, the album version of &quot;Roll Away the Stone&quot; credited to Mott the Hoople and Lynsey de Paul with the vocal bridge from de Paul and guitar from Ariel Bender was released in Japan, backed with a live version of &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; as the B-side.

In 1974, Mott the Hoople toured America with Ariel Bender playing lead guitar. In one of Bender&#x27;s earliest performances with the band they played the Masonic Temple in Detroit on 12 October 1973 with a young Aerosmith opening the show. They were primarily supported on the 1974 tour by the band Queen. This tour later provided the inspiration for Queen&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Down in the city, just Hoople and me.&quot; The song became a live favourite of Queen fans and reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. The tour resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two bands, with Ian Hunter, Mick Ronson and David Bowie performing &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992. Morgan Fisher went on to play piano on Queen&#x27;s &#x27;Hot Space&#x27; tour in 1982, and Brian May, Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor performed backing vocals on the Ian Hunter solo song, &quot;You Nearly Did Me In&quot;. May would later cover Mott&#x27;s &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot; on his solo album, &quot;Another World&quot;, with Hunter making a guest appearance. Mott the Hoople are name-checked on two other hit singles. Reunion&#x27;s 1974 single &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)&quot; begins with the lyrics &#x27;B Bumble and the Stingers, Mott the Hoople, Ray Charles Singers...&#x27;.; and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; begins with &#x27;Mott the Hoople and the Game of Life, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...&#x27;

In the afterglow of &quot;The Hoople&quot; (1974), a live album &quot;Live&quot; was quickly released, after which Mick Ronson replaced Bender. The end was near when both Hunter and Ronson left the group to form a duo, following which the band abbreviated its name to &#x27;Mott&#x27;.

Hunter&#x27;s book &quot;Diary of a Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Star&quot; about the day-to-day life on the band&#x27;s 1972 winter tour of the US, covering the ups and downs of life on the road, was published in June 1974. It was out of print for many years but was reissued in 1996.

===Post-Hunter years===
The new line-up consisted of Watts, Griffin, and Fisher along with lead guitarist Ray Majors (formerly of Opal Butterfly, Hackensack, and a brief stint with Andy Fraser and Frankie Miller) and front man Nigel Benjamin. This line-up released two more albums, &quot;Drive On&quot; (1975) and &quot;Shouting and Pointing&quot; (1976), both of which sold poorly. After Benjamin quit in 1976 (eventually joining the Los Angeles glam metal band, London, with Nikki Sixx, later of Mötley Crüe), Mott briefly replaced him with Steve Hyams, before joining forces with John Fiddler (formerly of Medicine Head), and became British Lions, recording two albums, &quot;British Lions&quot; (1977) and &quot;Trouble With Women&quot; (posthumously released on Cherry Red Records 1980) before finally splitting up without any chart success. Hunter and Ronson worked and toured together sporadically until Ronson&#x27;s death in 1993. Hunter has continued his solo career.

In 1990, after a brief reunion in 1989, the former members of The Silence reunited in the studio to record a mix of new songs and staples from their days performing together. The resultant album &quot;Shotgun Eyes&quot; was released in 1998, combined with &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (a re-release of the Doc Thomas Group&#x27;s self-titled album).

In 1996, K-tel released a CD called &quot;The Best of Mott the Hoople&quot; purporting to be re-recordings of the band&#x27;s hits and new songs by Hunter and Ronson. In actuality, the recording was by Danny McCulloch, former bass player with Eric Burdon and the New Animals and Gerry Chapman, usually going under the band name of The Trybe. The album consisted of heavy rock versions of Mott&#x27;s hits and original songs, and had nothing at all to do with the original Mott the Hoople. K-tel were subsequently fined for supplying goods with a false description, but the tracks and album continued to circulate under the name Mott the Hoople, often appearing on compilation albums. In 2002, the tracks were released again as &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Mott the Hoople!&quot;, though this time it was credited to The Trybe.

On 16 and 17 April 1999, the first and only &#x27;Mott the Hoople Convention&#x27; was held at the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; Pub in Bilston, Wolverhampton, England. Hunter and his band performed both evenings of the convention. During the encore of the Ian Hunter Band&#x27;s performance of 17 April, Hunter was joined onstage by Bender and Allen for a version of &quot;Walkin&#x27; With A Mountain&quot;; Allen performed on the original studio version of the song, whilst Bender performed an extended solo during performances of the song on Mott the Hoople&#x27;s 1973–74 tours.

In 2002 and 2004, Ralphs toured with Hunter, as part of the latter&#x27;s backing band.

No Mott the Hoople reunion occurred prior to 2009, although negotiations for one were attempted in 1985; all parties have shown some interest at various times in the idea over the last 30 years. In 2005 it was reported in the publication &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, that Hunter had received the offer of a seven-figure number to re-form the band. In October 2007 at Hunter&#x27;s concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, he was joined by Ralphs and Allen for the encore.

===2009 reunion===

On 16 January 2009, it was announced that the band would be re-uniting for two concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, in October 2009. According to Hunter&#x27;s web site, all five of the original members would participate in the reunion. Hunter wrote, &quot;Why are we doing it? I can&#x27;t speak for the others, but I&#x27;m doing it just to see what it&#x27;s like. Short of war, death, famine etc... it&#x27;s ON.&quot; Tickets for the two original dates sold out, and a third date at the same venue was added for 3 October 2009. After that one sold out as well another two dates were added on 5 and 6 October. The special limited 3 CD-set recorded during the first show at Hammersmith Apollo was sold directly after the concerts.

Mott the Hoople also held a warmup gig prior to their five-night stand at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in October. The show was held at the Blake Theatre in Monmouth, Wales, on 26 September 2009. Prior to this it was announced that because of the poor health of Buffin, his place for the concerts would be taken by Martin Chambers, drummer of The Pretenders, though Griffin did appear at encores.

The reunion was favourably reviewed by major British broadsheet newspapers, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; awarding 4/5 stars and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; awarding 5/5.
On 27 November 2009, Mott the Hoople played The Tartan Clefs charity night in Glasgow.

===2013 dates===
Mott the Hoople (featuring Allen, Hunter, Ralphs and Watts with Martin Chambers on drums) played the O2 Arena in London on 18 November 2013, preceded by dates in Birmingham, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester (the latter of which was recorded for a limited edition CD/DVD). One critic described the concert at the O2 Arena as &quot;a bit of a slog&quot; and Hunter&#x27;s voice as &quot;now little more than a guttural rasp&quot;. A recording of 17 November 2013 show at the O2 Apollo Manchester was released in June 2014 as a double album/DVD, &quot;Live 2013.&quot; Several years after the 2013 reunion, Mott the Hoople lost two of its founding members: Dale Griffin died on 17 January 2016 at the age of 67, and Overend Watts died on 22 January 2017 at the age of 69.

===2018 dates===
In February 2018, it was announced that Mott the Hoople would be playing several European dates in the summer of 2018. Ian Hunter would be joined by former bandmates Morgan Fisher on keyboards and Ariel Bender on guitar. In a press release, Hunter said &quot;[Fisher and Bender] toured extensively with Mott and both were featured heavily on &quot;The Hoople&quot; album after Mick Ralphs and Verden Allen left the band... I know many people were disappointed when neither appeared on the 2009 and 2013 get-togethers. Hope this makes up for it!&quot; The line-up would also include James Mastro and Mark Bosch on guitars, Dennis DiBrizzi on keyboards, Paul Page on bass, and Steve Holley on drums. Holley – a member of Wings from 1978 to 1981 – has been a member of Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Rant Band&quot; since 2001.

===2019 dates===
In January 2019, the band announced the &quot;Tax the Heat&quot; tour, a brief six-show UK tour in April 2019, preceded by an eight-date tour of the US as &quot;Mott the Hoople &#x27;74&quot; (which began on 1 April and concluded on 10 April at the Beacon Theatre in New York City). This was the first time in 45 years that Mott the Hoople had toured the US. Indeed, the core &#x27;74 members Ian Hunter, Ariel Bender and Morgan Fisher celebrated the 45th anniversary of their 1974 US tour (hence the name of the bill), as well as the original release of &quot;The Hoople&quot; and &quot;Live&quot;, the final albums of the classic Mott the Hoople era. The band includes Ian Hunter (vocals and guitar), Ariel Bender (guitar) and Morgan Fisher (keyboards) joined by James Mastro (guitar, saxophone, mandolin), Steve Holley (drums, backing vocals), Mark Bosch (guitar), Paul Page (bass) and Dennis Dibrizzi (keyboards, backing vocals).

The band were due to tour the US in October and November 2019, performing 11 shows. The tour dates were cancelled due to Ian Hunter&#x27;s tinnitus.

<doc id="149570" wikidata="Q7532162" url="?curid=149570" title="Situational offender">
<text>In criminology the term situational offender is used in several meanings, their common denominator being nontypical character of the offense in question for the person according to some criteria.

==General criminology==

Following the classical study of Martin R. Haskell and Lewis Yablonsky &quot;Criminology - Crime and Criminality&quot; (1974), a situational offender, as opposed to a career criminal, is a person who committed a crime under certain circumstances, but normally is not inclined to commit crimes and is unlikely to repeat the offense.

==Sex crimes==

In sex crimes, a situational sex offender is one whose offense is associated with situational sexual behavior, i.e., sexual behavior different from the person&#x27;s usual habits. This term is in an opposition to the preferential offender, whose offense is associated with the person&#x27;s preferential behavior. For example, a preferential child molester is exclusively involved with children, whereas the situational ones are normally engaged in sexual behavior within their peer group.

<doc id="149573" wikidata="Q7805491" url="?curid=149573" title="Time unit box system">
<text>Time Unit Box System (TUBS) is a simple system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating rhythms in music. The notation consists of one or more rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.

TUBS is most useful for showing relationships between complex rhythms, such as polyrhythms, that would be difficult to see in traditional musical notation. TUBS also has the advantage that non-musicians can interpret it much more easily than musical notation, because of its simplicity.

The term &quot;TUBS&quot; and the notation was originally used by musicologists Philip Harland and James Koetting to notate polyrhythms in African music in the early 1960s. However, Joseon composer Bak Yeon(박연)&#x27;s invention of similar but unrelated notation &quot;jeongganbo&quot;(정간보, image) to notate Korean court music dates back to middle of the 15th century.

TUBS notation has been adapted by several people; the most common adaptations use different symbols in the boxes to represent different sounds, for example different ways of hitting a drum or even different musical pitches. In fact, tracker notation is essentially TUBS rotated by 90 degrees.

== Examples ==
Below is an example in TUBS, followed by a similar representation in traditional music notation.

=== TUBS ===
=== Traditional ===
&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; {
\new Staff «
 \new Voice = &quot;first&quot;
 { \voiceOne c&#x27;4 c c8 c c4 }
 \new Voice = &quot;second&quot;
 { \voiceTwo r8 f, r f f f16 f f f r8 }
&lt;/score&gt;

Below is an example of an adapted TUBS score depicting a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates which drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time Unit Box relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.

<text>George Bush Intercontinental Airport is an international airport in Houston, Texas, United States, serving the Greater Houston metropolitan area. Initially named Houston Intercontinental Airport upon its opening in 1969, it was renamed in honor of George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States and a resident of Houston, in 1997. It is also commonly called Houston International Airport or George Bush International Airport.

Located about north of Downtown Houston between Interstate 45 and Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 with direct access to the Hardy Toll Road expressway, George Bush Intercontinental Airport has scheduled flights to a large number of domestic and international destinations covering five continents. It is the busiest airport in Texas for international passenger traffic and a number of international destinations, the second-busiest airport in Texas as of 2021 and the 15th busiest in the United States for total passenger traffic as of 2022

IAH covers of land and has five runways. Houston Intercontinental is one of the largest passenger hubs for United Airlines and formerly also served as a hub for defunct Continental Airlines and Texas International Airlines.

==History==
===20th century===

A group of Houston businessmen purchased the site for Bush Intercontinental Airport in 1957 to preserve it until the city of Houston could formulate a plan for a new airport as a replacement for William P. Hobby Airport (at the time known as Houston International Airport). The holding company for the land was named the Jet Era Ranch Corporation, but a typographical error transformed the words &quot;Jet Era&quot; into &quot;Jetero&quot; and the airport site subsequently became known as the Jetero airport site. Although the name Jetero was no longer used in official planning documents after 1961, the airport&#x27;s eastern entrance was named Jetero Boulevard. Most of Jetero Boulevard was later renamed Will Clayton Parkway.

The City of Houston annexed the Intercontinental Airport area in 1965. This annexation, along with the 1965 annexations of the Bayport area, the Fondren Road area, and an area west of Sharpstown, resulted in a gain of of land for the city limits.

Houston Intercontinental Airport, which was the original name for the airport, opened in June 1969. The airport&#x27;s IATA code of IAH derived from the stylization of the airport&#x27;s name as &quot;Intercontinental Airport of Houston.&quot; All scheduled passenger airline service formerly operated from William P. Hobby Airport moved to Intercontinental upon the airport&#x27;s completion. Hobby remained open as a general aviation airport and was once again used for scheduled passenger airline jet service two years later when Southwest Airlines initiated intrastate airline service nonstop between Hobby and Dallas Love Field in 1971.

In the late 1980s, Houston City Council considered a plan to rename the airport after Mickey Leland—an African-American U.S. Congressman who died in an aviation accident in Ethiopia. Instead of renaming the whole airport, the city named Mickey Leland International Arrivals Building, which would later become Mickey Leland Terminal D, after the congressman. In April 1997, Houston City Council unanimously voted to rename the airport George Bush Intercontinental Airport/Houston, after George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States. The name change took effect on May 2, 1997.

On August 28, 1990, Continental Airlines agreed to build its maintenance center at George Bush Intercontinental Airport; Continental agreed to do so because the city of Houston agreed to provide city-owned land near the airport.

At the time of the opening of IAH in 1969, domestic scheduled passenger airline flights were being operated by American Airlines, Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines and Houston-based Texas International Airlines, which had formerly operated as Trans-Texas Airways. International flights at this time were being flown by Pan American World Airways with ten nonstop flights a week operated with Boeing 707 jetliners to Mexico City; KLM Royal Dutch Airlines operating Douglas DC-8 jets four days a week to Amsterdam via an intermediate stop in Montreal; Braniff International with Boeing 727 services several times a week to Panama City, Panama; and Aeronaves de Mexico (now Aeroméxico) flying Douglas DC-9 jets to Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco and Mexico City several days a week. Texas International was also operating direct services to Mexico at this time with Douglas DC-9 jets to Monterrey and Convair 600 turboprop flights to Tampico and Veracruz. 

KLM introduced Boeing 747 services in 1971 and by 1974 Air France was operating four nonstop Boeing 747 flights a week to both Paris and Mexico City. Also in 1974, Continental, Pan Am, and National were operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jetliners into IAH while Delta was flying Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide body jets with both types being operated on respective domestic routes from the airport by these airlines; with National also operating Boeing 747s on a Miami–Houston–Los Angeles routing.

By the late 1970s, Cayman Airways had begun nonstop flights between Grand Cayman in the Caribbean and Intercontinental with BAC One-Eleven jets. Cayman Airways served the airport for many years, operating a variety of aircraft including Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400 and Douglas DC-8 jetliners into IAH in addition to the BAC One-Eleven. In 1977, British Caledonian, commenced nonstop flights between London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport and Houston with Boeing 707 service, and later with DC-10 and Boeing 747-200 service. British Airways continued operating the route, when in December 1987, BA took over B-Cal increasing its frequency on the route to double-daily.

By July 1983, the number of domestic and international air carriers serving Intercontinental had grown substantially. American, Continental, Delta and Eastern had been joined by Piedmont Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TWA, United Airlines, USAir and Western Airlines. Western was operating daily McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jet services nonstop to Salt Lake City at this time, with this flight also offering one-stop services to Anchorage, Alaska. International services were being operated by Air Canada, Aviateca, British Caledonian Airways, Continental Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, SAHSA, South African Airways, TACA, TWA and Viasa in addition to Pan Am, KLM, Air France, Aeroméxico and Cayman Airways. Several commuter and regional airlines were also operating passenger services at this time from IAH including Emerald Air (operating as Pan Am Express), Metro Airlines, Rio Airways and Royale Airlines. Metro Airlines was operating &quot;cross-town&quot; shuttle services with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops with up to seventeen round trip flights a day between IAH and the Clear Lake City STOLport located near the NASA Johnson Space Center and also up to nine round trip flights a day between the airport and Sugar Land Regional Airport as well as other flights to regional destinations in Texas and Louisiana. In addition, at this same time the airport had scheduled helicopter airline services operated by Executive Helicopters with Bell 206L LongRanger helicopters to four Houston-area heliports with up to 36 round trip flights a day.

===21st century===
Since Houston was not an approved gateway for U.S. to London Heathrow flights under the Bermuda II Agreement, Continental Airlines, and British Airways flew their London services to Gatwick Airport. British Airways, keen to allow its passengers access to connections at its larger Heathrow Airport hub, subsequently flew various routings from Houston to Heathrow, via a gateway approved technical stop, allowing its Houston originating flights to land at Heathrow. While keeping a daily Houston–Gatwick flight, British Airways operated a flight from Houston to Heathrow via Washington-Dulles, with the technical stop being later changed to Chicago-O&#x27;Hare and finally to Detroit. In March 2008, the Bermuda II agreement was replaced with the EU–US Open Skies Agreement, allowing Continental Airlines and British Airways to switch its London services from Houston to Heathrow Airport that summer. Gate BA presently operates double-daily flights to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport with Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 service.

As of 2007, Terminals A and B remain from the airport&#x27;s original design. Lewis W. Cutrer Terminal C opened in 1981, the Mickey Leland International Arrivals Building (now called Terminal D) opened in May 1990, and the new Terminal E partially opened on June 3, 2003. The rest of Terminal E opened on January 7, 2004. Terminal D is the arrival point for all international flights except for United flights, which use Terminal E. Flights from Canada on Air Canada and WestJet arrive in terminal A. Terminal D also held customs and INS until the opening of the new Federal Inspection Service (FIS) building, completed on January 25, 2005.

On January 7, 2009, a Continental Airlines Boeing 737-800 departing Bush Intercontinental was the first U.S. commercial jet to fly on a mix of conventional jet fuel and biofuel.

In December 2009, the Houston City Council approved a plan to allow Midway Cos. to develop of land owned by Houston Airport System (HAS) on the grounds of Bush Airport. Midway planned to develop a travel center for the airport&#x27;s rental car facility. The city dictated the developer needed to place a convenience store and gas station facility, a flight information board, a fast casual restaurant, and a sit-down restaurant in the development. Beyond the required buildings, the developer planned to add an office facility of between and additional retail space.

In 2011, United Airlines began Boeing 777-200ER services to Lagos, Nigeria; this was the airport&#x27;s first nonstop flight to the African continent. In May 2016, United ended the Houston–Lagos service citing the inability to repatriate revenue sold locally in Nigerian currency. South African Airways previously operated nonstop Boeing 747SP services in 1983 between Houston and Amilcar Cabral International Airport in the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa as a refueling stop for its flights between Houston and Johannesburg, South Africa. Continental was also planning to commence nonstop Boeing 787 services to Auckland in New Zealand but these plans were canceled as a reaction to new international flights at Hobby Airport announced by Southwest Airlines. United — which acquired Continental and had fully integrated it into the United brand by early 2012 — had postponed the introduction of this service owing to delays associated with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Its 787s were put to use on other international routes, however, including Houston–London and United&#x27;s then-new Houston–Lagos nonstop flights. The Houston–Auckland nonstop route was then begun by Air New Zealand using a Boeing 777-200ER. In 2014, United added a second daily flight to Tokyo and new routes to Munich, Germany; Santiago, Chile; and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and it restarted the Aruba route, which had been canceled in 2012.

In August 2012, Lufthansa switched its daily Houston–Frankfurt route to an Airbus A380 from a Boeing 747-400, making Houston the first airport in Texas to receive A380 service. In addition, Lufthansa has also operated the Boeing 747-8 on the route. Dubai-based carrier Emirates has also operated the A380 on the Dubai-Houston route.

IAH became the first airport in North America to have nonstop flights to every inhabited continent in 2017, with the addition of Air New Zealand, but lost this claim when Atlas Air ended its nonstop flight to Luanda. The airport regained this status in December 2019 when Ethiopian Airlines launched service to Lomé in Togo and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.

On September 7, 2017, United announced the launch of flights from Houston to Sydney, using a 787-9. The Houston–Sydney service, at , is currently United&#x27;s longest nonstop route. Additionally, it surpassed Emirates&#x27; Dubai route as the longest flight at IAH.

In January 2019, Ethiopian Airlines became the latest international carrier to announce new service, three-times weekly, to Addis Ababa. The route will be Addis Ababa–Lome–Houston, and the airline is replacing its Los Angeles gateway for Houston. The route will be serviced using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and will be the city&#x27;s only gateway to Africa after service to Lagos, Nigeria, was canceled by United Airlines. Service was supposed to begin in June 2019, but was delayed until December 2019. Service began on December 16, 2019. Ethiopian Airlines has since discontinued the route.

In October 2020, Southwest Airlines announced it would return to Bush airport for the first time since it stopped serving the airport in 2005. Service began in April 2021 with five nonstop destinations, augmenting the several dozen destinations it serves from Hobby airport. In 2024, however, Southwest suspended the service to Bush airport once again.

On July 20, 2022, Spirit Airlines crew base plans were cleared. It was also announced that Spirit will bring 500 new jobs to the Houston Area. They added Bush airport as their tenth crew base and Focus city.

In 2020, George Bush Intercontinental Airport began undergoing a $1.3 billion capital improvement program called the IAH Terminal Redevelopment Program (ITRP). The flagship project of this program is the construction of the Mickey Leland International Terminal (MLIT), which will consolidate what is today Terminal D and Terminal E into one centralized terminal including a shared ticketing, departure, and arrival hall. Terminal D will be extensively refurbished with a new concourse, Pier D West, being constructed. The ITRP should be complete by late 2024 or early 2025. Future expansion plans call for a Central D and East D pier to be built as passenger numbers grow, with the full project being capable of handling 33 million enplaned international passengers annually.

===Ground transportation===
From Downtown Houston one can travel to George Bush Intercontinental by taking Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59 (Eastex Freeway) to Beltway 8 or to Will Clayton Parkway, and access the airport from either road. From Downtown one could also take Interstate 45 (North Freeway), connect to Beltway 8, and enter the airport from the Beltway. The Hardy Toll Road has an exit from the north or south to the airport.

The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, or METRO, offers bus services available at the south side of Terminal C. The 102 Bush IAH Express serves the airport. Previously, METRO also operated an express bus service known as Airport Direct, launched in the summer of 2008, which traveled from Downtown Houston to Terminal C via the HOV lane of the Eastex Freeway (I-69)/(US 59). In 2010, in an effort to increase ridership and maximize revenue, METRO reduced the fare of Airport Direct and closed a dedicated passenger plaza for the service in Downtown Houston; instead, the bus stopped at several downtown hotels. The fare each way was reduced from $15 to $4.50. The fare change increased ridership levels but reduced cash flow. METRO consistently provided the service at an operational loss. However, in the summer of 2011, METRO announced it was discontinuing the Airport Direct service, while the Route 102 local service (which serves the greater Greenspoint business and residential district before traveling on I-45 to access downtown) continued to operate.

As of 2016 the Taiwanese airline EVA Air operates a shuttle bus service from Bush IAH to Richardson in the Dallas-Fort Worth area so DFW based customers may fly on its services to and from Houston. Previously China Airlines, also a Taiwanese carrier, provided a shuttle bus service to Sugar Land and the Southwest Houston Chinatown. It ended in 2008 when China Airlines ended its Houston passenger service.

Carriers provide scheduled bus and shuttle services to locations from IAH to NRG Park/NRG Astrodome, Downtown Houston, Uptown, Greenway Plaza, the Texas Medical Center, hotels in the Westchase and Energy Corridor business districts, the city of College Station and William P. Hobby Airport. Super Shuttle uses shared vans to provide services from George Bush Intercontinental Airport to the surrounding communities.

===Artwork===

Ed Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Light Wings&quot;, a multicolored glass sculpture suspended below a skylight, adorns the Terminal A North Concourse. In Terminal A, South Concourse stands Terry Allen&#x27;s &quot;Countree Music.&quot; Allen&#x27;s piece is a cast bronze tree that plays instrumental music by Joe Ely and David Byrne, though the music is normally turned off. The corridor leading to Terminal A displays Leamon Green&#x27;s &quot;Passing Through,&quot; a etched glass wall depicting airport travelers.

The elevators in Terminal B are cased in stainless steel accordion shaped structures designed by Rachel Hecker. The corridor leading to Terminal B has Dixie Friend Gay&#x27;s &quot;Houston Bayou.&quot; This work is composed of an Byzantine glass mosaic mural depicting scenes from Houston&#x27;s bayous and wetlands, several bronze animals embedded in the floor, and five mosaic columns.

&quot;Lights Spikes,&quot; designed by Jay Baker, was created for the 1990 G7 Summit when it was hosted by President George H. W. Bush in Houston. The sculpture was relocated to the airport outside E Terminal after the meetings, from its original location in front of the George R. Brown Convention Center. The columns lean at a ten-degree angle toward a central point that represents Houston. The distance between each &quot;spike&quot; and this point is relative to the distance between Houston and the capitals of the countries the flags represent. The countries represented are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany, as well as the European community. The airport has a display of lighted modern sculptures between terminals C and D.

&quot;Radiant Fountains&quot;, LED-illuminated towers on JFK Boulevard, is the most prominent sculpture around the airport.

===Other facilities===
The airport houses an on-site hotel, a Marriott, between Terminals B and C and is accessible via the landside inter-terminal train which runs every 3 minutes from 3:30 am to 12:30 am every day. The hotel has 573 rooms, one restaurant and bar, a concierge lounge, a coffee shop, health club, sundry shop and a conference center.

A VOR station, identified as IAH, is located on the airport property, south of runway 33L.

<text>Earl Louis &quot;Curly&quot; Lambeau ( ; April 9, 1898 – June 1, 1965) was an American professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). Lambeau, along with his friend and fellow Green Bay, Wisconsin, native George Whitney Calhoun, founded the Green Bay Packers in 1919. He served as team captain in the team&#x27;s first year before becoming player-coach in 1920. As a player, Lambeau lined up as a halfback, which in the early years of the NFL was the premier position. He was the team&#x27;s primary runner and passer, accounting for 35 touchdowns (eight as a rusher, three as a receiver, and 24 as a passer) in 77 games. He won his only NFL championship as a player in 1929.

From 1920 to 1949, Lambeau was the head coach and general manager of the Packers, with near-total control over the team&#x27;s day-to-day operations. He led his team to over 200 wins and six NFL championships, including three straight from 1929 to 1931. He is tied with rival George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots for the most NFL championships by a coach. Lambeau also coached eight players who went on to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. With players such as quarterback Arnie Herber and split end Don Hutson, his teams revolutionized the use of the passing game in football. After a falling-out with the Packers&#x27; board of directors, Lambeau left the Packers to coach the Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins, each for two seasons, before retiring in 1953.

For his accomplishments, Lambeau has been widely recognized and honored. He was named to the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team as one of the top halfbacks in the league&#x27;s first decade of existence. He was an inaugural inductee to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 and the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1970 in recognition for his role as founder, player, and coach of the Packers. Two months after his death in 1965, the Packers home stadium, which is still in use today, was renamed Lambeau Field in his honor.

==Early life and college==
Curly Lambeau was born April 9, 1898, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Marcelin Lambeau and Mary LaTour, both of Belgian descent. Lambeau attended Green Bay East High School, where he was identified as a standout athlete. He played for the football team all four years of high school and was named captain in 1917 as a senior. &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; sportswriter George Whitney Calhoun noted in September 1917 that Lambeau was trying out for the University of Wisconsin freshmen football team as &quot;one of the best gridiron prospects that has ever been turned out of a high school&quot;. However, Lambeau never ended up enrolling at Wisconsin.

After graduating from high school, he worked for his father in the construction business and participated in different local football teams. In 1918, Lambeau attended the University of Notre Dame and played for legendary college coach Knute Rockne, making the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team&#x27;s varsity squad. However a severe case of tonsillitis forced him to miss the 1919 spring semester. He never returned to Notre Dame. After a long recovery from tonsillitis, Lambeau went to work as a shipping clerk at the Indian Packing Company for $250 a month.

==Professional career==
===Founding the Green Bay Packers===

Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun founded the Green Bay Packers on August 11, 1919, after the packing company put up $500 for uniforms. That fall, the founders secured Willard &quot;Big Bill&quot; Ryan, former coach of Green Bay West High School, to coach the team. The team&#x27;s name reportedly was offered to Curly by his girlfriend Agnes Aylward after a pickup game; Curly had wanted to call the team &quot;The Green Bay Indians&quot; to respect Indian Packing&#x27;s purchase of uniforms for the team; so Agnes simply blurted, &quot;Well, for heaven&#x27;s sake, Curly, why don&#x27;t you just call them the Green Bay Packers!&quot; The team&#x27;s naming rights were sold to the Acme Packing Company, and the team remained Packers.

The Packers initially played teams from Wisconsin and Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. However, the success of the team in 1919 and 1920 quickly led to its joining of the American Professional Football Association (now called the National Football League) in 1921. During that season the team was owned by the Acme Packing Company and John and Emmet Clair of Chicago.

===Playing career===
Lambeau was a player-captain at first. He played for the Packers for ten seasons, including the first eight seasons after the team joined the National Football League NFL in 1921. Playing halfback in the then-popular single wing offensive formation, he was both the primary runner and passer. Lambeau threw 24 touchdown passes, rushed for eight touchdowns, and caught three touchdowns in 77 games. Lambeau was the first Packer to throw a pass, throw a touchdown pass, and make a field goal in Green Bay Packer franchise history. He was also occasionally the team&#x27;s kicker, kicking six field goals and 20 extra points. He won his only NFL championship as a player-coach in 1929, retiring as a player after the season.

===Coaching career===
Lambeau coached three NFL teams over his 33-year career: the Green Bay Packers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Washington Redskins. He completed his coaching career with an official overall record of 229–134–22 ().

====Green Bay Packers====

Ryan left the Packers after only one season, and Lambeau became player-coach. However, during the team&#x27;s first season, Lambeau, as team captain, handled many of the duties associated with a head coach in modern times. In the early days of pro football, the head coach was not allowed to talk to the players during the game. Thus, Lambeau was the team&#x27;s on-field leader during games, including play calling. He was also responsible for signing players and running practices. For these reasons, the Packers recognize Lambeau as the team&#x27;s first head coach.

In 1921, he led the team into the one-year-old American Professional Football Association, which became the NFL in 1922. After retiring as a player in 1929, he remained as head coach and general manager until 1949. For the better part of that time, he had near-complete control over the team&#x27;s day-to-day operations and represented the Packers at owners&#x27; meetings.

Before joining the NFL, the Packers achieved an overall 19–2–1 record in 1919 and 1920. Under Lambeau in the NFL, the Packers won six championships (1929, 1930, 1931, 1936, 1939, 1944). He compiled an NFL regular-season record of 209–104–21 () with a playoff record of 3–2, 212–106–21 () overall. Lambeau is still far and away the winningest coach in Packers history. His 104 losses are also the most by a Packers head coach.

The Packers&#x27; most successful period came in the 1930s, thanks to the additions of quarterback Arnie Herber and receiver Don Hutson. Herber and Hutson pioneered the passing game, which allowed the Packers to dominate their competitors throughout the 1930s.

In 1946, Lambeau purchased Rockwood Lodge, a former Norbertine retreat, creating the first self-contained training facility in professional football. The purchase was controversial among the Packers&#x27; board of directors, many of whom balked at the $32,000 purchase price and $8,000 Lambeau spent on renovations, and some members of the financial committee almost resigned in protest.

Lambeau&#x27;s players also grew to hate the facility, partly because they were severely battered by the brick-hard limestone under the fields. On some days, Lambeau had to move practices to fields near City Stadium due to the severe beating his players took at the Lodge.

At the same time, the Packers began noticeably slipping on the field after Hutson&#x27;s retirement in 1945. Still, the Packers remained competitive until 1948, when they suffered their first losing season since 1933, and only the second losing season in franchise history. The bottom fell out in 1949, when the Packers won only two games, at the time, their worst season ever. This was at least in part due to Lambeau&#x27;s refusal to abandon the Notre Dame Box that he had learned during his brief time in South Bend; the Packers continued to run this variation of the single wing long after most teams began running the T formation.

The Packers were also suffering financially, mainly due to the Rockwood Lodge purchase. Early in the 1949 season, Lambeau largely turned over control of the team to his assistants to devote his attention to the team&#x27;s financial situation, but even reducing the payroll and his own salary were not enough to stanch the bleeding: by the end of the season, the Packers were on what seemed to be an irreversible slide toward bankruptcy. Desperate for cash, Lambeau found investors willing to invest funds into the team on the condition that it abolished its then-unique public ownership structure. This proposal was considered rank heresy in Green Bay, and led to rumors that the NFL was using the pending merger with the All-America Football Conference as leverage to force Lambeau to relocate the Packers to the West Coast or shut down the team.

In response to these events, team officials offered him a revised contract that stripped him of nearly all control over non-football matters. Lambeau rejected this offer almost out of hand, effectively ending his 31-year tenure at the helm of the team he founded; however, he did not formally resign until February 1, 1950, seven days after his beloved Rockwood Lodge burned down in a fire that was presumed to be intentional, but had been caused by faulty electrical wiring. The insurance money relieved the Packers&#x27; financial woes at one stroke, and ensured they would stay in Green Bay.

====Chicago Cardinals====
After resigning from the Packers, Lambeau filled the open head coach position of the Chicago Cardinals. In addition to the position of head coach, Lambeau also was named vice president and was given complete control of personnel choices–effectively giving him the same control over football matters that he&#x27;d had in Green Bay. He traded Paul Christman, part of the &quot;Million Dollar Backfield&quot; that had won the 1947 title to the Green Bay Packers in favor of trying to push Jim Hardy for a greater passing attack. He proceeded to throw eight interceptions in his first game versus Philadelphia, a record. In 1950 season, the Cardinals ended the season 5–7, failing to improve upon its record in the previous season and missing out on the postseason. The 1951 season went even worse for Lambeau and the Cardinals; the team ended the season 3–9 and again failed to reach the postseason. He resigned after the tenth game while stating that “No man can do a satisfactory job if he constantly is harassed by front office second-guessing&quot;, while the Cardinals management publicly accused Lambeau of losing the trust of his coaches and players.

====Washington Redskins====
Lambeau coached the Washington Redskins in 1952 and 1953. In August 1954, Lambeau got into a heated argument with Redskins owner George Preston Marshall in the lobby of Sacramento&#x27;s Senator Hotel, after which Marshall abruptly fired Lambeau.

== Personal life ==
Lambeau was married three times: first to Marguerite Van Kessel from 1919 to 1934, ending in divorce with one son. His second wife, Susan Johnson, was a former Miss California, and they were married from 1935 to 1940. He married Grace Garland in 1945 and was divorced in 1955. While a player-coach for the Packers, Lambeau also coached his alma mater Green Bay East High School&#x27;s football team from 1919 to 1921, compiling a 14–4–3 record.

Lambeau died on June 1, 1965, at age 67, in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, from a heart attack. While waiting for his girlfriend, Mary Jane Van Duyse, to get ready for a date, he stepped out of his new red Cadillac convertible and helped her father cut the grass and then collapsed. Mary Jane was the Green Bay Packers champion majorette, and was a Packer Golden Girl.

== Legacy ==

Curly Lambeau was pivotal in establishing professional football in Green Bay. With help from co-founder George Whitney Calhoun and The Hungry Five, Lambeau helped keep the NFL in Green Bay and prevented the Packers from going bankrupt on multiple occasions. Lambeau&#x27;s impact on the Packers led to the team naming their current home stadium after him, Lambeau Field. The venue opened in 1957 as the second City Stadium and was informally called &quot;New&quot; City Stadium for its first eight years. Just two months after his death, the stadium was renamed Lambeau Field prior to the 1965 Green Bay Packers season to honor his contributions as founder, player, and coach.

Lambeau Field has become such an iconic facility that the Green Bay Packers and surrounding community have continued to remodel the stadium, instead of building a new one. This has made Lambeau Field the oldest continually operating NFL stadium. The name &quot;Lambeau&quot; is so strongly tied to the stadium, that the Packers have not sold naming rights to the stadium, instead choosing to sell naming rights to the various entrance gates. During the 2003 renovation, the Packers erected a statue of Lambeau in front of the new Atrium entrance. Lambeau Street, in Green Bay&#x27;s Packerland Industrial Park, is also named in his honor.

As a player and coach, Lambeau is credited with pioneering daily practices, the forward pass in the NFL, implementing pass patterns, and having teams fly to road games. He was a second-team All-Pro for three seasons (1922–1924) and was named to the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. He also led the Packers to over 200 wins, won six NFL Championships, and coached seven future Pro Football Hall of Fame players on the Packers (not including himself). He became the first coach to lead an NFL team to three consecutive NFL Championships (1929–31), a feat that has only been matched once by Packers coach Vince Lombardi (1965–67). For his contributions to football and athletics, Lambeau has been honored by multiple organizations. In 1961 he was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame. He was part of the inaugural class of Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963, and the inaugural class of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>Lambeau Field () is an outdoor athletic stadium in the north central United States, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The home field of the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL), it opened in 1957 as City Stadium, replacing the original City Stadium at Green Bay East High School as the Packers&#x27; home field. Informally known as New City Stadium for its first eight seasons, it was renamed in August 1965 in memory of Packers founder, player, and long-time head coach, Earl “Curly” Lambeau, who had died two months earlier.

With a seating capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the second-largest stadium in the NFL. It is now the largest venue in the State of Wisconsin, edging out Camp Randall Stadium (75,822) at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The playing field at the stadium has a conventional north–south alignment, at an elevation of above sea level.

Lambeau Field is the oldest continually operating NFL stadium. In 2007, the Packers completed their 51st season at Lambeau, breaking the all-time NFL record set by the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field (1921–70). While Soldier Field in Chicago is older, the Bears did not play their home games there until 1971 and the team did not play there during stadium renovations in 2002. Only the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field have longer active home-field tenures in American professional sports.

The stadium&#x27;s street address has been 1265 Lombardi Avenue since August 1968, when Highland Avenue was renamed in honor of former head coach Vince Lombardi, namesake of the Super Bowl championship trophy. Lambeau sits on a block east of Titletown District, a mixed-use development with a Destination Kohler luxury hotel, restaurants, a brewery, apartments, offices, and other entertainment.

==History==
===Packers seek a modern facility===
Since 1925, the Packers had played at 25,000-seat City Stadium, located behind Green Bay East High School. However, by the 1950s, it was considered inadequate for the times. It was built almost entirely of wood, and East High&#x27;s locker room facilities were considered inadequate even in the 1920s; visiting teams often dressed before the game at the Hotel Northland, where the Packers&#x27; opponents stayed at the time. The stadium could not be expanded. East High&#x27;s location ruled out any expansion to the south, and it could not be expanded to the north or east due to its location along the East River.

Officials in Milwaukee, to the south, where the Packers had played a part of their schedule since 1933, knew that City Stadium was less than ideal as an NFL venue. They built Milwaukee County Stadium in 1953 in hopes of luring the Packers there full-time. As originally built, County Stadium was double the size of City Stadium.

Soon after County Stadium opened, the other NFL owners threatened to force the Packers to move to Milwaukee unless they built a new stadium. In August 1955, the Packers announced plans for a new stadium in Green Bay, with a seating capacity of 32,000. In April 1956, Green Bay voters responded by approving (70.3%) a bond issue to finance the new stadium. The original cost in 1957 was $960,000 (paid off in 1978), and its seating capacity was 32,500.

The new stadium was the first modern stadium built specifically for an NFL franchise. At the time, the eleven other NFL teams were playing either in facilities shared with major league baseball teams or in other pre-existing shared facilities. The site, now bordered on three sides by the village of Ashwaubenon, was selected because it had a natural slope, ideal for creating the bowl shape, along with expansive parking. The nearby outdoor practice fields (Clarke Hinkle Field and Ray Nitschke Field) and Don Hutson Center are in Ashwaubenon, as was the Packers Hall of Fame until 2003. The land had once been farmland belonging to Jacques Vieau.

The new stadium, originally known as &quot;(New) City Stadium&quot;, was officially opened in week one of the 1957 season on September 29, as the Packers upset the rival Bears 21–17 in front of a capacity crowd of 32,132. In a ceremony at halftime, the stadium was dedicated by Vice President Richard Nixon. Also in attendance on the platform were reigning Miss America Marilyn Van Derbur, NFL commissioner Bert Bell, and Bears&#x27; owner George Halas, on a brief leave from coaching.

Although they now have a modern facility in Green Bay, the Packers continued to play two or three regular-season games in Milwaukee at County Stadium. Starting in 1995, expansions to Lambeau Field (see below) made it financially realistic for the Packers to play their entire regular season in Green Bay for the first time in over 60 years. Former Milwaukee ticket holders receive tickets to a preseason game and games 2 and 5 of the regular season home schedule, in what is referred to as the &quot;Gold package&quot;. Green Bay season ticket holders receive tickets to the remaining home games as part of their &quot;Green package&quot;.

===Expansion, 1961–95===
Demand for tickets at the new stadium easily outstripped supply, not coincidentally after the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959. In 1961, four years after it opened, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was increased to 38,669.

Since then, the Packers have been regularly increasing the seating capacity. The bowl was increased to 42,327 in 1963, to about 50,837 in 1965 with the enclosure of the south end zone, and to 56,263 in 1970, when the north end zone was enclosed to form a continuous oval bowl. In the early 1980s, the team considered placing a dome on the stadium.

Construction of 72 private boxes in 1985 increased the seating capacity to 56,926, and a 1990 addition of 36 additional boxes and 1,920 theatre-style club seats brought the number to 59,543. In 1995, a $4.7 million project put 90 more private boxes in the previously open north end zone, again giving the stadium the feel of a complete bowl and increasing capacity to 60,890.

===Renovation, 2001–03===
By the end of 1999, the Packers believed that they needed to update the facility to remain financially competitive in the NFL. Rather than build a new stadium, Chairman/CEO Bob Harlan and President/COO John Jones unveiled a $295 million plan to renovate Lambeau Field in January 2000. It was to be paid for partly by the team via the 1997–98 stock sale, which netted more than $20 million. Most of the proceeds were to be paid through a 0.5% sales tax in Brown County and personal seat license fees on season ticket holders. After their plan won approval by the Wisconsin State Legislature, it was ratified by Brown County voters on September 12, 2000, by a 53%–47% margin. Construction began early in 2001. The sales tax expired on September 30, 2015.

The massive redevelopment plan was designed to update the facilities, add more premium and suite seating, yet preserve the seating bowl, keeping the storied natural grass playing field of the &quot;frozen tundra&quot;. The project was completed in time for the 2003 season, bringing the capacity to 72,515. Construction management was conducted by Turner Construction Sports, and proved to be of remarkably little disruption to the 2001 and 2002 seasons.

Although the capacity has more than doubled since Lambeau Field was opened, demand for tickets remains high. The Packers have sold out every game since 1960, and at least 150,000 names are on the waiting list. Between 40 and 500 names come off the list each year.

Because of the sell-out streak, the Packers have not had a home game blacked out since a 1983 Wild Card Playoff game against the Cardinals.

During the season, Lambeau Field was voted the number one NFL stadium in game-day atmosphere and fan experience by a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; online poll.

In 2009, The Sports Turf Managers Association named Lambeau Field the 2009 Field of the Year.

===South end zone expansion, 2012–13===
In 2010, plans were announced by the Green Bay Packers to install new high definition scoreboards in place of their current scoreboards; plans for a new sound system were announced as well. Later, the plans were expanded to include adding as many as 7,500 seats both inside and outside as well as viewing platforms and lounge areas. On May 5, 2011, the Packers sent out an online survey to 30,000 season-ticket holders, club-seat holders and individuals on the season-ticket waiting list to get feedback from the fans on several concepts being considered for the south end-zone development. On August 25, 2011, plans were officially announced to add 7,500 new seats to the south end zone. The new seats are outdoors with the exception of one indoor row. The seats include heated areas that melt snow as it falls (a concept tested on a small scale during winter 2010), intending to solve the logistical problem of shoveling snow from an &quot;upper deck&quot; seating area. The snow that falls into the original bowl area is shoveled by compensated volunteers from the community using a system of temporary chutes placed in the aisles and carts to remove the snow from the stadium.

The new sound system was completed in time for the 2011 season. On August 25, 2011, Packers president Mark Murphy announced that the expansion of Lambeau would not be paid for by taxpayers but by the team itself. After construction was completed on the south end zone seating in the summer of 2013, Lambeau became the third-largest stadium in the NFL, with a capacity of 80,750. Additional construction included two new tower gates for the north and south end zone. Lambeau Field also installed Mitsubishi Diamond Vision Video Boards, as well as a rooftop viewing terrace in the north end zone for club seat holders during games. The rooftop viewing terrace and video boards were completed in time for the 2012 season.

On December 12, 2012, Lambeau Field was damaged by a minor fire when construction workers were cutting a metal beam near the fourth floor. The sparks from the cutting landed inside a wall and ignited the foam insulation. The area was temporarily evacuated and a minor back injury to one of the responding firefighters was reported. Green Bay Fire Lt. Nick Craig says the fire was small but in an unwieldy area. He says fire officials had to proceed slowly because they didn&#x27;t want to open the wall and allow the flames an oxygen supply until they had enough water on hand. The fire damage cost $5,000 in repairs.

===Atrium Renovation, 2013–15===
In 2013, the Packers announced a new $140.5 million renovation project for the Lambeau Atrium entrance, entirely paid by the Packers without public funding. The project began in March 2013 and was completed in June 2015.

The Packers removed ground between Bob Harlan Plaza and Lombardi Avenue, which is now the basement of the atrium. The Pro Shop has been moved to the new ground level, and a set of escalators were installed on the western side, leading to the atrium and the entrance of the Miller Gate. The Packers Hall of Fame moved to the second floor of the atrium where Curly&#x27;s Pub was originally located. Curly&#x27;s moved to the main floor where the Pro Shop was previously held and was renamed 1919 Kitchen &amp; Tap. This renovation project was referred to as &quot;Phase II&quot;, with the first phase considered as the 7,500 seats that were installed previously. The new setup was made to be easier for fans as it was difficult for fans in the past.

Phase II also included the following:

*The Oneida Nation gate was given an expanded plaza extending into the east parking lot. A tunnel under the plaza leads to a player parking area immediately east of the player facilities. Permanent restrooms were installed under the plaza.
*A new entrance called the American Family Insurance gate was added at parking lot level on the east side, with an escalator providing access to the main floor of the atrium. The Pro Shop is also accessible here.
*Harlan Plaza in front of the Miller Gate facing Lombardi Avenue will remain, but its front now lines up with the North face of the atrium tower where the Pro Shop is situated. The Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi statues were repositioned and remain in the plaza.
*New player facilities in the lower level of the stadium, including strength and conditioning rooms and a 35-by-50-yard practice walk-through area.

At the time of the proposed renovation, the project was expected to create approximately 1,500 jobs and pay more than $60 million in wages. Team president and CEO Mark Murphy also committed at the time that 95% of spending on the project would be done in Wisconsin and 69% in northeastern Wisconsin.

A 50-foot-tall replica Lombardi Trophy was unveiled on November 14, 2014, on the east side of the stadium.

The stadium&#x27;s floodlighting system was upgraded to a new instant on-off LED system in May 2018, with the stadium&#x27;s LCD play clocks and east/west scoreboards also being converted to LED-lighted systems. In the last game of the 2019 preseason, the Packers added a flashing stadium light celebration for each Packers touchdown as part of the upgrade, to some traditionalist fan criticism (a foghorn addition earlier in the preseason had been criticized for its resemblance to the Vikings&#x27; &quot;Gjallarhorn&quot;, and was removed for the other preseason home game); it was retained for regular season games.

===Lambeau Field Atrium===
The Lambeau Field Atrium houses the Green Bay Packers Pro Shop, the Packers Hall of Fame, Lambeau Field Stadium Tours, and the 1919 Kitchen &amp; Tap. It also hosts special events, such as meetings, weddings, receptions, and social gatherings.

===Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame===

The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame is on the first level of the Atrium. The Hall of Fame is an independent, charitable association that promotes the history of the Green Bay Packers. Since 1970, 170 Packers have been inducted into the Hall, which attracts over 170,000 visitors annually.

===Titletown District===

On August 20, 2015, the Green Bay Packers presented the master plan for the Titletown District, an area that will be constructed on approximately of land just west of Lambeau Field. Titletown will consist of three tenants including Lodge Kohler, a hotel built and managed by the Kohler Company; a Bellin Health Sports Medicine Clinic; and Hinterland Restaurant and Brewery. Development on the remaining calls for commercial, retail, and residential elements. The Titletown District was opened in the Summer of 2017.

===Packers home record at Lambeau===

As of the end of the 2024 season, the Packers have compiled a 264–133–6 regular-season mark at Lambeau Field. The Packers playoff record at home as of the 2024 season is 18–7.

The Denver Broncos (0–5) are the only NFL team that has never won a regular-season game at Lambeau Field as of 2024. No team has an undefeated record at Lambeau Field. The last remaining team with an undefeated record, the Houston Texans, were beaten by the Packers in Week 13 of the 2016 NFL season. In 2025 Caleb Williams became the first Chicago Bears rookie Quarterback to win at Lambeau Field.

==Name and nickname==
===New City Stadium===

The original name of Lambeau Field lasted through the 1964 season. Officially &quot;City Stadium&quot;, the name &quot;New City Stadium&quot; was used informally to distinguish it from its predecessor at East High School.

===Lambeau Field===
Two months after the death of Packers founder Curly Lambeau, New City Stadium was renamed &quot;Lambeau Field&quot; by the Green Bay city council on August 3, 1965.

Besides founding the team in 1919, Lambeau played for the Packers in their early years and was the team&#x27;s coach for 31 seasons through 1949. He shares the distinction with rival coach George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots of coaching his team to the most NFL championships, with six. Lambeau was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio in 1963.

===Corporate naming rights===
On November 7, 2000, two months after Brown County voters approved a sales tax to fund Lambeau Field&#x27;s renovation, a second referendum was presented to the same Brown County voters. This referendum asked whether naming rights to the renovated stadium should be sold in order to retire earlier the 0.5% sales tax created to cover construction costs. The referendum passed 53%-47%, the exact percentage by which voters approved the sales tax.

After the vote passed, the Packers entered talks with the city of Green Bay, which owns the stadium, to further explore the options. The city and team agreed to sell the rights if a price of $100 million could be realized, although no buyer has been found.

The Packers, although agreeing to be bound by the will of the voters, have consistently stressed that they would prefer Lambeau Field keep its traditional name, honoring the club&#x27;s founder.

The Packers have sold naming rights to the eight entrance gates. From the north going clockwise, they are: Bellin Health (north gate), Miller Brewing (atrium gate), American Family Insurance (northeast gate at parking lot level), the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin (east gate on elevated plaza facing Oneida Street), Fleet Farm stores (southwest gate), Associated Bank (west gate and private box entrance), and Kwik Trip (northwest gate). Verizon was the previous sponsor of the northwest gate (2003–2017). Miller Brewing is also a sponsor of the atrium and has a section in one end zone called the &quot;Miller Lite End Zone&quot;, giving away tickets in that area with various beer promotions. Shopko was the former sponsor of the south gate until its bankruptcy and liquidation in June 2019, and that gate is currently unbranded.

At the 2015 Packers shareholders meeting President Mark Murphy said &quot;We will not sell the naming rights to the stadium. ... We will never do that. It will always be Lambeau Field&quot;.

===&quot;The Frozen Tundra&quot;===

The stadium&#x27;s nickname was spawned by the Ice Bowl game between the Packers and the Dallas Cowboys, played on December 31, 1967. The game was played in temperatures of with sharp winds. Journalist Tex Maule associated Lambeau Field with the term &quot;tundra&quot; in his article summarizing the game in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

The nickname &quot;the frozen tundra&quot; is believed to originate from &quot;The Greatest Challenge&quot;, the Packers&#x27; authorized version of the highlight film written by Steve Sabol. In the Cowboys&#x27; authorized version of the highlight film, &quot;A Chilling Championship&quot;, also written by Sabol, Bill Woodson used the term &quot;the frozen tundra&quot; when narrating the film to describe Lambeau Field. Prior to the 1967 season, an underground electric heating system had been installed, but it was not able to counter the effects of the cold front that hit Green Bay at the onset of the Ice Bowl game. The field had been covered overnight with the heater on, but when the cover was removed in the sub-zero cold, the moisture atop the grass flash-froze.

The underground heating and drainage system was redone in 1997, with a system of pipes filled with a solution including antifreeze replacing the electric coils. After the 2006 season, the surface, heating, and drainage system was replaced. From 2007 until 2018, the playing surface used the Desso GrassMaster system, which has synthetic fibers woven into the traditional Kentucky bluegrass sod. In 2018, the Grassmaster surface was replaced with polyethylene-based SIS Grass. Even the new video boards, installed in 2004, have been influenced by the field&#x27;s nickname, being called &quot;Tundra Vision&quot;. These video displays measure more than high by wide.
An artificial lighting system, based on technology used in Dutch rose-growing greenhouses, was tested in 2010 and purchased for use in the 2011 season. It operates 24 hours a day from October to early December to extend the growing season for the field&#x27;s grass. The system is also used in some soccer stadiums where shade from stands and partial roofs are a problem for the turf, not the cold and short growing season found in Green Bay.

===Titletown, USA===
More famously a nickname for the city than its football field, &quot;Titletown, USA&quot; became popularized in 1961, even before Vince Lombardi won any of his championships. At the 1961 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants, which the Packers won 37–0, fans hung up signs around the stadium that read &quot;Welcome to Titletown, USA&quot;. Then-Giants quarterback Y. A. Tittle joked that the honor was for him, just that his name was misspelled. By the mid-60s, Titletown, USA was registered as a trademark of the Green Bay Packers, Inc. Lambeau Field has been home to seven NFL world championship seasons, five under Lombardi, one under Mike Holmgren and one under Mike McCarthy, surpassing the six world championship seasons witnessed by its predecessor, City Stadium, under Curly Lambeau.

==Postseason==

Lambeau Field has frequently given a significant postseason home-field advantage for the Packers. Playoff games at Lambeau Field typically feature cold Wisconsin winters. The most famous example is the aforementioned Ice Bowl. More recently, in the 1996–97 NFL playoffs both the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional playoffs and the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Championship Game struggled to adapt to the muddy and the cold conditions respectively. The temperatures during the 2007 NFC Championship Game (in which the Packers lost in OT, 23–20, to the New York Giants) reached as low as , with a wind chill of . From its opening in 1957 until January 2003, when they fell 27–7 to the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers had never lost a postseason game at Lambeau Field. However, the Packers hosted just one postseason game (in the ad hoc round-of-16 in the strike-shortened 1982 season) during a lean stretch of 27 years between the Ice Bowl of 1967 and a wild-card game in December 1994. Although the Packers have won only six of their last ten playoff games at Lambeau Field, their overall home postseason record is an outstanding 17–5. The stadium has hosted six championship contests: three NFL title games in 1961, 1965 and 1967 (the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot;) as well as three NFC championships after the 1996, 2007 and 2020 seasons.

==Traditions==
===The Lambeau Leap===
Many Packer players will jump into the end zone stands after scoring a touchdown, in a celebration affectionately known as the Lambeau Leap. The Lambeau Leap was spontaneously created in 1993 by safety LeRoy Butler, who scored after a Reggie White fumble recovery and lateral against the L.A. Raiders on December 26. It was later popularized by wide receiver Robert Brooks.

It&#x27;s not known precisely when the celebration was first coined the &quot;Lambeau Leap&quot;, but one of the first possible mentions was by broadcaster Al Michaels during a Monday night broadcast in September 1996, &quot;It&#x27;s a new tradition in Green Bay, Robert Brooks &quot;leaping&quot; into the stands.&quot;

When the NFL banned excessive celebrations in 2000, the Lambeau Leap was grandfathered into the new rules, permitting it to continue.

Occasionally, a visiting player will attempt a Lambeau Leap, only to be denied by Packers fans. This happened to then-Minnesota Vikings cornerback Fred Smoot when he intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown; Packers fans proceeded to throw their beverages on Smoot. During the 2007 NFC Championship game, New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs faked a Lambeau Leap after scoring a touchdown, angering many Green Bay faithful in the stands. Before a game against the Packers on September 20, 2009, Cincinnati Bengals wideout Chad Johnson, then known as Chad Ochocinco, announced he would do a Lambeau Leap if he scored a touchdown, and then followed through by leaping into the arms of pre-arranged fans wearing Bengals jerseys.

In 2014, a statue was made outside of Lambeau Field commemorating the Leap. Featuring a shortened replica of the end zone wall and 4 random Packers fans, the statue allows visitors to pose for pictures doing their own Lambeau Leap.

The NFL Network countdown program, &quot;NFL Top 10&quot;, named the Lambeau Leap the 3rd greatest touchdown celebration of all time.

==Special events==

===Packers shareholders meeting===
With the 1997–98 sale of stock in the Packers corporation, swelling the number of owners to over 112,000, a large venue was needed for the annual shareholders meeting. The event returned to Lambeau Field in 2006 after several thousand people were turned away from the 2005 meeting at the nearby Resch Center. Average attendance at shareholders meetings varies between 8,000 and 10,000.

The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the 2020 shareholders meeting from occurring as a large public gathering at Lambeau Field. For this reason, it was broadcast online in a virtual meeting format via live webcast. The pandemic also affected the 2021 meeting, resulting in only 3,900 owners attending in person.

===High school and college football===
When built, Lambeau Field was also slated to be used by schools of the Green Bay Area Public School District, as old City Stadium had been. However, a key 1962 game between the Packers and Detroit Lions was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, though Southwest and West continued to play there until a west side high school stadium was built in the late 1970s.

In 1973, the championship game for the Wisconsin Independent Schools Athletic Association (until 2000, the WIAA-equivalent organization for the state&#x27;s private and religious high schools) was played at Lambeau. The last high school game played at Lambeau was a WIAA semifinal between Green Bay West and Waukesha North, with the latter team the victor and going on to Madison for the divisional championship game. In 1982 and 1983, St. Norbert College hosted Fordham University (Lombardi&#x27;s alma mater) in two Division III tilts, benefitting the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The first was held on November 20, 1982, and the second was November 19, 1983. The first year, a 14-10 St. Norbert win, drew 5,119 people. The second year, a 18-9 St. Norbert win, drew 842 people.

In 2016, Lambeau Field hosted its first major NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision game when Wisconsin played LSU in the 2nd of a two-game series which started in 2014 at another NFL venue – Houston&#x27;s NRG Stadium. The Badgers won in what was called a &quot;historic upset&quot; by ESPN and Yahoo! Sports, as the unranked Badgers defeated the #5 ranked Tigers 16–14. &quot;ESPN College Gameday&quot; also visited Lambeau Field that day as a result, including Rodgers as a guest.

===Hockey===

Following the success of the &quot;Cold War&quot;, collegiate ice hockey game held in 2001 at Michigan State&#x27;s Spartan Stadium, hockey teams from Wisconsin and Ohio State met in the Frozen Tundra Hockey Classic, an outdoor game played on a temporary rink inside the stadium on February 11, 2006. The Badgers defeated the Buckeyes 4–2 before a capacity crowd of 40,890. There were some problems as the ice began to crack during play, but overall it was a success, ending with the Badgers doing the Lambeau Leap following their victory.

===Snowmobile racing===
In 2004 a snowmobile racing event was held in the parking lot due to a lack of snow. In 2005 the snowmobile racing event took place over the grass, with the right amount of snow cover.

===Concerts===
Due to the small size of the surrounding population, not many concerts are held at Lambeau Field because the primary use of the stadium is football. The Lambeau Field lease between the city of Green Bay and the Packers allows for one non-football event a month between February and June, with the Packers having veto power.

===Other===
Bob Hope was the first major entertainment event at the venue, performing in front of 18,000 on May 31, 1976.

===Soccer===
===Fireworks===
For many years, Lambeau hosted a popular annual Fourth of July fireworks display, sponsored by locally based retailer Shopko Stores, Inc.

==Seating capacity==
Lambeau Field is the second largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity.



==Sustainability==
The Green Bay Packers have made efforts to make Lambeau Field more environmentally sustainable, including the increased use of recycling bins, biodegradable food-ware, and LED lighting upgrades. More than 500 induction lighting fixtures have been installed, as well as 11 high-efficiency condensing boilers for space heating in the stadium, melting snow, and heating the field. Also, two high-efficiency electric chillers have been installed for the air-conditioned regions of Lambeau Field.

<text>The Marquesas Islands ( ; or &#x27; or&#x27; ; Marquesan: &#x27; ([[North Marquesan language|North Marquesan]]) and&#x27; (South Marquesan), both meaning &quot;the land of men&quot;) are a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France in the southern Pacific Ocean. Their highest point is the peak of Mount Oave () on Ua Pou island, at 1,230 m (4,035 ft) above sea level.

Archaeological research suggests the islands were colonized in the 10th century AD by voyagers from West Polynesia. Over the centuries that followed, the islands have maintained a &quot;remarkably uniform culture, biology and language&quot;. The Marquesas were named after the 16th-century Spanish Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Cañete (), by navigator , who visited them in 1595.

The Marquesas Islands constitute one of the five administrative divisions (&quot;&quot;) of French Polynesia. The capital of the Marquesas Islands&#x27; administrative subdivision is the town of Taioha&#x27;e, on the island of Nuku Hiva. The population of the Marquesas Islands was 9,346 inhabitants at the time of the August 2017 census.

==Geography==

The Marquesas Islands group is one of the most remote in the world. It lies about northeast of Tahiti and about southwest of Mexico (the nearest continental land mass). It is thought to have been formed by a centre of upwelling magma, called the Marquesas hotspot. The islands in the group fall naturally into two geographical divisions. One is the northern group, consisting of Eiao, Hatutu (Hatutaa), Motu One, and the islands surrounding the large island of Nuku Hiva: Motu Iti, also called Hatu Iti; Ua Pou; Motu Oa; and Ua Huka). The other is the southern group, consisting of Fatu Uku, Tahuata, Moho Tani (Motane), Terihi, Fatu Hiva, and Motu Nao (also called Thomasset Rock), which are clustered around the main island of Hiva Oa.

The Marquesas are among the largest island groups in French Polynesia. Their combined land area is . One of the islands in the group, Nuku Hiva, is the second-largest island in the entire territory (after Tahiti). With the exception of Motu One, all the islands of the Marquesas are of volcanic origin.

Although Polynesia tends to be associated with images of lush tropical vegetation, and the Marquesas lie within the tropics, they are remarkably dry. That is because they constitute the first major break for the prevailing easterly winds that arise from the (atmospherically) dry Humboldt Current. This subjects the Marquesas to frequent drought conditions. Only those islands that reach highest into the clouds (generally, higher than above sea level) reliably have periods of precipitation. These conditions have historically led to periodic fluctuations in the availability of fresh water. Periodic lack of water has made human habitation only intermittently sustainable in certain parts of the various islands throughout the archipelago. For example, Ua Huka Island (maximum elevation ) has a history of low population levels, and Eiao Island (maximum elevation ) has been intermittently uninhabited.

===Geology===
Most of the Marquesas Islands are of volcanic origin, created by the Marquesas hotspot that underlies the Pacific Plate. The Marquesas Islands lie above a submarine volcanic plateau of the same name. The plateau, like the islands, is generally believed to be less than 5 million years old, though one hypothesis is that the plateau (not the islands) is significantly older, and has been formed by forces similar to those that have formed the Inca Plateau, which is subducting under northern Peru.

The Marquesas islands are estimated to range in age from 1.3 million years old (Fatu Hiva) to 6 million years old (Eiao). All of them except Motu One are volcanic islands. Motu One is a low island, consisting of a small sand bank on a coral reef, the only atoll in the Marquesas Islands. Unlike most French Polynesian islands, the Marquesas islands (other than Motu One) are not surrounded by protective fringing reefs. In those islands, coral is found only in bays and other protected areas, or, in the case of Fatu Huku, in an unusual place: in fossilized form at the top of the island. The South Equatorial Current lashes all these islands fiercely; its force has carved sea-caves that dot their shores. Although the islands have valleys that empty into small bays, they are remarkable for their mountain ridges, which end abruptly in cliffs at the edge of the sea.

===Climate===

Temperatures in the Marquesas are stable all year round. Precipitation is highly variable: greater in the northern and eastern (windward) coastal areas and mountains, averaging annually; much lower in the western (leeward) areas. Average annual precipitation in the &quot;desert&quot; region of Nuku Hiva is only . Droughts are frequent, sometimes lasting several years, and seem to be associated with the phenomenon. The typical variability of the sea-level climate in the Marquesas is well illustrated by measurements made at the Atuona weather station on Hiva Oa: The highest recorded annual rainfall there is ; the lowest is .

==History==

The first recorded settlers of the Marquesas were Polynesians who arrived from West Polynesia, descendants of the Lapita Culture. Early attempts to carbon-date evidence from the site suggested they arrived before 100 AD, with other estimates proposing settlement from 600 AD, but several more recent independent studies suggest that they arrived more recently.

For example, a 2010 study that applied higher-precision radiocarbon dating methods to more reliable samples suggests that the earliest colonisation of eastern Polynesia took place much later, within a shorter time period, and in two waves: The first was a migration into the Society Islands between about 1025 and 1120 AD (four centuries later than had previously been thought); the second, between 70 and 265 years later, was a dispersal of migrants to all the remaining Marquesas islands between about 1190 and 1290 AD. This relatively rapid colonisation is believed to account for the &quot;remarkable uniformity of East Polynesian culture, biology and language&quot;.

A different study, published in 2014, suggested that the date of first settlement in the Marquesas was somewhat earlier: between around 900 and 1000 AD.

===Historical culture===

The richness of the natural resources in the islands has historically supported a large population. The inhabitants historically made a living by fishing, collecting shellfish, hunting birds, and gardening. They relied heavily on breadfruit but raised at least 32 other introduced crops. Hard evidence of significant pre-European interarchipelago trade has been found in basalt from the Marquesan quarry island of Eiao. It is known to have been distributed via sailing canoes over distances of more than 2500 km to provide adze heads to Mo&#x27;orea (Society Islands), Mangareva (Gambier Islands), Tubuai (Austral Islands), Rarotonga (Cook Islands), and Tabuaeran (Northern Line Islands).

===European contact===
The first Europeans to reach the Marquesas may have been the crew members aboard the &quot;San Lesmes&quot;, a Spanish vessel that disappeared in a storm in June 1526; it was part of an expedition headed by García Jofre de Loaísa. The Spanish explorer reached them nearly 70 years later, on 21 July 1595. He named the islands after his patron, , 5th Marquis of (), who served as Viceroy of Peru from 1590 to 1596. Mendaña visited first Fatu Hiva and then Tahuata before continuing on to the Solomon Islands. His expedition charted the four southernmost Marquesas as &#x27; (Fatu Hiva), &#x27; (Hiva Oa), &#x27; (Moho Tani), and &#x27; (Tahuata).

In the late 18th century, European explorers estimated that the population was 80,000 to 100,000. Europeans and Americans were impressed with how easy life appeared to be in the islands, which had a rich habitat and environment. In 1791, the American maritime fur trader Joseph Ingraham first visited the northern Marquesas while commanding the brig . He named them the Washington Islands. In 1813, Commodore David Porter claimed Nuku Hiva for the United States, but the United States Congress never ratified that claim. For a brief period the islands exported sandalwood, but the resource was depleted within four years. 

The islands were a popular port of call for whaling ships in the Age of Sail. The first on record to visit was the &quot;Hope&quot;, in April 1791. The last known such visitor was the American whaler &quot;Alaska&quot; in February 1907.
In 1842, France conducted a successful military operation in support of the native chief Iotete&#x27;s claim that he was king of the whole island of Tahuata. The French government then laid claim to the whole island group and established a settlement on Nuku Hiva. That settlement was abandoned in 1857, but France re-established control over the group in 1870. It later incorporated the Marquesas into French Polynesia.

The indigenous people of the Marquesas suffered high death rates from diseases carried by Western explorers, such as smallpox and measles, because none of them had any immunity to them.

The Marquesas lost more people to death from these diseases than any other island group in Polynesia. The population shrank from over 78,000 inhabitants in the 18th century to about 20,000 by the middle of the 19th century, and to just over 4,000 by the beginning of the 20th century, reaching an all-time low of 2,255 in 1926. After that, the population started to increase, reaching 8,548 by the time of the November 2002 census (not including the Marquesan community residing in Tahiti), and 9,346 by the time of the August 2017 census.

===Contemporary history===
In 2024, the Marquesas Islands were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under &quot;Te Henua Enata&quot; (), as part of the committee&#x27;s commitment to conservation efforts protecting indigenous populations.

==Government and politics==
The Marquesas Islands form one of the five administrative divisions (&quot;&quot;) of French Polynesia. French and Tahitian are the official languages of government. The capital of the Marquesas Islands administrative subdivision is the settlement of Taioha&#x27;e on the island of Nuku Hiva.

The sparsely populated Marquesas Islands are located from Tahiti. With 183,645 inhabitants (2012 census), Tahiti is the most populous island of French Polynesia, containing 68.5% of the total population of the grouping.

Residents of the Marquesas have chafed at Tahiti&#x27;s overwhelming dominance, complaining of neglect by politicians based in Tahiti, and leaders have suggested developing a direct relationship with the metropole, the government in Paris, instead of depending on Papeete. As sentiment was rising in Tahiti in the 21st century for independence from France, several prominent Marquesan political leaders in 2007 floated the idea of the Marquesas Islands separating from French Polynesia but remaining within the French Republic. This has generated controversy in Tahiti, where pro-independence Tahitian leaders have accused the French central government of encouraging the separation of the Marquesas Islands from French Polynesia.

==Administration==
===Community of communes of the Marquesas Islands (CODIM)===
The Marquesas Islands do not have a provincial or regional assembly, but since 2010 the six communes (municipalities) into which the Marquesas Islands are divided have gathered to form an intercommunality, the community of communes of the Marquesas Islands (in French: &quot;communauté de communes des îles Marquises&quot;, or CODIM). As all communities of communes in France, the CODIM is not a full-fledged territorial collectivity, but only a federation of communes (in French Polynesia, only the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia and the 48 communes are territorial collectivities). The CODIM is governed by a president and by a community council (&quot;conseil communautaire&quot;) which is made up of 15 delegates elected by the municipal councils of the six communes among their members, with each commune having a number of delegates proportional to the size of its population. The president of the CODIM and the community council have their offices in Atuona, on the island of Hiva Oa. The current president is Benoît Kautai, mayor of Nuku Hiva, who was elected president by the community council in July 2020 after the 2020 French municipal elections and is due to serve for six years until the next municipal elections.

The community of communes of the Marquesas Islands was created in 2010 with the aim of delegating powers both from the six communes and from the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia to this new intercommunal structure, due to the isolation of the Marquesas Islands and distance from the seat of the French Polynesian government in Tahiti. The government of French Polynesia transferred to the CODIM the power to oversee economic development. As a result, the CODIM is now in charge of drafting a blueprint for local economic development. The French Polynesian government also transferred to the CODIM the power to grant subsidies in favor of cultural and sports activities. Transfers of powers from the six communes to the CODIM have been extremely limited. Besides drafting a blueprint for economic development and granting subsidies for cultural and sports activities, the CODIM is currently in charge only of creating hiking trails, drafting studies for waste collection (but not actually managing waste collection, which the communes kept for themselves), drafting a blueprint for transports between the islands of the archipelago, acquiring computers and office equipment for the six communes of the archipelago, and offering legal and technical support to the six communes.

The French Polynesian public auditor (&quot;chambre territoriale des comptes&quot;) has pointed out that the actions of the CODIM have been very limited and fallen short of its theoretical powers due to a very small budget (less than 100 million Pacific Francs, i.e. less than US$1 million). For example, the CODIM has not exercised its power to acquire computers and office equipment for the six communes of the archipelago, and more generally its creation has not led to a pooling of resources and expenses by the six communes. Most of the CODIM&#x27;s budget has been spent on drafting a blueprint for local economic development, but the CODIM has neither the power nor the financial means to implement the blueprint and build the required infrastructure. The public auditor has called for an expansion of the powers and financial resources of the CODIM.

===Deconcentrated administrations===
Administratively, the Marquesas Islands form a deconcentrated subdivision of both the French central State and the government of French Polynesia. As a deconcentrated subdivision of the French central State, the Marquesas Islands form the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas (), one of French Polynesia&#x27;s five administrative subdivisions. The head of the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas is the &#x27; (&quot;State administrator&quot;), generally simply known as &#x27;, also sometimes called &#x27; (&quot;head of the administrative subdivision&quot;). The &#x27; is a civil servant under the authority of the High Commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia in Papeete. The &quot; and his staff sit in Taioha&#x27;e, on the island of Nuku Hiva, which has become the administrative capital of the Marquesas Islands, having replaced Atuona on the island of Hiva Oa, which was previously the capital (although, in reverse to this general trend, Atuona was selected as the seat of the community of communes of the Marquesas Islands in 2010).

Acting as the representative of the French central State and delegate of Papeete&#x27;s High Commissioner, the &quot; of the Marquesas is in charge of:
* Offering legal advice to the communes (municipalities) of the Marquesas and verifying the legality of decisions made by the communes
* Issuing official documents (ID cards, driving licences, etc.), applying immigration rules, organising elections
* Managing security (coordination of gendarmerie forces, handling of major crises such as natural disasters, etc.)
* Overseeing public services of the French central State in the Marquesas Islands (such as the correctional facility on Nuku Hiva)

As a deconcentrated subdivision of the government of French Polynesia, the Marquesas Islands form the &#x27; (&quot;district of the Marquesas&quot;), one of French Polynesia&#x27;s four &#x27; (&quot;districts&quot;) created in 2000 by the Assembly of French Polynesia to serve as deconcentrated subdivisions of the government of French Polynesia in the islands away from Tahiti and Moorea. The head of the &#x27; is the &#x27;, known as &#x27; in French (&quot;territorial administrator&quot;), but the Tahitian title &#x27; is most often used. The &#x27; is the direct representative of the president of French Polynesia&#x27;s government who appoints him. The &#x27; and his staff sit in Taioha&#x27;e on Nuku Hiva, same as the State administrator.

The &quot;&quot; is in charge of:
* Coordinating the work of French Polynesian administrations in the Marquesas Islands (such as the French Polynesian administrations in charge of roads, fisheries, etc.)
* Ensuring the enforcement of acts passed by the Assembly of French Polynesia and decisions taken by the government of French Polynesia
* Evaluating the performance of French Polynesian civil servants and sending the evaluations to the responsible ministries in Papeete
* Acting as a liaison between the local population and the government of French Polynesia in Papeete
The Marquesas Islands also form the electoral district of the Marquesas Islands, one of French Polynesia&#x27;s six electoral districts for the Assembly of French Polynesia (see also Politics of French Polynesia).

===Communes===
The Marquesas Islands are subdivided in six communes (municipalities). In each of the six communes the local residents with either a French or another EU citizenship elect a municipal council and a mayor in charge of managing local affairs within the commune. Three communes (Nuku-Hiva, Ua-Pou, and Hiva-Oa) are further subdivided into associated communes due to their larger population. The communes and associated communes are the only elected councils in the Marquesas since there does not exist a provincial or regional assembly for the entire archipelago (the community council of the CODIM (community of communes of the Marquesas Islands) is not directly elected by local residents, but is only made up of delegates chosen by the municipal councils of the six communes). Municipal elections are held every six years on the same day as municipal elections in the rest of France (see 2020 French municipal elections for the last municipal elections). Each municipal council then selects delegates among its members to sit in the community council of the CODIM in Atuona (on the island of Hiva Oa).

The areas and populations of the communes at the 2012 Census were as follows:

* Nuku-Hiva (388 km2): 2,966
* Ua-Pou (106 km2): 2,173
* Ua-Huka (83 km2): 621
* Hiva-Oa (327 km2): 2,190
* Tahuata (61 km2): 703
* Fatu-Hiva (85km2): 611
* &quot;Total&quot; (1,049km2): 9,264

==Demographics==

===Historical population===
===Migrations===
The places of birth of the 9,346 residents of the Marquesas Islands at the 2017 census were the following:
*63.2% were born in the Marquesas Islands (down from 70.5% at the 2007 census)
*29.2% in Tahiti (up from 20.9% at the 2007 census)
*4.0% in Metropolitan France (down from 4.5% at the 2007 census)
*2.5% in French Polynesia (other than the Marquesas Islands and Tahiti) (down from 3.0% at the 2007 census)
*0.8% in foreign countries (up from 0.6% at the 2007 census)
*0.3% in overseas France (other than French Polynesia) (down from 0.5% at the 2007 census)

Between the 2007 and 2017 censuses, the population of residents of the Marquesas Islands born in Tahiti rose by 50.5% (from 1,810 at the 2007 census to 2,726 at the 2017), and as a result, they made up 29.2% of the population in 2017. A lot of these arrivals from Tahiti, however, are children of Marquesans who had migrated to Tahiti and given birth there, and whose children are returning to the Marquesas, as can be seen in the language statistics: 50.8% of the Marquesas Islands&#x27; residents whose age was 15 or older and who were born in Tahiti and lived in the Marquesas at the 2017 census reported that the language they spoke the most at home was Marquesan, whereas 42.1% reported French, and only 6.6% reported Tahitian.

3,353 people born in the Marquesas Islands lived on the island of Tahiti at the 2017 census (down from 3,493 at the 2007 census), whereas 5,907 people born in the Marquesas Islands lived in the Marquesas (down from 6,106 at the 2007 census), and 705 lived in the rest of French Polynesia (up from 679 at the 2007 census). The total number of people born in the Marquesas Islands and living in French Polynesia decreased from 10,278 at the 2007 census to 9,965 at the 2017 census, as net births were not able to offset the departures to New Caledonia and Metropolitan France due to the economic crisis experienced by French Polynesia.

=== Religion ===
Most of the population of the Marquesas Islands is Christian as a consequence of the missionary activity of the Catholic Church, and various Protestant Christian groups. The main church in the area is the Cathedral of Our Lady of Taioha&#x27;e (), seat of the Catholic Diocese of Taioha&#x27;e ().

According to 2017 data 90.1% of the population of the Marquesas Islands was affiliated with the Catholic Church, an increase from 1950 when Catholics formed 87.3% of population of the islands.

Although the Mendaña ships had chaplains on board, there does not appear to have been any serious attempt at missionary work in the Marquesas Islands. The first missionaries to arrive in the Marquesas from 1797, coming from England via Tahiti, were William Pascoe Crook (1775–1846) and John Harris (1754–1819) of the London Missionary Society. Harris could not endure the conditions at all and returned to Tahiti only a few months later. A contemporary report says that he was picked up on the beach, utterly desperate, naked and looted. Crook remained until 1799.

The American mission from Hawaii was no more successful. William Patterson Alexander (1805–1864), Benjamin Parker (1803–1877), and Richard Armstrong (1805–1860) arrived in the Marquesas in 1834 from Hawaii with their wives and a three-month-old baby. They returned the same year. In 1853, more missionaries led by James Kekela (1824–1904) arrived at Fatu Hiva with their wives from Hawaii, but were unable to remain there because of clashes with Catholic missionaries arriving on a French warship.

Protestants went to Hiva Oa, and also had little success. There were few converts; tribal warfare and human sacrifice continued. Protestant missionaries gradually left Hiva Oa and returned to Hawaii, and only James Kekela remained. In 1899, he returned to Hawaii, dying in Honolulu on 29 November 1904. Hawaiian-born missionary James Bicknell translated the Gospel of John into the Marquesan language in 1857.

From 1838 to 1839, the Catholic mission was able to establish itself, supported by the French order (founded in 1800). The missionaries spread from Mangareva to Tahuata, Ua Pou, Fatu Hiva and Nuku Hiva. They suffered the same hostile tribal reception as the previous Protestants. However, with the support of the French authorities, they were able to sustain themselves in the long run, despite the obstacles. They even managed to baptize King Moana of Nuku Hiva who, however, would die of smallpox in 1863.

The missionaries of all denominations did their best to eradicate the traditional culture in any way possible. Not only were the Christians disapproving of the long-enjoyed consumption of kava, the ancient and sacred tattoo artwork, and general dancing and traditional music, but they were especially horrified by tribal fertility/virility rites and skull dissection. However, they also tried and finally succeeded putting an end to cannibalism, human sacrifice and constant tribal warfare.

===Language===
French and Tahitian are the official languages of all of French Polynesia, but the Marquesan languages, in their various forms, remain the primary means of communication among residents within this archipelago. In addition, knowledge of French is now almost universal among residents of the Marquesas Islands (see census data below).

Marquesan is a collection of East-Central Polynesian language dialects, of the Marquesic group, spoken in the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia. They are usually classified into two groups, North Marquesan and South Marquesan, corresponding roughly along geographic lines.

The North Marquesan dialects are spoken on the islands of Ua Pu and Nuku Hiva, and South Marquesan dialects on the islands of Hiva Oa, Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. The dialects of Ua Huka are often incorrectly classified as North Marquesan; they are instead transitional. While the island is in the northern Marquesas group, the dialects show more morphological and phonological affinities with South Marquesan. The North Marquesan dialects are sometimes considered to be two separate languages: North Marquesan and Tai Pi Marquesan, the latter being spoken in the valleys of the eastern third of the island of Nuku Hiva, in the ancient province of Tai Pi.

The most striking feature of the Marquesan languages is their almost universal replacement of the or of other Polynesian languages by a (glottal stop).

Like other Polynesian languages, the phonology of Marquesan languages is characterised by a paucity of consonants and a comparative abundance of vowels.

====Language data in 2017 census====
At the 2017 census, 97.0% of the population whose age was 15 and older reported that they could speak French (up from 94.1% at the 2007 census). 92.6% reported that they could also read and write it (up from 90.2% at the 2007 census). Only 1.9% of the population whose age was 15 and older had no knowledge of French (down from 4.4% at the 2007 census).

At the same census, 66.9% of the population whose age was 15 and older reported that the language they spoke the most at home was Marquesan (down from 67.8% at the 2007 census). 30.2% reported that French was the language they spoke the most at home (up from 30.1% at the 2007 census). 2.3% reported Tahitian (up from 1.4% at the 2007 census), and 0.6% reported another language (down from 0.7% at the 2007 census).

4.9% of the population whose age was 15 and older reported that they had no knowledge of any Polynesian language at the 2017 census (down from 7.2% at the 2007 census).

==Communications==
===Airports===
There are four airports in the Marquesas, one each on the islands of Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, and Hiva Oa. The terrain of Tahuata is too irregular to allow for the construction of a landing strip without significant investment, and while the upland plateau of central Fatu Hiva is large enough to permit the construction of an airstrip, the island&#x27;s minuscule population makes such an exercise of dubious benefit.

===Telecommunications===
The Marquesas are served by telephone as well as by radio and television, mainly from Tahiti. Recent additions include &quot;Vini&quot;, a mobile phone service that is a commercial subsidiary of the public , the sole provider of fixed telephony in most of Polynesia. Over a period of about six years, Vini has expanded to cover most of the populated islands.

==Art and culture==

The Marquesas Islands have a rich tradition of art. Art of the Marquesas ranges from large wooden sculptures of ancestors created for temples to small, intricate personal ornaments made from bone and shell. Carved wooden objects were decorated in elaborate anthropomorphic and geometric motifs, similar to tattoo designs that are part of a traditional practice.

==Biology==

The ecosystem of the Marquesas has been devastated in some areas by the activities of feral livestock. As a first step in preserving what remains, the Marquesan Nature Reserves were created in 1992.

In 1996 Lucien Kimitete, the Mayor of Nuku Hiva, proposed that the Marquesas become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In May 2022 public consultations on their listing began. The French government formally lodged an application with UNESCO in January 2023. Te Henua Enata was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List on July 31, 2024.

<doc id="149592" wikidata="Q639955" url="?curid=149592" title="Super Mario Sunshine">
<text>is a 2002 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It is the second 3D game in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, following &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996). The game was directed by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, produced by series creators Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, written by Makoto Wada, and scored by Koji Kondo and Shinobu Tanaka.

The game takes place on the tropical Isle Delfino, where Mario, Toadsworth, Princess Peach, and five Toads are taking a vacation. A villain resembling Mario, known as Shadow Mario, vandalizes the island with graffiti and causes Mario to be wrongfully convicted for the mess. Mario is ordered to clean up Isle Delfino, using a device called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device (F.L.U.D.D.), while saving Princess Peach from Shadow Mario.

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the game&#x27;s graphics, gameplay, story, soundtrack, and the addition of F.L.U.D.D. as a mechanic. However, some criticized the game&#x27;s camera, F.L.U.D.D.&#x27;s gimmicky nature, the difficulty of some of the missions, and the decision to use full voice acting for some characters. The game sold over five million copies worldwide by 2006, making it one of the best-selling GameCube games. The game was re-released as a part of the Player&#x27;s Choice brand in 2003. It was re-released alongside &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; in the &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot; collection for the Nintendo Switch in 2020.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, while introducing several new gameplay features. Players control Mario as he collects 120 Shine Sprites to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr. disguises himself as Mario, steals the Shine Sprites, and covers the island in toxic slime. Players start off in the hub world of Delfino Plaza and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Stars in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing selected missions with specific objectives. Unlike its predecessor, these missions have a more strictly linear order and most mission Shine Sprites cannot be collected until previous missions are completed. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players can find Blue Coins hidden across Isle Delfino, which can be exchanged for Shine Sprites in the boathouse at Delfino Plaza.

In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named F.L.U.D.D. (Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for F.L.U.D.D., Squirt and Hover, which he can switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water, which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for F.L.U.D.D. which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of F.L.U.D.D.&#x27;s nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also various secret courses where F.L.U.D.D. is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. Unlike &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, Mario cannot long jump; he can instead perform a spin jump by twirling the analog stick and jumping, allowing him to jump higher and farther. Mario can also perform dives at any time, giving him the ability to slide quickly across wet surfaces. 

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; is the first 3D &quot;Super Mario&quot; game with the ability to ride Yoshi. At certain points, Mario can come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being given a specific type of fruit. Yoshi can be ridden upon and attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water; juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.

==Plot==

Mario visits the tropical Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, her steward Toadsworth, and several other Toads. At Delfino Airstrip, they discover a mass of paint-like goop. After acquiring the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device (F.L.U.D.D.), a water cannon created by Professor E. Gadd, Mario defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant that emerges from the goop. However, Mario is arrested on suspicion of vandalizing the island with graffiti, which has caused the source of the island&#x27;s power, Shine Sprites, to disappear and the island to be covered in shadow. Mario is assigned community service to clean up the island and track down the real criminal.

The culprit a shadowy blue doppelgänger of Mario, Shadow Mario. Using a magic paintbrush developed by Professor E. Gadd, Shadow Mario created the graffiti. He attempts to kidnap Princess Peach, but is thwarted by Mario. After the player collects ten Shine Sprites, Shadow Mario successfully kidnaps Peach and takes her to Pinna Island. Upon arriving at Pinna Park, a theme park on the island, Mario encounters and destroys Mecha Bowser, a giant Bowser robot controlled by Shadow Mario. Afterwards, Shadow Mario reveals that his true identity is Bowser Jr. Bowser&#x27;s son, and that he framed Mario because his father, Bowser, told him Peach is his mother, whom Mario was trying to kidnap. Mecha Bowser&#x27;s head then transforms into a hot air balloon and Bowser Jr. takes Peach to Corona Mountain. With no way to enter the volcano, Mario continues his mission collecting Shine Sprites.

After the player defeats Bowser Jr. in his Shadow Mario disguise in the seven main levels, Delfino Plaza floods and the entrance to Corona Mountain is opened. Mario travels through the lava-filled caverns and finds Bowser, Bowser Jr. and Princess Peach in a giant hot tub in the sky. Mario defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by destroying the hot tub, causing everyone to fall from the sky. Bowser and Bowser Jr. land on a platform in the ocean, while Mario and Peach land on a small island. However, F.L.U.D.D. is damaged by the fall and powers down. Mario and Peach watch as the Shine Gate&#x27;s power is restored while a group of locals celebrate. Meanwhile, Bowser admits to his son that Peach is not his mother, to which Bowser Jr. replies that he already knows, and that when he is older he wants to fight Mario again. Mario and Princess Peach watch the sunset at Sirena Beach, and the Toads present Mario with F.L.U.D.D., who has been repaired, and he declares the vacation begins now.

==Development==

A sequel to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; had been in development for several years; the canceled games &quot;Super Mario 64 2/Super Mario 128&quot; were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel. &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2001. The game was later shown again at E3 2002. It was developed by Nintendo EAD.

The game received the first lead directing role for Nintendo designer Yoshiaki Koizumi following a ten-year-long apprenticeship working on various other games. Super Mario creators Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka served as producers. It was the first Nintendo first-party game after Satoru Iwata became president of Nintendo, succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi. Developing a Mario game for the GameCube was the last request Yamauchi gave the team before resigning. In an interview about the development of &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; with Koizumi, Kenta Usui, and Tezuka, it was mentioned that the game&#x27;s development began after showing &quot;Super Mario 128&quot; and following the critical and commercial success of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, when Koizumi conceived the idea of gameplay involving a water pump. However, at first Koizumi, Miyamoto and Tezuka thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and F.L.U.D.D. was chosen because of fitting in the game&#x27;s setting, though it was not one of the favorites. They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted, such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him. It was the first in the Mario series to include Peach’s panneria-like overskirt and ponytail and Toad’s different colored spots, and vests with yellow outlines.

Koji Kondo and Shinobu Tanaka composed the score to &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. Kondo composed the main motif for Isle Delfino, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, and Gelato Beach, as well as the ending credits, while additional music was composed by Tanaka. The soundtrack features various arrangements of classic &quot;Mario&quot; tunes, including the underground music and the main stage music from the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; features many of the usual voice actors for the various Mario characters. Charles Martinet voices Mario, Jen Taylor voices Princess Peach and Toad, Kit Harris voices F.L.U.D.D. and the Nokis, Scott Burns voices Bowser in the character&#x27;s first speaking role in a video game, Toadsworth, and the male Piantas, and Dolores Rogers voices Bowser Jr. and the female Piantas. Unlike most games of the series, the cutscenes in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; feature full English voice acting.

==Release==
&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was released in Japan on July 19, 2002. It was later released in the United States on August 26 of that year. A GameCube bundle containing the game along with a GameCube console was released in North America on October 14, 2002. The game was re-released alongside &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996) and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; (2007) in the &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot; collection on Nintendo Switch on September 18, 2020.

==Reception==

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was critically acclaimed by game critics and fans. Particular praise went towards the graphics, music, story, gameplay and the addition of F.L.U.D.D. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the addition of the water backpack for improving gameplay, and GameSpy commented on the &quot;wide variety of moves and the beautifully constructed environments&quot;. The game received a perfect score from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, who commended the &quot;superb graphics, excellent music, clever layouts, funny cinema scenes and ingenious puzzles&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Platformer on GameCube&quot; award. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect score, stating that the game was &quot;a masterpiece of superior game design, infinite gameplay variety, creativity, and life.&quot; The American-based publication &quot;Game Informer&quot; said that the game is arguably &quot;the best &quot;Mario&quot; game to date.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; also mentioned the game is &quot;better than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.&quot; The game placed 46th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time. &quot;AllGame&quot; gave a lower review, stating that &quot;During the six-year span between &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, platform games have become more epic, more interactive, and prettier. Yet the core element of collecting items in a world divided into sub-sections has been left unchanged. So it comes with a modicum of disappointment that &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; doesn&#x27;t shake up the genre with a number of new and fresh ideas other than the usual enhancements expected from a sequel.&quot;

Some reviewers were critical towards certain aspects of the game. The camera system and high difficulty were the most criticized aspects of the game. The decision to use full voice acting for some characters in the game, as well as F.L.U.D.D., received mixed responses. &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann criticized the various additions, including F.L.U.D.D. and Yoshi, calling them &quot;mere gimmicks&quot;. He also complained about the camera system. Gerstmann said that the game seemed somewhat unpolished and rushed, a sentiment shared by Matt Wales of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it 2002&#x27;s most disappointing GameCube game. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; for &quot;Console Platform Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

===Sales===
In Japan, more than 400,000 copies of &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; were sold within four days. In the United States, more than 350,000 copies were sold within its first ten days of release, surpassing launch sales of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, the Xbox&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and the Nintendo 64&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and boosting hardware sales of the GameCube. In Europe, 175,000 units were sold within a week of its release. In Japan, 624,240 units had been sold by October 2002. In 2002, &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was the tenth best-selling game in the United States according to the NPD Group. It was re-released in 2003 as part of the Player&#x27;s Choice line, a selection of games with high sales sold for a reduced price. By July 2006, 2.5 million copies were sold for $85 million, in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the ninth highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. By June 2006, over 5.5 million copies had been sold worldwide. Despite strong sales numbers, Satoru Iwata confirmed at E3 2003 that the game&#x27;s sales, along with those of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, had failed to live up to the company&#x27;s expectations.

==Legacy==

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; introduced several elements that were carried over into subsequent &quot;Mario&quot; games. Many of the bosses appear in &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs that followed on the GameCube, such as Bowser Jr, and the unlockable Petey Piranha and King Boo in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&quot; and the four unlockable characters in &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; introduced the Shine Sprites, which appeared in &quot;Mario&quot; games such as &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; and &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot;. It is also the debut of Bowser Jr., a character in games such as &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;, and in later &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off and sports games. It introduces recurring characters Petey Piranha, Gooper Blooper, and Toadsworth. The &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series has numerous references to original elements of &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;; most notably, F.L.U.D.D. has been featured as a part of Mario&#x27;s moveset since &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. In the action-adventure games &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum&quot; and &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Wifix&quot;, one of the Roman foes the player faces has a similar appearance to Mario with F.L.U.D.D. attached to his back. In 2024, Miyamoto said he regretted the difficulty of &quot;Mario Sunshine&quot; and felt that anyone in the family should be able to play a Nintendo game. He felt the hidden bonus stages should have been optional for finishing the game.

<doc id="149593" wikidata="Q6507722" url="?curid=149593" title="Mario Party (video game)">
<text>is a 1998 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game was targeted at a young audience. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto served as development supervisor. It received mostly positive critical reviews for its multiplayer mode, concept, and music; disapproval of its slow pacing; and mixed reviews of its graphics. It is the first installment in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series and was followed by &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; in 1999. The game received its first official re-release on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022. Content from this game was remastered as part of &quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; for the Nintendo Switch.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario Party&quot; is a party video game featuring six playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong. In the game&#x27;s frame story, Mario and his friends argue about which of them is the &quot;Super Star&quot;, a figure upon whom the entire world can rely. To settle their dispute, they set out for adventure to determine which of them is most worthy of the title. The gameplay is presented in the form of a traditional board game, and includes six game board maps themed after each of the playable characters. Two additional board maps become available later in the game. &quot;Mario Party&quot; includes multiplayer compatibility; each game on a board map consists of four players, including at least one human player and up to four. Any character who is not controlled by a human will instead be controlled by the game as a computer-controlled character. The skill level of the computer-controlled characters can be individually adjusted between &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, or &quot;Hard&quot;. After the players and board map have been determined, the player chooses how long the board map game will last: &quot;Lite Play&quot; consists of 20 turns, &quot;Standard Play&quot; consists of 35, and &quot;Full Play&quot; consists of 50. Upon starting a board, players each hit a dice block to determine turn order, with the highest number going first on each turn and the lowest number going last.

The goal of &quot;Mario Party&quot; is to collect the most stars within the allotted amount of turns. Stars must be purchased from Toad with coins, which can be earned through a selection from one of 50 mini-games that is played once at the end of each turn. The first player initiates a turn by rolling a dice block that determines how many spaces they will advance on the board, ranging from one to ten spaces. Each board map has a variety of spaces. Plain blue and red spaces cause the player who lands on one to respectively gain or lose three coins; the amount of coins is doubled to six during the final five turns. Blue spaces labeled with a star will initiate a single-player mini-game. Blue &quot;!&quot; spaces result in a Chance Time game, in which selected characters must give or exchange coins or stars; the player who landed on the space is given three blocks to hit, determining which characters and prize will be involved. Green &quot;?&quot; spaces result in an event occurring on the board map; each board features different events which can help or hinder certain players. Red spaces marked with an insignia of Bowser&#x27;s head will cause Bowser to appear and hinder the player&#x27;s progress. Blue spaces labeled with a mushroom give players a chance to either take another turn right away or lose their subsequent turn. Aside from Toad, other characters on the map include Boo, Koopa Troopa, and Bowser. Boo can steal coins or a star from another player on behalf of any player who passes him; stealing coins is free, but stealing a star costs 50 coins. Koopa Troopa is stationed at the starting point on board maps and will give ten coins to each player who passes him. Bowser will inconvenience players who pass him by forcibly selling them a useless item. On some boards, Toad&#x27;s location will change after he sells a Star.

After all four players have made a movement on the board, a mini-game is initiated. The type of mini-game that is played is determined based on the color of space that each player landed on. Players that have landed on a green space will be randomly assigned to &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;red&quot; status before the mini-game is selected. If all players have landed on the same color of space, a 4-player mini-game is played. Other color variations result in either a 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 2 mini-game. The specific mini-game is then selected via roulette. Mini-game titles are normally highlighted in green, though some titles are highlighted in red; the winner of any given mini-game receives coins, and in red-highlighted games, the losers will lose coins. Another turn is initiated following the end of a mini-game, and the process is repeated until the allotted number of turns have been completed. After the end of the last turn, the winners of three awards are announced, with each winner receiving one additional star; the first two awards are given to the player(s) who collected the most coins in mini-games and throughout the board map game, and the third is given to the player(s) who landed on the most &quot;?&quot; spaces. The winner of the game, the &quot;Super Star&quot;, is then determined by the number of total coins and stars collected by each player. If two or more characters have acquired the same amount of coins and stars, the winner will be determined with a roll of the dice block.

===Other modes===
The game&#x27;s main menu includes a &quot;Mushroom Bank&quot; at which coins received by the human player during gameplay are deposited. The Mushroom Bank will initially carry 300 coins. Coins can be used to purchase mini-games at the &quot;Mini-Game House&quot;, which can then be played at any time outside of normal board games. The Mini-Game House includes the &quot;Mini-Game Stadium&quot; mode, in which four players compete on a special board map consisting only of blue and red spaces. Coins are neither gained nor lost from these spaces, and coins are only earned by winning mini-games. The winner of Mini-Game Stadium is determined by whoever accumulates the highest number of coins by the completion of the allotted turns. Coins can also be used at the main menu&#x27;s &quot;Mushroom Shop&quot;, where items can be purchased and stored at the Mushroom Bank. These items can be toggled on or off for use during games, where they will randomly take effect when any character rolls the dice block. Such effects include special dice blocks with only high or low numbers. Other items remove Koopa Troopa or Boo from the board.

The game includes the single-player Mini-Game Island mode, in which one human player must play through each mini-game. The player has four lives and progresses through a world map with the completion of each mini-game, while losing a mini-game results in the loss of a life. If the player loses all lives, the game ends, and the player must resume from the last save point. If the player completes all the mini-games in Mini-Game Island, up to three bonus mini-games are unlocked.

== Development ==
&quot;Mario Party&quot; was developed by Hudson Soft, known for creating the &quot;Bomberman&quot; franchise. It was previewed in the January 1999 issue of The 64Dream and teased in the #116 issue of the Nintendo Power magazine published in January 1999 in the &quot;Coming Next Issue...&quot; section.

==Reception==
&quot;Mario Party&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics considered &quot;Mario Party&quot; much more enjoyable when playing with other people through the game&#x27;s multiplayer option. Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;The games that are enjoyable to play in multi-player are nowhere near as good in the single player mode. Really, it&#x27;s that multi-player competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they&#x27;re just simple little games.&quot; Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot; took a similar stance, saying that it was the interaction between players rather than the interaction with the game that made &quot;Mario Party&quot; fun. James Bottorff of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;Playing by yourself requires you to sit through the painfully slow moves of each of your computer opponents.&quot; Dr. Moo of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; wrote that playing alone &quot;is terribly boring, and realistically scrounging up 4 people to play &quot;Mario Party&quot; is harder than it sounds&quot;. He added that the game had &quot;great intentions, but unsatisfying delivery,&quot; calling it &quot;a tedious and often frustrating experience&quot;. Reviewers for &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote negatively about &quot;Mario Party&quot; and its mini-games. Scott Alan Marriott of &quot;AllGame&quot; was also dissatisfied with most of the mini-games, and criticized the random luck involved. He stated that &quot;Mario Party&quot; had a good concept but was somewhat disappointing, concluding that most players would be unsatisfied with the short mini-games and simple gameplay.

The music was praised, although the graphics received a mixed response. Critics believed the game would have appeal for young children. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s authors gave the game an average score of 8.625 out of 10. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s standard quartet of reviewers gave it a total score of 31 out of 40.

During the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Mario Party&quot; for the &quot;Console Children&#x27;s/Family Title of the Year&quot; award, which was ultimately given to &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;.

Within the first two months of its U.S. release, &quot;Mario Party&quot; was among the top five most rented video games. It was also the fourth-best-selling video game of April 1999.

==Hand injury complaints==
In &quot;Mario Party&quot;, certain minigames require rotation of the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s analog stick at top speed. Some players reportedly got blisters, friction burns, and lacerations from rotating the stick with palms instead of using thumbs because of the uncomfortable design of the analog stick and it is faster to beat the minigames that way.

Although no lawsuits were filed, around 90 complaints were received by New York&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office and Nintendo of America eventually agreed to a settlement, which included providing gloves for injured players and paying the state&#x27;s $75,000 legal fees. At the time, providing the estimated 1.2 million gloves could have cost Nintendo up to $80 million.

&quot;Mario Party&quot; was not re-released via the Virtual Console on Wii and Wii U, with &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; released instead. The game would not be re-released until November 2, 2022, via the Nintendo Switch Online service.

Minigames using stick rotation returned in &quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot;. In &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot;, a disclaimer is placed on the rules screen for the two mini games that use stick rotation, warning players not to use their palms to turn the stick to avoid hand injury and stick damage. A similar warning appears for the Nintendo Switch Online version of &quot;Mario Party&quot; when starting the game.

<doc id="149595" wikidata="Q12008" url="?curid=149595" title="Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, marked Quasi una fantasia, Op. 27, No. 2, is a piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven, completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his pupil Countess Julie &quot;Giulietta&quot; Guicciardi. Although known throughout the world as the Moonlight Sonata (German: &quot;Mondscheinsonate&quot;), it was not Beethoven who named it so. The name grew popular later, likely long after Beethoven&#x27;s death.

The piece is one of Beethoven&#x27;s most famous compositions for the piano, and was quite popular even in his own day. Beethoven wrote the &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; around the age of 30, after he had finished with some commissioned work; there is no evidence that he was commissioned to write this sonata.

==Names==
The first edition of the score is headed &quot;Sonata quasi una fantasia&quot; (&quot;sonata almost a fantasy&quot;), the same title as that of its companion piece, Op. 27, No. 1. Grove Music Online translates the Italian title as &quot;sonata in the manner of a fantasy&quot;. &quot;The subtitle reminds listeners that the piece, although technically a sonata, is suggestive of a free-flowing, improvised fantasia.&quot;

Many sources say that the nickname &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; arose after the German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab likened the effect of the first movement to that of moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne. This comes from the musicologist Wilhelm von Lenz, who wrote in 1852: &quot;Rellstab compares this work to a boat, visiting, by moonlight, the remote parts of Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. The soubriquet &quot;Mondscheinsonate&quot;, which twenty years ago made connoisseurs cry out in Germany, has no other origin.&quot; Taken literally, &quot;twenty years&quot; would mean the nickname had to have started after Beethoven&#x27;s death. In fact Rellstab made his comment about the sonata&#x27;s first movement in a story called &quot;Theodor&quot; that he published in 1824: &quot;The lake reposes in twilit moon-shimmer [&quot;Mondenschimmer&quot;], muffled waves strike the dark shore; gloomy wooded mountains rise and close off the holy place from the world; ghostly swans glide with whispering rustles on the tide, and an Aeolian harp sends down mysterious tones of lovelorn yearning from the ruins.&quot; Rellstab made no mention of Lake Lucerne, which seems to have been Lenz&#x27;s own addition. Rellstab met Beethoven in 1825, making it theoretically possible for Beethoven to have known of the moonlight comparison, though the nickname may not have arisen until later.

By the late 1830s, the name &quot;Mondscheinsonate&quot; was being used in German publications and &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; in English publications. Later in the nineteenth century, the sonata was universally known by that name.

Many critics have objected to the subjective, romantic nature of the title &quot;Moonlight&quot;, which has at times been called &quot;a misleading approach to a movement with almost the character of a funeral march&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;. Other critics have approved of the sobriquet, finding it evocative or in line with their own interpretation of the work. &quot;Gramophone&quot; founder Compton Mackenzie found the title &quot;harmless&quot;, remarking that &quot;it is silly for austere critics to work themselves up into a state of almost hysterical rage with poor Rellstab&quot;, and adding, &quot;what these austere critics fail to grasp is that unless the general public had responded to the suggestion of moonlight in this music Rellstab&#x27;s remark would long ago have been forgotten.&quot; Donald Francis Tovey thought the title of &quot;Moonlight&quot; was appropriate for the first movement but not for the other two.

Carl Czerny, Beethoven&#x27;s pupil, described the first movement as &quot;a ghost scene, where out of the far distance a plaintive ghostly voice sounds&quot;.

Franz Liszt described the second movement as &quot;a flower between two abysses&quot;.

==Form==
Although no direct testimony exists as to the specific reasons why Beethoven decided to title both the Op. 27 works as &quot;Sonata quasi una fantasia&quot;, it may be significant that the layout of the present work does not follow the traditional movement arrangement in the Classical period of fast–slow–[fast]–fast. Indeed, this sonata is considered one of the earliest pieces of the Romantic era. Instead, the sonata possesses an end-weighted trajectory, with the rapid music held off until the third movement. In his analysis, German critic Paul Bekker states: &quot;The opening sonata-allegro movement gave the work a definite character from the beginning ... which succeeding movements could supplement but not change. Beethoven rebelled against this determinative quality in the first movement. He wanted a prelude, an introduction, not a proposition&quot;.

The sonata consists of three movements:

===I. Adagio sostenuto===

&lt;/score&gt;
The first movement, in C minor and alla breve, is written in modified sonata-allegro form. Donald Francis Tovey warned players of this movement to avoid &quot;taking [it] on a quaver standard like a slow &quot;.

The movement opens with an octave in the left hand and a triplet figuration in the right. A melody that Hector Berlioz called a &quot;lamentation&quot;, mostly by the left hand, is played against an accompanying ostinato triplet rhythm, simultaneously played by the right hand. 
The movement is played &quot;pianissimo (pp)&quot; or &quot;very quietly&quot;, and the loudest it gets is &quot;piano (p)&quot; or &quot;quietly&quot;.

The &quot;adagio sostenuto&quot; tempo has made a powerful impression on many listeners; for instance, Berlioz commented that it &quot;is one of those poems that human language does not know how to qualify&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s student Carl Czerny called it &quot;a nocturnal scene, in which a mournful ghostly voice sounds from the distance&quot;. The movement was very popular in Beethoven&#x27;s day, to the point of exasperating the composer himself, who remarked to Czerny, &quot;Surely I&#x27;ve written better things&quot;.

In his book &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s pianoforte sonatas&quot;, 
the renowned pianist Edwin Fischer suggests that this movement of this sonata is based on Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Ah Soccorso! Son Tradito&quot; of his opera Don Giovanni, which comes just after the Commendatore&#x27;s murder. He claims to have found, in the archives of the Wiener Musikverein, a sketch in Beethoven&#x27;s handwriting of a few lines of Mozart&#x27;s music (which bears the same characteristic triplet figuration) transposed to C minor, the key of the sonata. &quot;In any case, there is no romantic moon-light in this movement: it is rather a solemn dirge&quot;, writes Fischer.

The second movement is a relatively conventional minuet in triple time, with the first section of the minuet not repeated. It is a seeming moment of relative calm written in D major, the more easily notated enharmonic equivalent of C major, the parallel major of the main work&#x27;s key, C minor. The slight majority of the movement is in &quot;piano (p)&quot;, but a handful of &quot;sforzandos (sfz)&quot; and &quot;fortepianos&quot; (&quot;fp)&quot; helps to maintain the movement&#x27;s cheerful disposition. It is the shortest of the movements and has been called the &quot;less popular&quot; interlude between the first and third movements. Franz Liszt is said to have described the second movement as &quot;a flower between two chasms&quot;.

The stormy final movement (C minor), in sonata form and common time, is the weightiest of the three, reflecting an experiment of Beethoven&#x27;s (also carried out in the companion sonata Opus 27, No. 1 and later on in Opus 101), namely, placement of the most important movement of the sonata last. The writing has many fast arpeggios/broken chords, strongly accented notes, and fast alberti bass sequences that fall both into the right and left hands at various times. An effective performance of this movement demands lively, skillful playing and great stamina, and is significantly more demanding technically than the 1st and 2nd movements.

Of the final movement, Charles Rosen has written &quot;it is the most unbridled in its representation of emotion. Even today, two hundred years later, its ferocity is astonishing&quot;.

Beethoven&#x27;s heavy use of &quot;sforzando (sfz)&quot; notes, together with just a few strategically located &quot;fortissimo (ff)&quot; passages, creates the sense of a very powerful sound in spite of the predominance of &quot;piano (p)&quot; markings throughout.
== Beethoven&#x27;s pedal mark ==
At the opening of the first movement, Beethoven included the following direction in Italian: &quot;Si deve suonare tutto questo pezzo delicatissimamente e senza sordino&quot; (&quot;This whole piece ought to be played with the utmost delicacy and without damper[s]&quot;). The way this is accomplished (both on today&#x27;s pianos and on those of Beethoven&#x27;s day) is to depress the sustain pedal throughout the movement – or at least to make use of the pedal throughout, but re-applying it as the harmony changes.

The modern piano has a much longer sustain time than the instruments of Beethoven&#x27;s time, so that a steady application of the sustain pedal creates a dissonant sound. In contrast, performers who employ a historically based instrument (either a restored old piano or a modern instrument built on historical principles) are more able to follow Beethoven&#x27;s direction literally.

For performance on the modern piano, several options have been put forth.

*One option is simply to change the sustain pedal periodically where necessary to avoid excessive dissonance. This is seen, for instance, in the editorially supplied pedal marks in the Ricordi edition of the sonata.
*Half pedaling—a technique involving a partial depression of the pedal—is also often used to simulate the shorter sustain of the early nineteenth century pedal. Charles Rosen suggested either half-pedaling or releasing the pedal a fraction of a second late.
*Joseph Banowetz suggests using the sostenuto pedal: the pianist should pedal cleanly while allowing sympathetic vibration of the low bass strings to provide the desired &quot;blur&quot;. This is accomplished by silently depressing the piano&#x27;s lowest bass notes before beginning the movement, then using the sostenuto pedal to hold these dampers up for the duration of the movement.

==Influence==
The C minor sonata, particularly the third movement, is held to have been the inspiration for Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;, and the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; to have been in fact a tribute to Beethoven. It manifests the key relationships of the sonata&#x27;s three movements, chord structures, and even shares some passages. Ernst Oster writes: &quot;With the aid of the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; we can at least recognize what particular features of the C minor Sonata struck fire in Chopin. We can actually regard Chopin as our teacher as he points to the coda and says, &#x27;Look here, this is great. Take heed of this example!&#x27; ... The &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; is perhaps the only instance where one genius discloses to us – if only by means of a composition of his own – what he actually hears in the work of another genius.&quot;

Carl Bohm composed a piece for violin and piano called &quot;Meditation&quot;, Op. 296, in which he adds a violin melody over the unaltered first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s sonata.

Modern popular music pianists have included core motifs of the piece in their adaptations. Examples include George Shearing, in his &#x27;Moonlight Becomes You,&#x27; on his &quot;White Satin&quot; album and Alicia Keys&#x27;s &#x27;Remixed &amp; Unplugged&#x27; version of her &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; album.

Depeche Mode released a version of the piece, performed by Alan Wilder, as a B-side on their 1988 single &quot;Little 15&quot;. The Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; is based upon the chord progression of Moonlight Sonata played in reverse.

Psychedelic rock band Vanilla Fudge covered the piece (along with Fur Elise) that is part of &quot;Phase Two&quot; on their 1968 album, &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;.

In July 1975, Dmitri Shostakovich quoted the sonata&#x27;s first movement in his Viola Sonata, op. 147, his last composition. The third movement, where the quotation takes fragmentary form, is actually called an &quot;Adagio in memory of Beethoven&quot;.

<text>Pimlico () is an area of Central London in the City of Westminster, built as a southern extension to neighbouring Belgravia. It is known for its garden squares and distinctive Regency architecture. Pimlico is demarcated to the north by Victoria Station, by the River Thames to the south, Vauxhall Bridge Road to the east and the former Grosvenor Canal to the west. At its heart is a grid of residential streets laid down by the planner Thomas Cubitt, beginning in 1825 and now protected as the Pimlico Conservation Area. The most prestigious are those on garden squares, with buildings decreasing in grandeur away from St George&#x27;s Square, Warwick Square, Eccleston Square and the main thoroughfares of Belgrave Road and St. George&#x27;s Drive. 

Additions have included the pre–World War II Dolphin Square and the Churchill Gardens and Lillington and Longmoore Gardens estates, now conservation areas in their own right. The area has over 350 Grade II listed buildings and several Grade II* listed churches. At the western edge of Pimlico, on the borders of Chelsea, Pimlico Road has in recent years seen a loss of traditional local retail, replaced by upscale interiors and design stores.

==History==
===Early history and origin of name===

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Manor of Ebury was divided up and leased by the Crown to servants or favourites. In 1623, James I sold the freehold of Ebury for £1,151 and 15 shillings. The land was sold on several more times, until it came into the hands of heiress Mary Davies in 1666.

Mary&#x27;s dowry not only included &quot;The Five Fields&quot; of modern-day Pimlico and Belgravia, but also most of what is now Mayfair and Knightsbridge. Understandably, she was much pursued but in 1677, at the age of twelve, married Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet. The Grosvenors were a family of Norman descent long seated at Eaton Hall in Cheshire who, until this auspicious marriage, were of but local consequence in their native county of Cheshire. Through the development and good management of this land the Grosvenors acquired enormous wealth.

At some point in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, the area ceased to be known as Ebury or &quot;The Five Fields&quot; and gained the name by which it is now known. While its origins are disputed, it is &quot;clearly of foreign derivation... [William] Gifford, in a note in his edition of Ben Jonson, tells us that &#x27;Pimlico is sometimes spoken of as a person, and may not improbably have been the master of a house once famous for ale of a particular description&#x27;.&quot; Supporting this etymology, E. Cobham Brewer describes the area as &quot;a district of public gardens much frequented on holidays. According to tradition, it received its name from Ben Pimlico, famous for his nut-brown ale. His tea-gardens, however, were near Hoxton, and the road to them was termed Pimlico Path, so that what is now called Pimlico was so named from the popularity of the Hoxton resort&quot;.

H. G. Wells, in his novel &quot;The Dream&quot;, says that there was a wharf at Pimlico where ships from America docked and that the word Pimlico came with the trade and was the last word left alive of the Algonquin Indian language (Pamlico).

===Development and decline===

By the 19th century, and as a result of an increase in demand for property in the previously unfashionable West End of London following the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London, Pimlico had become ripe for development. In 1825, Thomas Cubitt was contracted by Lord Grosvenor to develop Pimlico. The land up to this time had been marshy but was reclaimed using soil excavated during the construction of St Katharine Docks.

Cubitt developed Pimlico as a grid of handsome white stucco terraces. The largest and most opulent houses were built along St George&#x27;s Drive and Belgrave Road, the two principal streets, and Eccleston, Warwick and St George&#x27;s Squares. Lupus Street contained similarly grand houses, as well as shops and, until the early twentieth century, a hospital for women and children. Smaller-scale properties, typically of three storeys, line the side streets.

An 1877 newspaper article described Pimlico as &quot;genteel, sacred to professional men… not rich enough to luxuriate in Belgravia proper, but rich enough to live in private houses.&quot; Its inhabitants were &quot;more lively than in Kensington… and yet a cut above Chelsea, which is only commercial.&quot;

Although the area was dominated by the well-to-do middle and upper-middle classes as late as Booth&#x27;s 1889 Map of London Poverty, parts of Pimlico are said to have declined significantly by the 1890s. When Rev Gerald Olivier moved to the neighbourhood in 1912 with his family, including the young Laurence Olivier, to minister to the parishioners of St Saviour, it was part of a venture to west London &quot;slums&quot; that had previously taken the family to the depths of Notting Hill.

In 1908, G. K. Chesterton described Pimlico as &quot;a desperate thing&quot; in his philosophical treatise &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;.

Through the late nineteenth century, Pimlico saw the construction of several Peabody Estates, charitable housing projects designed to provide affordable, quality homes.

===Twentieth-century resurgence===

Proximity to the Houses of Parliament made Pimlico a centre of political activity. Prior to 1928, the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress shared offices at 33 Eccleston Square, and it was here in 1926 that the general strike was organised.

In the mid-1930s Pimlico saw a second wave of development with the construction of Dolphin Square, a self-contained &quot;city&quot; of 1,250 up-market flats built on the site formerly occupied by Cubitt&#x27;s building works. Completed in 1937, it quickly became popular with MPs and public servants. It was home to fascist Oswald Mosley until his arrest in 1940, and the headquarters of the Free French for much of the Second World War.

Pimlico survived the war with its essential character intact, although parts sustained significant bomb damage. Through the 1950s these areas were the focus of large-scale redevelopment as the Churchill Gardens and Lillington and Longmoore Gardens estates, and many of the larger Victorian houses were converted to hotels and other uses.

To provide affordable and efficient heating to the residents of the new post-war developments, Pimlico became one of the few places in the UK to have a district heating system installed. District heating became popular after World War II to heat the large residential estates that replaced areas devastated by the Blitz. The Pimlico District Heating Undertaking (PDHU) is just north of the River Thames. The PDHU first became operational in 1950 and continues to expand to this day. The PDHU once relied on waste heat from the now-disused Battersea Power Station on the south side of the River Thames. It is still in operation, the water now being heated locally by a new energy centre which incorporates 3.1 MWe /4.0 MWTh of gas-fired CHP engines and 3 × 8 MW gas-fired boilers.

In 1953, the Second Duke of Westminster sold the part of the Grosvenor estate on which Pimlico is built.

In 1970, whilst Roger Byron-Collins was a partner in Mullett Booker Estate Agents in Albion Street on the Hyde Park Estate, he sold the entire 27 acre freehold Pimlico Estate for £4.4 million to Jack Dellal of Dalton Barton Bank in a JV with Peter Crane of City and Municipal Properties, being a consortium controlled by the Hanson Trust. He was introduced to the owners of the Estate by the Hon Brian Alexander, son of Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis, who at that time represented Previews International, a part of Coldwell Banker. Brian Alexander&#x27;s friend, Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, owner of Mustique island in the Caribbean was friends with Henry Cubitt, Baron Ashcombe the chairman of the builders, Holland, Hannen and Cubbits who developed the estate comprising 480 homes in the 19th Century and were major shareholders in partnership with Harry Reynolds of Reynolds Engineering of then owners CR Developments. Brian Alexander after leaving Previews International, eventually became MD of the Mustique Company for many decades..

Pimlico was connected to the London Underground in 1972 as a late addition to the Victoria line. Following the designation of a conservation area in 1968 (extended in 1973 and again in 1990), the area has seen extensive regeneration. Successive waves of development have given Pimlico an interesting social mix, combining exclusive restaurants and residences with Westminster City Council-run facilities.

== Notable buildings ==
Dolphin Square is a block of private apartments built between 1935 and 1937. At the time of their construction the development was billed as the largest self-contained block of flats in Europe. It is home to many Members of Parliament (MPs).

Churchill Gardens is a large housing estate covering the south-west corner of Pimlico. It was developed between 1946 and 1962 to a design by the architects Powell and Moya, replacing docks, industrial works, and several Cubitt terraces damaged in the Blitz.

On Buckingham Palace Road is the former &quot;Empire Terminal&quot; of Imperial Airways, a striking Art Moderne building designed in 1938 by architect Albert Lakeman. Mail, freight and passengers were transported from the terminal to Southampton via rail before transferring to flying boats. The building now serves as the headquarters of the National Audit Office.

The area contains a number of Anglican churches, most constructed at the time the neighbourhood was laid out. Among them are St Gabriel&#x27;s (of which a former Vicar is now Archdeacon of Chichester), St Saviour and St James the Less. From its founding St Peter&#x27;s, Eaton Square, Belgravia was usually recorded as St Peter&#x27;s, Pimlico (at least prior to 1878). The area&#x27;s Catholic church, Holy Apostles, was destroyed in the Blitz and rebuilt in 1957. The headquarters of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales are located in Eccleston Square.

Tate Britain is located within the ward of Millbank, but is a short walk from Pimlico Underground station and is regarded as a Pimlico landmark. The district&#x27;s association with fine art has been reinforced by the Chelsea College of Art and Design&#x27;s recent move to the former Royal Army Medical College next to the Tate.

Pimlico School, a comprehensive built between 1967 and 1970, was a notable example of Brutalist architecture. It was demolished in 2010.

==In the arts==
Pimlico is the setting of the 1940 version of &quot;Gaslight&quot;.

Post World War II, Pimlico was the setting of the 1949 Ealing comedy &quot;Passport To Pimlico&quot;.

In G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, Pimlico is used as an example of &quot;a desperate thing.&quot; Arguing that things are not loved because they are great but become great because they are loved, he asserts that if merely approved of, Pimlico &quot;will remain Pimlico, which would be awful,&quot; but if &quot;loved with a transcendental tie and without any earthly reason&quot; it &quot;in a year or two might be fairer than Florence.&quot;

Barbara Pym used St Gabriel&#x27;s Church as her inspiration for St Mary&#x27;s in &quot;Excellent Women&quot;.

The area is the home of Francis Urquhart in Michael Dobbs&#x27;s 1989 novel, &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

While still only partially built, the area is the abode of a criminal gang in Charles Palliser&#x27;s 1989 novel, &quot;The Quincunx&quot;. They live in &#x27;carcasses&#x27;, part-built houses on which work has ceased owing to the drying-up of funds, due in turn to an involved conspiracy central to the book&#x27;s convoluted plot.

Alexander McCall Smith&#x27;s on-line &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; serial novel &quot;Corduroy Mansions&quot; is set in Pimlico.

==Education==
==Transport==
Pimlico is served by Pimlico station on the Victoria line and Victoria station on the Victoria, District and Circle lines. It is also served by National Rail services to London Victoria Station.
Bus routes that run centrally through Pimlico are the 24, 360 and the C10. Many more buses run along Vauxhall Bridge Road (Pimlico&#x27;s eastern boundary).
Riverboat services to Waterloo and Southwark run from Millbank Millennium Pier.

The area has a dozen docking stations for the Santander Cycles scheme.

Pimlico would be connected at Victoria to the proposed Chelsea-Hackney line (Crossrail 2). Plans under consideration for the redevelopment of Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station include a pedestrian bridge stretching across the river from St George&#x27;s Square; in 2015, Wandsworth council awarded Bystrup and partners the design for the £40m bridge, with spiral ramps preserving parks at both ends.

==Governance==
The area is represented on Westminster City Council by the wards of Pimlico North and Pimlico South. These all form part of the Cities of London and Westminster parliamentary constituency, currently represented by MP Nickie Aiken, a Conservative. Of the six local councillors, three are Labour and three are Conservative. Pimlico is part of the West Central constituency on the London Assembly, which is represented by James Small-Edwards AM.

<text>Encyclopedia Americana is a general encyclopedia written in American English. It was the first general encyclopedia of any magnitude to be published in North America. With &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopedia Americana&quot; became one of the three major and large English-language general encyclopedias; the three were sometimes collectively called &quot;the ABCs of encyclopedias&quot;. Following the acquisition of Grolier in 2000, the encyclopedia has been produced by Scholastic.

The encyclopedia has more than 45,000 articles, most of them more than 500 words and many running to considerable length (the &quot;United States&quot; article is over 300,000 words). &quot;Americana&quot; is international in scope and is known for its detailed coverage of American and Canadian geography and history. &quot;Americana&quot; is also known for its strong coverage of biographies, as well as scientific and technical subjects. Written by 6,500 contributors, the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; includes over 9,000 bibliographies, 150,000 cross-references, 1,000+ tables, 1,200 maps, and almost 4,500 black-and-white line art and color images. It also has 680 fact boxes. Major articles are signed by their contributors, many being scholars pre-eminent in their field.

Long available as a 30-volume print set, the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; is now marketed as an online encyclopedia requiring a subscription. In March 2008, Scholastic said that print sales remained good but that the company was still deciding on the future of the print edition. The company&#x27;s final print edition was released in 2006.

The online version of the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;, first introduced in 1996, continues to be updated and sold. This work, like the print set from which it is derived, is designed for high school and first-year college students along with public library users. It is available to libraries as one of the databases in the Scholastic GO! reference service (previously known as Grolier Online), which also includes the &quot;Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia&quot;, an encyclopedia for middle and high school students, &quot;The New Book of Knowledge&quot;, an encyclopedia for ages 7-14 and particularly grades 3-6, America the Beautiful, Lands and Peoples, Amazing Animals of the World, and The New Book of Popular Science. According to The New York Public Library, Scholastic GO! also includes the La Nueva Enciclopedia Cumbre, a Spanish-language general encyclopedia for students in middle through high school. However, the previously mentioned Scholastic blog does not show that. It is possible that La Nueva Enciclopedia Cumbre is only included in the Spanish version of Scholastic GO!, though the existense of that in itself is unsure due to the same New York Public Library link saying that the language of Scholastic GO! is English. Scholastic GO! is not available to individual subscribers.

== History and predecessors ==

There have been three separate works using the title &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;.

The first work began publication in 1829 by Francis Lieber, an influential 19th century German-American scholar. The 13 volumes of the first edition were completed in 1833, and other editions and printings followed in 1835, 1836, 1847–1848, 1849 and 1858. According to one contemporary source, the original price in 1832, at which time several volumes had been issued, was to be $2.50 per volume for 12 volumes, or $30 in total. At first, Lieber planned only an English-language translation of the 7th edition of the popular German encyclopedia Konversations-Lexikon, familiarly known as Brockhaus after its publisher Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus. However, as work on the new encyclopedia progressed, Lieber sought and added original articles by leading U.S. writers and intellectuals of the day. United States Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, for instance, contributed more than 120 pages of legal material to the 1st edition. Hence, when the Americana began appearing some 165 years ago, it represented a hybrid of 2 cultures, German and American.

A second &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; was published by J.M. Stoddart between 1883 and 1889, as a supplement to American reprintings of the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. It was four quarto volumes meant to &quot;extend and complete the articles in &quot;Britannica&quot;&quot;. Stoddart&#x27;s work, however, is not connected to the earlier work by Lieber.

In 1902, a new, 16-volume &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; was published under the editorial supervision of &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine. The magazine&#x27;s editor, Frederick Converse Beach, was editor-in-chief, assisted by hundreds of eminent scholars and authorities as consulting editors and article authors. Beach also expanded the encyclopedia&#x27;s coverage, especially in the area of the physical and life sciences. George Edwin Rines was appointed managing editor in 1903. Between 1903 and 1906 the publisher was R.S. Peale &amp; Co. From 1906 through 1936, &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; was published by the Americana Corporation, with the editorial support of &quot;Scientific American&quot;. The relationship with &quot;Scientific American&quot; was terminated in 1911. From 1907 to 1912, the encyclopedia was published as &quot;The Americana&quot;.

In 1918–20, the Americana Corporation published a new, International, 30-volume edition, with George Edwin Rines continuing as editor-in-chief. It was the last entirely new edition of the encyclopedia. A yearbook, which appeared under a variety of titles, was also published each year beginning in 1923 and continuing until 2008.

In 1936, the Americana Corporation was purchased by The Grolier Society, later renamed Grolier Incorporated. The Americana Corporation&#x27;s president, J. Cooper Graham, became a vice president of Grolier. By the late1960s, Grolier&#x27;s annual sales of &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; &quot;Americana&quot; and its sister publications under Grolier—&quot;The Book of Knowledge&quot;, the &quot;American Peoples Encyclopedia&quot;, the &quot;Book of Popular Science&quot;, and &quot;Lands and Peoples&quot; were over $181 million, and the company held a 30 percent market share as the leading publisher of encyclopedias in the United States. Grolier&#x27;s corporate headquarters were in a large building (variously named the Americana Building and the Grolier Building) in Midtown Manhattan, at 575 Lexington Avenue. Sales during this period were accomplished primarily through mail-order and door-to-door operations. Telemarketing and third-party distribution of &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; through Grolier&#x27;s Lexicon Publications subsidiary added to sales volumes in the 1970s. By the late 1970s, Grolier had moved its operations to Danbury, Connecticut.

== Later developments ==
In 1988, Grolier was purchased by the French media company Hachette, which owned a well-known French-language encyclopedia, the &quot;Hachette Encyclopedia&quot;. Hachette was later absorbed by the French conglomerate the Lagardère Group.

A CD-ROM version of the encyclopedia was published in 1995. Although the text and images were stored on separate disks, it was in keeping with the standards current at the time. More importantly, the work had been digitized, allowing for the release of an online version in 1997. Over the next few years, the product was augmented with additional features, functions, supplementary references, Internet links, and a current events journal. A redesigned interface and partly re-engineered product, featuring enhanced search capabilities and a first-ever ADA-compliant, text-only version for users with disabilities, was presented in 2002.

The acquisition of Grolier by Scholastic for US$400 million, took place in 2000. The new owners projected a 30% increase in operating income, although historically Grolier had experienced earnings of 7% to 8% on income. Following the acquisition, &quot;Americana&quot; became part of a suite of educational resources, with those resources including The New Book of Knowledge, The New Book of Popular Science, America the Beautiful, Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia, Amazing Animals of the World, and Lands and People. All of those resources formed Grolier Online (now called Scholastic GO!). According to The New York Public Library, Scholastic GO! also includes the La Nueva Enciclopedia Cumbre, a Spanish-language general encyclopedia for students in middle through high school. However, the previously mentioned Scholastic blog does not show that. It is possible that La Nueva Enciclopedia Cumbre is only included in the Spanish version of Scholastic GO!, though the existense of that in itself is unsure due to the same New York Public Library link saying that the language of Scholastic GO! is English. Staff reductions as a means of controlling costs also followed soon thereafter, even while an effort was made to augment the sales force. Cuts occurred every year between 2000 and 2007, leaving a much-depleted workforce to carry out the duties of maintaining a large encyclopedia database.

In 2004, Scholastic stated that &quot;Americana&quot;&#x27;s 2,500 online articles are being revised annually. Today, &quot;Americana&quot; lives on as an integral database within the Scholastic GO! product.

<doc id="149612" wikidata="Q407617" url="?curid=149612" title="Sertraline">
<text>Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although also having approval for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), findings indicate it leads to only modest improvements in symptoms associated with this condition.
The drug shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, mild sedation, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old. It should not be used together with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.
Sertraline was developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines and available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States. It was also the eleventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 39million prescriptions in 2022, and sertraline ranks among the top 10 most prescribed medications in Australia between 2017 and 2023. 

For alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety, the drug is usually second in potency to another SSRI, escitalopram. Sertraline&#x27;s effectiveness is similar to that of other antidepressants in its class, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are also considered first-line treatments and are better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. 

==Medical uses==
Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD.

===Depression===
In meta-analyses, sertraline displays similar efficacy to other SSRI antidepressants, with an odds ratio for response in clinical depression of between 1.44 and 1.67. However, as with other antidepressants, the nature and clinical significance of this effect remain disputed. A major study of sertraline in a broad primary care population found improvements in general mental health, quality of life, and anxiety. However, it failed to find significant effects on depression in either the mildly or severely depressed, and the clinical relevance and accuracy of the positive effects found have been questioned.

In several double-blind studies, sertraline was consistently more effective than placebo for dysthymia, a more chronic variety of depression, and comparable to imipramine in that respect. Sertraline also improves the functional impairments of dysthymia to a similar degree whether group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is undergone or not.

Limited pediatric data also demonstrates a reduction in depressive symptoms in the pediatric population though remains a second-line therapy after fluoxetine.

====Comparison with other antidepressants====
In general, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other antidepressants. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram are the best in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Comparative clinical trials demonstrated that sertraline is similar in efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Sertraline may be more efficacious for the treatment of depression in the acute phase (first four weeks) than fluoxetine.

There are differences between sertraline and some other antidepressants in their efficacy in the treatment of different subtypes of depression and in their adverse effects. For severe depression, sertraline is as good as clomipramine but is better tolerated. Sertraline appears to work better in melancholic depression than fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin and is similar to the tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. In the treatment of depression accompanied by OCD, sertraline performs significantly better than desipramine on the measures of both OCD and depression. Sertraline is equivalent to imipramine for the treatment of depression with co-morbid panic disorder, but it is better tolerated. Compared with amitriptyline, sertraline offered a greater overall improvement in quality of life of depressed patients.

====Depression in elderly====
Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients is superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine. Sertraline has much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurs more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appears to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of antidepressants in older adults found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. However, in a 2003 trial the effect size was modest, and there was no improvement in quality of life as compared to placebo. With depression in dementia, there is no benefit of sertraline treatment compared to either placebo or mirtazapine.

===Obsessive–compulsive disorder===
Sertraline is effective for the treatment of OCD in adults, adolescents and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention-to-treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. Continuing sertraline treatment helps prevent relapses of OCD with long-term data supporting its use for up to 24 months. The sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression. The treatment recommendation is to start treatment with half of the maximal recommended dose for at least two months. After that, the dose can be raised to the maximal recommended in the cases of unsatisfactory response.

Cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not more effective than sertraline in adolescents and children; however, a combination of these treatments is effective.

===Panic disorder===
Sertraline is superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in an improvement in quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as &quot;improved&quot; on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who &quot;improved&quot; on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with a placebo. Sertraline is equally effective for men and women, and for patients with or without agoraphobia. Previous unsuccessful treatment with benzodiazepines does not diminish its efficacy. However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic. Starting treatment simultaneously with sertraline and clonazepam, with subsequent gradual discontinuation of clonazepam, may accelerate the response.

Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as paroxetine or imipramine. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, and fluvoxamine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.

===Other anxiety disorders===
Sertraline has been successfully used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. All three major domains of the disorder (fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms) respond to sertraline. Maintenance treatment, after the response is achieved, prevents the return of the symptoms. The improvement is greater among the patients with later, adult onset of the disorder. In a comparison trial, sertraline was superior to exposure therapy, but patients treated with the psychological intervention continued to improve during a year-long follow-up, while those treated with sertraline deteriorated after treatment termination. The combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be more effective in children and young people than either treatment alone.

Sertraline has not been approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; however, several guidelines recommend it as a first-line medication referring to good quality controlled clinical trials.

===Premenstrual dysphoric disorder===
Sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity, and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating, and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14 days before menses is not as effective as continuous treatment. Continuous treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of sertraline (25 mg vs. usual 50–100 mg) is also effective.

===Other indications===
Sertraline is approved for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends it for patients who prefer drug treatment to a psychological one. Other guidelines also suggest sertraline as a first-line option for pharmacological therapy. When necessary, long-term pharmacotherapy can be beneficial. There are both negative and positive clinical trial results for sertraline, which may be explained by the types of psychological traumas, symptoms, and comorbidities included in the various studies. Positive results were obtained in trials that included predominantly women (75%) with a majority (60%) having physical or sexual assault as the traumatic event. Somewhat contrary to the above suggestions, a meta-analysis of sertraline clinical trials for PTSD found it to be statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small. Another meta-analysis relegated sertraline to the second line, proposing trauma focused psychotherapy as a first-line intervention. The authors noted that Pfizer had declined to submit the results of a negative trial for inclusion in the meta-analysis making the results unreliable.

Sertraline, when taken daily, can be useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation. A disadvantage of sertraline is that it requires continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly.

A 2019 systematic review suggested that sertraline may be a good way to control anger, irritability, and hostility in depressed patients and patients with other comorbidities.

==Contraindications==
Sertraline is contraindicated in individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide. Sertraline concentrate contains ethanol and is therefore contraindicated with disulfiram. The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment &quot;must be approached with caution&quot;. Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose.

==Side effects==
Nausea, ejaculation failure, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, headache, excessive sweating, fatigue, restless legs syndrome and decreased libido are the common adverse effects associated with sertraline with the greatest difference from placebo. Those that most often result in interruption of the treatment are nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline – especially when prescribed at higher doses – in comparison with other SSRIs.

Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, people showed no significant weight increase. A 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD also resulted in no significant weight gain. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the average weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (1%) but higher for citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group.

Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency but did not affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance in a group of people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5 years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20 measures of memory, attention, and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance.

Sertraline has a low level of exposure of an infant through the breast milk and is recommended as the preferred option for the antidepressant therapy of breast-feeding mothers. There is 29–42% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed sertraline during pregnancy, with sertraline use in the first trimester associated with 2.7-fold increase in septal heart defects.

Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome. Dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and irritability are common symptoms. It typically occurs within a few days from drug discontinuation and lasts a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms for sertraline are less severe and frequent than for paroxetine, and more frequent than for fluoxetine. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering-off rate.

Sertraline and SSRI antidepressants in general may be associated with bruxism and other movement disorders. Sertraline appears to be associated with microscopic colitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology.

===Sexual===
Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm. While nefazodone and bupropion do not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties versus 18% before the treatment. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as &quot;inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men&quot;, occurred in 12% of people on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved. Some people continue experiencing sexual side effects after they stop taking SSRIs.

=== Suicide ===
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 100% increase of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 50% increase in the 18–24 age group.

Suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance of 37% or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that &quot;given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference&quot;. The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.

==Overdose==
Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low.

==Interactions==
As with other SSRIs, sertraline may increase the risk of bleeding with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to sertraline&#x27;s inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Sertraline, in particular, may potentially diminish the efficacy of levothyroxine.

Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 &quot;in vitro&quot;. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased blood levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, as well as the CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent; for example, co-administration with 50 mg of sertraline resulted in 20% greater exposure to desipramine, while 150 mg of sertraline led to a 70% increase. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6, which is inhibited by sertraline, and this may result in an interaction between sertraline and bupropion.

Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide, and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; the clinical relevance of this effect was unclear. As expected from &quot;in vitro&quot; data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine.

Sertraline did not affect the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking sertraline with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.

CYP2C19 inhibitor esomeprazole increased sertraline concentrations in blood plasma by approximately 40%.

Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). By binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) it inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. It does not significantly affect histamine, acetylcholine, GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.

Sertraline also shows relatively high activity as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT) occupying ~20% of DAT receptors at doses 200mg and above, and antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, sertraline affinity for its main target (SERT) is much greater than its affinity for σ1 receptor and DAT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear. Similarly, the clinical relevance of sertraline&#x27;s blockade of the dopamine transporter is uncertain.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
Following a single oral dose of sertraline, mean peak blood levels of sertraline occur between 4.5 and 8.4 hours. Bioavailability is likely linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 150 to 200 mg. Concomitant intake of sertraline with food slightly increases sertraline peak levels and total exposure. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of sertraline with continuous administration and steady-state levels are reached within one week.

====Distribution====
Sertraline is highly plasma protein bound (98.5%) across a concentration range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. Despite the high plasma protein binding, sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline at respective tested concentrations of 300 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL were found not to interfere with the plasma protein binding of warfarin and propranolol, two other highly plasma protein-bound drugs.

====Metabolism====
Sertraline is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, as indicated by a small study of radiolabeled sertraline in which less than 5% of plasma radioactivity was unchanged sertraline in two males. The principal metabolic pathway for sertraline is &quot;N&quot;-demethylation into desmethylsertraline (&quot;N&quot;-desmethylsertraline) mainly by CYP2B6. Reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation of both sertraline and desmethylsertraline also occur. Desmethylsertraline, while pharmacologically active, is substantially (50-fold) weaker than sertraline as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its influence on the clinical effects of sertraline is thought to be negligible. Based on &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms; however, it appears that in the human body CYP2C19 plays the most important role, followed by CYP2B6. In addition to the cytochrome P450 system, sertraline can be oxidatively deaminated &quot;in vitro&quot; by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied &quot;in vivo&quot;.

====Elimination====
The elimination half-life of sertraline is on average 26 hours, with a range of 13 to 45 hours. The elimination half-life of desmethylsertraline is 62 to 104 hours.

In a small study of two males, sertraline was excreted to similar degrees in urine and feces (40 to 45% each within 9 days). Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in urine, whereas 12 to 14% of unchanged sertraline was present in feces.

===Pharmacogenomics===
CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 are thought to be the key cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of sertraline. Relative to CYP2C19 normal (extensive) metabolizers, poor metabolizers have 2.7-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher levels. In contrast, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers have 1.6-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.2-fold higher levels.

==History==
The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds, including lometraline, based on the structures of the neuroleptics thiothixene and pinoxepin. Further work on these compounds led to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated several potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested &quot;in vivo&quot; by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not &quot;very goal driven&quot;, and the invention of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even &quot;did not have a formal project team&quot;. The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.

Sertraline was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of major depression. During the discussion, Paul Leber, the director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a &quot;tough decision&quot;, since the treatment effect on outpatients with depression had been &quot;modest to minimal&quot;. Other experts emphasized that the drug&#x27;s effect on inpatients had not differed from placebo and criticized the poor design of the clinical trials by Pfizer. For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their validity.

Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD. In 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued guidance that, apart from fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRIs are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18. However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24.

==Society and culture==

===Generic availability===
The US patent for Zoloft expired in 2006, and sertraline is available in generic form and is marketed under many brand names worldwide.

=== Brand names ===
In the US, Zoloft is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

===Interest during COVID-19 pandemic===
Sertraline has been the most sought-after antidepressant worldwide before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Google Trends data. The pandemic has led to an increase in searches for antidepressants, with sertraline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine showing the highest search volumes, whereas searches of citalopram decreased during the pandemic.

==Other uses==
Sertraline may be useful to treat murine Zaire ebolavirus (murine EBOV). The World Health Organization (WHO) considers this a promising area of research.

Lass-Flörl &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003 finds it significantly inhibits phospholipase B in the fungal genus &quot;Candida&quot;, reducing virulence.

Sertraline is also a very effective leishmanicide. Specifically, Palit &amp; Ali 2008 find that sertraline kills almost all promastigotes of &quot;Leishmania donovani&quot;.

Sertraline is strongly antibacterial against some species. It is also known to act as a photosensitizer of bacterial surfaces. In combination with antibacterials its photosensitization effect reverses antibacterial resistance. As such sertraline shows promise for food preservation.

Lass-Flörl &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003 finds this compound acts as a fungicide against &quot;Candida parapsilosis&quot;. Its anti-&quot;Cp&quot; effect is indeed due to its serotonergic activity and not its other effects.

Sertraline is a promising trypanocide. It acts at several different life stages and against several strains. Sertraline&#x27;s trypanocidal mechanism of action is by way of interference with bioenergetics.

<text>Bird Noises is the first extended play by Australian rock group, Midnight Oil, which was released on 24 November 1980 under the band&#x27;s own independent label, Powderworks Records / Sprint Music. It was produced by Leszek Karski and manufactured and distributed by CBS/Columbia. &quot;Bird Noises&quot; reached the Top 30 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.

==Background==
On 24 November 1980, Australian rock music group, Midnight Oil, released their first four-track extended play, &quot;Bird Noises&quot;. At the time Midnight Oil consisted of Peter Garrett on lead vocals and harmonica; Peter Gifford on bass guitar and backing vocals; Rob Hirst on drums and backing vocals; Jim Moginie on lead guitar and keyboards; and Martin Rotsey on lead guitar. It was the first recording by the band to feature Gifford who had replaced the band&#x27;s earlier bass guitarist, Andrew James.

It was produced by former Supercharge band member Leszek Karski for Powderworks Records and Sprint Music label at Music Farm Studios in Byron Bay and distributed internationally by the CBS/Columbia Records. The track, &quot;Wedding Cake Island&quot;, refers to the island of the same name off Coogee Beach, Sydney. In 1990 the EP was re-released, on CD, in the United States by Columbia Records.

==Reception==

&quot;Bird Noises&quot; peaked at No. 28 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;Bird Noises&quot; &quot;continued the development heard on &quot;Head Injuries&quot;, with &#x27;No Time for Games&#x27; and &#x27;I&#x27;m the Cure&#x27; being particularly impressive. &quot;Bird Noises&quot; also boasted the anomalous, but delightful Shadows-like instrumental &#x27;Wedding Cake Island&#x27;&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlman noted the group had tried &quot;some musical variations after two albums of hard rock ... the music in fact was restrained, and the group tried acoustic instruments and a moody instrumental for an intriguing change of pace from their usual style&quot;.

<text>Species Deceases is an extended play by Australian rock band Midnight Oil, released on 26 November 1985 under the CBS record label. &quot;Species Deceases&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart for six weeks from December 1985 to January 1986. It was the first Australian single and/or EP to reach the number-one spot on its chart appearance and remains Midnight Oil&#x27;s only No. 1 on the national singles chart.

==Background==
On 26 November 1985, Australian rock music group, Midnight Oil, released a four-track extended play, &quot;Species Deceases&quot;. At the time Midnight Oil consisted of Peter Garrett on lead vocals and harmonica; Peter Gifford on bass guitar and backing vocals; Rob Hirst on drums and backing vocals; Jim Moginie on lead guitar and keyboards; and Martin Rotsey on lead guitar. It was produced with Francois Kevorkian at Paradise Studios, Darlinghurst for Sprint Music and distributed by the CBS/Columbia label. &quot;Species Deceases&quot; became a big favourite of FM Radio around the world, with all four songs enjoying frequent airplay, sometimes all of them played back-to-back.

According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;Species Deceases&quot;, with the track &quot;Hercules&quot;, featured &quot;a stripped-back pub-rock sound. In terms of sheer sonic firepower, it was one of the band&#x27;s hardest hitting works&quot;.

A line from the song &quot;Blossom and Blood&quot; appeared in the message that got flashed on infected computers by the worm WANK: &quot;You talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war.&quot;

==Trivial Note==
&quot;Species Deceases&quot; was certified platinum on 14 December 1985, two weeks after its release. The following day, and six years after its release, their second album &quot;Head Injuries&quot; was certified gold.

<doc id="149620" wikidata="Q598841" url="?curid=149620" title="Monash University">
<text>Monash University () is a public research university based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Named after World War I general Sir John Monash, it was founded in 1958 and is the second oldest university in the state. The university has a number of campuses, four of which are in Victoria (Clayton, Caulfield, Peninsula, and Parkville), one in Malaysia and another one in Indonesia. Monash also has a research and teaching centre in Prato, Italy, a graduate research school in Mumbai, India and graduate schools in Suzhou, China and Tangerang, Indonesia. Courses are also delivered at other locations, including South Africa.

Monash is home to major research facilities, including the Monash Law School, the Australian Synchrotron, the Monash Science Technology Research and Innovation Precinct (STRIP), the Australian Stem Cell Centre, Victorian College of Pharmacy, and 100 research centres and 17 co-operative research centres. In 2019, its total revenue was over $2.72 billion (AUD), with external research income around $462 million. In 2019, Monash enrolled over 55,000 undergraduate and over 25,000 graduate students. It has more applicants than any other university in the state of Victoria.

Monash is a member of Australia&#x27;s Group of Eight research universities, a member of the ASAIHL, and is the only Australian member of the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies. Monash is one of the Australian universities to be ranked in the École des Mines de Paris (Mines ParisTech) ranking on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies.

==History==


===Early history: 1950s===
Established by an Act of Parliament in 1958, the original campus was in the suburb of Clayton where the university was granted an expansive site of 100 hectares of open land. The 100 hectares of land consisted of farmland and included the former Talbot Epileptic Colony. The Tudor-style farmhouse built by the O&#x27;Shea family became the original Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s House - now University House.

From its first intake of 357 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967 its all-times enrollment reached 21,000 students. In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics, politics, education, and law. It was a major provider for international student places under the Colombo Plan, which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.

The university was named after the prominent Australian general Sir John Monash. This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city or state.

===1970s onwards===
From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of student radicalism in Australia. It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia&#x27;s role in Vietnam War and conscription. By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins. In one extraordinary event that came to be known as the Monash Siege, students forced then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to hide in a basement at the Alexander Theatre, in a major protest over the Whitlam dismissal.
In the late 1970s and 1980s, some of Monash&#x27;s most publicised research came through its pioneering of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Led by Carl Wood and Alan Trounson, the Monash IVF Program achieved the world&#x27;s first clinical IVF pregnancy in 1973. In 1980, they delivered the first IVF baby in Australia. This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the university at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down.

In the late 1980s, the Dawkins Reforms changed the landscape of higher education in Australia. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Mal Logan, Monash transformed dramatically. In 1988, Monash University had only one campus in Clayton, with around 15,000 students. Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.

===Expansion in the 1990s===
Expansion of the university began in 1990 with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. In 1991 a merger with the Victorian College of Pharmacy created a new faculty of the university. This continued in 1994, with the establishment of the Berwick campus.

In 1998, the university opened the Malaysia campus, its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in Malaysia. In 2001, Monash South Africa opened its doors in Johannesburg, making Monash the first foreign university in South Africa. The same year, the university secured an 18th-century Tuscan palace to open a research and teaching centre in Prato, Italy.

At the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most. Today, around 30% of its students are from outside Australia. Monash students come from over 100 countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with the university&#x27;s expansion, meant that Monash&#x27;s income greatly increased throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia&#x27;s top 200 exporters.

===2000 onwards===

In recent years, the university has been prominent in medical research. A highlight of this came in 2000, when Alan Trounson led the team of scientists which announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of stem cells. It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine.

On 21 October 2002 Huan Yun &quot;Allen&quot; Xiang, shot two people dead and injured five others on the Clayton campus.

Since December 2011, Monash has had a global alliance with the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.

In 2014, the university ceded its Gippsland campus to Federation University. On 15 July 2016, Monash confirmed that Federation University Australia would take over the operations of the Berwick campus prior to the end of 2018.

In 2019, the university sold its Monash South Africa campus to Advtech. Students who were on schedule to complete their degree on time would still receive a degree from Monash University after the sale. The reason for the sale was reported low profitability and enrollment numbers. Prior to the sale, Monash University had sidelined the South African campus on its official websites and did not refer to it as a &#x27;campus&#x27; unlike Monash Malaysia.

Monash announced its second Southeast Asian expansion in Indonesia as it officially obtained its operational license from the Ministry of Education and Culture on 1 December 2020. The university plans to open its campus doors in October 2021, located in BSD City, Tangerang, Banten. Unlike Monash Malaysia, Monash Indonesia will focus on graduate studies.

==Campuses and buildings==
===Australia===
====Clayton====
The Clayton campus covers an area over 1.1 km2 and is the largest of the Monash campuses. Clayton is the flagship campus for Monash, demanding higher ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) scores than all the other campuses, with the exception of Parkville. Clayton is home to the faculties of Arts, Business &amp; Economics, Education, Engineering, IT, Law, Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Pharmaceutical Science and Science. The Clayton campus has its own suburb and postcode (3800).

Various major scientific research facilities are located on or adjacent to the campus. Chief among these are the Australian Synchrotron and CSIRO.

The campus is also home to numerous restaurants and retail outlets, as well as student bars Sir John&#x27;s (located in the Campus Centre) and the Notting Hill Hotel (located down the street, founded in 1891), both of which are hubs of social life on the campus.

The campus is also home to a number of halls of residence, colleges and other on-campus accommodation that house several thousand students. Six halls of residence are located at the Clayton campus in Clayton, Victoria. There is an additional private residential college affiliated with the university.

===Former campuses===

====Gippsland====
As part of the university&#x27;s expansion in the 1990s, Monash took over the operations of the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education in 1990. 

The Gippsland campus provided courses via distance education. However, between 2005 and 2010, many of these programs were transferred to city campuses, thus losing their appeal to regional areas. At its peak enrolment in 2007, the campus was home to 2,000 on-campus students, 5,000 off-campus students and nearly 400 staff. The campus was located in the Latrobe Valley town of Churchill. Until 2014 it was the only non-metropolitan campus of Monash University. 

The Gippsland campus had on-campus accommodation including the self-catering West House and East House.

Ballarat University joined with Monash University&#x27;s Gippsland campus to form a new regional university known as Federation University Australia from 1 January 2014, so this campus is no longer part of Monash.

====Berwick====
The former Berwick campus of Monash University was built on the old Casey airfield in the south-eastern growth corridor of Victoria, Australia. The town of Berwick has experienced an influx of people and development in recent times, which includes the new campus of Monash University. With a presence in the area since 1994, the first Monash Berwick campus building was completed in 1996 and the third building in March 2004. It was situated on a 55-hectare site in the City of Casey, then one of the three fastest growing municipalities in Australia. Monash announced the closure of this campus to staff and students on 7 March 2016. On 15 July 2016 it was announced that Federation University Australia would take responsibility for the Berwick Campus from 2017 pending government approvals. This officially commenced on 1 January 2018, as a campus of Federation University Australia.

====South Africa====
In August 2013, Monash University entered a partnership with Laureate International Universities to establish a campus in South Africa. This effort was short-lived, and Monash elected to transfer ownership of the campus to the Independent Institute of Education (IIE) South Africa in 2015. The transfer was concluded in 2019.

==Governance and structure==
===Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor===
The vice-chancellor is the chief executive of the university, who is head of Monash&#x27;s day-to-day activities. The vice-chancellor is also the university president of Monash.

The Monash University Museum of Art (MUMA), since 2010 based on the Caulfield Campus, is the result of an initiative started in 1961, when the inaugural Vice Chancellor Louis Matheson created a fund for the purchase of artworks by then living Australian artists. The establishment of the museum reflected a desire by the university&#x27;s founders to create the modern Australian university, and to enrich the cultural life of students, staff and visitors.

In 1975, the Monash University Gallery was created in the Menzies Building, moving in 1987 to the Multi-Discipline Centre (later called the Gallery Building).

Its collection had grown to over 1500 works by 2008, including artworks by Arthur Boyd, William Dobell, Sidney Nolan, Howard Arkley, Tracey Moffatt, John Perceval, Fred Williams and Bill Henson. While the gallery&#x27;s focus is on contemporary Australian art, it houses a number of international works and exhibitions. It hosts regular exhibitions which are open to Monash students and staff, as well as the general public.
