<text>Richmond Park, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, is the largest of London&#x27;s Royal Parks and is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation. It was created by Charles I in the 17th century as a deer park. It is now a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation and is included, at Grade I, on Historic England&#x27;s Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Its landscapes have inspired many famous artists and it has been a location for several films and TV series.


Richmond Park includes many buildings of architectural or historic interest. The Grade I-listed White Lodge was formerly a royal residence and is now home to the Royal Ballet School. The park&#x27;s boundary walls and ten other buildings are listed at Grade II, including Pembroke Lodge, the home of 19th-century British Prime Minister Lord John Russell and his grandson, the philosopher Bertrand Russell. In 2020, Historic England also listed two other features in the park – King Henry&#x27;s Mound which is possibly a round barrow and another (unnamed) mound which could be a long barrow.

Historically the preserve of the monarch, the park is now open for all to use and includes a golf course and other facilities for sport and recreation. It played an important role in both world wars and in the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics.
==Overview==

===Size===
Richmond Park is the largest of London&#x27;s Royal Parks. It is the second-largest park in London (after the Lee Valley Park, whose linear shaped area extends beyond the M25 into Hertfordshire and Essex) and is Britain&#x27;s second-largest urban walled park after Sutton Park, Birmingham.
===Status===
Of national and international importance for wildlife conservation, most of Richmond Park (856 hectares; 2115 acres) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a National Nature Reserve (NNR) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The largest Site of Special Scientific Interest in London, it was designated as an SSSI in 1992, excluding the area of the golf course, Pembroke Lodge Gardens and the Gate Gardens. In its citation, Natural England said: &quot;Richmond Park has been managed as a royal deer park since the seventeenth century, producing a range of habitats of value to wildlife. In particular, Richmond Park is of importance for its diverse deadwood beetle fauna associated with the ancient trees found throughout the parkland. In addition the park supports the most extensive area of dry acid grassland in Greater London.&quot;

The park was designated as an SAC in 2005 because it has &quot;a large number of ancient trees with decaying timber. It is at the heart of the south London centre of distribution for stag beetle &quot;Lucanus cervus&quot;, and is a site of national importance for the conservation of the fauna of invertebrates associated with the decaying timber of ancient trees&quot;.

Since 1987 the park has also been included, at Grade I, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England, being described in Historic England&#x27;s listing as &quot;A royal deer park with pre C15 origins, imparked by Charles I and improved by subsequent monarchs. A public open space since the mid C19&quot;.

===Geography===
Richmond Park is located in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is close to Richmond, Ham, Petersham, Kingston upon Thames, Wimbledon, Roehampton and East Sheen.

==Organisation==

===Governance===

The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport manages Richmond Park and the other Royal Parks of London under powers set out in the Crown Lands Act 1851, which transferred management of the parks from the monarch to the government. Day-to-day management of the Royal Parks has been delegated to The Royal Parks, an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The Royal Parks&#x27; Board sets the strategic direction for the agency. Appointments to the Board are made by the Mayor of London.

The Friends of Richmond Park and the Friends of Bushy Park co-chair the Richmond and Bushy Parks Forum, comprising 38 local groups of local stakeholder organisations. The forum was formed in September 2010 to consider proposals to bring Richmond Park and Bushy Park – and London&#x27;s other royal parks – under the control of the Mayor of London through a new Royal Parks Board and to make a joint response. Although welcoming the principles of the new governance arrangements, the forum (in 2011) and the Friends of Richmond Park (in 2012) expressed concerns about the composition of the new board.

===Access===
Richmond Park is the most visited royal park outside central London, with 4.4 million visits in 2014. The park is enclosed by a high wall with several gates. The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only, or allow bicycle, pedestrian and other vehicle access. The gates for motor vehicle access are open only during daylight hours; the speed limit is . The gates for pedestrians and cyclists are open 24 hours a day except during the deer culls in February and November, when the pedestrian gates are closed between 8:00 pm and 7:30 am. However, since 2020, there has been restricted through traffic in Richmond Park, for example restricted traffic between Richmond Gate and Roehampton Gate at weekends. Apart from taxis, no commercial vehicles are allowed unless they are being used to transact business with residents of the park.

From April to November, a free bus service, calling near Mortlake railway station, runs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, stopping at the main car parks and the gate at Isabella Plantation nearest Peg&#x27;s Pond.
The gates open to motor traffic are: Sheen Gate, Richmond Gate, Ham Gate, Kingston Gate, Roehampton Gate and (for access to Richmond Park Golf Course only) Chohole Gate. 
The park has designated bridleways and cycle paths. These are shown on maps and noticeboards displayed near the main entrances, along with other regulations that govern use of the park. The bridleways are special in that they are for horses (and their riders) only and not open to cyclists, like normal bridleways.

The Beverley Brook Walk runs through the park between Roehampton Gate and Robin Hood Gate. The Capital Ring walking route passes through the park from Robin Hood Gate to Petersham Gate.

Cycling is allowed only on main roads, on National Cycle Route 4 through the centre of the park and on the Tamsin Trail (the shared-use pedestrian–cycle path that runs close to the park&#x27;s perimeter).
National Cycle Route 4 crosses the park between Ham Gate in the west and Roehampton Gate in the east, skirting Pen Ponds and White Lodge. It interlinks with the Thames Cycle Route and forms part of the London Cycle Network. The speed limit on this route through the centre of the park, where it is off the main road, is .

As the park is a national nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading to the death of wildfowl, the park&#x27;s dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and The Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer&#x27;s birthing season.

===Law enforcement===
A mugging at gunpoint in 1854 reputedly led to the establishment of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary, but that was subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half their level ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.

In July 2012 it was reported that police had been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park, and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37 mph in the park. In 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41 mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.

Conservative MP Danny Kruger was fined after his puppy, during a family walk, caused a stampede when it chased a 200-strong herd of deer in the park in March 2021. Kruger apologised and said he would be more careful in future.

===Sport and recreation===
&quot;Cycling&quot;: Cycles are available for hire near Roehampton Gate and, at peak times, near Pembroke Lodge. The Tamsin Trail (shared between pedestrians and cyclists) provides a circuit of the park and is almost entirely car-free.

&quot;Fishing&quot; is allowed, by paid permit, on Pen Ponds from mid-June to mid-March.

&quot;Golf&quot; is played at Richmond Park Golf Course, a public facility opened in 1923 by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII). It has two 18-hole golf courses and practice facilities and is accessed from Chohole Gate.

&quot;Horse riding&quot;: Horses from local stables are ridden in the park.

&quot;Rugby&quot;: A section of the grassland to the north of the Roehampton Gate is maintained and laid out during the winter months for rugby; there are three pitches. At weekends, this area is hired extensively to the rugby union club Rosslyn Park F.C.. Visiting teams are transferred by bus to and from the park pitches from the club&#x27;s nearby clubhouse and changing rooms.

&quot;Running&quot;: The Tamsin Trail is a trail around the park which is popular with runners. Members of Barnes Runners complete at least one circumnavigation of it on the first and third Sunday of every month. Richmond Park Parkrun, a five-kilometre organised run, takes place every Saturday.

There is a children&#x27;s playground at Petersham Gate.

===Friends of Richmond Park===
The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) was founded in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 miles an hour and there were concerns that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park&#x27;s roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in 2004.

In 2011, the Friends successfully campaigned for the withdrawal of plans for open-air screenings of films in the park. In 2012, the Friends contributed towards the cost of a new Jubilee Pond, and launched a public appeal for a Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme in which the Friends, the Richmond Park Wildlife Group and Healthy Planet have been working with staff from The Royal Parks to restore some of the streams and ponds in the park.

The Friends run a visitor centre near Pembroke Lodge, organise a programme of walks and education activities for young people, and produce a quarterly newsletter. The Friends have published two books, &quot;A Guide to Richmond Park&quot; and &quot;Family Trails in Richmond Park&quot;; profits from the books&#x27; sales contribute towards the Friends&#x27; conservation work.

The Friends of Richmond Park has been a charitable organisation since 2009. It has 3,700 members, is run by approximately 300 volunteers and has no staff. Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, former Richmond Park MP Baroness Susan Kramer, broadcaster Clare Balding and radio and TV presenter and former professional tennis player Annabel Croft are patrons of FRP. The chairman, since April 2021, is Roger Hillyer.

==History==

===Stuart origins===
In 1625 Charles I brought his court to Richmond Palace to escape an outbreak of plague in London and turned the area on the hill above Richmond into a park for the hunting of red and fallow deer. It was originally referred to as the king&#x27;s &quot;New Park&quot; to distinguish it from the existing park in Richmond, which is now known as Old Deer Park. In 1637 he appointed Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland as keeper of the new park for life, with a fee of 12 (old) pence a day, pasture for four horses, and the use of the brushwood – later holders of that office were known as &quot;Ranger&quot;. Charles&#x27;s decision, also in 1637, to enclose the land was not popular with the local residents, but he did allow pedestrians the right of way. To this day the walls remain, although they have been partially rebuilt and reinforced. Following Charles I&#x27;s execution, custodianship of the park passed to the Corporation of the City of London. It was returned to the restored monarch, Charles II, on his return to London in 1660.

===Georgian alterations===
In 1719, Caroline of Ansbach and her husband, the future George II of Great Britain, bought Richmond Lodge as a country residence. This building had first been built as a hunting lodge for James I in 1619 and had also been occupied by William III. As shown in a map of 1734, Richmond Park and Richmond Gardens then formed a single unit – the latter was merged with Kew Gardens by George III in the early 19th century. In 1736 the Queen&#x27;s Ride was cut through existing woodland to create a grand avenue through the park and Bog Gate or Queen&#x27;s Gate was opened as a private entrance for Caroline to enter the park on her journeys between White Lodge and Richmond Lodge. The same map shows Pen Ponds, a lake divided in two by a causeway, dug in 1746 and initially referred to as the Canals, which is now a good place to see water birds. Richmond Lodge fell out of use on Caroline&#x27;s death in 1737 but was brought back into use by her grandson George III as his summer residence from 1764 to 1772, when he switched his summer residence to Kew Palace and had Richmond Lodge demolished.
In 1751, Caroline&#x27;s daughter Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park after the death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing a few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who had stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.

===19th century===
Full right of public access to the park was confirmed by Act of Parliament in 1872. However, people were no longer given the right to remove firewood; this is still the case and helps in preserving the park.
Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate, and then part of Sudbrook Park, were incorporated into Richmond Park. Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge. The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851. Between 1855 and 1861, new drainage improvements were constructed, including drinking points for deer. In 1867 and 1876 fallow deer from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first fallow deer introduced to that country. In or around 1870, the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Italian general and politician, visited Lord John Russell at Pembroke Lodge in 1864, as did the Shah of Persia, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in 1873. He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.

===Early 20th century===
Edward VII developed the park as a public amenity by opening up almost all the previously fenced woods and making public those gates that were previously private. From 1915 level areas of the park were marked out for football and cricket pitches. A golf course was developed on the former &quot;Great Paddock&quot; of Richmond Park, an area used for feeding deer for the royal hunt. The tree belt in this part of the park was supplemented by additional planting in 1936. The public golf course was opened in 1923 by Edward, Prince of Wales (who was to become King Edward VIII and, after his abdication, Duke of Windsor). The future king had been born in the park, at White Lodge, in 1894. In 1925, a second public 18-hole course was laid out to the south of the first (towards Robin Hood Gate); it was opened by the Duke of York (George VI). In honour of their respective openers, Richmond Park Golf Course&#x27;s two courses are named the &quot;Prince&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Duke&#x27;s&quot;.

The park played an important role during World War I and was used for cavalry training. On 7 December 1915 English inventor Harry Grindell Matthews demonstrated, in a secret test on Pen Ponds, how selenium cells would work in a remotely controlled prototype weapon for use against German Zeppelins. Reporting on this story several years later, in April 1924, &quot;The Daily Chronicle&quot; reported that the test had been carried out in the presence of Arthur Balfour, Lord Fisher and a staff of experts. Its success led to Matthews receiving a payment of £25,000 from the Government the very next morning. Despite this large sum changing hands, the Admiralty never used the invention. Between 1916 and 1925 the park housed a South African military war hospital, which was built between Bishop&#x27;s Pond and Conduit Wood. The hospital closed in 1921 and was demolished in 1925. Richmond Cemetery, just outside the park, contains a section of war graves commemorating 39 soldiers who died at the hospital; the section is marked by a Cross of Sacrifice and a Grade II listed cenotaph designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Faisal I of Iraq and Lebanese politician Salim Ali Salam were photographed visiting the park in 1925.

=== World War II and its aftermath===
An army camp was established in 1938. It covered to the south and east of Thatched House Lodge, extending to the area south of Dann&#x27;s Pond. It became known as Kingston Gate Camp and expanded the capacity of the East Surrey Regiment&#x27;s regimental depot Infantry Training Centre (ITC). As a result, the ITC was better able to meet the demands of training new recruits and called-up militia between early 1940 and August 1941 when the ITC transferred to a facility in Canterbury shared with the Buffs. The camp was subsequently used as a military convalescent depot for up to 2,500 persons after which it continued as a base for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) until after the war.

During World War II Pembroke Lodge was used as the base for &quot;Phantom&quot; (the GHQ Liaison Regiment). The Pen Ponds were drained, in order to disguise them as a landmark, and an experimental bomb disposal centre was set up at Killcat Corner, which is between Robin Hood Gate and Roehampton Gate.

An anti-aircraft gun site was inside Sheen Gate for the duration of the war. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, visited it on 10 November 1940 and it was featured in a photograph published in &quot;Picture Post&quot; on 13 December 1941.

Associated with the gun site was the research site of the Army Operational Research Group (AORG), located on the polo field beside Sheen Cross, where Stanley Hey researched improvements to the operation of anti-aircraft gun-laying radar. During the war, Hey discovered that the Sun is a radio source and he investigated radio reflections from meteor trails, and radio noise from cosmic sources. In 1946 Hey&#x27;s group discovered Cygnus A, later shown to be the first radio galaxy. The Richmond Park installation thus became the first radio observatory in Britain.

In addition to use of the park for military purposes, approximately of the park was converted to agricultural use during the war.

The Russell School (then located within the park&#x27;s boundary) was destroyed by enemy action in 1943 and Sheen Cottage a year later.

John Boyd-Carpenter, MP for Kingston-upon-Thames, proposed using the Kingston Gate Camp to help alleviate the local post-war housing shortage but the Minister of Works, Charles Key, was opposed, preferring that the site be eventually returned to its former parkland use. Key&#x27;s department refurbished and repurposed the camp as an Olympic Village for the 1948 Summer Olympics. The Olympic Village was opened by Lord Burghley, with Key making the announcement, in July 1948. After the Olympics, the camp was used by units of the Royal Corps of Signals and then by the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps following their formation in 1949 as successor to the wartime ATS. Although it had been hoped to clear the camp during the 1950s, it remained in military use and was used to house service families repatriated following the Suez Crisis in 1956. It was not until 1965 that the camp was eventually demolished and reintegrated into the park during the following year.

===Late 20th century – present===
In 1953 President Tito of Yugoslavia stayed at White Lodge during a state visit to Britain.

The Petersham Hole was a sink hole caused by subsidence of a sewer which forced the total closure of the A307 road in Petersham in 1979–80. As the hole and subsequent repair work had forced a total closure of this main road between Richmond and Kingston, traffic was diverted through the park and the Richmond, Ham, and Kingston gates remained open throughout the day and night. The park road was widened at Ham Cross near Ham Gate to accommodate temporary traffic lights. About 10 deer a month were killed by traffic while the diversion was in operation.

When the present London Borough of Richmond upon Thames was created in 1965, it included the majority, but not the whole, of the park. The eastern tip, including Roehampton Gate, belonged to the London Borough of Wandsworth, and the southern tip was in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Following a series of borough boundary changes in 1994 and 1995, these anomalies were corrected and the whole park became part of Richmond upon Thames.

In the 2012 Summer Olympics the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s cycling road races went through the park.

==Features==
===Boundary wall===
The brick wall enclosing Richmond Park is eight miles (13 km) long and up to 9 ft (2.7m) high. Much of the wall is designated by Historic England as a Grade II listed building.

===Gates===
====Six original gates====

When the park was enclosed in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a stepladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis&#x27;s case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The &quot;chinoiserie&quot; lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.

Robin Hood Gate takes its name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called the Robin Hood roundabout on the A3. Widened in 1907, it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial. Alterations commenced in 2013 to make the gates more suitable for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.

====Other gates====

Chohole Gate served the farm that stood within the park on the site of the present Kings Farm Plantation. It is first mentioned in 1680. The gate now provides access to Richmond Park Golf Course.

Kingston Gate dates from about 1750. The existing gates date from 1898.

Bog Gate, or Queen&#x27;s Gate, which connects the park with East Sheen Common, was built in 1736. Public access to the park via this gate, 24 hours a day, was granted in 1894 and the present &quot;cradle&quot; gate was installed.

Petersham Gate served the Russell School, replacing the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further up the hill was probably a tradesman&#x27;s entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables.

Bishop&#x27;s Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896.

Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public.

Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I for access to the newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent, with public access, as a pedestrian gate.

===Buildings===
The park includes a Grade I listed building, White Lodge. The park&#x27;s boundary wall, and ten other buildings, are also Grade II listed: Ham Gate Lodge, built in 1742; Holly Lodge (formerly known as Bog Lodge) and the game larder in its courtyard, built in 1735; Pembroke Lodge; Richmond Gate and Richmond Gate Lodge, dated 1798 and designed by Sir John Soane; Thatched House Lodge; and White Ash Lodge and its barns and stables, built in the 1730s or 1740s.

The freebord or &quot;deer leap&quot; is a strip of land 5 metres (16&#x27;6&quot;) wide, running around most of the perimeter of the park. Owned by the Crown, it allows access to the outside of the boundary wall for inspection and repairs. Householders whose property backs on to the park can use this land by paying an annual fee.

====Holly Lodge====

In 1735, a new lodge, Cooper&#x27;s Lodge, was built on the site of Hill Farm. It was renamed Lucas&#x27;s Lodge in 1771 and Bog Lodge in the 1790s. Bog Lodge was renamed Holly Lodge in 1993 and now contains a visitors&#x27; centre (bookings only), the park&#x27;s administrative headquarters and a base for the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Royal Parks Operational Command Unit.

Holly Lodge also includes the Holly Lodge Centre, an organisation which provides an opportunity for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from a series of hands-on experiences, focusing particularly on the environment and in the Victorian history and heritage of Richmond Park. The centre, which is wheelchair-accessible throughout, was opened in 1994. It was founded by Mike Fitt, who was then The Royal Parks&#x27; Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London&#x27;s Royal Parks. A registered charity, the Holly Lodge Centre received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service in 2005.

Princess Alexandra has been Holly Lodge Centre&#x27;s Royal Patron since 2007. In 2011 she opened the centre&#x27;s Victorian-themed pharmacy, &quot;Mr Palmer&#x27;s Chymist&quot;. This includes the original interior, artefacts and dispensing records dating from 1865, from a chemist&#x27;s shop in Mortlake, and is used for educational activities. The centre also includes a replica Victorian schoolroom, and a kitchen garden planted with varieties of vegetables used in Victorian times and herbs cultivated for their medicinal properties.

====Pembroke Lodge====

Pembroke Lodge and some associated houses stand in their own garden within the park. In 1847 Pembroke Lodge became the home of the then Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, and from 1876 to 1890 was the childhood home of his grandson, Bertrand Russell. It is now a popular restaurant with views across the Thames Valley.

====Thatched House Lodge====

Thatched House Lodge was the London home of United States General Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Second World War. Since 1963 it has been the residence of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. It was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge, and was enlarged in 1727, possibly by William Kent, as a home for Sir Robert Walpole. The two houses were joined and renamed Thatched House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane. The gardens include an 18th-century two-room thatched summer house which gave the main house its name.

====White Lodge====

Built as a hunting lodge for George II by the architect Roger Morris, White Lodge was completed in 1730. Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family. The future king Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894; his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI) and the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother) lived there in the 1920s. The Royal Ballet School (formerly Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet) has been based since 1955 at White Lodge where younger ballet students continue to be trained.

====Bishop&#x27;s Gate Lodge====
Bishop&#x27;s Gate Lodge takes its name from a gamekeeper who was on the staff in the first half of the 19th century. A reference dated 1854 said that the keeper had had access to the lodge for the past fifty years. The lodge is not shown on the 1813 plan of the park, but appears on the plans of 1850, and its layout seems to have changed little from that time. It forms part of a view over the park, and beyond, that is much favoured by amateur painters.

====Other buildings====
Oak Lodge, near Sidmouth Wood, was built in about 1852 as a home for the park bailiff, who was responsible for repair and maintenance in the park. It is used by The Royal Parks as its base for a similar function today.

There are also gate lodges at Chohole Gate, Kingston Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and at Sheen Gate, which also has a bungalow (Sheen Gate Bungalow). Ladderstile Cottage, at Ladderstile Gate, was built in the 1780s.

====Former buildings====

A map by John Eyre, &quot;Plan of His Majesty&#x27;s New Park&quot;, shows a summer house near Richmond Gate.

Several buildings already existed within the park when it was created. One of these was a manor house at Petersham which was renamed Petersham Lodge. During the Commonwealth period it became accommodation for one of the park&#x27;s deputy keepers, Lodowick Carlell (or Carlile), who was also a renowned playwright in his day, and his wife, Joan Carlile, one of the first women to practise painting professionally.

Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart, and her husband Sir Lionel Tollemache, took over Petersham Lodge when they became joint keepers of Richmond Park. After Tollemache&#x27;s death the Lodge and its surrounding land were leased in 1686 to Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, whose sister Anne was married to the new king, James II. It became a private park and was subsequently landscaped. By 1692 Rochester had demolished the Lodge and replaced it with a splendid new mansion in his &quot;New Park&quot;. In 1732, a new Petersham Lodge was built to replace it after a fire. This Petersham Lodge was demolished in 1835.

Professor Sir Richard Owen, the first Director of the Natural History Museum, lived at Sheen Cottage until his death in 1892. The cottage was destroyed by enemy action in 1944. The remains of the cottage can be seen in patches and irregularities in the wall 220 metres from Sheen Gate.

A bandstand, similar to one in Kensington Gardens, was erected near Richmond Gate in 1931. In 1975, after many years of disuse, it was moved to Regent&#x27;s Park.

===Viewpoints===

There is a protected view of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral from King Henry&#x27;s Mound, and also from Sawyer&#x27;s Hill a view of central London in which the London Eye, Tower 42 (formerly the NatWest Tower) and 30 St Mary Axe (&quot;The Gherkin&quot;) appear to be close to one another.

====King Henry&#x27;s Mound====
King Henry&#x27;s Mound, which may have been a Neolithic burial barrow, was listed in 2020 by Historic England along with another (unnamed) mound in the park which could be a long barrow. King Henry&#x27;s Mound is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. At various times the mound&#x27;s name has been connected with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII. However, there is no evidence to support the legend that Henry VIII stood on the mound to watch for a sign from St Paul&#x27;s that Anne Boleyn had been executed at the Tower and that he was then free to marry Jane Seymour.

To the west of King Henry&#x27;s Mound is a panorama of the Thames Valley. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, over 10 miles (16 km) to the east, can be seen through the naked eye or via a telescope that has been installed on the Mound. This vista, created soon after the cathedral was completed in 1710, is protected by a &quot;dome and a half&quot; width of sky on either side. In 2005 the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, sought to overturn this protection and reduce it to &quot;half a dome&quot;. In 2009 his successor, Boris Johnson, promised to reinstate the wider view, though also approving a development at Victoria Station which, when completed, will obscure its right-hand corner. New gates − &quot;The Way&quot; − which can be viewed through the King Henry&#x27;s Mound telescope, were installed in 2012 on the edge of Sidmouth Wood to mark the 300th anniversary of St Paul&#x27;s.

In December 2016, it was reported that Manhattan Loft Gardens, a 42-storey 135m-tall apartment building under construction in Stratford, an area of London not covered by these planning restrictions, had &quot;destroyed&quot; the view from the park as it can now be seen behind the framed view of the cathedral&#x27;s dome. The developers said that &quot;Despite going through the correct planning processes in a public and transparent manner, at no point was the subject of visual impact to St Paul&#x27;s ever raised&quot; by the Olympic Delivery Authority or the Greater London Authority and that they were looking into the issues raised by the development.

In November 2017, the Friends of Richmond Park reported that their campaigning on the issue had resulted in the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, instructing London planners to consult the Greater London Authority on planning requests for high-rise buildings which, if built, could affect the visibility of St Paul&#x27;s from established viewpoints. His instruction has now been incorporated into planning procedures across Greater London.

===Plantings and memorials===

The park&#x27;s open slopes and woods are based on lowland acid soils. The grassland is mostly managed by grazing. The park contains numerous woods and copses, some created with donations from members of the public.

Between 1819 and 1835, Lord Sidmouth, Deputy Ranger, established several new plantations and enclosures, including Sidmouth Wood and the ornamental Isabella Plantation, both of which are fenced to keep the deer out. After World War II the existing woodland at Isabella Plantation was transformed into a woodland garden, and is organically run, resulting in a rich flora and fauna. Opened to the public in 1953, it is now a major visitor attraction in its own right. It is best known for the flowering, in April and May, of its evergreen azaleas and camellias, which have been planted next to its ponds and streams. There are also many rare and unusual trees and shrubs.

The Jubilee Plantation was created in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Prince Charles&#x27; Spinney was planted out in 1951 with trees protected from the deer by fences, to preserve a natural habitat. The bluebell glade is managed to encourage native British bluebells. Teck Plantation, established in 1905, commemorates the Duke and Duchess of Teck, who lived at White Lodge. Their daughter Mary married George V. Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937, marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946 to mark the end of the Second World War. Queen Mother&#x27;s Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

The park lost over 1000 mature trees during the Great Storm of 1987 and the Burns&#x27; Day Storm of 1990. The subsequent replanting included a new plantation, Two Storms Wood, a short distance into the park from Sheen Gate. Some extremely old trees can also be seen inside this enclosure.

Bone Copse, which was named in 2005, was started by the Bone family in 1988 by purchasing and planting a tree from the park authorities in memory of Bessie Bone who died in that year. Trees have been added annually, and in 1994 her husband Frederick Bone also died. The annual planting has been continued by their children.

The park&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee Woodland, marking the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, was opened by Sir David Attenborough in 2023.

====James Thomson and Poet&#x27;s Corner====

Poet&#x27;s Corner, an area at the north end of Pembroke Lodge Gardens, commemorates the poet James Thomson (1700–1748), who was living in Richmond at the time of his death. A curved metal bench inscribed with lines by Thomson and known as &quot;Poet&#x27;s Seat&quot; is located there. Sculpted by Richard Farrington, it was based on an idea by Jane Fowles.

A wooden memorial plaque with an ode to Thomson by the writer and historian John Heneage Jesse was formerly located near Pembroke Lodge stables, where it was installed in 1851. The plaque was replaced by the Selborne Society in 1895.

In 2014 Poet&#x27;s Corner was re-sited to the other side of the main path and the ode, on a re-gilded board, was installed in a completely new oak frame. The new Poet&#x27;s Corner, funded by the Friends of Richmond Park and the Visitor Centre at Pembroke Lodge, and by a donation in memory of Wendy Vachell, also includes three curved benches made from reclaimed teak. The benches are inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet W. H. Davies, &quot;A poor life this, if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare&quot;.

Benches, also sculpted by Richard Farrrington, at King Henry&#x27;s Mound are inscribed with a few lines from Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;.

Poet&#x27;s Corner is linked to King Henry&#x27;s Mound by the John Beer Laburnum Arch, named after one of Pembroke Lodge Gardens&#x27; former charge-hands. The arch has a display of yellow laburnum flowers in May.

====Ian Dury====

In 2002 a &quot;musical bench&quot;, designed by Mil Stricevic, was placed in a favoured viewing spot of rock singer and lyricist Ian Dury (1942–2000) near Poet&#x27;s Corner. On the back of the bench are the words &quot;Reasons to be cheerful&quot;, the title of one of Dury&#x27;s songs. The solar-powered seat was intended to allow visitors to plug in and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview, but was subjected to repeated vandalism. In 2015 the bench was refurbished and the MP3 players and solar panels were replaced with metal plates on which a QR code can be scanned via a smartphone. Visitors can access nine Ian Dury and the Blockheads songs and hear Dury&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; interview with Sue Lawley, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 December 1996.

==Nature==

===Wildlife===

Originally created for deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within much of the park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained; about 200 deer are culled annually and the meat is sold to licensed game dealers. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs.

The park is an important refuge for other wildlife, including woodpeckers, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, stag beetles and many other insects plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.

Richmond Park supports a large population of ring-necked parakeets. These bred from birds that escaped or were freed from captivity.

===Ponds and streams===

There are about 30 ponds in the park. Some – including Barn Wood Pond, Bishop&#x27;s Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin&#x27;s Pond and White Ash Pond – have been created to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas of water in the park.

Beverley Brook rises at Cuddington Recreation Ground in Worcester Park and enters the park (where it is followed by the Tamsin Trail and Beverley Walk) at Robin Hood Gate, creating a water feature used by deer, smaller animals and water grasses and some water lilies. Its name is derived from the former presence in the river of the European beaver (&quot;Castor fiber&quot;), a species extinct in Britain since the 16th century.

Most of the streams in the park drain into Beverley Brook but a spring above Dann&#x27;s Pond flows to join Sudbrook (from &quot;South brook&quot;) on the park boundary. Sudbrook flows through a small valley known as Ham Dip and has been dammed and enlarged in two places to form Ham Dip Pond and Ham Gate Pond, first mapped in 1861 and 1754 respectively. These were created for the watering of deer. Both ponds underwent restoration work including de-silting, which was completed in 2013. Sudbrook drains the western escarpment of the hill that, to the east, forms part of the catchment of Beverley Brook and, to the south, the Hogsmill River. Sudbrook is joined by the Latchmere stream just beyond Ham Gate Pond. Sudbrook then flows into Sudbrook Park, Petersham. Another stream rises north of Sidmouth Wood and goes through Conduit Wood towards the park boundary near Bog Gate.

A separate water system for Isabella Plantation was developed in the 1950s. Water from the upper Pen Pond is pumped to Still Pond, Thomson&#x27;s Pond and Peg&#x27;s Pond.

The park&#x27;s newest pond is Attenborough Pond, opened by and named after the broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough in July 2014. It was created as part of the park&#x27;s Ponds and Streams Conservation Programme.

==In culture==

===The Hearsum Collection===
The Hearsum Collection is a registered charity that collects and preserves the heritage of Richmond Park. It has a collection, which was started by Daniel Hearsum (1958-2021) in 1997, of heritage material covering the last four centuries, with over 5000 items including antique prints, paintings, maps, postcards, photographs, documents, books and press cuttings. Volunteers from the Friends of Richmond Park have been cataloguing them. The Collection, which as of 2025 continues to be stored in unsatisfactory accommodation in Pembroke Lodge, is overseen by volunteers and part-time staff. The trustees announced in 2014 plans for a new purpose-built heritage centre to provide full public access to the Collection.

In April 2017 the Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks and Ireland&#x27;s Office of Public Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park entitled &quot;Parks, Our Shared Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin &amp; The Royal Parks, London&quot;, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017.

====20th and 21st centuries====

The oil painting &quot;Richmond Park&quot; (1913) by Arthur George Bell is in the collection of the London Transport Museum.

Spencer Gore&#x27;s painting &quot;Richmond Park&quot;, thought to have been painted in the autumn of 1913 or shortly before the artist&#x27;s death in March 1914, was exhibited at the Paterson and Carfax Gallery in 1920. In 1939 it was exhibited in Warsaw, Helsingfors and Stockholm by the British Council as &quot;Group of Trees&quot;. It is now in the collection of the Tate Gallery under its original title but is not currently on display. The painting is one of a series of landscapes painted in Richmond Park during the last months of Gore&#x27;s life. According to Tate curator Helena Bonett, Gore&#x27;s early death from pneumonia, two months before what would have been his 36th birthday, was brought on by his painting outdoors in Richmond Park in the cold and wet winter months. It is not certain where in the park the picture was made but a row of trees close to the pond near Cambrian Gate has a very close resemblance to those in the painting. Another Gore painting, with the same title (&quot;Richmond Park&quot;), painted in 1914, is at the Ashmolean Museum. His painting &quot;Wood in Richmond Park&quot; is in the Birmingham Art Gallery&#x27;s collection.

* In the 1968 film &quot;Performance&quot;, James Fox crosses Richmond Park in a Rolls-Royce car.
* The park was the backdrop for the classic historical film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), with Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold, which looks back to what is now Richmond in the 16th century. The film tells the story of King Henry VIII&#x27;s courtship of Anne Boleyn and their brief marriage.
* An Indian dust storm was filmed in the park for the film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983).
* The Royal Ballet School in Richmond Park featured in the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000).

* Richmond Park was the setting for some scenes in the 2018 family comedy film &quot;Patrick&quot;.

As well as a location for films, Richmond Park is regularly featured in television programmes, corporate videos and fashion shoots. It has made an appearance on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot; (the BBC regional current affairs programme) and &quot;Springwatch&quot; (the BBC natural history series). In 2014 it was featured in a video commissioned by The Hearsum Collection. Most recently it was the subject of nature documentary &quot;Richmond Park – National Nature Reserve&quot;, presented by Sir David Attenborough and produced by the Friends of Richmond Park, which has won the best &quot;Longform&quot; film in the 2018 national Charity Film Awards.

==International connections==
===Richmond Park, Brunswick, Germany===
The &quot;Richmond Park&quot; in Germany is named after the park in Britain and was created in 1768 in Brunswick for Princess Augusta, sister of George III. She was married to the Duke of Brunswick and was feeling homesick, so an English-style park was designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown and a palace built for her, both with the name &quot;Richmond&quot;.

In 1935, the palace including the entire estate was purchased by the City of Braunschweig. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made and the park not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events. The nearly four-hectare (10-acre) park has been open to the public since 1964.

<text>Pacific (formerly Franklin) is a city in the U.S. state of Missouri in eastern Franklin County and extending to the east into southwest St. Louis County. The population was 7,414 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

=== Early history (1820–1864) ===
Throughout the early 19th century, the area that would eventually become Pacific slowly developed, with the first log cabin being constructed in 1820 and a covered bridge across the nearby Meramec River being constructed in 1838.

The Town of Franklin, Missouri was platted in 1852 by Major William C. Inks. The following year, the Pacific Railroad laid tracks in the town, and the railroad opened on July 19, 1853. A post office was opened in 1854, and has continuously operated since. The first city school was constructed in 1855.

In 1859, Franklin was incorporated as a fourth-class city and, in honor of the railroad, changed its name to Pacific.

=== The Battle of Pacific (1864) ===
On October 1, 1864, as a part of former Missouri governor and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price&#x27;s unsuccessful Missouri Expedition, a brigade of the Arkansas Cavalry of the Confederate States Army under the command of Gen. William Cabell was sent to Pacific from near Saint Clair. The brigade entered Pacific at sunrise and burned major city structures, including the rail depot and a number of bridges.

Union authorities in nearby Saint Louis quickly dispatched three divisions of the 16th Army Corps originally destined for Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in Atlanta to Pacific to deal with Cabell&#x27;s troops, who had, by most accounts, set up four pieces of artillery around the town. The troops from St. Louis encountered Confederate troops just east of Pacific, near what is now Allenton, who shelled the train and the troops. The two brigades engaged in battle for a few hours, and when additional Union supports from Saint Louis arrived, Cabell&#x27;s troops were forced out of the city to nearby Union, Missouri.

Given Pacific&#x27;s proximity to the St. Louis County line, the city was seen as the last defense against an attempted Confederate invasion of Saint Louis. The casualties numbered about a dozen on each side, but Cabell&#x27;s troops had done the bulk of their plundering earlier in the day.

=== Post-war development (1864–1925) ===
The first issue of the Franklin County Democrat was published in Pacific in 1871, marking the first time a newspaper was published in the city. Production was moved to nearby Washington, Missouri on May 31, 1878, where the newspaper was published weekly until 1882.

A new railroad depot was opened in 1882. It was used continuously until 1961, when regular service between Pacific and Saint Louis was discontinued due to declining ridership, and the Frisco Railroad abandoned the depot in 1976. It was demolished shortly thereafter.

In 1891, a fire at the center of town broke out, destroying all buildings on Saint Louis Street, the main commercial thoroughfare in Pacific, between First and Columbus Streets. In the following years, the Meramec River flooded the southern extent of Pacific a number of times, most notably in 1895 and 1915. The old covered bridge south of town was severely damaged by the former flood, and was demolished.

The Missouri Botanical Garden purchased 1,300 acres (5.3 km2) of land immediately to the west of Pacific in 1925 when pollution from coal smoke in Saint Louis threatened the garden&#x27;s extensive plant collection, notably its orchids. The orchids were moved to the land, then called the Gray Summit Extension, the following year, but were restored to the original location of the garden when pollution waned. The Missouri Botanical Garden kept the land, and over the next fifty years, amounting eventually to the 2,444 acre (9.89 km2) parcel currently known as Shaw Nature Reserve.

=== The Route 66 era (1925–1977) ===
U.S. Route 66 was commissioned by the federal government in 1926, but it originally did not go through Pacific; it was routed along what is now Missouri Route 100 east of Gray Summit going into Saint Louis until 1933. That year, U.S. Route 50 took over the 1926 alignment, and Route 66 was routed down what is now Osage Street through downtown Pacific. As Route 66 exploded in popularity through the 20th century, new attention was brought to Pacific, as cross-country motorists would stop in the city to eat and stay the night. The Red Cedar Inn, The Al-Pac Motel and Beacon Court, constructed in 1933, 1942 and 1946, respectively, are examples of bed and breakfasts that opened in Pacific along Route 66.

The Jensen&#x27;s Point overlook, named for Lars P. Jensen, the first president of the Henry Shaw Gardenway Association, was constructed in 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps atop the sandstone bluffs towering above the Meramec River on the east side of town. It was restored by the city of Pacific in the late 2010s, and is open to the public, offering panoramic views of downtown Pacific and the Meramec River.

In 1959, as part of Project Nike, the U.S. Air Force purchased some land approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of Pacific and constructed a Nike Hercules missile site on the land. Nike Base SL-60, as it was called, was one of four surface-to-air missile sites surrounding the Saint Louis metropolitan area in case of an imminent attack from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It operated from 1960 until 1968. The city of Pacific took control of the land in 1969 and the Meramec Valley R-III school district utilized the barracks to build an elementary school. The parcel is now mostly privately owned, with the airstrip becoming part of a residential subdivision later.

Interstate 44 was constructed throughout Missouri during the early 1960s, and when it opened in 1965, Pacific and Route 66 were bypassed immediately to the north by the highway. By 1972, the Interstate Highway System had completely bypassed Route 66, and in 1974, the AASHTO decided that Route 66 from Joplin, Missouri to Chicago, Illinois should be decommissioned. Former Route 66 was commissioned as Business Loop 44 through Pacific, and signs and shields referencing Route 66 in Pacific were removed in 1977.

=== Modern growth (1977–present) ===
The Missouri Eastern Correctional Center, a medium-minimum security prison with the capacity to house 1,100 male inmates, was constructed immediately east of Pacific in 1979. The city annexed the prison in 2004 after a lengthy debate with neighboring Eureka, who claimed they had also intended to annex the prison.

In 1982, following the Meramec River flooding around Pacific, dioxin contaminants in oil used to spray down the dirt roads in nearby Times Beach were spread through the town, which caused disease and the eventual evacuation and demolition of the entire town. Some evacuees moved to Pacific, which caused a substantial population boom.

The Gustav Grauer Farm, located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) north of Pacific in unincorporated Franklin County, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

== Geography ==

The city straddles the Franklin/St. Louis county line, which lies halfway on the blocks between Elm and Neosho streets. St. Louis is northeast of Pacific, and the communities comprising the Missouri Rhineland are northwest of the city.

Pacific is bordered on the southeast by the Pacific Palisades Conservation Area. Access to the Meramec River, through the Pacific Palisades Conservation Area, is located east of the city, adjacent to Eureka on the north side. The majority of the Pacific Palisades Conservation Area is south of the river and can be accessed south of the city in Jefferson County.

The Union Pacific (formerly Missouri Pacific) railroad, BNSF Railway (formerly St. Louis–San Francisco) Railroad, Historic U.S. Route 66, Brush Creek, and Fox Creek run through the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. A total of of the city is located in St. Louis County. The city is located directly west from Eureka and east of Gray Summit.


=== Commercial areas ===
The Old Downtown Commerce Area is mostly located along First and St. Louis streets. The historic downtown buildings, built in the late 1800s, have been fully or partially restored, and new businesses have moved into the buildings.

The Red Cedar Inn, on the east end of town, was a meeting place for people around the country seeking out one of the oldest restaurants still standing on Route 66. The restaurant closed in 2007.

<doc id="150747" wikidata="Q953654" url="?curid=150747" title="Rogersville, Missouri">
<text>Rogersville is a city in Greene and Webster counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. The population is 3,897 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Springfield, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. Rogersville was formerly known as the &quot;Raccoon Capital of the World&quot;. In 2006, &quot;417 Magazine&quot; ranked Rogersville as the eighth-best place to live in Southwest Missouri.

==History==
Rogersville was named after Doctor Rogers, a pioneer settler. A post office called Rogersville has been in operation since 1882. The Citizens Bank of Rogersville was formed as a corporation on December 15, 1908, with $10,000 in capital stock.

The history of Rogersville has been documented by the Citizens Bank of Rogersville and is shown below.

There is, however, the Logan Cemetery about a half mile west of the Logan Elementary School on Farm Road 219 and also the old Crossroad Store at the intersection of Farm Roads 164 and 219. This area is generally known as Logan.

Around late 1929 or early 1930, the Bank of Rogersville was robbed by two men who stole $981. About a dozen men rode out to chase the robbers, one of which was shot and the other was captured. The trial was held in the Rogersville High School gym for the captured robber, and he was sentenced to jail.

In 1957, a fire was discovered in a vacant building in Rogersville on a Saturday night around 10:30p.m., which burned out of control due to Rogersville having no fire-fighting equipment or a city water supply. Calls for aid were sent out to surrounding communities including the Fordland Air Force Station, the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department, the Ozark Rural Fire Department, and the Marshfield Department. Four businesses were destroyed, including a market and a new theater, with damages estimated at $75,000.

In 1992, the Webster County Council on Aging formed a &quot;Senior Services Committee&quot; to address the needs of its senior citizens. In 1993, the committee decided to ask for a 5-cent tax increase to extend services on the August ballot, but the issue failed. In 1994, a forum was held with the assistance of the Southwest Missouri Office on Aging (SMOA) to discuss the possibility of a Rogersville Senior Center. A temporary center was formed in May 1994, and after fundraising events and community donations, the Rogersville Senior Center opened on January 17, 1995.

==Arts and culture==
In the City of Rogersville alongside Highway B and the passing train tracks, there is a revitalized Frisco caboose that represents the Rogersville Caboose Veterans Memorial. The memorial was donated by the American Legion Goad-Ballinger Post 69 on July 1, 1995, and contains a plaque that reads as follows:

The purple dinosaur at the City of Rogersville Park, described as a &quot;beloved piece of playground equipment&quot;, was stolen in August 2021, which prompted city-wide investigation and monetary rewards from local businesses. In December 2021, a Michigan man happened to have the same purple dinosaur and donated the playground piece to the City of Rogersville after seeing the story online.

==Government==
The finances of the City of Rogersville are regularly audited by an independent agency to ensure proper financial conduct by the city government. As of spring 2020, the most recent publicly available audit report was for the year ended June 30, 2017. The audit listed a potential concern with segregation of duties citing &quot;because of a limited number of available personnel, it is not always possible to adequately segregate certain incompatible duties so that no one employee has access to both physical assets and the related accounting records, or to all phases of a transaction&quot;. The City responded to this finding citing it &quot;believes that at this time, adding staff or implementing additional procedures is not cost justified, nor would it meaningfully improve this finding&quot;.

The below table summarizes the 2016–2017 revenues and expenses for the City of Rogersville.

In response to the spread of COVID-19, the City of Rogersville issued a stay-at-home order on March 27, 2020, but still allowed essential activities to take place.

==Education==
Rogersville has a lending library, a branch of the Webster County Library.

Rogersville is served by the Logan-Rogersville R-VIII School District, which contains 3 elementary and 2 secondary schools. The public schools are listed below.

===Elementary schools===
* Logan-Rogersville Primary School (Pre-K – 1st)
* Logan-Rogersville Elementary School (2nd – 3rd)
* Logan-Rogersville Upper Elementary School (4th – 6th)

===Secondary schools===
* Logan-Rogersville Middle School (7th – 8th)
* Logan-Rogersville High School (9th – 12th)

==Infrastructure==
The Missouri Department of Transportation oversaw the construction of &quot;Project Freeway: U.S. 60 Rogersville&quot;, which was completed in early November 2016. The project included three new interchanges built along Highway 60 and a series of outer roads and backage roads. The project was designed and built by Ozark Regional Road Constructors (ORRC) and was estimated at a cost of $27 million. The project was recognized by the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) with the 2017 National Award of Excellence and the Chairman&#x27;s Award for Community Impact and Social Responsibility for including community components such as the project&#x27;s &quot;Young Women in Engineering Program, a partnership with the Logan-Rogersville School District, and the Minority Outreach Program at Missouri State University. The outreach programs used the highway project as a laboratory to expose female high school students to the engineering field and exposed minority students at the university to the highway design and construction industries.&quot;

In December 2016, improved railroad crossings were completed in Rogersville along Route B. The project was a partnership between the City of Rogersville, BNSF Railway, and the Missouri Department of Transportation and was estimated at a cost of $6.7 million.

In 2019, Rogersville was experiencing substantial residential development and was described as &quot;the next boom&quot; in Southwest Missouri by &quot;Springfield Business Journal&quot;. The unprecedented growth was estimated to increase the town&#x27;s population by at least 50% in 2018–2020. A new $100 million development of housing and commercial space was constructed in response to the increased population growth. The population growth has also strained city resources including the local police force.

On April 30, 2019, an EF2 tornado impacted 75 houses in the Rogersville area. Nine school buses were also badly damaged and required the City to borrow school buses from Ozark, Missouri to continue running bus routes. Another EF1 tornado crossed Rogersville on October 21, 2019, but was more limited and only &quot;damaged trees and outbuildings&quot;.

Construction is set to begin in 2023 for a new $22 million interchange system at U.S. Route 60 and Highway 125 to improve safety, reduce vehicle crashes, and reduce traffic congestion. The construction project will be completed by November 2024.

<text>Joplin is a city in Jasper and Newton counties in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Missouri. The bulk of the city is in Jasper County, while the southern portion is in Newton County. Joplin is the largest city located within both Jasper and Newton Counties – even though it is not the county seat of either county (Carthage is the seat of Jasper County while Neosho is the seat of Newton County). With a population of 51,762 as of the 2020 census, Joplin is the 12th most-populous city in the state. The city covers an area of 35.69 square miles (92.41 km2) on the outer edge of the Ozark Mountains. Joplin is the main hub of the three-county Joplin-Miami, Missouri-Oklahoma Metro area, which is home to 210,077 people; this makes the city the fifth largest metropolitan area in Missouri. In May 2011, a violent EF5 tornado killed more than 150 people and destroyed one-third of the city.

==History==

===19th century===

Lead was discovered in the Joplin Creek Valley before the Civil War, but only after the war did significant development take place. By 1871, numerous mining camps sprang up in the valley and resident John C. Cox filed a plan for a city on the east side of the valley. Cox named his village Joplin City after the spring and creek nearby, which had been named for the Reverend Harris G. Joplin, who settled upon its banks circa 1840.

Carthage resident Patrick Murphy filed a plan for a city on the opposite side of the valley and named it Murphysburg. As the nearest sheriff was in Carthage, frontier lawlessness abounded in Joplin. The historic period was referred to as the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot;. The cities eventually merged into Union City, but when the merger was found illegal, the cities split. Murphy suggested that a combined city be named Joplin. The cities merged again on March 23, 1873, this time permanently, as the City of Joplin.

While Joplin was first settled for lead mining, zinc, often referred to as &quot;jack&quot;, was the most important mineral resource. As railroads were built to connect Joplin to major markets in other cities, it was on the verge of dramatic growth. By the start of the 20th century, the city was becoming a regional metropolis. Construction centered around Main Street, with many bars, hotels, and fine homes nearby. Joplin&#x27;s three-story &quot;House of Lords&quot; was its most famous saloon, with a bar and restaurant on the first floor, gambling on the second, and a brothel on the third. Trolley and rail lines made Joplin the hub of southwest Missouri. As the center of the &quot;Tri-state district&quot;, it soon became the lead- and zinc-mining capital of the world.

As a result of extensive surface and deep mining, Joplin is dotted with open-pit mines and mineshafts. Mining left many tailings piles (small hills of ground rock), which are considered unsightly locally. The main part of Joplin is nearly 75% undermined, with some mine shafts well over 100 ft (30 m) deep. These shafts have occasionally caved in, creating sinkholes.

===20th century===

Joplin began to add cultural amenities; in 1902, residents passed a tax to create a public library, and gained matching funds that enabled them to build the Carnegie Library. It was seen as the symbol of a thriving city. In 1930, the grand commercial Electric Theater was built, one of the many movie palaces of the time. It was later purchased and renamed the Fox by Fox Theatres corporation. With the Depression and post-World War II suburban development, moviegoing declined at such large venues.

On April 15, 1903, Joplin police officers, including Theodore Leslie, 36, were searching nearby rail yards for a Black man who had allegedly stolen pistols from a hardware store when Leslie noticed a man in one of the rail cars. Shots were fired, and Leslie, a father of four, was mortally wounded. Hundreds of men launched a search using bloodhounds. On April 16, a Black man with a weapon, Thomas Gilyard, was arrested, and while he told one of the men involved in the arrest that he had been in the box car, he said several others had been there and that one of them fired the fatal shot.
Joplin City Attorney Perl Decker pleaded with the growing mob to break up, according to newspaper and other historical accounts, as did Mayor Thomas Cunningham, but the crowd soon stormed the jail and took Gilyard from his cell. He was lynched soon afterward.
In 1933 during the Great Depression, the notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde spent some weeks in Joplin, where they robbed several area businesses. Tipped off by a neighbor, the Joplin Police Department attempted to apprehend the pair. Bonnie and Clyde escaped after killing Newton County Constable John Wesley Harryman and Joplin Police Detective Harry McGinnis; however, they were forced to leave most of their possessions behind, including a camera. The &quot;Joplin Globe&quot; developed and printed the film, which showed now-legendary photos of Bonnie holding Clyde at mock gunpoint, and of Bonnie with her foot on a car fender, posed with a pistol in her hand and cigar in her mouth. The Missouri Advisory Council on Historic Preservation nominated the house where the couple stayed, at 34th Street and Oak Ridge Drive, for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places on February 13, 2009.

After World War II, most of the mines were closed, and population growth leveled off. The main road through Joplin running east and west was designated as part of U.S. Route 66, which became famous as more Americans took to newly constructed highways. The roads provided improved access between cities, but they also drew off population to newer housing and eventually retail centers.

In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly 40 acres (16 ha) of the city&#x27;s downtown were razed in an attempt at urban renewal, as population and businesses had moved to a suburban fringe along newly constructed highways. The Keystone Hotel and Worth Block (former home of the House of Lords) were notable historic structures that were demolished. Christman&#x27;s Department Store stands (converted into loft apartments), as does the Joplin Union Depot, since railroad restructuring and the decline in passenger traffic led to its closure. Other notable historic structures in Joplin include the Carnegie Library, Fred and Red&#x27;s Diner, the Frisco Depot, the Scottish Rite Cathedral, and the Crystal Cave (filled in and used for a parking lot). The Newman Mercantile Store has been adapted for use as City Hall. The Fox Theatre has been adapted for use as the Central Christian Center. 

On May 5, 1971, Joplin was struck by a severe tornado, resulting in one death and 50 injuries, along with major damage to many houses and businesses.
On November 11, 1978, Joplin&#x27;s once-stately Connor Hotel, which was slated for implosion to make way for a new public library, collapsed suddenly and prematurely. Two demolition workers were killed instantly. A third, Alfred Sommers, was trapped for four days, yet survived.

===21st century===
The city had three hospitals at one time. Oak Hill Hospital, which was located at 34th &amp; Indiana. Joplin General Hospital was founded by Dr. Kilbane and was later moved and renamed Oak Hill Hospital. Freeman Hospital merged with Oak Hill Hospital to become the Freeman-Oak Hill Hospital Health System. The city has two major hospitals now, which serve the Four States region, Freeman-Oak Hill Hospital Health System and Mercy Hospital Joplin, the latter replacing St. John&#x27;s Regional Medical Center which was destroyed in the May 22, 2011, tornado. Freeman Hospital East, the former Oak Hill Hospital, and Landmark Hospital serve more specialized community health needs. The city&#x27;s park system has nearly and includes a golf course, three swimming pools, of walking/biking trails, the world&#x27;s largest remaining globally unique Chert Glades and the Shoal Creek Nature Center located in Wildcat Park. A waterfall, Grand Falls, the highest continuously flowing in the state, is on Shoal Creek on the southern end of the city. 

Numerous buildings in Joplin have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their historic and architectural significance. The city has undertaken Agenda 21; a major project to revitalize its Main Street downtown district, which lies on the historic Route 66. It has refurbished building facades, sidewalks, and added old-styled lamp posts, flower baskets, and benches to highlight the historic center of the city. A gasoline-powered citywide trolley system evokes images of the city&#x27;s vibrant past.

Numerous trucking lines such as CFI are headquartered in town, as the city is situated near the geographic and population centers of the nation. Eagle-Picher Industries, Tamko Building Products, AT&amp;T Communications, and Schaeffler Group are noted employers in Joplin, and Leggett &amp; Platt (a Fortune 500) is located in nearby Carthage. The city is served by the Joplin Regional Airport located north of town near Webb City.

Since the 2011 tornado, the city continued to expand eastward toward I-44. Large-scale development occurred along Range Line Road, particularly around Northpark Mall. Numerous other smaller cities are in close proximity to the city include Carl Junction, Webb City, Duenweg, Duquesne, Airport Drive, Oronogo, Carterville, Redings Mill, Shoal Creek Drive, Leawood, and Saginaw.

Due to its location near two major highways and its few event and sports facilities, Joplin attracts travelers and is a destination for conferences and group events. Joplin offers nearly 500 hotel rooms, the majority located within a 1/4-mile area of Range Line Road and I-44. It has the John Q. Hammons Convention and Trade Center, which serves as the primary event facility for conventions, associations, and large events.

Each June, Joplin hosts the Boomtown Run, a half marathon, 5K, and children&#x27;s run. The event attracts runners from across the country, and features USTA certified courses which start and end in the historic downtown area. Celebrity runners featured at the prerace banquet have included Bart Yasso, Sarah Reinerston, Suzy Favor-Hamilton, and Jeff Galloway. In 2011, due to the devastating EF5 tornado that struck Joplin on May 22, just three weeks before the run, the event was transformed in the Boomtown Run Day of Service. About 270 individuals registered for the race after the tornado struck, knowing their proceeds would benefit tornado recovery. On June 11, about 270 registered runners and volunteers turned out to help clean debris and sort donations, contributing more than 1,200 hours of service. On August 7, 2012, the Village of Silver Creek and the City of Joplin voted to have Silver Creek annexed into Joplin City limits.

===2011 tornado===

On May 22, 2011, an EF5 tornado formed near the western edge of the city at about 5:21 pm CDT (22:34 UTC) and tracked eastward across the city and Interstate 44 into rural portions of Newton County. The tornado&#x27;s damage path reached up to in width and in length, though the six miles of the path through Joplin itself contained the heaviest damage. About 2,400 houses, 1,000 cars, and businesses were flattened or blown away in Joplin, particularly in the section between 13th and 32nd Streets across the southern part of the city. The tornado narrowly missed the downtown area.

St. John&#x27;s Regional Medical Center was damaged, and demolished in 2012. The Missouri Disaster Medical Assistance Team temporarily replaced the demolished St. John&#x27;s Regional Medical Center with a mobile hospital until the permanent hospital was rebuilt. The local high school, Joplin High School, was totally destroyed, as well. A total of 161 people died from tornado-related injuries as of the end of July 2011. Communications were lost and power was knocked out to many areas. An official statement from the National Weather Service has categorized the tornado as an EF5. On Sunday, May 29, President Barack Obama, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, and Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate visited and toured Joplin to see what the damage looked like and attended a memorial service for the deceased. Later that day, the city held a moment of silence at 5:41 p.m., to mark the time the tornado struck. The area was declared a federal disaster area.

In July 2011, the City of Joplin entered into a contractual agreement with a master developer company, hired to assist in nearly $3 billion in reconstruction efforts. Priority construction projects included residential districts and senior and assisted-living facilities; 7,500 residential dwellings in the city were damaged or destroyed by storm. The city council began receiving government funds for additional recovery projects intended to spur expansion and economic growth included the construction of a new and expanded public library and a senior center, among other city amenities of trails, sidewalks, transportation, and park enhancements. A variety of additional major projects were to follow, greatly enhancing and expanding all aspects of the community&#x27;s development. City Manager Mark Rohr said, &quot;This effort is the greatest opportunity the city has ever seen.&quot; Among other resources and support from governmental agencies, the Economic Development Administration provided $20 million to construct a new Joplin Library and a two-year funding agreement to hire a disaster recovery coordinator to help coordinate the city&#x27;s nearly $850 million in immediate restoration and recovery efforts.

In the summer of 2012, the United States Housing and Urban Development Department awarded a $45 million community development block grant for reconstruction efforts and in 2013 awarded another $113 million. In May 2013, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources awarded Wildcat Glades Conservation and Audubon Center $500,000 to help with the restoration of the urban forest, which was passed through to the City of Joplin as a subgrant; 1,500 large-calibre trees were planted in the tornado zone and along an urban stream, Joplin Creek.

In May 2016, a summit was held under the name of &quot;Joplin Disaster Recovery Summit&quot;. The summit&#x27;s purpose was to tackle several issues and ensure that the recovery plans take place.

As of March 2018, the only project finished that was proposed in the recovery effort besides the hospital and schools was the new public library. Wallace-Bajjali was sued by a city they formerly contracted with and skipped town without fulfilling the contract made to refurbish Joplin.

Mercy Park was created at the site of the former hospital.

=== Tourism ===
After the May 22, 2011 tornado came through a number of unofficial murals and monuments popped up across the city. These popups also showcased the beginning of an arts renaissance in Joplin which still can be seen throughout the city today. One of many monuments which popped up was the Rainbow Tree, which was found on 20th Street between Indiana Avenue and Illinois Avenue. The Rainbow Tree, not to be confused with the since-fallen Spirit Tree, was a tree which was destroyed in the May 22, 2011 tornado that the community decorated with bird houses, bird feeders, colored paint, and a sign saying &quot;Help Us Feed The Birds&quot;; as of November 2022, it had been cut down and removed. After the tornado butterflies became a major part of the artistic works in the city due to the stories of children seeing butterfly entities carrying people through the sky shortly after the tornado which spread across the community of Joplin. One of the first works in Joplin to incorporate Butterflies was the &quot;Butterfly Effect: Dreams Take Flight&quot; Mural which is located on the Northwest corner of 15th and Main Street. The piece was painted by Dave Loewenstein with the support of a 20 community member design team and more than 300 community volunteers.
On March 15, 2018, the City of Joplin conducted an independent tourism study which covered the purpose of the study, evaluation process, competitive market summary, recommendations, and implementations. In the overview, the City states its strategic priorities for tourism which were improve the visitor experience, increase the number of visitors, capture visitor spending, and emphasize results-driven tourism marketing. The purpose of the study was to provide direction for Joplin to help define the focus for future tourism efforts. In the study the city mentions the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the tourism market in the region as well as recommendations to increase tourism in the city. One of the recommendations in the study was to develop a conference center with an incorporated or adjacent hotel which could accommodate groups up to 2,500 and include multi-use exhibit space, breakout rooms and the newest technology. Another recommendation was to enhance downtown by encouraging hotel development in downtown, supporting and promoting development of empire market and food culture, supporting development of an Arts &amp; Entertainment complex, supporting efforts of Connect2Culture and the broader art community relating facilities and programs downtown, hosting a variety of special events downtown, promoting downtown as a location for dining, shopping and culture, and continuing Main Street and downtown core improvements. It is recommended that the first step for the CVB Board is to discuss and decide which of the recommendations they see as priorities and take these to City Council for their recommendation. Additionally, the CVB should start collecting visitor data, undertake Identity and Branding study (with the city as lead or in partnership with the city), work on increasing lodging tax, ear-marked for conference center use the Tourism Study as a roadmap for future decision-making.

In September 2019, Joplin unveiled the Rotary Sculpture Garden in Mercy Park which is home to 9 new sculptures with more on the way. The project was a joint effort of Joplin Rotary Club and Joplin Daybreak Rotary Club and all the Sculptures were donated. One by Sharon and Lance Beshore, one by Barbara and Jim Hicklin, and seven by Harry M. Cornell Jr., an art collector and chairman emeritus of Leggett &amp; Platt Inc. On February 7, 2019, the Joplin Rotary Club donated over $9,800 which funded signage at the entrance of the walking paths in Mercy Park. The sculpture garden represents a $200,000 investment by community members who looked for the works of art, bought them, and donated them for permanent display.

Joplin&#x27;s local heritage, including its mining heritage, is celebrated by the Joplin History and Mineral Museum in Schifferdecker Park. The museum contains wings dedicated to (a) local history, and (b) the minerals of the world, particularly those found during the era of lead and zinc mining in Southwest Missouri and the Tri-State Region. An outdoor display near the museum features used mining equipment used for production in the Joplin region, including pieces of heavy machinery.

The Ghost Light or Spooklight, a mysterious orb supposedly spotted by locals and tourists, is also located in the region around Joplin.

==Media==
==Transportation==
Joplin is served by the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) Railway, as well as by branchlines of the BNSF Railway and Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad (MNA). The city was once a beehive of railroad activity; however, many of the original railroad lines serving Joplin, such as the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, were abandoned after the demise of the mining and industrial enterprises. The Missouri and North Arkansas had connected Joplin with Helena, Arkansas. Passenger trains have not served the city since the 1960s. The Joplin Union Depot is still intact along the KCS mainline, and efforts are underway to restore it. Despite the decline in some rail lines in and around Joplin during the past five decades, many of the original lines still remain. Aside from the former Frisco Railroad route from Joplin to Webb City and the Carthage to Wichita, Kansas, lines that have since been converted into bike/hike trails, most of the original routes still remain in place under the control of the BNSF, KCS, and M&amp;NA railroad companies.

Interstate 44 connects Joplin with Springfield and St. Louis to the east and Tulsa and Oklahoma City to the west. U.S. Route 71 runs east of the city, connecting Joplin to Kansas City to the north and Fort Smith, Arkansas, to the south. The segment from Kansas City to Joplin was designated Interstate 49 on December 12, 2012.

Range Line Road is the primary north and south commercial district with traffic approaching 25,000 vehicles daily. In 2022 the Range Line Road bridge over Kansas City Southern Railroad line was replaced and made taller and wider to accommodate growth.

Previously, Interstate 66 was proposed along the current Interstate 44 alignment from St. Louis and extending along the U.S. 400 alignment to Wichita, Kansas, but, despite lobbying by both Missouri and Kansas, the project has been cancelled due to resistance farther east and west along the proposed extended alignment.

Joplin once boasted an extensive trolley and inter-urban rail system. Today, part of the city is served by the Sunshine Lamp Trolley, which commenced service in July 2007, and expanded to three routes in 2009.

<text>Emma is a city in Lafayette and Saline counties in the U.S. state of Missouri and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. The population was 201 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The village has the name of Emma Demetrio, the daughter of a local minister.

The following are Excerpted from Robert W. Frizzell&#x27;s 1977 article &quot;&#x27;Killed by Rebels&#x27;: A Civil War Massacre And Its Aftermath&quot;: 
Missouri Germans in general had a well-earned reputation among slaveowners as being opposed to slavery. Many St.Louis Germans were exiles from European political oppression. They desired and expected in the United States &quot;a political and social utopia where the rights of the individual were held sacred.&quot;

In West Missouri, the first Germans arrived in southwestern Lafayette County in the late 1830s. In the 1840s and 50s more Germans came, most of them from Hanover in Northwest Germany. They came for neither religious nor political reasons but simply for improved economic opportunity in the form of available farmland.

When the war came in 1861, some sixty Lafayette-Saline Germans joined Frederick Becker&#x27;s independent company of pro-Union Home Guards in Lafayette County in July. The company stationed itself at Lexington. During this time, with the Home Guards away, the community later known as Concordia experienced its first visit by Southern partisans. The Lutheran minister F. J. Biltz was interrogated, and Brockhoff&#x27;s store was raided, and many of the community&#x27;s horses and mules were confiscated. The community felt safer when a few days later 1200 Illinois troops passed through on their way to Lexington, but later in September, the entire Federal garrison at Lexington surrendered, including the Lafayette-Saline Germans. The Germans were released to go home after they were made to swear an oath not to take up arms again.

With the activation of the 71st EMM** in August 1862, fifty Germans from Lafayette-Saline joined, and the German community for a second time found many of its men away on militia duty. As had happened previously, Southern partisans visited the community. This time, however, the partisans were guerrillas who did not stop with confiscation of property. On October 5, 1862, several families along with Rev. Biltz and his wife gathered at the home of Julius Vogt for an infant baptism. After the ceremony, while the group finished an evening meal, some sixty shouting, cursing men on horseback surrounded the house. The bushwhackers took eleven men prisoners and took all the usable goods they could find. About a mile away, the killing began—the guerrillas took aside and shot three prisoners. In total, six were shot, three fatally, and five were freed.

On July 13, 1863 a second bushwhacker raid occurred in the German community. The bushwackers took four men prisoner, all of whom were members of Co. B. 71st EMM** and had been on active duty the previous year. The bushwhackers lined up the four and shot them dead. Again, no one is certain of the identities of these particular bushwhacker gangs, but David Poole and &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson, affiliates of William C. Quantrill, were notoriously opposed to the German farmers and militia. There was relative peace following this 1863 raid until the next summer.

The war was not going well for the Confederacy in 1864. General Price in Arkansas decided to take pressure off Confederates further east by leading his Missouri army on a great raid through its home state. Word reached the guerrillas that summer to disrupt Federal activities as much as possible in order to ready the countryside for Price&#x27;s arrival. Thus in central and western Missouri, bushwhacking guerrilla raids occurred almost every day through the summer and early fall. Many of these incidents happened in or near Lafayette and Saline counties.

The night of October 9, 1864, a hundred bushwhackers camped somewhere near Brownsville (renamed Sweet Springs in the 1880s). The next morning Quantrill&#x27;s men, led by David Poole and George Todd, decided to attack the German settlement lying to their west (in the Concordia area). About 50 Germans responded to the cow horns and arrived at the Lutheran Church. They divided into two groups—one rode east to aid Germans who had set an ambush at Davis Creek, and the other group went to guard a ford. The first group encountered the hundred guerrillas near the present town of Emma. Only one of the Germans survived. The bushwhackers smashed each of the 24 victim&#x27;s skulls with a gun butt or club. Among the dead was Fred Dickenhorst, Maria&#x27;s uncle. With the resistance eliminated, Quantrill&#x27;s men went on a killing and burning spree amid the homes of the German community.

After they were finished with what was to be their last massacre, Quantrill&#x27;s men rode further into Lafayette County. One leader of the last raid on October 10, 1864, George Todd, was killed October 21 as he scouted for General Price. The other leader, David Poole, survived the war to live peacefully in Lexington.

<doc id="150755" wikidata="Q961975" url="?curid=150755" title="Hannibal, Missouri">
<text>Hannibal is a city along the Mississippi River in Marion and Ralls counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the population was 17,108, making it the largest city in Marion County. The bulk of the city is in Marion County, with a tiny sliver in the south extending into Ralls County.

Nestled on the Mississippi River, commerce and traffic has long been an integral part of Hannibal&#x27;s development, including by river, rail and the interstate/highway system. Today the city is intersected by Interstate 72 and U.S. Routes 24, 36, and 61. Hannibal is approximately northwest of St. Louis (also bordering the Mississippi), east-northeast of Kansas City and miles east of Saint Joseph (both cities on the Missouri River), and approximately west of Springfield, Illinois.

Hannibal is not the county seat, but it has one of two county courthouses. There is also one in Palmyra, the county seat of Marion County, which is located more centrally in the county. Hannibal is the principal city of the Hannibal, Missouri micropolitan area, which consists of both Marion and Ralls counties.

==History and landmarks==

The site of Hannibal was originally inhabited by various cultures of indigenous Native American tribes. Hannibal is home to Osterhout Mounds Park, a preservation of ancient Indian burial mounds.

The river community was the mid-19th-century boyhood home of author Samuel Langhorne Clemens (aka Mark Twain, 1835–1910). Twain drew from his childhood settings for his novels &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876) and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884). Numerous historical sites are associated with Mark Twain and the places depicted in his fiction.

Heritage tourism contributes to the Hannibal economy, as the city attracts both American and international tourists. The Mark Twain Boyhood Home &amp; Museum marked its 100th anniversary in 2012; it has had visitors from all 50 states and some 60 countries.

===Background===
After the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi in 1803, European-American settlers began to enter the area. Its early European settlements were established by ethnic French colonists, some from Illinois, who largely spoke French and were Roman Catholic in religion.

Hannibal was laid out in 1819 by Moses Bates and named after Hannibal Creek (later Bear Creek). The name is derived from Hannibal, a hero of ancient Carthage (in modern Tunisia).

The city grew slowly, with a population of 30 by 1830. But by 1846, Hannibal was Missouri&#x27;s third-largest city when the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad was organized by John M. Clemens (Mark Twain&#x27;s father) and associates. This railway was built to connect to St. Joseph, Missouri, in the west, then the state&#x27;s second-largest city. This railroad was the westernmost line before the Transcontinental Railroad was constructed. It transported mail for delivery to the first outpost of the Pony Express.

Construction of railroads to the area and increased steamboats on the Mississippi River had stimulated growth. In 1843 the city had also annexed the town of South Hannibal. Hannibal gained &quot;city&quot; status by 1845. By 1850 it had 2,020 residents.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city served as a regional marketing center for livestock and grain, as well as other products produced locally, such as cement and shoes. Cement for the Empire State Building (completed 1931) and Panama Canal was manufactured at the Atlas Portland Cement Company in the nearby unincorporated company town of Ilasco.

The Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse was constructed in 1933 as a public works project under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It has been lit on ceremonial occasions at three separate times by Presidents Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton. Rockcliffe Mansion, a private house on a knoll in Hannibal, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2011, the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum released &quot;Mark Twain: Words &amp; Music&quot;, a CD featuring entertainers who recount Mark Twain&#x27;s life in spoken word and song. Several songs were written especially for the project and refer to Hannibal, including &quot;Huck Finn Blues&quot; by Brad Paisley and &quot;Run Mississippi&quot; by Rhonda Vincent. Other artists include Jimmy Buffett as Huckleberry Finn, Clint Eastwood as Twain, and Garrison Keillor as the narrator of the project.

<doc id="150759" wikidata="Q961229" url="?curid=150759" title="Sikeston, Missouri">
<text>Sikeston is a city located both in southern Scott County and northern New Madrid County, in the state of Missouri, United States. It is situated just north of the &quot;Missouri Bootheel&quot;, although many locals consider Sikeston a part of it. By way of Interstate 55, Interstate 57, and U.S. Route 60, Sikeston is close to the halfway point between St. Louis and Memphis, Tennessee and is four hours from Nashville.

The city is named after John Sikes, who founded it in 1860. It is the principal city of the Sikeston Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of all of Scott County, and has a total population of 41,143.

As of the 2020 census, the city population was 16,291, making it the fourth-most populous city in Missouri&#x27;s 8th Congressional district behind Cape Girardeau, Rolla, and Farmington, and just ahead of Poplar Bluff which has had a similar population as Sikeston over the last few decades. Before the 2010 census, it had been the second-most populous city in the congressional district.

==History==
The first explorers and settlers came to a region of cypress swamps and forested prairies. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Little River Drainage District was formed to reclaim the land. This was the world&#x27;s largest drainage project, moving more earth than completed during the construction of the Panama Canal.

In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto may have stood upon the Sikeston Ridge, although some historical references dispute this, believing that he traveled further south than Sikeston. The area was claimed by the French as part of La Louisiane, and they ceded it in 1763 to the Spanish after being defeated by Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1789, by order of the King of Spain, an overland route was laid out to connect the cities of St. Louis and New Orleans. This frontier road was known as the El Camino Real or King&#x27;s Highway.

In 1803 the United States acquired this area under the Louisiana Purchase. More Americans began to settle west of the river. From December 16, 1811, to February 4, 1812, the area was struck by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes (a series of more than 2,000 events). They are believed by some to have been the greatest in North American history.

The Hunter Memorial Cemetery, located on the grounds of the local Presbyterian Church, was established around 1812 after the New Madrid earthquake by Joseph Hunter II who served under George Rogers Clark during the Revolutionary War and on the Territorial Council for President Madison. In 1814, the village of Winchester was laid out about one-half a mile south of the future site of Sikeston. It was the seat of justice for New Madrid County, but after the county seat was moved in 1822 to New Madrid, Winchester became defunct and abandoned. The Winchester jail was completed in 1817 and was used until December 1821, when Scott County was organized.

The land for the city of Sikeston was first owned by Frenchman Francis Paquette. In 1829, the city site was acquired by the Stallcup family. In 1859, city founder John Sikes, who had married into the Stallcup family, gained control of the land. In April 1860, he had the city platted in anticipation of the completion of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad, which would intersect with the King&#x27;s Highway. In the city of New Madrid, the street was known as Big Prairie Road, and later as Sikeston Road after the city of Sikeston was established.

Today Kingshighway, also known as Business U.S. Highway 61, serves Sikeston as a primary north–south street. It is lined with businesses and older historic homes. Sikeston&#x27;s downtown area includes Malone Park, the city&#x27;s oldest park, and the historic First Methodist Church columns. These six pillars are all that remain of the 1879 church which was destroyed in 1968 by fire.

The first house in Sikeston is believed to have been located at 318 Baker Lane. The &quot;Baker House&quot; was probably built in 1855, about five years before the town was founded. One of the early inhabitants of this house was Lee Hunter, after whom one of the elementary schools is named. The house once had a large barn, located on the site where Lee Hunter school was later built. The Baker family moved into the house in 1888 and purchased it from the Hunter family in the early 1950s.

===Civil War era===
Although Sikeston was a small village during the Civil War, its position at the railroad and highway intersection gave it strategic significance. Around July 1861, Confederate forces of Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow planned to link up with units commanded by Sterling Price and Benjamin McCulloch for an advance on St. Louis, using the Sikeston-area road of Kingshighway. In preparation for this advance, Confederate General Jeff Thompson gathered Missouri state troops and irregulars near Sikeston; he robbed a bank in nearby Charleston to pay men and buy arms and supplies. Legend has it that he hid part of his money in Sikeston under one of the oak trees at the corner of New Madrid Street and Kingshighway.

In the fall of 1861, General Pillow pushed a column of troops from New Madrid towards Sikeston and Cape Girardeau. On October 4, Confederate General Jeff Thompson reached Sikeston, planning to strike Cape Girardeau; however, his manpower was limited, and he decided to retreat into the swamps off to the west. On November 3, from Cairo, Illinois, US Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant wrote a letter to Colonel Richard J. Oglesby, commander of the Union Headquarters District Southeast Missouri at Bird&#x27;s Point, ordering his troops to &quot;strike for Sikeston&quot; from the Mississippi River town of Commerce. Brigadier General Benjamin Prentiss and Colonel W. H. L. Wallace also converged in the Sikeston area in preparation of Grant&#x27;s attack at the Battle of Belmont.

In 1862, Sikeston was used as a transportation connection as Union Brigadier General Pope sent his artillery across the river to Commerce, Missouri, to be sent by rail to Sikeston for cart transportation to New Madrid, in preparation for the Battle of Island Number Ten. On February 28, 1862, Pope left Commerce with his army of 12,000, arriving in Sikeston on March 2. US Colonel William Pitt Kellogg, future governor of Louisiana, commanding the 7th Illinois cavalry, was the first to encounter the rebel sabotage of recently burned bridges and other obstructions. The federals were attacked just south of Sikeston by a small group of rebels led by General Thompson (he was called the Swamp Fox, a nickname after the Revolutionary War Brigadier General Francis Marion). Thompson commanded a detachment of 85 horsemen and four to six experimental cannons that had been manufactured in Memphis. Seeing that Colonel James Morgan&#x27;s Illinois troops were reinforced by Brigadier General Schuyler Hamilton&#x27;s 2nd Division, Thompson fled.

Entering the area from Bird&#x27;s Point, Brigadier General Eleazor Arthur Paine, commander of the 4th Division of Army of the Mississippi, repaired the railroad and telegraph lines and used troops from Illinois to form a garrison for Sikeston, Bertrand, and Charleston. War records indicate that on March 31, 1862, there were six Union officers and 143 Union soldiers present in Sikeston. On September 22, 1864, during Price&#x27;s Raid, a Confederate force of 1,500 men near Sikeston, under the command of Colonel William Lafayette Jeffers, attacked Captain Lewis Sells&#x27; company of Union soldiers who were moving from Cape Girardeau to reinforce two companies of soldiers in Bloomfield.

===Post Civil War era===
One of the first rail lines west of the Mississippi River ran to Sikeston, and it was the terminus of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad until 1872. By 1900, Sikeston had a population of 1,100, and two drainage ditches had been completed. By this time, the city had two banks, two newspapers, and three hotels. One of the hotels built between 1895 and 1898 was a three-story brick hotel later known as the Marshall-Dunn Hotel. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Prominent individuals who stayed at this hotel included Harry S. Truman, Alben W. Barkley, and Tom Pendergast.

===World Wars era===
During World War I, an infantry company was organized in Sikeston on August 25, 1917, until the spring of 1919. Company K became part of the 140th Infantry, 70th Brigade, U.S. 35th Infantry Division and fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. It also served as part of the occupation force of Europe. In 1920, American Legion Post 114 was chartered for the community of Sikeston and named after Henry Meldrun, a Sikeston native who was killed in Europe during World War I. Between the two world wars, Company K was reorganized. The company helped secure rail centers during the railroad workers&#x27; strike of 1922, helped out with the aftermath of the Poplar Bluff tornado of May 1927, and worked on the Mississippi River levees during the floods of 1927 and 1937. In 1941, Company K was sent to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, near Little Rock, where they drilled for eight months.

The Sikeston Memorial Municipal Airport was built in the 1930s, opening in July 1934. From 1940 until 1944, it was known as Harvey Parks Airport. Long barrack-style buildings were constructed to hold the Missouri Institute of Aeronautics, established after General Hap Arnold asked flight training operations to triple their enrollments. The first U.S. Army Air Corps inspection officials arrived in July 1940 with the first flight cadet arriving that September. In June 1940, a home at West Gladys and New Madrid streets was transformed into a district infirmary in coordination with the building of the new air barracks. World War II flying aces Robert S. Johnson and Harold E. Comstock trained at this location. The original gated entrance to Harvey Parks Airport now serves as the entrance to the city&#x27;s Veterans Park.

During World War II, local National Guard unit Company K was assigned to the Western Defense Command in California. Sikeston-area students helped raise money to have three B-25 bombers named the &quot;Spirit of Sikeston&quot;, &quot;The Sikeston Bulldog&quot;, and one other. These three planes were supposedly used in the Doolittle Raid, during which they went down and are at the bottom of the Pacific between Japan and China. The local International Shoe Company factory had a contract for a major shoe order for the US Army during the war.

==== Lynching of Cleo Wright ====

Sikeston was the site of the first lynching to occur in the United States since the onset of World War II. In the early hours of Sunday, January 25, 1942, a Black man named Cleo Wright was arrested on charges of allegedly assaulting a white woman. Upon resisting arrest, Wright was shot several times by a city night marshal. The local General Hospital refused to admit Wright for treatment of his injuries due to his race. Police initially brought the ailing Wright to his home to die, but later returned him to the city jail, where a white mob abducted Wright in the early afternoon and burned him alive in front of two Black church congregations. The lynching spurred the first ever federal investigation into a civil rights matter, though no indictments were made.

===Post World War era===
Following World War II, Miner was founded as the next city. The city was first known as Minner, in honor of one of the original residing landowners. However, the name was altered when the railroad inadvertently omitted an &quot;n&quot; from the switching station, renaming it Miner Switch. In 1951, the city became incorporated due to modern-day pioneer William Howard McGill.

In 2000, the remains of Mason Yarbrough, a Sikeston native and World War II marine, were found in the Pacific area on Makin Island and returned to his hometown for a military funeral. The George E. Day Parkway is named for Medal of Honor recipient Colonel George E. &quot;Bud&quot; Day, an F-100 Super Sabre pilot who is the only known American POW to escape into South Vietnam.

<doc id="150760" wikidata="Q1236821" url="?curid=150760" title="Ermolao Barbaro">
<text>Ermolao Barbaro, in Latin Hermolaus Barbarus (21 May 145414 June 1493), was a Venetian Renaissance humanist, diplomat and churchman. From 1491, he was the patriarch of Aquileia. He is often called &quot;the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his cousin, Ermolao Barbaro the Elder.

==Education==
Ermolao Barbaro was born in Venice, the son of Zaccaria Barbaro, and the grandson of Francesco Barbaro. He was also the uncle of Daniele Barbaro and Marcantonio Barbaro

Much of his early education was outside of Venice, accompanying his father who was an active politician and diplomat. He received further education in Verona with an uncle, also named Ermolao. In 1462 he was sent to Rome, where he studied under Pomponius Laetus and Theodorus Gaza. By 1468 he had returned to Verona, where Frederick III awarded him a laurel crown for his poetry.

He completed his education at the University of Padua, where he was appointed professor of philosophy there in 1477. Two years later he revisited Venice, but returned to Padua when the plague broke out in his native city.

==Career==
Barbaro had an active political career, though he resented these duties as a distraction from his studies. In 1483 he was elected to the Senate of the Republic of Venice. He was twenty when he gave the funeral oration for Doge Nicholas Marcello in 1474.

In 1486, he was sent to the court of the Duchy of Burgundy in Bruges. In 1488 he held the important civil post of &quot;Savio di Terrafirma&quot;. In 1489 he was appointed ambassador to the Duchy of Milan and in 1490 he was appointed Ambassador to the Holy See. In 1491, Pope Innocent VIII, nominated him to the office of Patriarch of Aquileia. 

It was illegal under Venetian law for ambassadors to accept gifts or positions of foreign heads of state. There was also a dispute between Venice and the Papacy as to who should nominate Patriarchs of Aquileia. Barbaro was accused of treason and the Venetian Senate ordered him to refuse the position. Pope Innocent and his successor Alexander VI threatened to excommunicate Barbaro if he resigned as Patriarch of Aquileia.

The Venetian Senate revoked Barbaro&#x27;s appointment as ambassador and exiled him from Venice. They threatened the same for his father, Zaccaria, as well as confiscation of both men&#x27;s property, but Zaccaria died shortly afterwards.

Barbaro then lived in a Roman villa on the Pincian Hill belonging to his brothers Daniele and Ludovico. He died there of the plague in 1493 and was buried at the church of Santa Maria del Popolo. Ferdinando Ughelli mentions an inscription to Barbaro there, but it was lost by 1758. Valeriano wrote a tribute to Barbaro.

==Scholarly works==
Barbaro edited and translated a number of classical works: Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; and &quot;Politics&quot; (1474); Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetorica&quot; (1479);Themistius&#x27;s &quot;Paraphrases&quot; of certain works of Aristotle (1481);&quot;Castigationes in Pomponium Melam&quot; (1493).

His own work, &quot;De Coelibatu&quot; was less influential, but Barbaro&#x27;s &quot;Castigationes Plinianae&quot;, published in Rome in 1492 by Eucharius Silber, was perhaps his most influential work. In this discussion of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; Barbaro made 5000 corrections to the text. The work was written in only twenty months and dedicated to the newly elected Pope Alexander VI. &quot;Castigationes Plinianae&quot; was considered by Barbaro&#x27;s contemporaries to be the most authoritative work on Pliny. Even before his death, he was considered a leading authority on the Greek and Latin works of antiquity. Erasmus frequently cited Barbaro&#x27;s works, often with respect.

His letters to Giovanni Pico were also widely circulated. Much of his work was published after his death: &quot;In Dioscuridem Corollarii libri quinque&quot;, a work on Dioscorides, in 1516, his translations of Aristotle in 1544, and &quot;Compendium Scientiae Naturalis&quot; in 1545.

Barbaro&#x27;s work &quot;De Officio Legati&quot; was representative of a revolution in the conduct of diplomacy which took place during the Renaissance.

<text>Braathens ASA, until 1997 Braathens South American &amp; Far East Airtransport A/S and trading as Braathens SAFE, was a Norwegian airline which operated from 1946 until it merged with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) in 2004 to become SAS Braathens. For most of its history, Braathens was the largest domestic airline in Norway, but did not operate an international network for many years. Its main hubs were Oslo Airport, Fornebu and later Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, and briefly Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. The airline operated 118 aircraft of 15 models, mostly Boeing 737 variants. Braathens served 53 airports and 50 cities with scheduled services through its history.

The airline was founded in 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen and originally used a fleet of Douglas DC-4 aircraft on routes to the Far East and South Africa. From 1954 the airline was forced to operate all its scheduled flights domestically, where it used de Havilland Herons. Braathens SAFE retained an international charter service using the DC-3 and DC-6. As new domestic airports were built, Braathens SAFE and SAS were awarded each their share of monopoly route concessions. The Fokker F-27 was introduced in 1958, but was phased out with the delivery of the Fokker F-28 and Boeing 737-200 jets from 1969. The last F-27 was phased out in 1975. After a two-year use of Boeing 767 aircraft, Braathens operated an all-Boeing 737 fleet from 1986.

Increased domestic competition on routes started from 1987, along with Braathens SAFE again starting international routes. By 1994 the fleet had been replaced with Boeing 737-400 and -500 and domestic deregulation of the airline market was introduced. Braathens followed up by listing itself on the Oslo Stock Exchange, joining an alliance with Dutch airline KLM and expanding its operations to Sweden through purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. The 1998 opening of Gardermoen resulted in an intense price war with SAS and Color Air, from which Braathens never recovered financially. Braathens was controlled by Braganza until 2001, when it was sold to the SAS Group. Braathens merged with SAS Norway on 1 May 2004.

==History==
===Far East===
Braathens South American &amp; Far East Airtransport A/S was founded on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his shipping company Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and its holding company Braganza. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission. His initial intentions were to fly crew and supplies to his and others ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East. Braathen traveled to the United States, where he bought several used 44-passenger Douglas C-54 (DC-4) aircraft from the United States Air Force. Twenty pilots were recruited and sent to Fort Worth for certification. The first plane, LN-HAV &quot;Norse Explorer&quot;, landed at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 26 December 1946.
The first service run from Oslo to Cairo via Copenhagen and Paris on 30 January 1947. Various charter services were provided, such as evacuating French and British personnel prior to the creation of Israel. The first Braathens SAFE flight was to the Far East started on 24 February from Oslo, with landings at Amsterdam, Marseille, Cairo, Basra, Karachi, Calcutta and Bangkok before Hong Kong, where &quot;Norske Skyfarer&quot; landed on 8 March. Total flight time was 46 hours. The only other services to the Far East from Europe were operated by KLM and British Overseas Airways Corporation. The regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days, including overnighting in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York City and one to Johannesburg. Douglas DC-3 aircraft were introduced the same year for shorter charters. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. By 1948 the airline had weekly trips to the Far East.

The partially state-owned Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) was granted a monopoly on all domestic and international flights during the late 1940s. They started the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) cooperation and stated that they would start a route to the Far East. Braathens SAFE&#x27;s charters were by 1948 so regular that a concession would be needed. SAS demanded preferential treatment, but Braathens SAFE threatened to flag out and the government gave them a concession that lasted until 1954, on condition they establish a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The airline chose at the same time to move its main base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu.
The SAS cooperation resulted in a full merger from 1951, after a merger proposal from Braathens SAFE had been rejected. Braathens SAFE made proposals to expand its routes to New York and Tokyo, but both were rejected by the government. The SAS merger bound the government to issue the Far East concession to SAS, and Braathens lost their international service rights then. Braathens SAFE started cooperating with Icelandic Loftleidir, who held the rights to fly to North America via Iceland. This involved Braathens leasing personnel and aircraft to Loftleidir and profit sharing on the route, in an agreement which lasted until 1961.

===Domestic operations with Herons and Fellowships===

Charter flights to Europe using Douglas DC-6 aircraft started in 1950. The airline applied for and was granted permission to fly from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. Braathens acquired de Havilland Heron aircraft to operate the route. Permission to fly from Oslo to Trondheim Airport, Lade was granted in 1953, a route also served by SAS. Termination of Far East routes led to a 90% drop in revenue and the airline made several unsuccessful applications for new routes. They were successful in obtaining permission include stopovers on Oslo–Stavanger services at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and Farsund Airport, Lista. From 1956 stopovers took place at Hamar Airport, Stafsberg and Notodden Airport, Tuven, but these only lasted until 1959. By then it had added Røros Airport to its destinations. Following the bankruptcy of West Norway Airlines in 1957 and the opening of Ålesund Airport, Vigra the following year, concessions were reshuffled, and Braathens was granted a monopoly on services to Ålesund and between Trondheim and Bergen, while it and SAS would compete on services between Oslo and Stavanger, Kristiansand and Trondheim.
Braathens SAFE was the second airline to take delivery of the Fokker F-27 Friendship. The Friendships, which replaced the DC-3 and Herons were turboprops with pressurized cabins. The first aircraft was delivered in 1958 and the model was put into service on the main routes. Service to Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg stopped because their runways were too short. Braathens started charter flights to Longyearbyen in 1959, landing on an improvised snow runway. Scheduled service between Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark was introduced in 1960. In 1967 Braathens SAFE was granted permission to continue their service between Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim northwards to Bodø Airport and Tromsø Airport.

Saga Tours started selling Mediterranean charter trips in 1959 and Braathens SAFE operated the flights. At first the DC-4 was used, but from 1961 the airline used the 96-seat Douglas DC-6, reaching seven aircraft in 1967. Braathens bought strategic stakes in both Saga Tours and Sweden&#x27;s Atlas Resor to secure their share of the charter market. Multilateral agreements allowed any Scandinavian airline to fly charter services from any of the three Scandinavian countries to Spain; while this allowed Braathens SAFE to enter the Swedish and Danish charter market, it increased competition on their home turf.

===Entering the Jet Age===

Braathens SAFE ordered three Boeing 737-200 jets in 1965, which were intended to rationalize charter operations. The shorter -100 model was rejected in favor of becoming the launch customer of the Fokker F-28 Fellowship, which was planned as the new domestic workhorse. The move would see all the F-27 replaced with F-28. Both jet aircraft were delivered in 1969. This period also saw the gradual retirement of the DC-4 and DC-6.

Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget opened in 1970 and Molde Airport, Årø in 1972, with Braathens SAFE granted permission to operate the routes. The airline also received permission to operate from Bergen via either Ålesund, Molde or Kristiansund to Bodø and Tromsø. Between 1975 and 1977, the last three F-27 were sold to sister airline Busy Bee, which took over some of the smallest services. &quot;Green Routes&quot; were introduced from 1976, which offered discounts on certain flights with strict conditions. Founder Ludvig G. Braathen died on 27 December 1976, while still acting as chief executive officer (CEO). He was replaced by his son Bjørn G. Braathen. During the 1970s, Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s, including one with a cargo door, and three with extended range which allowed for non-stop flights to the Canary Islands. Discounted &quot;summer tickets&quot; were introduced from the early 1980s which increased load factor.
Braathens SAFE bought 15 percent of DNL in 1982 and applied for concessions for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. This resulted in the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applying for all of Braathens SAFE&#x27;s western Norway routes. Neither application was successful. Busy Bee was contracted in 1984 to connect Farsund, Haugesund Airport, Karmøy, Bergen and Stavanger, as well as operate from Sandefjord Airport, Torp.

In an attempt to remain competitive in the charter market from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, the airline ordered two Boeing 767-200 in 1980. They were configured with 242 seats, fewer than for most charter airlines, which typically had 273. The aircraft were delivered in 1984.
 Launched as &quot;First Business Class&quot; to charter travelers, the business model was unsuccessful as new customer groups had little willingness to pay. The company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the lower number of seats, but could not put in the extra seats because the aircraft were also used for scheduled flights. As a result, the two aircraft were sold in 1986, and the airline&#x27;s Swedish charter operations closed in 1988.
The four remaining F-28s were also sold in 1986, giving Braathens SAFE a unified 737-200 fleet, reducing operating costs. Six more 737-200 were delivered in 1986. On 1 June 1989, Erik G. Braathen, son of Bjørn G., took over as CEO at the age of 34. With the launch of the Boeing 737 Classic range, Braathens took delivery of the 156-seat 737-400 and the 124-seat 737-500, both featuring glass cockpits. The larger model was mostly used for charter services, while the smaller was mostly used in the domestic market. The first -400 was delivered in 1989 and the first -500 the following year. By 1994 all -200 had been retired.

===Deregulation===

The first stages towards deregulation started in 1987 with Braathens SAFE being permitted to compete with SAS on the Oslo–Bergen and Western Norway–Trondheim–Bodø–Tromsø route, plus once daily Oslo–Trondheim–Bodø, as well as Tromsø–Longyearbyen, in an attempt to increase domestic competition. From 1988, Braathens SAFE was granted a series of international route concessions. The first, to Billund, Denmark, started in 1989, and the second, to Newcastle, started the following year. A route to Malmö, Sweden, started in 1991 and on a week&#x27;s notice in 1992, Braathens SAFE started flying to London Gatwick Airport, after the bankruptcies of Norway Airlines and Dan-Air. Busy Bee went bankrupt in 1993 and their regional services were instead subcontracted to Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Braathens Helikopter was established by Braganza in 1989 after negotiating agreements with Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This was the first time the incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered. Services started on 1 September 1990. In 1992 the helicopter airline signed an agreement to fly for British Petroleum to Ula and Gyda. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 that the two companies would merge from 1 January 1994.

The deregulation process, which would eliminate the need for concessions for routes, was driven by Norway&#x27;s application for membership of the European Union. Since the airline&#x27;s conception, Braathens SAFE had been a staunch opponent to the concession system and an avid proponent of free competition in the airline industry. With a deregulation around the corner, the airline changed stance and warned against the consequences of a free market. In contrast, SAS embraced the new system. Braathens SAFE&#x27;s main concern was that their high debt incurred after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war.
The airline started negotiating airline alliance with larger haulers, but turned both those and a merger proposal with SAS down. The Norwegian airline market was deregulated on 1 April 1994, as the third country in Europe.
Both Braathens SAFE and SAS had been cross-subsidizing their routes as part of the concession agreements, and Braathens SAFE was losing money on the Haugesund–Bergen route and flights to Røros. A three-year wage agreement was reached with the trade unions to keep costs down, and the company raised additional capital in an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braganza retained 69% of the company. On 1 April, service frequencies increased on the Oslo–Bergen route and the airline introduced direct flights from Oslo to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, later supplemented with direct services to Bodø. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim. Braathens signed agreements with many of Norway&#x27;s large companies in 1995 in exchange for large discounts.

===SAFE goes &quot;Back&quot;===
The airline bought Transwede Airways in 1996, the second-largest domestic airline in Sweden. The goal was to integrate the networks, starting on 18 June with a new service between the two capital cities, one of SAS&#x27; most profitable. Braathens announced in 1997 the order of six 134-seat Boeing 737-700, while Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with 737s. Transwede changed its name to Braathens Sverige later that year.
From 1998 Braathens SAFE started a strategic partnership with Dutch airline KLM, with KLM purchasing thirty percent of Braathens SAFE and Braathens SAFE taking over most of KLM&#x27;s routes between Norway and Amsterdam. London services were moved to London Stansted Airport. The KLM agreement came as a response to SAS founding the Star Alliance along with among others Lufthansa.

On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE changed its name and corporate identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company&#x27;s new logo. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced—Best and Back—with the latter being offered to discounted ticket-holders. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens&#x27;, including complimentary service. Braathens bought Malmö Aviation on 17 August 1998, which operated eleven British Aerospace 146 jets between Stockholm-Bromma Airport, Göteborg Landvetter Airport, Malmö Airport and London City Airport.
Color Air was established as a domestic low-cost airline by Olav Nils Sunde in January 1998. That year also saw the closing of Fornebu and the opening of Gardermoen as the new main airport, with the move taking place on 8 October. Color Air started flights from Gardermoen on 1 August. As Gardermoen did not have the landing slot limitations as the single-runway Fornebu, the three airline set off in a craze to establish new routes. In total, the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200, and the daily seat capacity from 18,000 to 26,000. Braathens introduced a new route to Haugesund, but saw competition from SAS to Kristiansand and from two airlines to Ålesund.

By the end of 1998, it became clear that Braathens had increased capacity with 20 percent, but only achieved a 5.2 percent ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million flown seats annually between the three airlines, but only 345,000 passengers. Color Air terminated all flights and ceased operations on 27 September 1999. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20 percent. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than 1 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion.

===Fall and merger with SAS===
Arne A. Jensen took over as CEO on 23 July 1999. In February 1999, Braathens merged the Swedish division with Malmö Aviation, to create Braathens Malmö Aviation. At the same time, the airline removed the &#x27;Best&#x27; and &#x27;Back&#x27; scheme on domestic Swedish flights. In November, Braathens terminated all services in Sweden that were inherited from Transwede. The following two years saw a large increase in ticket prices and a decrease of flights. Several domestic and international routes were cut in 2001, but introduced new international services to leisure destinations.

The SAS Group and Braathens announced on 21 May 2001 that KLM and Braganza had agreed to sell their 69 percent stake in Braathens for NOK 800 million to SAS— putting Braathens&#x27; value at NOK 1.1 billion. Because the two would hold a near-monopoly on domestic services, the merger was investigated by the Norwegian Competition Authority. They initially disapproved of the merger, With bankruptcy imminent and no other purchasers interested, the authority gave the green light on 23 October. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market.
SAS and Braathens split all the routes between them on 2 April 2002. Braathens withdrew from the Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger routes, but took over most flights to Northern Norway. On 24 April 2002, SAS announced that all handling services operated by Braathens would be taken over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens&#x27; employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The issue ended in the courts, with the Supreme Court reinstating seniority in 2006. SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would in May be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens. The company took over the operating licence of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remains a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.

==Fleet==

The airline operated 118 aircraft of 15 different models. The airline has operated at least three models each from Douglas, Fokker and Boeing, in addition to the de Havilland Heron and British Aerospace 146. The airline&#x27;s most-operated aircraft is the Boeing 737-200, of which it had 20. Braathens has operated five variants of the 737, totaling 64 aircraft.

From the establishment, Braathens SAFE&#x27;s aircraft livery had a thick red and thinner white and blue cheatline, with the Flag of Norway on the vertical stabilizer. With only slight modifications, this general design was continued to and including the 737-400 and -500 aircraft. A new livery with a stylized grey wing as logo on the vertical stabilizer and a blue belly was introduced in 1998 with the delivery of the 737-700. The logo was replaced with the Flag of Norway in 1999. Only some of the early Douglas aircraft were named, and those that were started with &quot;Norse&quot;. The Heron were given common Norwegian male names. The three last F-27 and newer aircraft were all named for kings of Norway.

==Destinations==

During its operations, the airline has served 53 airports serving 50 cities. Of these, 25 airports serving 23 cities were in Norway and 6 destinations and cities in Sweden. Braathens had provided international services to 24 airports serving 22 cities in 17 countries. Seven of these cities are in Asia, the rest in Europe. In addition, Braathens has served numerous destinations as both regular and ad-hoc charter. Braathens SAFE&#x27;s main base was Oslo Airport, Gardermoen from 1946 to 1949, and then moved its main base to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From the closing of Fornebu in 1998, it moved back to Gardermoen and established it as a hub. From 1997 to 1999, Stockholm Arlanda Airport acted as a hub for Sweden. The main technical base was at Stavanger Airport, Sola.

Prior to 1987 the Norwegian aviation market was split between Braathens SAFE and SAS. The two only competed head-on on the routes from Oslo to Stavanger and Trondheim. Braathens held a monopoly on the routes from Oslo to Kristiansand, Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, as well as the West Coast route between Bergen, Ålesund, Molde, Kristiansund and Trondheim, as well as from Western Norway to Northern Norway.
With the opening of Gardermoen in 1998, Braathens had expanded its network to direct services from Oslo to Kristiansand, Stavanger, Haugesund, Bergen, Ålesund, Molde, Kristiansund, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, in addition to a network of direct routes connected many of these airports with each other. In Sweden, Braahtens operated flights from Stockholm to Luleå, Umeå, Sundsvall, Jönköping and Halmstad. From Oslo, international services were provided to Malmö, Stockholm, Billund, Newcastle, London, Jersey, Nice and Rome, and from 2000 to Barcelona, Alicante and Málaga. Service were flown from several Norwegian cities to Amsterdam.

==Service==
Prior to 1998, Braathens had a one-class service; the service included a complimentary in-flight meal and discounted tickets were available with restrictions. Starting 23 March 1998, the airline changed its corporate identity to &#x27;Braathens&#x27; and introduced a two-class system onboard its planes. Passengers paying full price were seated in the &#x27;Best&#x27; category at the front of the plane, making up about 70 percent of the capacity. Best customers received complimentary coffee and meals with non-disposable cutlery, free newspapers and a better seat pitch. Behind the curtain was the &#x27;Back&#x27; category, which had no in-flight meals or newspapers and a smaller pitch. However, a meal with coffee and soft drink could be purchased for NOK 45. Back tickets were sold with a discount, but had to be bought at least seven days before travel, and the traveller had to be away over a weekend. There were also some discounted Best tickets, but these never cost as little as the Back tickets.
The &#x27;Best&#x27; and &#x27;Back&#x27; service was highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE had a strong image as the people&#x27;s airline, in contrast to SAS&#x27; business image. Braathens also drew goodwill from being Norwegian-owned and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the segregation offended passengers: Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using &#x27;Back&#x27; tickets, while people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt they received better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. The effect was that Braathens lost customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly in the beginning of the service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.

Braathens launched its frequent-flyer program as Bracard in 1985, and rebranded it as Wings in 1999. The membership had three tiers: gold, silver and blue. Until 1997, Braathens had agreements with Finnair and British Airways, where Bracard members received miles on the partners flights. After the partnership with KLM was introduced, Wings-members received miles with KLM, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines and Alitalia.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 7 November 1956, the Heron LN-SUR &quot;Lars&quot; crashed at Hummelfjell after the aircraft had experienced icing problems. The Hummelfjell Accident killed the pilot and one passenger, but the remaining ten people on board survived. Among them was the famous television actor Rolf Kirkvaag, who, despite injury, succeeded at walking to civilization to inform about the accident.

*On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company&#x27;s most fatal accident occurred. F-28 LN-SUY &quot;Sverre Sigurdson&quot; on Flight 239 from Ålesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including the crew of three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the instrument landing system.

*On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG &quot;Harald Gille&quot; Flight 139, with 121 passengers en route from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and a press conference to make a political statement. Those demands were not met, and he surrendered after 4.5 hours after he demanded and had a few beers. This was the first hijacking in Norway.

<doc id="150765" wikidata="Q898857" url="?curid=150765" title="Branson, Missouri">
<text>Branson is a city in the U.S. state of Missouri. Most of the city is situated in Taney County, with a small portion in the west extending into Stone County. Branson is in the Ozark Mountains. The community was named after Reuben Branson, postmaster and operator of a general store in the area in the 1880s. The population was 12,638 at the 2020 census, and its population constitutes nearly one fourth of the Taney County population.

Branson has long been a popular destination for vacationers from Missouri and around the country. The collection of entertainment theaters along 76 Country Boulevard (and to a lesser extent along Shepherd of the Hills Expressway), including Dolly Parton&#x27;s Stampede, has increased Branson&#x27;s popularity as a tourist destination. Branson is the site of the Branson Cross, the largest cross monument in North America.

==History==
In 1882, Reuben Branson opened a general store and post office in the area. Branson was formally incorporated on April 1, 1912, and construction of the Powersite Dam nearby on the White River which would form Lake Taneycomo was completed.

In 1894, William Henry Lynch bought Marble Cave (renamed &quot;Marvel Cave&quot;) and began charging visitors to tour it. Hugo and Mary Herschend leased the cave for 99 years in 1950 and began hosting square dances in it. The Herschend Family modernized the cave with electricity and concrete staircases, and in 1960 the Herschends opened Silver Dollar City, a re-creation of a frontier town that featured five shops, a church, and a log cabin, with actors that played out the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys.

===Growth as a cultural attraction===
Harold Bell Wright published his novel about the Ozarks, &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot;, in 1907. The novel became an international best seller, making Wright the first millionaire author and established Branson and Southwest Missouri as a tourist destination. The Old Mill Theater began its first outdoor production based on the novel in 1960. The show, known as &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills Outdoor Drama&quot;, continued in its 61st season for 2021. The historic farm is also the home of Inspiration Tower, the Shepherd of the Hills Adventure Park as well as numerous other shows and attractions.

The Harold Bell Wright Museum is located within The World&#x27;s Largest Toy Museum complex. Mayor of Branson for 12 years and entrepreneur Jim Owen built the first theater in 1934 on Commercial Street, originally called &quot;The Hillbilly Theater&quot;, which began to attract people from far and wide to tour the area. 1959 saw the completion of Table Rock Dam on the White River, which created Table Rock Lake. In 1959, the Mabe Brothers started a band that, in 1961, would become the first music show in Branson. Taking their name from the parts they played in the Shepherd of the Hills Outdoor Drama, they became known as the Baldknobber Hillbilly Jamboree.

In 1962, Paul Henning, inspired by a Boy Scout camping trip to the Ozarks, created &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, which ran as a CBS television sitcom until 1971. Henning later donated for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson. He also donated the modified 1921 Oldsmobile truck used as the vehicle in the series to the College of the Ozarks, where it is on display in the Ralph Foster Museum.

The Presley family became the first to move their show (Presleys&#x27; Country Jubilee) to Highway 76 in 1967, followed a year later by the Baldknobbers. Eventually Branson would have more than 50 theaters, most of them located on Highway 76.

Also in 1983, the 7,500-seat Swiss Villa Amphitheatre opened in Lampe, southwest of Branson. The outdoor amphitheater brought in acts like Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, REO Speedwagon, Steppenwolf, and Ozzy Osbourne. Closing in the early 2000s, it reopened in 2010 as the Black Oak Mountain Amphitheater. Closing suddenly in 2013, it went unused until relaunching live music events in 2021.

In 1987, Boxcar Willie became the first internationally known entertainer to purchase a theater in Branson and have a permanent performance schedule there.

In 1989, Shoji Tabuchi opened his first theater in Branson (converting the Ozarks Auto Museum on West 76 Highway into a theater). He then built a new theater on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway in 1990, while Mel Tillis moved into Shoji&#x27;s old theater. In 1990-1991 several nationally known stars such as Jim Stafford, Ray Stevens, Mickey Gilley, and Moe Bandy opened their own theaters.

The Lowe Family featured their show and hosted nationally known stars like Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn, Vern Gosdin, Waylon Jennings, and others. 76 Music Hall (now known as the Grand Country Music Hall) became the first theater to have three different shows a day performing in different time slots. In 1991, local producer and entertainer Bob Nichols opened the first morning show and the following year, Buck Trent became the first nationally known star to star in a morning show.

The increasing number of theaters and other attractions opening in Branson drew the attention of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which aired an episode about Branson on December 8, 1991, and called it the &quot;live music capital of the entire universe&quot;.

Andy Williams built his theater in Branson, opening on May 1, 1992, calling it the Moon River Theatre. The Glen Campbell Goodtime Theatre opened in 1994, starring Glen along with his &quot;Goodtime Band&quot;, daughter Debbie Campbell, the Matthew Dickens Dancers, and comedian ventriloquist Jim Barber. Also headlining their own theaters were Tony Orlando (Yellow Ribbon Theater) and Bobby Vinton (Blue Velvet Theater). In 1998, the Acrobats of China arrived in Branson, making them one of the first international shows to call Branson home. They opened their theatre, the New Shanghai Theatre, in 2005. In 2006, Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Theatre opened and is the most recent new theater to be built on Route 76. Branson has continued to add theaters (the most recent being the Sight &amp; Sound Theatres) and shows; it refers to itself as &quot;the live music show capital of the world&quot;.

=== 2012 tornado ===

Just after 1 a.m. on February 29, 2012, the city of Branson sustained damage from an EF-2 tornado in the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak. At least 37 injuries were reported, most being cuts and bruises, with the most serious injury being an 80-year-old woman with a head injury. Most of the tourist attractions and businesses were undamaged and remained open after the storm, although at least 11 buildings suffered more than $3 million in total damage. As of November 2012, most of the damage was repaired. Mary Jane Rice, a spokeswoman for Branson Area Chamber of Commerce, told the AP that February is generally a slow time for business and most of the damage would be cleaned up in the next few days. The tornado followed a path from Kimberling City, Missouri, across Table Rock Lake and along the entertainment strip Missouri Route 76 (now 76 Country Boulevard) before hitting the downtown area where it blew out or cracked windows in 219 of the hotel rooms in the 12-story/295 room Hilton Branson Convention Center. The tornado extensively damaged three of Branson&#x27;s 50-plus theatres — (Americana Theater, Branson Variety Theater and Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Theater) and there was damage to portions of Branson Landing on Lake Taneycomo and the Veterans Memorial Museum. Vehicles at the Ride the Ducks water/land attraction were flipped over, but officials said they were not damaged enough to be put out of service.

<text>Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux (; 6 March 1767 – 25 June 1794) was a Girondin politician of the Revolutionary period and Freemason. He was the leader of the Fédérés and popular in the South of France. 

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born in Marseille, Barbaroux was educated at first by the local Oratorians, then studied law in Aix-en-Provence, and became a successful lawyer. In 1789 he was appointed &quot;greffier&quot; to the commune of Marseille, and in 1792 was commissioned to go to the Legislative Assembly and demand the accusation of the directorate of the &quot;département&quot; of Bouches-du-Rhône, as accomplices in a Royalist movement in Arles. 

In Paris, he was received in the Jacobin club, and contacted Jacques Pierre Brissot and Jean Marie Roland de la Platiere and his wife Madame Roland. It was at his instigation that Marseille sent to Paris the battalion of volunteers that arrived in the city singing the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;. A significant maneuver took place during the night of 4 August 1792 when volunteers from Marseille led by Barbaroux moved into the Cordeliers Convent, and contributed to the &quot;insurrection of 10 August 1792&quot;. According to Barbaroux, who visited Robespierre early August 1792, his pretty boudoir was full of images of himself in every form and art; a painting, a drawing, a bust, a relief and six physionotraces on the tables.

===Convention===

Returning to Marseille, he was elected deputy to the National Convention with 775 votes out of 776 cast. He viewed himself as an opponent of the Montagnards from the first day of sessions. On 25 and 26 September, Barbaroux and the Girondist Lasource accused Maximilien Robespierre of wanting to form a dictatorship. He attacked Jean-Paul Marat and the September Massacres, and proposed to break up the Commune of Paris. At the end of the year, he got the &quot;Act of Accusation&quot; against the king adopted, and in the trial voted for his capital punishment &quot;without appeal and without delay&quot;. He then participated in the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project. Barbaroux called for fixed salaries and fixed prices for grain and meat in April 1793. 

On 29 May 1793, Robespierre attacked Barbaroux. During the final struggle between the Girondists and the Montagnards (Insurrection of 31 May - 2 June 1793), Barbaroux refused to resign as deputy, and rejected the offer made by the sans-culottes in Paris to give hostages for the arrested representatives. On 2 June Barbaroux was declared as an enemy of the republic by Saint-Juste. He succeeded in escaping, first to Caen, where he organized the Girondist rebellion, then to Saint-Émilion, where he wrote his &quot;Mémoires&quot; (first published in 1822 by his son, and re-edited in 1866). On 18 June Élie Guadet and Jean-Baptiste Salle were arrested; Pétion de Villeneuve and Francois Buzot succeeded in killing themselves. Barbaroux attempted to shoot himself, but was only wounded. He was taken to Bordeaux, where he was guillotined once his identity was established.

<text>Big Sky is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Gallatin and Madison counties in southwestern Montana, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 3,591, up from 2,308 in 2010. It is by road southwest of Bozeman. The primary industry of the area is tourism.

==Geography==
Big Sky is located along the western edge of Gallatin County and eastern edge of Madison County approximately midway between West Yellowstone and Bozeman on U.S. Highway 191 and from the northwestern border of Yellowstone National Park. It sits within the Madison Range, with elevations in the CDP ranging from in Gallatin Canyon along U.S. 191 to over at the summit of Lone Mountain.

The &quot;Meadow&quot; area of Big Sky lies in the eastern part of the CDP in an alpine valley formed during the Cretaceous period, at a base elevation of . Initially called the &quot;Gallatin Canyon Basin&quot;, the Meadow is braided with small rivers that channel mountain snow run-off. Fishing is permitted on all of these feeders of the Gallatin River. Two ponds are found on the Middle Fork of the Gallatin that bisects the Meadow, and fishing there is permitted for those 16 and younger. Since 1993, an innovative sewer system has protected the water in the area from sewage discharge. Several agencies, such as the Gallatin River Task Force, monitor the health of the rivers.

The &quot;Mountain&quot; area of Big Sky is west of the &quot;Meadow&quot; area at a base elevation of about . The community had two large ski resorts in the &quot;Mountain&quot; area: Big Sky Resort and Moonlight Basin. In October 2013, these resorts merged: both are now managed by Big Sky Resort, and both are alpine ski and golf resorts. The combined terrain of the two resorts allows them to market themselves as the &quot;Biggest Skiing in America&quot;, with over of terrain. The Spanish Peaks Mountain Club is a ski and golf resort that has three chairlifts and 13 ski runs connecting it to Big Sky Resort at the base of Big Sky&#x27;s Southern Comfort lift. Spanish Peaks is also now owned by Big Sky Resort, in collaboration with the Yellowstone Club. Another resort, Lone Mountain Ranch, is a Nordic ski and summer resort that professionally grooms over 75 kilometers of cross-country ski trails. Yellowstone Club, a private resort, is located to the south and adjacent to Big Sky Resort.

The &quot;Canyon&quot; area of Big Sky lies in the Gallatin Canyon in the northeast part of the CDP, along the Gallatin River, a favorite for whitewater rafters and kayakers. The river, named after Albert Gallatin who was the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is a Blue Ribbon trout stream that attracts fly-fishers from around the world. Several dude ranches (320 Guest Ranch, Elkhorn Ranch, Cinnamon Lodge and 9 Quarter Circle) operate in the Gallatin Canyon.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.18%, are water. Most of the CDP drains to the east into the Gallatin River, while the westernmost portions drain west via Cedar Creek and Jack Creek to the Madison River. The Gallatin and the Madison both drain north to form the Missouri River.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Big Sky has a borderline humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) / alpine subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). for most of the area, but the lower elevations may be closer to a dry continental climate.

==Demographics==

At the 2010 census, there were 2,308 people living in the CDP. The population density was 10.1 per square mile.

==Activities==
Hiking trails thread throughout the landscape and into neighboring national forests. Camping sites are available throughout the Spanish Peaks and the Gallatin National Forest. Elk, deer, black bears, grizzlies, upland birds, waterfowl, and wolves call this area home. Hunting is prohibited in Big Sky proper, but it is permitted throughout the National Forests that surround the area. Recreational snowmobiling is also not permitted within the Meadow or Mountain terrain, but is permitted in the Gallatin Canyon and in areas to the south of Big Sky.

The Crail Ranch Buildings, built by Montana pioneer Frank Crail and his family, offer a glimpse of life in Big Sky more than 100 years ago. The authentic cabins are preserved as part of the Crail Ranch Homestead Museum. The museum displays artifacts, photographs and documents, along with extensive information about the pioneer Crail and Creek families.

==Education==
The Gallatin County portion of the CDP is in Big Sky School K-12. The Madison County portion is in Ennis K-12 Schools school district.

In addition to the Big Sky School District #72 and the Ennis district, Big Sky has a preK-12 non-profit private school, Big Sky Discovery Academy.

<text>Tilden is a city in Madison and Antelope counties in Nebraska, United States. The population was 992 at the 2020 census. The Madison County portion of Tilden is part of the Norfolk Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Tilden was originally called &quot;Burnett&quot;, under which name it was laid out by the railroad in 1880.

<doc id="150780" wikidata="Q316039" url="?curid=150780" title="Haakon IV">
<text>Haakon IV Haakonsson ( – 16 December 1263; ; ), sometimes called Haakon the Old in contrast to his namesake son, was King of Norway from 1217 to 1263. His reign lasted for 46 years, longer than any Norwegian king since Harald Fairhair. Haakon was born into the troubled civil war era in Norway, but his reign eventually managed to put an end to the internal conflicts. At the start of his reign, during his minority, Earl Skule Bårdsson served as regent. As a king of the Birkebeiner faction, Haakon defeated the uprising of the final Bagler royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung, in 1227. He put a definitive end to the civil war era when he had Skule Bårdsson killed in 1240, a year after he had himself proclaimed king in opposition to Haakon. Haakon thereafter formally appointed his own eldest son, Haakon the Young, as his co-regent.

Under Haakon&#x27;s rule, medieval Norway is considered to have reached its zenith or golden age. His reputation and formidable naval fleet allowed him to maintain friendships with both the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, despite their conflict. He was at different points offered the imperial crown by the pope, the High Kingship of Ireland by a delegation of Irish kings, and the command of the French crusader fleet by the French king. He amplified the influence of European culture in Norway by importing and translating contemporary European literature into Old Norse, and by constructing monumental European-style stone buildings. In conjunction with this he employed an active and aggressive foreign policy, and at the end of his rule added Iceland and the Norse Greenland community to his kingdom, leaving the Norwegian realm at its territorial height. Although he for the moment managed to secure Norwegian control of the islands off the northern and western shores of Scotland, plus the Isle of Man, he fell ill and died when wintering in Orkney following some military engagements with the expanding Kingdom of Scotland. He was succeeded by his second son, Magnus VI. 

==Historical sources==
The main source of information concerning Haakon is the &quot;Saga of Haakon Haakonsson&quot;, which was written in the years immediately following his death. Commissioned by his son Magnus, it was written by the Icelandic writer and politician Sturla Þórðarson (nephew of the famous historian Snorri Sturluson). Having come into conflict with the royal representative in Iceland, Sturla came to Norway in 1263 in an attempt to reconcile with Haakon. When he arrived, he learned that Haakon was in Scotland, and that Magnus ruled Norway in his place. While Magnus initially took an unfriendly attitude towards Sturla, his talents as a story-teller and skald eventually won him the favour of Magnus and his men. The saga is considered the most detailed and reliable of all sagas concerning Norwegian kings, building on both written archive material and oral information from individuals who had been close to Haakon. It is nonetheless written openly in support of the political program of the House of Sverre, and the legitimacy of Haakon&#x27;s kingship.

==Background and childhood==

Haakon was born in Folkenborg (now in Eidsberg) to Inga of Varteig in the summer of 1204, probably in March or April. The father was widely regarded to have been King Haakon Sverresson, as Inga had been with Haakon in his hostel in Borg (now Sarpsborg) in late 1203. King Haakon was the leader of the Birkebeiner faction in the ongoing civil war against the Bagler faction. He was dead by the time his son Haakon was born (many believed to have been poisoned by his Swedish stepmother Margaret), but Inga&#x27;s claim was supported by several of the king&#x27;s followers. Haakon was born in Bagler-controlled territory, and his mother&#x27;s claim placed them in a dangerous position. When the Baglers started hunting Haakon, a group of Birkebeiners fled with the child in the winter of 1205/06, heading for Inge Bårdsson, the new Birkebeiner king in Nidaros (now Trondheim). As the party was struck by a blizzard, two of the best Birkebeiner skiers, Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, carried on with the child over the mountain from Lillehammer to Østerdalen. They eventually managed to bring Haakon to safety with King Inge; this particular event is commemorated in modern-day Norway by the popular annual skiing event &quot;Birkebeinerrennet&quot;. Haakon&#x27;s dramatic childhood was often parallelled with that of former king Olaf Tryggvasson (who introduced Christianity to Norway), as well as with the gospels and Child Jesus, which served an important ideological function for his kingship.

In the saga, Haakon is described as bright and witty, and as being small for his age. When he was three years old, he was captured by the Baglers but refused to call the Bagler king Philip Simonsson his lord (he nonetheless came from the capture unharmed). When he learned at the age of eight that King Inge Bårdsson and his brother Earl Haakon the Crazy had made an agreement for the succession to the throne that excluded himself, Haakon pointed out that the agreement was invalid due to his attorney not having been present. He subsequently identified his attorney as &quot;God and Saint Olaf.&quot; Haakon was notably the first Norwegian king to receive formal education at a school. From the late civil war era, the government administration relied increasingly on written communication, which in turn demanded literate leaders. When Haakon was in Bergen under the care of Haakon the Crazy, he began his education at the age of seven, likely at the Bergen Cathedral School. He continued his education under King Inge at the Trondheim Cathedral School after the Earl&#x27;s death in 1214. Haakon was brought up alongside Inge&#x27;s son Guttorm, and they were treated as the same. When he was eleven, some of Haakon&#x27;s friends provoked the king by asking him to give Haakon a region to govern. When Haakon was approached by the men and was urged to take up arms against Inge, he rejected it in part because of his young age and its bad prospects, as well as because he believed it would be morally wrong to fight Inge and thus split the Birkebeiner. He instead said that he prayed that God would give him his share of his father&#x27;s inheritance when the time was right.

==Reign==
===Succession struggle===
After King Inge&#x27;s death in 1217, a succession dispute erupted. Haakon was supported by the majority of Birkebeiners, including the veterans who had served under his father and grandfather. Other candidates included Inge&#x27;s illegitimate son Guttorm (who dropped out very soon); Inge&#x27;s half-brother Earl Skule Bårdsson, who had been appointed leader of the king&#x27;s &quot;hird&quot; at Inge&#x27;s deathbed and was supported by the Archbishop of Nidaros as well as part of the Birkebeiners; and Haakon the Crazy&#x27;s son, Knut Haakonsson. With his widespread popular support in Trøndelag and western Norway, Haakon was proclaimed king at Øyrating in June 1217. He was later the same year hailed as king at Gulating in Bergen, and at Haugating, Borgarting and local things east of Elven (Göta Älv). While Skule&#x27;s supporters initially had attempted to cast doubt about Haakon&#x27;s royal ancestry, they eventually suspended open resistance to his candidacy. As the dispute could have divided the Birkebeiners, Skule settled on becoming regent for Haakon during his minority.
In connection with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon&#x27;s mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The result of the trial strengthened the legal basis for his kingship, and improved his relationship with the Church. The saga&#x27;s claim that Haakon already had been generally accepted as king in 1217/18 has however been contested by modern historians such as Sverre Bagge. Skule and Haakon increasingly drifted apart in their administration, and Skule focused mainly on governing Eastern Norway after 1220, which he had gained the right to rule in 1218 as his third of the Norwegian kingdom. From 1221 to 1223, Haakon and Skule separately issued letters as rulers of Norway, and maintained official contacts abroad. In 1223 a great meeting of bishops, clergy, secular nobles, and other high-ranking figures from all across the country was held in Bergen to decide finally on Haakon&#x27;s right to the throne. Other candidates to the throne were present either personally or through attorneys, but Haakon was in the end unanimously confirmed as King of Norway by the court.

The last Bagler king Philip Simonsson died in 1217. Speedy political and military manoeuvering by Skule led to a reconciliation between the Birkebeiners and Baglers, and thus the reunification of the kingdom. However, some discontented Baglers found a new royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung, and launched a new rising from 1219. The rising only gained support in parts of Eastern Norway, and was did not gain control of Viken and Opplandene as the Baglers formerly had done. In the summer of 1223, Skule forced the Ribbungar to surrender. However, The great meeting in Bergen soon after renewed the division of the Norwegian kingdom, with Skule gaining control of the northern third of the country instead of the east, in what marked a setback despite his military victory. In 1224, Sigurd escaped from Skule&#x27;s custody, and Haakon was left to fight him alone as the new ruler of Eastern Norway. Skule remained passive throughout the rest of the war, and his support for Haakon was lukewarm at best. Assuming the military lead in the fight, Haakon nevertheless defeated Ribbung through comprehensive and organisationally demanding warfare over the next few years. As part of the campaign, Haakon additionally led a large army into the Värmland district of Sweden in 1225, to punish the inhabitants for their support of Sigurd. Sigurd died in 1226, and the revolt was finally quashed in 1227 with the surrender of its last leader, Haakon the Crazy&#x27;s son Knut Haakonsson. This left Haakon more or less uncontested monarch.
Haakon&#x27;s councillors had sought to reconcile Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage between Haakon and Skule&#x27;s daughter Margaret in 1219. Haakon accepted the proposal (although he did not think it would change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete did not take place before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Sigurd. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempted settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and spent a great amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed - according to the saga, by intrigues derived from rumours and slander by men who played the two against each other. Skule was the first person in Norway to be titled duke (&quot;hertug&quot;) in 1237, but instead of control over a region, gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the &quot;syssels&quot; scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule&#x27;s power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene, and eastern Viken, he could not stand up to Haakon&#x27;s forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway&#x27;s civil war era.

===Recognition by the Pope===

While the Church in Norway initially had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite being the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon was still not approved as king by the pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete who were designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon&#x27;s new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor in the absence of any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the Church&#x27;s political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the Church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.

Haakon also attempted to strengthen his ties with the papacy by taking a vow to go on Crusade. In 1241 he converted this into a vow of waging war against pagan peoples in the north in light of the Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians (&quot;Bjarmians&quot;) had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in the area surrounding the Malangen fjord and had them Christianized—something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a Crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon declined. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.

===Cultural influence and legal reforms===

After consolidating his position in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He built several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen, where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the sultan of Tunis.

The royal court in Bergen also started importing and translating the first true European literature that became available to a wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and, in turn, English courts, notably &quot;chansons de geste&quot; around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot;, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Haakon&#x27;s programme seems to have been the spark for the emergence of a new Norse genre of chivalric sagas.

Haakon also had the popular religious text &quot;Visio Tnugdali&quot; translated into Old Norse as &quot;Duggals leiðsla&quot;. The literature also appealed to women, and both Haakon&#x27;s wife Margrete and his daughter Kristina owned richly illustrated psalters.

Haakon also initiated legal reforms which were crucial for the development of justice in Norway. Haakon&#x27;s &quot;New Law&quot;, written around 1260, was a breakthrough for both the idea and practice of public justice, as opposed to the traditional Norwegian customs of feuds and revenge. The influence of the reforms is also apparent in Haakon&#x27;s &quot;Konungs skuggsjá&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Mirror&quot;), an educational text intended for his son Magnus, which was probably written in cooperation with the royal court in the mid-1250s.

===Involvements abroad===
Relations were hostile with both Sweden and Denmark from the start of his reign. During Haakon&#x27;s rivalry with Earl Skule, Skule sought the support of Valdemar II of Denmark, but any aid was made impossible after Valdemar&#x27;s capture by one of his vassals. Since the Danes wanted overlordship of Norway and supported the Guelphs (those supporting the Pope over the Holy Roman Emperor), Haakon in turn sought closer ties with the Ghibelline Emperor Frederick II, who sent ambassadors to Norway. As Haakon had gained a powerful reputation due to the strength of his fleet, other European rulers wanted to benefit from his friendship. Despite the struggle between the Pope and the Emperor, Haakon was able to maintain friendships with both. According to an English chronicler, the Pope wanted Haakon to become Holy Roman Emperor. It has been suggested that Haakon hesitated to leave Norway due to the Mongol threat.

Haakon pursued a foreign policy that was active in all directions (although foremost to the west and south-east). In the north-east, the relationship with Novgorod had been tense due to a dispute over the right to tax the Sami people, as well as raiding from both Norwegian and Karelian sides. Eventually, the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27; drove Prince Alexander Nevsky to negotiations with Haakon that likely strengthened Norwegian control of Troms and Finnmark. An embassy from Novgorod one time asked for the hand of Haakon&#x27;s daughter Christina, but Haakon refused due to the Mongol threat. With Norwegian ships from the port of Elven were active in the waters south of Sweden and into the Baltic Sea, Norway increasingly relied on Baltic grain from Lübeck. This trade was halted in the late 1240s by the plundering of Norwegian ships in Danish seas by ships from Lübeck. In 1250, Haakon made a peace and trade agreement with Lübeck, which eventually also opened the city of Bergen to the Hanseatic League. During the conflict, Haakon had reportedly been offered control over the city by Emperor Frederick II. In any case, Haakon&#x27;s policy regarding Northern German ports largely derived from his strategy of attempting to exploit the internal turmoil in Denmark after the death of King Valdemar II in 1241.

In Scandinavia, Haakon regularly met with neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven from the late 1240s through the 1250s. He sent grand fleets as embassies; some reportedly numbered over 300 ships. Haakon also reconciled with the Swedes when he his son Haakon the Young married Rikissa, a daughter of Swedish leader Earl Birger. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the Swedes, as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. In 1249, Haakon allied with Earl Birger for a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the Swedes (&quot;see&quot; Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. But he renounced this claim in a 1257 peace agreement with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son, Magnus, and Christopher&#x27;s niece Ingeborg. Haakon&#x27;s Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), that in the end had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon&#x27;s aggressive policies.

More distantly, Haakon sought an alliance with Alfonso X of Castile (a potential next Holy Roman emperor) chiefly as it would guarantee new supplies of grain to Castile in light of rising prices in England, and possibly giving access to Baltic grain through Norwegian control of Lübeck. Alfonso in turn sought to expand his influence in Northern Europe, as well as to gain Norwegian naval assistance for the campaign or crusade he had proposed in Morocco (seeing that the Iberian Moors received backing overseas from North Africa). Haakon could thus potentially also fulfill his papal vow of crusade, although he likely did not intend to. He sent an embassy to Castile in 1255. A Castilian ambassador to Norway returned with the embassy, and proposed to establish the &quot;strongest ties of friendship&quot; with Haakon. At the request of Alfonso, Haakon sent his daughter Christina to Castile to marry one of Alfonso&#x27;s brothers. However, Christina died four years later without children, which marked the effective end of the short-lived alliance, and the proposed crusade fell into the blue.

===The Scottish expedition and death===

Haakon employed an active and aggressive foreign policy to strengthen Norwegian ties in the west. His policy relied on friendship and trade with the King of England; the first known Norwegian trade agreements were made with England in the years 1217–23 (England&#x27;s first commercial treaties were also made with Norway), and the friendship with Henry III of England was a cornerstone of Haakon&#x27;s foreign policy. As they had become kings around the same time, Haakon wrote to Henry in 1224 that he wished they could maintain the friendship that had existed between their fathers. Haakon sought to defend the Norwegian sovereignty over islands in the west, namely the Hebrides and Man (under the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles), Shetland and Orkney (under the Earldom of Orkney), and the Faroe Islands. Further, the Norse community in Greenland agreed to submit to the Norwegian crown in 1261, and in 1262 Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when he incorporated Iceland into his kingdom by exploiting the island&#x27;s internal conflicts in his favour. The dependency on Norwegian maritime trade and their subordination to the Nidaros ecclesiastical province were some of the key reasons which allowed Haakon to assert sovereignty over the islands. The Norwegian kingdom was at the largest it has ever been by the end of Haakon&#x27;s reign.

Norwegian control over the Faroe Islands and Shetland was strong due to the importance of Bergen as a trading centre, while Orkney, the Hebrides, and Man had more natural ties with the Scottish mainland. Although traditionally having had ties with the community of Norse settlers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had increasingly asserted their sovereignty over the entire mainland. Haakon had at the same time gained stronger control of the Hebrides and Man than any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As part of a new development the Scottish king Alexander II claimed the Hebrides and asked to buy the islands from Norway, but Haakon staunchly rejected the proposals. Following Alexander II&#x27;s death, his son Alexander III continued and stepped up his father&#x27;s policy by sending an embassy to Norway in 1261, and thereafter attacking the Hebrides.

In 1263, the dispute with the Scottish king over the Hebrides induced Haakon to undertake an expedition to the islands. Haakon learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had raided the Hebrides and that Alexander III planned to conquer the islands. In 1263 Haakon mounted an expedition with his formidable &quot;leidang&quot; fleet of at least 120 ships. He had become accustomed to negotiating while backed by an intimidating fleet. The fleet left Bergen in July, and reached Shetland and Orkney in August, where they were joined by chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Alexander started negotiations after Norwegian landings on the Scottish mainland, but the Scots purposely prolonged the talks. The Scots waited until September and October for weather that would be trouble for Haakon&#x27;s fleet. A Scottish force met a smaller Norwegian force at the Battle of Largs (2 October). Although the battle was inconclusive, Haakon withdrew to Orkney for the winter. A delegation of Irish kings invited Haakon to become the High King of Ireland and expel the Anglo-Norman settlers in Ireland, but this was apparently rejected against Haakon&#x27;s wish.

Haakon over-wintered at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Kirkwall, Orkney, with plans to resume his campaign the next year. During his stay in Kirkwall he however fell ill, and died in the early hours of 16 December 1263. Haakon was buried in the St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall for the winter; in spring, his body was exhumed and taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the Old Cathedral in his capital Bergen. Centuries later, in 1531, the cathedral was demolished by the commander of Bergenhus, Eske Bille, for military purposes in connection with the Protestant Reformation, and the graves of Haakon and other Norwegian kings buried there might have been destroyed in the process or moved to another location.

==Evaluation==
Norwegian historians have held differing views on Haakon&#x27;s reign. In the 19th century, P. A. Munch portrayed Haakon as a mighty, almost flawless ruler, which in turn influenced Henrik Ibsen in his 1863 play &quot;The Pretenders&quot;. In the early 20th century, poet Hans E. Kinck countered and viewed Haakon as an insignificant king subordinated to forces outside of his control, a view which influenced historians such as Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull, Sr. Haakon has often been compared with Skule Bårdsson, and historians have taken sides in the old conflict. While Munch saw Skule as a traitor to the rightful Norwegian king, Koht viewed Skule as a heroic figure. On more sketchy grounds, Kinck praised Skule as representing the original and dying Norse culture, and Haakon as a superficial emulator of foreign culture. Since the 1960s, historians including Narve Bjørgo, Per Sveaas Andersen, Knut Helle, Svein Haga, and Kåre Lunden have in turn professed a reaction against Koht&#x27;s view. According to Sverre Bagge, modern historians tend to follow Koht when it comes to see Skule&#x27;s rebellion as a last desperate attempt to stop Haakon from encroaching on Skule&#x27;s power, but lean closer to Munch&#x27;s overall evaluation of the two men.

Knut Helle interprets the saga to leave an impression of Skule as a skilled warrior and politician, while noting that the author of the saga purposely created a diffuse image of his role in the conflict with Haakon. On the other hand, Helle notes that Skule was outmaneuvered with relative ease by Haakon&#x27;s supporters in the years immediately after 1217, and that this may suggest some limited abilities. While neither giving a clear picture of Haakon, Helle maintains that Haakon &quot;obviously&quot; learned to master the political game in his early years. He interprets Haakon as an independent and strong-willed ruler to whom he assigns a &quot;significant personal responsibility&quot; for the policies pursued during his reign: notably regarding the internal consolidation of the kingship, the orientation towards European culture and the aggressive foreign policy. In his article in &quot;Norsk biografisk leksikon&quot;, Knut Helle acknowledges that Haakon was empowered by the strong institutional position of the kingship at the end of his reign (which he had developed himself), and that his policies were not always successful. Helle nonetheless recognises the substantial political abilities and powerful determination Haakon must have had in order to progress from the difficult position in which he started his reign.

==Children and marriage==

Haakon had three illegitimate children with his mistress Kanga the Younger av Folkindberg (who is only known by name) (1198–1225), before 1225. They were:
* Sigurd (died 1252).
* Cecilia (died 1248). Married &quot;lendmann&quot; Gregorius Andresson, a nephew of the last Bagler king Philip Simonsson in 1241. Widowed in 1246, she married Harald Olafsson, King of Mann and the Isles in 1248. They both drowned the same year on the return voyage to Great Britain.
* Kone (c. 1225 -), married Toralde Gunnarsson Hvite, until Gulsvik (Buskerud, c. 1220 – Gulsvik, Flå, Buskerud, d. 1260), mentioned on a 1258 document, and had issue.

Haakon married Margrete Skulesdatter on 25 May 1225, daughter of his rival Earl Skule Bårdsson. Their children were:
# Olav (born 1226). Died in infancy.
# Haakon the Young (1232–1257). Married Rikissa Birgersdotter, daughter of the Swedish statesman Earl Birger in 1251. Appointed king and co-ruler by his father in 1240, but predeceased his father.
# Christina (1234–1262). Married Infante Philip of Castile, brother of Alfonso X of Castile in 1258. Died childless.
# Magnus VI of Norway (1238–1280). Married Ingeborg, daughter of Eric IV of Denmark in 1261. Appointed king and co-ruler after the death of Haakon the Young. Succeeded his father as King of Norway.

==Popular culture==
Håkon and Kristin were the mascots of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Håkon is named after Haakon IV of Norway and Kristin after Christina of Norway.

In &quot;The Last King&quot; (2016), the infant Håkon IV is portrayed by Jonathan Oskar Dahlgren.

<doc id="150786" wikidata="Q1135270" url="?curid=150786" title="Corrales, New Mexico">
<text>Corrales is a village in southern Sandoval County, New Mexico, United States. First farmed by Tiquex Pueblo people, chosen due to its proximity to the Rio Grande, as documented by Hispano farmers of Nuevo México in the late 1500s. Despite being a part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area, the village maintains its rural character, while also being surrounded by the cities of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. The population of Corrales was 8,329 at the 2010 Census.

The Rio Grande Bosque on the eastern edge of the village provides refuge for native animals and plants, and ancient Pueblo and Hispano acequias continue to be maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.

==History==

The village of Corrales (Spanish for &quot;corrals&quot;) is located along the Rio Grande and is built on the site of two Indian Pueblos settled before AD 500 by the Tiguex Indians, and which were later occupied by Spanish Colonists and explorers who colonized the region around 1540. The Spanish Colonists subsequently built an adobe church on the site called the Church of San Ysidro in 1868, named after the annual fiesta de San Ysidro in May.

In 1710, a grant of the Alameda lands (including Corrales) was given to Corporal Francisco Montes Vigil, A soldier in the Spanish army. Vigil sold it in 1712 to Captain Juan Gonzáles Bas who was then living in Bernalillo. Gonzáles subsequently sold the land comprising the Village of Corrales in 1718 to Salvador Martinez. Over time, the land comprising the Village of Corrales was parceled off and sold for agricultural development and livestock ranching. The current Village of Corrales government was incorporated and chartered in 1971.

The village was selected as #19 in CNN Money&#x27;s list of the 100 best places to live in 2007.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (4.71%) is water.

Until 2005, portions of the Village of Corrales were located in both Bernalillo and Sandoval counties. In 2005, a special election annexed the portion of Corrales located in Bernalillo County to Sandoval County, so that now the entire village is located in Sandoval County.

Unlike the surrounding communities of Rio Rancho and Albuquerque, much of the Village of Corrales does not have a centralized water system for running water or a municipal sewage system, which requires many homes and businesses to each install their own wells and water pumping systems and leach fields for sewage disposal. Newer homes built in Corrales are no longer allowed to install leach fields and are required to use closed septic systems with a holding tank which must be pumped regularly by sewage trucks at the homeowner&#x27;s expense. The Village has an extensive system of canals which transport water from the Rio Grande to crop fields and pasturage for crop irrigation and livestock.

== Biology ==
The Village is heavily wooded with large stands of cottonwood and other native trees. Russian olive trees grow throughout the area and are an invasive species. Corrales is divided in a lower riparian habitat and a drier, sandy shrubland uphill on the west side of the Rio Grande.

<doc id="150788" wikidata="Q1289481" url="?curid=150788" title="Lucayan people">
<text>The Lucayan people ( ) were the original residents of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands before the European colonisation of the Americas. They were a branch of the Taínos who inhabited most of the Caribbean islands at the time. The Lucayans were the first Indigenous Americans encountered by Christopher Columbus (in October 1492). Shortly after contact, the Spanish kidnapped and enslaved Lucayans with the displacement culminating in the complete eradication of the Lucayan people from the Bahamas by 1520.

The name &quot;Lucayan&quot; is an Anglicization of the Spanish &quot;Lucayos&quot;, itself a hispanicization derived from the Lucayan &quot;Lukku-Cairi&quot;, which the people used for themselves, meaning &quot;people of the islands&quot;. The Taíno word for &quot;island&quot;, &quot;cairi&quot;, became &quot;cayo&quot; in Spanish and &quot;cay&quot; in English [spelled &quot;key&quot; in American English].

Some crania and artifacts of &quot;Ciboney type&quot; were reportedly found on Andros Island, but if some Ciboney did reach the Bahamas ahead of the Lucayans, they left no known evidence of occupation. Some possible Ciboney archaeological sites have been found elsewhere in the Bahamas, but the only one subjected to radiocarbon dating dated to the mid- to late-12th century, contemporaneous with Lucayan presence on the islands.

Christopher Columbus&#x27;s &quot;diario&quot; contains the only contemporaneous observations of the Lucayans. Other information about the customs of the Lucayans has come from archaeological investigations and comparison with what is known of Taíno culture in Cuba and Hispaniola. The Lucayans were distinguished from the Taínos of Cuba and Hispaniola in the size of their houses, the organization and location of their villages, the resources they used, and the materials used in their pottery.

==Origin and settlement==

Sometime between 500 and 800 CE, Taínos began crossing in dugout canoes from Hispaniola and/or Cuba to the Bahamas. Hypothesized routes for the earliest migrations have been from Hispaniola to the Caicos Islands, from Hispaniola or eastern Cuba to Great Inagua Island, and from central Cuba to Long Island in the central Bahamas. The settlement sites in the Caicos Islands differ from those found elsewhere in the Bahamas, resembling sites in Hispaniola associated with the Classic Taíno settlements that arose after 1200.

William Keegan argues that the sites on Caicos therefore represent a colonization after 1200 by Taínos from Hispaniola seeking salt from the natural salt pans on the island. Great Inagua is closer to both Hispaniola, at , and Cuba, at , than any other island in the Bahamas, and sites on Great Inagua contain large quantities of sand-tempered pottery imported from Cuba and/or Hispaniola, while sites on other islands in the Bahamas contain more shell-tempered pottery (&quot;Palmetto Ware&quot;), which developed in the Bahamas.

While trade in dugout canoes between Cuba and Long Island was reported by Columbus, this involved a voyage of at least over open water, although much of that was on the very shallow waters of the Great Bahama Bank. The Taínos probably did not settle in central Cuba until after 1000, and there is no particular evidence that this was the route of the initial settlement of the Bahamas.

From an initial settlement of Great Inagua Island, the Lucayans expanded throughout the Bahamas Islands in some 800 years (c. 700 – c. 1500), growing to a population of about 40,000. Population density at the time of first European contact was highest in the south central area of the Bahamas, declining towards the north, reflecting the progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands. Known Lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago, or to smaller cays located less than one kilometre from those islands.

Keegan posits a north-ward migration route from Great Inagua Island to Acklins and Crooked Islands, then on to Long Island. From Long Island expansion would have gone east to Rum Cay and San Salvador Island, north to Cat Island and west to Great and Little Exuma Islands. From Cat Island the expansion proceeded to Eleuthera, from which New Providence and Andros to the west and Great and Little Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama to the north were reached. Lucayan village sites are also known on Mayaguana, east of Acklins Island, and Samana Cay, north of Acklins.

There are village sites on East, Middle and North Caicos and on Providenciales, in the Caicos Islands, at least some of which Keegan attributes to a later settlement wave from Hispaniola. Population density in the southernmost Bahamas remained lower, probably due to the drier climate there, less than of rain a year on Great Inagua Island and the Turks and Caicos Islands and only slightly higher on Acklins and Crooked Islands and Mayaguana.

Based on Lucayan names for the islands, Granberry and Vescelius argue for two origins of settlement; one from Hispaniola to the Turks and Caicos Islands through Mayaguana and Acklins and Crooked Islands to Long Island and the Great and Little Exuma Islands, and another from Cuba through Great Inagua Island, Little Inagua Island and Ragged Island to Long Island and the Exumas. Granberry and Vescelius also state that around 1200 the Turks and Caicos Islands were resettled from Hispaniola and were thereafter part of the Classical Taíno culture and language area, and no longer Lucayan.

== History ==

=== Connections ===
The Lucayans were part of a larger Taíno population in the Greater Antilles. The Lucayans, along with the Taínos in Jamaica, most of Cuba and parts of western Hispaniola have been classified as part of a Sub-Taíno, Western Taíno or Ciboney Taíno cultural and language group. Keegan describes any distinctions between Lucayans and Classical Taínos of Hispaniola and eastern Cuba as largely arbitrary. The Lucayans lived in smaller political units, simple chiefdoms, compared to the more elaborate political structures in Hispaniola, and their language and culture showed differences, but they remained Taínos, although a &quot;hinterland&quot; of the wider Taíno world. The Lucayans were connected to a Caribbean-wide trade network. Columbus observed trade carried between Long Island and Cuba by dugout canoe. A piece of jadeite found on San Salvador Island appears to have originated in Guatemala, based on a trace element analysis.

=== Appearance ===
Columbus thought the Lucayans resembled the Guanche of the Canary Islands, in part because they were intermediate in skin color between Europeans and Africans. He described the Lucayans as handsome, graceful, well-proportioned, gentle, generous and peaceful, and customarily going almost completely naked. Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera said that the Lucayan women were so beautiful that men from &quot;other countries&quot; moved to the islands to be near them. Women past puberty wore a small skirt of cotton, and the men might wear a loincloth made of plaited leaves or cotton.

Some people wore head bands, waist bands, feathers, bones and ear and nose jewelry on occasion. They were often tattooed and usually applied paint to their bodies and/or faces. They also practiced head flattening. Their hair was black and straight, and they kept it cut short except for a few hairs in back which were never cut. Columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men, which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by people from other islands to capture them.

=== 1492 Lucayan–Spanish encounter ===
In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain with three ships, seeking a direct route to Asia. On October 12, 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas, an event long regarded as the &#x27;discovery&#x27; of America. This first island to be visited by Columbus was called Guanahani by the Lucayans, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains contested, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison&#x27;s identification of what was later called Watling (or Watling&#x27;s) Island as Columbus&#x27; San Salvador. The former Watling Island was officially renamed San Salvador in 1925. Luis Marden&#x27;s identification of Samaná Key as Guanahani is the strongest contender with the former Watling Island theory. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas hunting for gold before sailing on to Cuba.

Columbus spent a few days visiting other islands in the vicinity: Santa María de la Concepción, Fernandina, and Saomete. Lucayans on San Salvador had told Columbus that he could find a &quot;king&quot; who had a lot of gold at the village of &quot;Samaot&quot;, also spelled &quot;Samoet&quot;, &quot;Saomete&quot; or &quot;Saometo&quot;. Taíno chiefs and villages often shared a name. Keegan suggests that the confusion of spellings was due to grammatically differing forms of the name for the chief and for the village or island, or was simply due to Columbus&#x27;s difficulty with the Lucayan language.

Columbus spent three days sailing back and forth along the shore of an island seeking Samaot. At one point he sought to reach Samaot by sailing eastward, but the water was too shallow, and he felt that sailing around the island was &quot;a very long way&quot;. Keegan interprets this description to fit the Acklins/Crooked Islands group, with a ship in the west side being able to see the western shore of Acklins Island across the very shallow waters of the Bight of Acklins, where there was a village that stretched about along the shore.

Amerigo Vespucci spent almost four months in the Bahamas in 1499 to 1500. His log of that time is vague, perhaps because he was trespassing on Columbus&#x27;s discoveries, which at the time remained under Columbus. There may have been other unrecorded Spanish landfalls in the Bahamas, shipwrecks and slaving expeditions. Maps published between 1500 and 1508 appear to show details of the Bahamas, Cuba and the North American mainland that were not officially reported until later. European artifacts of the period have been found on San Salvador, the Caicos Islands, Long Island, Little Exuma, Acklins Island, Conception Island and Samaná Cay. Such finds, however, do not prove that Spaniards visited those islands, as trade among Lucayans could have distributed the artifacts.

=== Slavery and genocide ===
Columbus kidnapped several Lucayans on San Salvador and Santa María de la Concepción. Two fled, but Columbus took some Lucayans back to Spain at the end of his first voyage. Vespucci took 232 Lucayans to Spain as slaves in 1500. Spanish exploitation of the labor of the natives of Hispaniola rapidly reduced that population, leading the Governor of Hispaniola to complain to the Spanish crown. After Columbus&#x27;s death, Ferdinand II of Aragon ordered in 1509 that Indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in Hispaniola, and the Spanish began capturing Lucayans in the Bahamas for use as laborers in Hispaniola.

At first the Lucayans sold for no more than four gold pesos in Hispaniola, but when it was realized that the Lucayans were practiced at diving for conchs, the price rose to 100 to 150 gold pesos and the Lucayans were sent to the Isle of Cubagua as pearl divers. Within two years the southern Bahamas were largely depopulated. The Spanish may have carried away as many as 40,000 Lucayans by 1513.

Carl O. Sauer described Ponce de León&#x27;s 1513 expedition in which he encountered Florida as simply &quot;an extension of slave hunting beyond the empty islands.&quot; When the Spanish decided to traffic the remaining Lucayans to Hispaniola in 1520, they could find only eleven in all of the Bahamas. Thereafter the Bahamas remained uninhabited for 130 years.

==Society==

=== Genetics ===
In 2018, researchers successfully extracted DNA from a tooth found in a burial context in Preacher&#x27;s Cave on Eleuthera Island. The tooth was directly dated to around 776–992 AD. Genetic analysis revealed that the tooth belonged to a woman. When compared against contemporary populations, the ancient individual shows closest genetic affinity to Arawakan speakers from the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, with closest affinity to the Palikur. The individual was assigned to mtDNA Haplogroup B2.

=== Customs ===
Lucayan society was based on descent through the mother&#x27;s line, which was typical of Taíno culture as a whole. The Spanish reported that a woman resided with her husband&#x27;s family, but Keegan argues that this was not patrilocal residence in the strict sense, but rather residence in the husband&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s household (avunculocal residence).

=== Houses ===
Lucayans, like other Taínos, lived in multi-household houses. Descriptions of Lucayan houses by the Spanish match those of houses used by Taínos in Hispaniola and Cuba: shaped like a round tent, tall, made of poles and thatch, with an opening at the top to let smoke out. Columbus described the houses of the Lucayans as clean and well-swept. The houses were furnished with cotton nets (some kind of hammocks) for beds and furnishings, and were used mainly for sleeping. Each house sheltered an extended family.

There are no surviving reports of the size of Lucayan houses, but estimates of about 20 people per house in Taíno communities in pre-contact Cuba are cited by Keegan as a reasonable estimate for Lucayan houses. While not mentioned for Lucayan houses, the houses in Cuba were described as having two doors. Classic Taíno villages in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba typically had houses arranged around a central plaza, and often located along rivers with access to good agricultural land. Lucayan villages were linear, along the coast, often on the leeward side of an island, but also found on the windward side wherever tidal creeks provided some protected shoreline.

=== Pre-European contact diet ===
The Lucayans grew root crops and hunted, fished and gathered wild foods. At least half of the diet came from plant foods.

The staple crop of the Lucayans was manioc (cassava), followed by sweet potato. Sweet manioc was eaten like sweet potato, by peeling and boiling. Bitter manioc, which has a dangerous amount of hydrogen cyanide, was prepared by peeling, grinding, and mashing. The mash was then filtered through a basket tube to remove the hydrogen cyanide as a poisonous juice. The filtered mash was dried and sieved for flour, which was used to make pancake-like bread cooked on a flat clay griddle. The poisonous hydrogen cyanide juice was boiled, which released the poison, and the liquid base mixed with chili peppers, vegetables, meat, and fish to make a slow-boiling stew that prevented the spoiling of its ingredients.

The Spanish also reported that the Lucayans grew sweet potatoes, cocoyams, arrowroot, leren, yampee, peanuts, beans and cucurbits. The Lucayans probably took most, if not all, of their crops with them to the Bahamas. The Lucayans may have grown papayas, pineapples, guava, mammee apple, guinep and tamarind fruit.

There were few land animals available in the Bahamas for hunting: hutias (Taíno &quot;utia&quot;), rock iguanas, small lizards, land crabs and birds. While Taínos kept dogs and Muscovy ducks, only dogs were reported by early observers, or found at Lucayan sites. Less than 12% of the meat eaten by Lucayans came from land animals, of which three-quarters came from iguanas and land crabs. 

More than 80 percent of the meat in the Lucayan diet came from marine fishes, almost all of which grazed on seagrass and/or coral. Sea turtles and marine mammals (West Indian monk seal and porpoise) provided a very small portion of the meat in the Lucayan diet. The balance of dietary meat came from marine mollusks. The main meats were fishes and mollusks from the grass flat and patch reef habitats that are found between the beach and the barrier reef, and include parrotfish, grouper, snapper, bonefish, queen conch, urchins, nerites, chitons, and clams.

Maize was a recent introduction to the Greater Antilles when the Spanish arrived, and was only a minor component of the Taíno and, presumably, Lucayan diets.

=== Fiber and other plant products ===
The Lucayans grew cotton (&quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot;) and tobacco, and used other plants such as agave, furcraea and hibiscus for fiber in fishing nets. One of Columbus&#x27;s sailors received of cotton in trade from a single Lucayan on Guanahani. Although Columbus did not see tobacco in use by the Lucayans, he did note that they traded a type of leaf that they regarded as valuable. Bixa was used to produce a reddish body paint and jagua (Genipa or Mamoncillo) for black body paint.

=== Conch tools ===
Conch shells (pronounced as &quot;konk&quot;, known as &quot;cobo&quot; in Taino) were a hard material in plentiful supply on the islands. They included several species of conch, including the queen conch and the Atlantic Triton. Lucayans used them to make tools such as canoe gouges, hoes, hammers, picks, net mesh gauges, and fishhooks. They were also made into beads shaped like disks, carved into amulets, and used as inlay for sculptures.

Trumpet-like instruments that were played by blowing were also made of conch. A specific term, &quot;guamo&quot;, existed for trumpets made from the largest snail available, the Atlantic Triton. These were used, similarly to church bells, to call people into action as well as for religious rites. 

=== Other technology ===

The Lucayans carved canoes, spears, bowls and ceremonial stools from wood. Stone chopping, cutting and scraping tools were imported from Cuba or Haiti. Most pottery was of the type called &quot;Palmetto Ware&quot;, including &quot;Abaco Redware&quot; and &quot;Crooked Island Ware&quot;. This was produced in the islands using local red clay soils tempered with burnt conch shells. Palmetto Ware pottery was usually undecorated. There are no known differences that can be used to date or sequence Palmetto Ware pottery. Some (usually less than one percent of collected sherds in most of the Bahamas, about ten percent in the Caicos Islands) sand-tempered pottery was imported from Cuba and/or Haiti. The Lucayans made fish hooks from bone or shell and harpoon points from bone. The Lucayans probably did not use bows and arrows. The first mention by the Spanish of encountering Indians using bows and arrows was at Samaná Bay in northeastern Hispaniola.

One of the few artifacts of Lucayan life that has been found in a variety of areas in the Bahama archipelago is the duho. are carved seats found in the houses of Taíno caciques or chiefs throughout the Caribbean region. Duhos &quot;figured prominently in the maintenance of Taíno political and ideological systems . . . [and were] . . . literally seats of power, prestige, and ritual.&quot; made of wood and stone have both been found, though those made of wood tend not to last as well as the stone chairs and are, therefore, much rarer. There are intact wooden in the collections of the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris and British Museum in London (the latter found on the island of Eleuthera).

=== Religion ===

The Taino pantheon of cemís, also known as zemís, play an active role in the lives of humans, and distinguish between the cultural, pleasing human theme and the anti-cultural, nonhuman, foul theme. The term refers to both the spirits and the objects that represent spirits.

They include fruitfulness spirits Yocahu, the male giver of manioc, and Attabeira, the mother goddess. Attending to them were the twin spirits Maquetaurie Guayaba, the lord of the dead, and Guabancex, the mistress of the hurricane. The twin spirits were also attended to by sets of twins.

During arieto ceremonies, food was offered to the zemi, and shamans (behique) would give a piece of cassava bread to participants, which were kept preserved until the following year.

<doc id="150790" wikidata="Q1908744" url="?curid=150790" title="Crystal, New Mexico">
<text>Crystal () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on the Navajo Nation in San Juan and McKinley counties in New Mexico, United States. The population was 302 at the 2020 census. It is located along the base of the Chuska Mountains, at the western end of Narbona Pass.

The McKinley County portion of Crystal is part of the Gallup Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the San Juan County portion is part of the Farmington Metropolitan Statistical Area. A post office operated at Crystal from 1903 to 1941.

==History==

The first known trader in the Washington Pass area (now Narbona Pass) was Romulo Martinez, a Spanish-American from Fort Defiance, in 1873. The names of other traders are recorded for the following years, but they seem all to have been temporary, trading from tents in the summer season.

Crystal was founded in 1884 when a trading post was established. Its name likely derives from its Navajo moniker meaning &quot;crystal water flows out.&quot; 

In 1896 John Bradford Moore arrived, an Irishman from Sheridan, Wyoming. He bought the trading site, then cut timber in the mountains and hauled it down to build a log trading post, which he stocked with supplies carted from the rail head in Gallup. He named his post at the western mouth of Narbona Pass the Crystal Trading Post. During the winter months, he employed Navajo weavers to make rugs. Moore ensured that the wool and the weaving was good quality, and created designs of his own, quickly gaining a reputation as a source of good quality rugs.

Moore understood what the market in the eastern United States would value, and in his catalog stressed the use of natural materials and primitive technology. Despite this, he introduced production-line techniques, and had no problem with using machine-produced yarns with synthetic dyes. Traders in Navajo rugs had to keep costs down to be able to offer competitive prices, so wages were low. Talking of the weaver&#x27;s life, Moore said, &quot;there is no more dismal wage proposition than her remuneration for her part in the industry. Given any other paying outlet for her labor, there would very soon be no such thing as a blanket industry ... it is her one and only way of earning money.&quot;

Moore was succeeded in 1911 by his manager, A. J. Molohon. The Crystal Trading Post was owned by the C.C. Manning company from 1919 to 1922. Later Charlie Newcomb and then Jim Collyer owned the post. In 1944 Don Jensen bought the post, holding it until 1981. Apparently Jenson developed the current Crystal rug.

==Geography==
Crystal is in southwestern San Juan County, with a small portion extending into the northwest corner of McKinley County. New Mexico State Road 134 has its terminus in Crystal and leads northeast over Narbona Pass to U.S. Route 491 at Sheep Springs.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Crystal CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.44%, are water. The community is drained by Crystal Creek, which flows west toward Coyote Wash and Canyon de Chelly.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 347 people, 100 households, and 77 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 113 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.98% Native American, 1.73% White, and 0.29% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.59% of the population.

There were 100 households, out of which 41.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.0% were married couples living together, 27.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.0% were non-families. 21.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.47 and the average family size was 4.10.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 38.0% under the age of 18, 10.4% from 18 to 24, 26.8% from 25 to 44, 17.6% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 27 years. For every 100 females, there were 74.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.8 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $24,722, and the median income for a family was $13,906. Males had a median income of $31,023 versus $16,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $7,002. About 54.7% of families and 54.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 63.8% of those under age 18 and 20.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) operates Crystal Boarding School, a K-6 boarding school. It opened in 1935 as part of an effort to replace off-reservation Indian boarding schools with on-reservation boarding schools, as a part of the New Deal project. In 2014 about 30 students boarded but most did not, and only one dormitory was open as another was deemed unsafe. In 2013, 5% of the students were classified as having mathematics skills on par with their grade levels even though the school had already shifted most of its instruction to mathematics and reading at the expense of science and social studies. In 2015 &quot;Politico&quot; stated that the school&#x27;s campus was in a poor condition. It had no school counselor.

The portion of Crystal in San Juan County is served by Central Consolidated Schools. Gallup-McKinley County Schools serve the McKinley County portion of Crystal. The McKinley County portion is zoned to Navajo Elementary School, Navajo Middle School, and Navajo Pine High School in Navajo.

<doc id="150791" wikidata="Q3055512" url="?curid=150791" title="Chimayo, New Mexico">
<text>Chimayo is a census-designated place (CDP) in Rio Arriba and Santa Fe counties in the U.S. state of New Mexico. The name is derived from a Tewa name for a local landmark, the hill of Tsi Mayoh. The town is unincorporated and includes many neighborhoods, called plazas or placitas, each with its own name, including El Potrero de Chimayó (the plaza near Chimayo&#x27;s communal pasture) and the Plaza del Cerro (plaza by the hill). The cluster of plazas called Chimayo lies near Santa Cruz, approximately 25 miles north of Santa Fe. The population was 3,177 at the 2010 census.

==Background==
The Potrero plaza of Chimayo is known internationally for a Catholic chapel, the Santuario de Nuestro Señor de Esquipulas, commonly known as El Santuario de Chimayó. A private individual built it by 1816 so that local people could worship Jesus as depicted at Esquipulas; preservationists bought it and handed it over to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe in 1929. The chapel is managed by the Archdiocese as a Catholic church. For its reputation as a healing site (believers claim that dirt from a back room of the church can heal physical and spiritual ills), it has become known as the &quot;Lourdes of America,&quot; and attracts close to 300,000 visitors a year, including up to 30,000 during Holy Week (the week prior to Easter). It has been called &quot;no doubt the most important Catholic pilgrimage center in the United States.&quot; The sanctuary was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

Chimayo has long been an important site for the Hispanic weaving traditions of northern New Mexico, and an important style of weaving which developed between 1920 and 1940 is named after the town. The style is characterized by well-developed transverse bands and a prominent central motif. The central motif is usually diamond or hourglass shaped and very elaborate. Because of how Anglo-Americans were interested in native American designs, products from Chimayo were marketed as Indian goods up until the early 1940s. Chimayo is particularly known for the weaving traditions of the Ortega and Trujillo families, who have been weaving in the Spanish Colonial tradition for many generations and operate weaving businesses near the Plaza del Cerro and in the placita of Centinela. Their traditional craft is but one of several still practiced in the region, including tin smithing, wood carving, and making religious paintings. These activities, along with the local architecture and the landscape of irrigated fields, create a historic ambiance that attracts much tourism.

On Jan. 26, 1991, 7 were killed in a shooting rampage in the town.

== Culture ==
Chimayo figures prominently in &quot;Now Eleanor&#x27;s Idea&quot;, an opera by Robert Ashley. Ashley describes Chimayo in his foreword to the libretto as &quot;the spiritual center of the lowrider world...Now Eleanor conceives of a television documentary program to study the exotic lowrider community...in the car shops&quot; of Chimayo. Act II, Scene 2 is a recorded interview with Chimayo residents LowLow and Joan Medina.

The town is also known for its heirloom chile cultivar, the Chimayo pepper (&quot;Capsicum annuum&quot; &#x27;Chimayo&#x27;). In 2003 the Native Hispanic Institute&#x27;s founder Marie Pilar Campos authored the Chimayo Chile Project to replenish the 300-year-old native seed stock and revive the industry. The Chimayo Chile Project began planting in the spring of 2005, which is the foundation of its ongoing seed-distribution services to local farmers. The project&#x27;s job development operations were funded by the United States Office of Community Services from 2005 through 2008. As part of the project&#x27;s work with the state to revive the industry, two joint memorials have passed the New Mexico State Legislature. The Chimayo Chile Project incorporated the local farmers, Chimayo Chile Farmers, Inc. Chimayo Chile Farmers, Inc. applied for the certification mark &quot;Chimayo&quot; with the USPTO in 2006 and was granted registration in 2009.
The 2008 New Mexico State Legislature, via New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs, appropriated preservation support that resulted in the June 2009 publication, &quot;Chimayo Chile: A Living History of Faith, Culture, and Art,&quot; by Marie Pilar Campos of the Native Hispanic Institute.

<text>Española is a city primarily in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, United States. A portion of the central and eastern section of the city is in Santa Fe County. Founded as a railroad village some distance from the old Indian town of San Juan de los Caballeros (now renamed Ohkay Owingeh),&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelspanishmissions/mission-san-juan-bautista.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it was named Española and officially incorporated in 1925. It has been called the first capital city in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was at 10,526. Española is within the Albuquerque–Santa Fe–Los Alamos combined statistical area.

==History==

===Etymology===
Española was referred to as &quot;La Vega de los Vigiles&quot; (&#x27;the Vigils&#x27; Meadow&#x27;) before the presence of railroads. &quot;La Española&quot; means &#x27;Spanish woman&#x27;, and folk history attributes the name to railroad construction workers who named the area after a woman who worked in a small restaurant in the area. In fact the name is a shortened form of &quot;Plaza Española&quot; (&#x27;Spanish town&#x27;), which likely was to differentiate it from the Tewa pueblo just to the south.

===Spanish settlement===
Tewa people have lived in the area since the 13th century. They built towns in the area, now called &#x27;pueblos&#x27;, four of which still exist: Ohkay Owingeh, Pojoaque, Santa Clara and San Ildefonso.

The upper reaches of the Rio Grande region were explored by the Spanish in 1540. Don Juan de Oñate was the first to bring settlers here in 1598. His group stayed at Ohkay Owingeh for a time (calling the Tewa town San Juan de los Caballeros), before settling in an abandoned Tewa village which he renamed San Gabriel. San Gabriel, close to modern Española, can thus be seen as the first capital city founded by people of European racial descent in what is now the United States.

Oñate arrived in the Española area on July 11, 1598, at the confluence of the Chama River and the Rio Grande, where he established a camp at a place then called Yunque-Yunque.

Almost a century later, near the same region, Don Diego de Vargas established his villa at Santa Cruz.

===Railroad era===

Prior to the arrival from Antonito, Colorado of the narrow gauge Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1880, the hamlet on the west-side of the Rio Grande was known as La Vega de los Vigiles in reference to the Vigil family who initially settled that area. The earliest document found indicates that La Vegas de los Vigiles had been populated by 1751, over 100 years before the railroad&#x27;s arrival. With the coming of the railroad the name of the hamlet was changed to Española. Until 1886, when it was extended to Santa Fe, Española was the terminus of the line. The Española station included an engine facility along with a roundhouse and turntable so it could service the locomotives. The facilities were built but torn down or no longer in use after six years; plans for the town had changed. Later popularly known as the &quot;Chili Line&quot;, this was part of an ambitious but unsuccessful proposal to connect Denver with Mexico City. 

The route extended into what today is the downtown Española area, and the railroad began selling lots in the area. Anglo merchants, mountain men, and settlers slowly filtered into Española. Frank Bond and his brother George, who were Canadian emigrants, would later arrive in the city. Together they established the state&#x27;s largest mercantile and a multi–million dollar wool empire. With them came economic growth and prominence. Española was the headquarters for all the Bond family interests which included over 12 businesses across New Mexico.

Frank R. Frankenburger, a business man born in Fort Scott, Kansas, was the first &quot;elected&quot; mayor; he was elected in 1923. The first mayor who was chosen in &quot;popularity&quot; was Frank Bond, in 1907. In 1925 Española was incorporated as a city. As the population rose, there was a high demand for public education in the city. Española High School was established; it would be the largest school in the area for decades. The first high school in the area, however, was Santa Cruz High School. Two miles away from downtown Española, it opened in 1906 in the historic Santa Cruz area. Neither high school operates after a merger of school districts in 1975.

The importance of the railroad began to lessen as minimal passenger traffic and low shipments forced the railroad to close in 1941, with the tracks removed the following year. Many locals would become unemployed and would follow the railroad to Santa Fe, Albuquerque and central Colorado for jobs. Española&#x27;s population would fall dramatically and many homes in the downtown became abandoned. Most of the locals who remained would turn to farming as a way of life. Many people saw Española as another failed railroad town. The city removed the railroad tracks and the train depot in the 1960s, and the railroads completely vanished.

===Post-railroad===
With the beginnings of Manhattan Project in nearby Los Alamos, many locals eventually found jobs at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). As much as nearly 9% of Española&#x27;s population have been employed at LANL.

In the 1980s, many historical buildings and homes of historical significance were torn down for urban renewal. Española followed many other New Mexico cities in this trend, but in Española, it failed. More modern business began to move into town, but the growth of Española had now expanded east across the Rio Grande. Although several buildings of historical significance remain in downtown Española, many are unused or abandoned. Strip malls became visible in Española, the first being the &#x27;Big Rock shopping center&#x27;, founded by oil tycoon Roy Honstein.

In the 1990s, a controversial plan to build a &quot;plaza&quot; and mission church where many historic buildings once stood was up for consideration. The city agreed to the plan, and locals supported the plaza. Although a plaza never existed in Española before the railroads, it was built to pay tribute to the Spanish culture in the area.

===Recent history===

On September 18, 2008, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, visited Española for a rally at the city&#x27;s New Plaza in the Main Street district.

<text>Birger Jarl or Birger Magnusson (21 October 1266) was a Swedish statesman and regent, &quot;jarl&quot;, and a member of the House of Bjälbo, who played a pivotal role in the consolidation of Sweden. His first marriage was to Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, which created his base of power. Birger led the Second Swedish Crusade, which established Swedish rule in Finland. Additionally, he is traditionally attributed with the foundation of the Swedish capital, Stockholm, around 1250. Birger used the Latin title of (&quot;duke of Swedes and Geats&quot;).

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Birger, likely born around the time of the Battle of Gestilren in 1210, spent his childhood and adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland. The exact date of his birth is uncertain and historical sources are contradictory, but examinations of his remains suggest he was around 50 years old at his death in 1266, which would indicate a birth year around 1216. However, since his father, Magnus Minnesköld, is believed to have died no later than 1210, Birger&#x27;s birth may have occurred a few years earlier.

Birger&#x27;s mother Ingrid Ylva was, according to Olaus Petri, a daughter of Sune Sik and the granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden. His brothers or half-brothers—Eskil, Karl, and —were born well before 1200, suggesting they likely had a different mother. Birger was named after his uncle Birger Brosa, a jarl from the House of Bjälbo and one of the most powerful men of the era, who died in 1202.

Birger married Ingeborg Eriksdotter, the sister of King Erik Eriksson in the mid-1230s, following intense competition with other suitors, as chronicled in &quot;Erik&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Erikskrönikan&quot;). This combination of family ties and strategic marriage would prove vital in his ascent to power.
During the following 15 years, Birger consolidated his position and was probably one of the most influential men years before being formally given the title jarl in 1248 by King Erik.

=== Campaign to Neva ===

According to some 15th and 16th century sources, Birger was responsible for a military campaign against the Novgorod Republic in 1240, which ended in a victory by Alexander Nevsky during what is known as the Battle of the Neva. While Swedish sources give no information on the battle at all, a 16th-century Russian manuscript &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; tells that the Swedish &quot;king&quot; was wounded in the face while dueling against Prince Alexander Nevsky. Although Birger Jarl saw many battles, some have speculated that traces of a sword blow in Birger&#x27;s cranium might have originated from this battle. However, the original 14th-century Russian record of the battle gives no information on this at all, and the first sources that link Birger Jarl to the Neva campaign date from mid-15th century.

=== Career ===

When the papal diplomat William of Modena visited present Sweden around 1248, he urged the Swedish kings to fulfill the rules of the Catholic Church, an exhortation which Birger seems to have taken as a chance to strengthen his position by simply taking the side of the church against other members of his family (alternatively it&#x27;s possible to interpret this as a manifestation of his pious side). This was a choice of historical importance as it was to make Birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office, thus making him the last Swedish jarl ever, even called as the &quot;first true king of Sweden&quot; by historians. As this happened during an era when the inherited concept Folkung became more of a political party, it also meant Swedish magnates lost most of their influence which paved the way for a consolidated Swedish kingdom supported by the Pope.

In 1247, royal troops led by Birger at the Battle of Sparrsätra fought with Folkung forces led by pretender Holmger Knutsson, son of King Knut Långe. The Folkungs lost the battle and were unable to resist the central government and its taxes. Holmger Knutsson fled to Gästrikland and was captured there by Birger in the following year. Quickly brought to trial, he was beheaded.

In 1249, Birger succeeded in ending a decades-long period of hostilities with Norway. As a part of the Treaty of Lödöse, he also managed to marry off his daughter Rikissa, then only 11 years old, to Haakon Haakonsson the Young, the eldest son of King Haakon IV of Norway. Presumably later that year, Birger led an expedition to Finland, later dubbed as the Second Swedish Crusade, which permanently established the Swedish rule in Finland. On King Erik&#x27;s death in 1250, Birger&#x27;s son Valdemar was elected as the new king while Birger acted as regent, holding the true power in Sweden until his death.

In 1252, a year after another victory over the folkungs at the , Birger wrote two carefully dated letters, the first mention of Stockholm interpreted as the foundation of the city or at least some sort of special interest in the location. Neither of the letters give a description of the location, however, and while archaeological traces of older defensive structures have been found there, what did exist on the premises before the mid-13th century remains debated. It has been suggested Birger chose the location for several reasons: Partly to curb domestic magnates by isolating them with a &quot;lock of Lake Mälaren&quot;, offering a defense to the lands around Mälaren from invading enemies in the process; and to create a commercial bridgehead to attract German merchants. While Birger&#x27;s direct involvement in the foundation of the city remains speculative, it probably was no accident it was founded on the location at this time.


=== Later life and burial ===
Ingeborg died in 1254. In 1261, Birger married Queen Mechtilde of Holstein, the widow of the Danish king Abel, who had allied herself with the Archbishop Jakob Erlandsen to protect her sons&#x27; interitance against King Christopher I of Denmark. The marriage produced no children. Birger died on 21 October 1266, at Jälbolung in Västergötland. After Birger&#x27;s death, Mechtilde returned to Denmark, where she died in 1288.

Birger, his son Erik and Mechtilde were buried in Varnhem Abbey. The grave was forgotten after a fire in the 16th century and was only rediscovered during restoration work in the 1920s. When opened, it was found to contain two male skeletons and one female skeleton. These findings were later questioned and the grave was reopened in May 2002. The remains were re-examined using modern methods, which confirmed the earlier conclusions. A DNA analysis 

Following Birger&#x27;s death, the title of jarl was replaced with duke.

== Legacy ==
There is a statue of Birger Jarl in his own square Birger Jarls Torg next to Riddarholm Church in Stockholm, erected by Bengt Erland Fogelberg at the expense of the Governor of Stockholm in 1854. There is a cenotaph for him at the base of the tower of Stockholm City Hall. It was originally intended that his remains be removed there, but this was never done. Several other historical structures there are also named for him including the street Birger Jarlsgatan on Norrmalm and the tower Birger Jarls torn on Riddarholmen. The Hotel Birger Jarl is located in Stockholm&#x27;s Norrmalm neighborhood. He is also the central figure of &quot;Bröllopet på Ulvåsa&quot; by Frans Hedberg (1865).

== Children ==
Birger married Ingeborg Eriksdotter in mid-1230s. The marriage was contracted relatively near the time when Ingeborg&#x27;s brother, the once-deposed Erik Eriksson, returned from exile in Denmark in 1234. Ingeborg and Birger had the following children:
# Rikissa, born 1238, married firstly 1251 Haakon Haakonsson the Young, co-king of Norway, and secondly, Henry I, Prince of Werle
# Valdemar, born c. 1238, king of Sweden 1250–1275, lord of parts of Gothenland until 1278
# Kristina, married presumably several times, one of her husbands was lord Sigge Guttormsson
# Magnus Ladulås, born 1240, Duke (of Södermanland), then king of Sweden 1275–90
# Erik &quot;Allsintet&quot;, born 1250, made Duke of Sweden in 1275, few months before his death
# Bengt, born 1254, Duke of Finland, bishop of Linköping
Hans Gillingstam has argued that Catharina (b. 1245), who married Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1259, and Ingeborg (c. 1254 30 June 1302), who married Duke John I of Saxony in 1270, and are mentioned in German sources as &quot;daughters of Swedish king&quot; were daughters of Birger.

Birger also had an illegitimate son, Gregers, whose mother is unknown.

<doc id="150794" wikidata="Q2648205" url="?curid=150794" title="Allegany Indian Reservation">
<text>Allegany Reservation () is a Seneca Nation of Indians reservation in Cattaraugus County, New York, U.S. In the 2000 census, 58 percent of the population within the reservation boundaries were Native Americans. Some 42% were European Americans; they occupy properties under leases from the Seneca Nation, a federally recognized tribe. The population outside of the rented towns was 1,020 at the 2010 census. The reservation&#x27;s Native American residents are primarily members of the Seneca, but a smaller number of Cayuga, another Iroquois nation, also reside there, and at least one family is known to have descended from the Neutral Nation.
Prior to the 17th century, this area was occupied by the Iroquoian-speaking Wenrohronon and Eriehronon. The more powerful Seneca eliminated these competing groups during the Beaver Wars beginning in 1638, as the Iroquois Confederacy sought to control the lucrative fur trade with the French and Dutch colonists.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of 43.7 mi2 (113.1 km2). 36.4 mi2 (94.2 km2) of it is land and 7.3 mi2 (18.8 km2) of it (16.65%) is water.

The reservation borders both banks of the Allegheny River and is partially within several of the Towns in the south part of the county (South Valley, Cold Spring, Salamanca, Great Valley, Red House and Carrollton, with a very small portion in the town of Allegany). The City of Salamanca, with the exception of a northern spur along U.S. Route 219, is also located within the reservation.

The governmental headquarters for the Allegany Reservation are located in a small community known as Jimerson Town or &quot;jo:nya:tih&quot;, an unincorporated hamlet located west of Salamanca on a stretch of dead-end road that used to be part of New York State Route 17. The government rotates every two years, alternating operations in Jimerson Town and Irving on the Cattaraugus Reservation. Jimerson Town&#x27;s most recent turn began in November 2018.

In addition to Jimerson Town, significant developed communities on the reservation include: Highbanks, a community south of Steamburg that includes residences, smoke shops, a Faithkeepers School and a campground; Shongo, a sparsely populated hamlet south of Jimerson Town; Kill Buck, a mixed community of both native and non-native residents; The Junction, a mostly commercial cluster surrounding an exit on Interstate 86; and Vandalia, the easternmost developed site on the reservation. South of Highbanks, the reservation is primarily undeveloped wilderness. Wilderness is also the predominant form between Steamburg and Shongo, where natives often take part in hunting and informal recreation. Each area is also given a name in the Seneca language: the Coldspring-Steamburg area is known as &quot;jonegano:h&quot;, Shongo and Red House are known as &quot;joë:hesta&#x27; &quot;, Salamanca is dubbed &quot;onë:dagö:h&quot;, while everything from Kill Buck eastward is named &quot;dejódiha:ˀkdö:h&quot;. These names appear on markers on Interstate 86.

The reservation was defined adjacent to the Cornplanter Tract, a 1500-acre perpetual land grant given to Seneca chief Cornplanter and his descendants that extended into Pennsylvania. The Cornplanter Tract constituted the only reserved native lands in the state of Pennsylvania. By 1957, the year Cornplanter&#x27;s last direct descendant (Jesse Cornplanter) died, the Cornplanter Tract was occupied only seasonally by the Seneca.

During the 1930s and the Great Depression, the federal government authorized a major flood control project on the Allegheny River. Construction did not begin until 1961. The project envisioned construction of a dam and reservoir, to flood much of the Cornplanter Tract and the western portion of the Allegany Reservation. These areas were made uninhabitable during construction of the Kinzua Dam, which was completed in 1965.

The Allegheny Reservoir, also known as Kinzua Lake, reaches into New York and nearly to Salamanca. The Seneca were compensated primarily by grants of land set aside at Jimerson Town, where numerous houses were constructed, and a handful of other resettlement areas in New York.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,099 people, 410 households, and 280 families residing in the Indian reservation (excluding the rented cities). The population density was 30.2/mi2 (11.7/km2). There were 459 housing units at an average density of 12.6/mi2 (4.9/km2). The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 42.13% White, 0.82% Black or African American, 53.78% Native American, 0.45% Asian, 0.18% from other races, and 2.64% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.00% of the population.

There were 410 households, out of which 30.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.7% were married couples living together, 18.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.7% were non-families. 24.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.08.

In the Indian reservation the population was spread out, with 29.9% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 27.2% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.9 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $28,971, and the median income for a family was $30,250. Males had a median income of $23,958 versus $20,982 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $12,681. About 17.0% of families and 22.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.7% of those under age 18 and 22.3% of those age 65 or over.

==History==

===Early habitation by American Indians===
The area was first inhabited during the Stone Age by nomadic Algonquian peoples. An Algonquian earthwork mound from the first or second Stone Age is located on a farm in the area of Rosenberg along Zoar Valley near Gowanda. The mound is believed to be about 3,500 years old. Artifacts including spearheads, copper heads, and stone implements of a crude nature have been excavated from the site. In the latter half of the 14th century, Iroquoian-speaking peoples traveled to the area and lived along Cattaraugus Creek. They were proud, considering themselves to be &quot;chosen people&quot;. Other tribes lived in the area around this time. The powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy defeated the Erie people (also an Iroquoian-speaking tribe), driving them out of the area or assimilating captives by adoption in certain clans. About this time, the Five Nations of the Confederacy coalesced as distinct peoples. They made a pact of cooperation rather than warfare. They controlled much of present-day New York state west of Albany and the Hudson River.

After the Revolutionary War, the American government secured land treaties with the Iroquois nations in western New York in 1784 and 1788. Because the majority of the nations had been allies of the British, they were forced to cede most of their lands in New York after the British defeat and United States independence.

In 1796 and 1797, Robert Morris purchased extensive lands in the upstate areas, mostly American Indian lands, and mortgaged them to the Holland Land Company of Willem Willink and 11 associates of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Excluded from his purchases in 1797 were territories for ten American Indian reservations within the state, with the Cattaraugus Reservation of among these. Thereafter, two land offices of the Holland Land Company were opened in Batavia, New York, and Danby, Vermont. Many early settlers to Gowanda were from the Danby area, and many were Quakers.

===Settlement and incorporation===
Originally called &quot;Aldrich&#x27;s Mills&quot; after the first European-American settler, Turner Aldrich, the European-American village was settled in 1810 and began to develop. He and his family of three sons and three daughters traveled up Cattaraugus Creek from Connecticut, taking of land, comprising a large portion of what is Gowanda today. Aldrich built a sawmill and in 1817 a gristmill. Records of farmers coming from a radius for their grain to be ground are held by the historical society. At that time, farmers and pioneers traveled along American Indian trails through the dense forest, with their wagons being pulled by oxen.

Jacob Taylor, a Quaker missionary from the Friends Yearly Meeting of Philadelphia, was sent in 1809 to serve the American Indians in the area. Taylor Hollow is named for him. In 1811, he built, owned, and operated a sawmill and gristmill. Other missionaries accompanied Taylor, and though they called themselves a &quot;family,&quot; they were not related.

The village later adopted the name &quot;Lodi&quot;, though there was confusion in mail delivery due to &quot;Lodi&quot; in Seneca County, New York (the post office officially used the name &quot;West Lodi&quot; for what is now Gowanda to distinguish the two). When the village was incorporated, it dropped that name, although the post office retained the name &quot;Persia.&quot; The Seneca in the area had once identified this place as &quot;Juc-Gowanda&quot;, meaning &quot;a valley among the hills&quot;. The settlers adopted the name &quot;Gowanda&quot; for the village. It was first incorporated in 1848, and was re-incorporated in 1878 under a new state regulation. At the latter time, the village extended its territory to annex the nearby hamlet of Hidi.

===19th century===
Most of the village in Erie County, made up of wooden buildings, was destroyed by a fire in 1856. Another fire in 1875 burned many businesses in the Cattaraugus part.

A historical book about Gowanda identifies 120 men, including Caucasians and American Indians, who were Gowanda residents and who fought in the Civil War in New York regiments. The same book also identifies six men who had been Gowanda residents, but who enlisted and fought in the Civil War with regiments from Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.

Long associated with Gowanda although located outside its boundaries, the Thomas Asylum for Orphan and Destitute Indian Children (also known as the &quot;Thomas Indian School&quot;) was built following a gift of of land on the Cattaraugus Reservation. The school was incorporated in 1855. In June 1856, the institution opened and was immediately at capacity in housing 50 orphaned American Indian children. The Thomas Asylum housed and schooled orphaned American Indian children for decades, until the latter part of the twentieth century.

In 1894, the Erie County Legislature passed an act that authorized establishment of the Homeopathic State Hospital (later known as the &quot;Gowanda Psychiatric Center&quot;) in Gowanda and Collins. Erie County purchased of land for the hospital site, known as the &quot;Taylor tract&quot;. When the State Care Act was effected in 1894, the land was transferred to the State of New York, which conveyed it to the state hospital.

Since the late 20th century, the facility has been adapted for use as a correctional center. It borders Taylor Hollow Road in Gowanda. The road was named for the original owner of the land that was purchased and used for the State Hospital.

===20th century===

====Tanning and glue industries====
Important industries that flourished in Gowanda during the twentieth century, but which also polluted the adjoining Cattaraugus Creek, included the Peter Cooper Corporation Glue Factory and the Moench Tannery. The first tannery in Gowanda was begun by Samuel T. Munger in 1829, although one was already in operation by Smith Bartlett since 1815 in Collins. In 1829, to tan one side of leather in six months was considered quick work. Other tanneries in operation in Gowanda were by the Benton Brothers; K. Webster (which was purchased by Agle &amp; Sons in 1860); and Albert Gaensslen. In 1852, Albert Gaensslen converted the former wool factory in Gowanda to a leather plant with 12 liquor vats. The Gaensslen Brothers tannery manufactured only shoe sole leather. Gaensslen Brothers tannery was established in 1855; reorganizing as Gaensslen, Fisher &amp; Company in 1896, following the partnership with E.C. Fisher. In 1879, the Gaensslen Brothers tannery &quot;included 250 liquor vats and shipped 20,000 sides of sole leather to Cleveland each year.&quot; Additionally, the Agle &amp; Sons tannery was expanded, containing 40 liquor vats and annually finishing 700 sides of leather by 1879.

A glue factory was originally started in association with the Gaensslen Brothers Tannery in 1874 in order to utilize the tanning waste. At that time, of glue was produced annually. The first construction of Richard Wilhelm&#x27;s Eastern Tanners Glue Company plant began on May 5, 1904. In 1898, tanning factory waste from the now-reorganized Gaensslen, Fisher &amp; Company tannery produced of glue. In 1899, the tannery was purchased by C. Moench &amp; Sons. Although it was purchased by the Brown Shoe Company in 1925, it existed as the Moench Tanning Company, Incorporated.

====America&#x27;s glue capital====
A 1976 historical book about Gowanda states that the Eastern Tanners Glue Company begun by Richard Wilhelm, and later purchased and operated by the Peter Cooper Corporations, was &quot;the largest glue making plant in the world.&quot; Gowanda, therefore, was known as America&#x27;s glue capital.

===21st century===
The Bank of Gowanda building and Gowanda Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic Hollywood Theatre is also located in Gowanda.

==Notable recent events==

===Cultural events and entertainment===
Gowanda hosts the Hollywood Happening, bringing a focus to the historic and restored Hollywood Theatre. It lasts from Friday to Sunday, usually the first weekend in June. Main Street of Gowanda is shut down for the event, which provides parking for numerous motorcycles and beer tents. Many local Western New York rock, country, and blues bands are featured. There are also several food and merchandise vendors who sponsor and participate in the event. Attendance for the 2008 Hollywood Happening was estimated to be around 22,000 people for the entire weekend.

Beginning about 2000, the Harvest Heritage Festival has been held every year in the fall, with many local businesses and private home owners opening up their residences for historical garden tours. A scarecrow contest is also held in which local businesses compete. Afterwards, the scarecrows are hung up around town to scare the children on Halloween. Gowanda also hosts Pine Hill Cemetery tours that are free and open to the public. The events usually last two hours, and are held every weekend during the month of October at midnight. Tours include period reenactments of those buried in the cemetery, and detailed stories of their lives. A staged reenactment of the 1861 murder of Private Lee Crawford and Beulah Snyder also takes place. Locally brewed Chuck Barlow&#x27;s Millhouse Cider sponsors the event, and offers refreshments during the festivities.

Parts of the 1987 comedy movie &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;, starring Steve Martin and John Candy, were filmed at the Gowanda Train Depot, as well as the Olympia Diner on Jamestown Street. The New York and Lake Erie Railroad, a short rail line serving northwestern Cattaraugus County, is headquartered in Gowanda and offers freight and occasional passenger service.

===Flood of 2009 and related events===
Throughout the years, Gowanda has regularly experienced flooding. In August 2009, a great flash flood occurred in Gowanda and devastated much of the village. One man drowned, and houses and cars were washed away. A total of two fatalities were caused directly from the flooding. During the flood, Gowanda&#x27;s water reservoir at Point Peter Road was completely destroyed, leaving the village without water. It was estimated that it would take one year to rebuild the reservoir. New York State declared the village a disaster site, as did President Barack Obama. FEMA was tapped to assist the town in rebuilding. In January 2014, it was announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo that Gowanda would be compensated with $700,000 in monies from FEMA for expenses paid in rebuilding the village after the 2009 flood.

The Tri-County Memorial Hospital (Tri-County) was devastated beyond repair during the 2009 flood, and was demolished. Initial plans were to relocate the hospital to another location in Perrysburg out of the flood zone. The relocation would utilize $18.5 million in FEMA aid. TLC, the operators of Tri-County, would have needed to raise $2.3 million to fund the project. The proposal came under fire from residents of towns to the southeast, such as Cattaraugus and Little Valley, who noted that Gowanda is located less than from hospitals in either direction (Dunkirk and Springville), while residents of Cattaraugus and Little Valley must travel or more to the nearest hospital (which, until the flood, was Tri-County).

In July 2013, TLC announced it was abandoning its plans to reconstruct the hospital, noting that the existing hospitals in the region had more than enough capacity to meet demand, and would instead maintain an urgent care facility in Gowanda. Gary Rhodes, interim CEO of Lake Erie Regional Health System of New York, stated that it would not be economical to rebuild the hospital due to declining revenues, decreasing area population, and because of other hospitals within the system being nearby. The hospital&#x27;s closure had a significant negative impact on the village, leading to declines at several local businesses.

===Flood of 2014===
Gowanda experienced another flood, resulting in a state of emergency, when two waterways, Cattaraugus Creek and Thatcher Brook, flooded their banks in May 2014. Two elderly residents were evacuated from their homes as a safety precaution. One elderly resident was hospitalized as a result of injuries sustained when a tree fell and she was hit; her injuries were not life-threatening.

As a result of the flood, Gowanda&#x27;s water reservoir was damaged and contaminated, being shut down. Residents were asked to conserve water and not use it for activities such as washing their cars. Mayor Heather McKeever stated that the most costly facet of clean-up from the flooding would likely be the reservoir&#x27;s repair, with initial repair estimates of approximately $500,000 (~$ in ). Residents pumped flood waters from their basements, and semi-truck loads of mud were hauled away as part of clean-up efforts.

Officials used a system called &quot;Code Red&quot; to notify residents to take precautions due to the rains. Residents were notified, electronically, at 7:30 am, and waterways had overflowed by 8:45 am. About 200 families in Gowanda were affected by the flooding, with 30 homes being flooded with water and mud. The children of Gowanda had school that day. The bus drivers were given a hard time about going on to certain closed roads.

<text>Keeseville is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Clinton and Essex counties, New York, United States. The population was 1,815 at the 2010 census. The hamlet was named after the Keese family, early settlers from Vermont. It developed along the Ausable River, which provided water power for mills and industrial development.

Keeseville is in the towns of Au Sable and Chesterfield and is south of the city of Plattsburgh. It is located inside what are now the boundaries of Adirondack Park, which was authorized in the 20th century.

On January 23, 2013, the town&#x27;s select board voted to dissolve the village. As of 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau still had Keeseville listed as a village.

==History==

The hamlet was originally called &quot;Anderson Falls&quot; by settlers from New England, who moved into the area following the American Revolutionary War and forcing of Iroquois tribes off their lands. The name was changed circa 1812 to &quot;Keeseville&quot;, after a local manufacturer and businessman. The early hamlet was an industrial area devoted, in part, to lumber, iron processing and milling. One such industry was the Ausable Chasm Horse Nail Works, which produced two tons of nails a day from 1863 to 1925. There has also been a strong French Canadian influence, and many ethnic French have historic ties to the area. The Catholic cathedral, St. John&#x27;s, was designed in a French style. As population moved west across New York and later to more urbanized areas, the village declined in population.

The Keeseville, Ausable Chasm &amp; Lake Champlain Railroad connected Port Kent steamships and the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad with the Chasm and local commerce from 1890 until 1924. The &quot;Peanut RR&quot; was a 5.6 mile shortline, of traditional American Standard Gauge width to allow easy transfer onto the rest of the U.S. rail network. The former train station, long North Country Club Restaurant, received a historic roadside marker on May 19, 2018. Visit Anderson Falls Heritage Society, 96 Clinton Street in Keeseville, to experience local history.

The &quot;Essex County Republican&quot; newspaper, founded in Port Henry, moved to Keeseville in the 20th century, becoming the &quot;Keeseville Essex County Republican&quot;.

In January 2013, voters decided in a referendum by a vote of 268–176 to dissolve the village. Their territory falls under the jurisdiction of the two towns in which it is located, which will provide services and government. The village officially dissolved on December 31, 2014.

The Double-Span Metal Pratt Truss Bridge, Keeseville Historic District, Rembrandt Hall, Stone Arch Bridge, Swing Bridge, and Tomlinson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Saranac Lake is a village in the state of New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,887, making it the largest community by population in the Adirondack Park. The village is named after Upper, Middle and Lower Saranac lakes, which are nearby.

The village of Saranac Lake covers parts of three towns (Harrietstown, St. Armand, and North Elba) and two counties (Franklin and Essex). The county line is within two blocks of the center of the village. At the 2010 census, 3,897 village residents lived in Harrietstown, 1,367 lived in North Elba, and 142 lived in St. Armand. The village boundaries do not touch the shores of any of the three Saranac Lakes; Lower Saranac Lake, the nearest, is a half mile west of the village&#x27;s downtown district. The northern reaches of Lake Flower, which is a wide part of the Saranac River downstream from the three Saranac Lakes, lie within the village. The town of Saranac is an entirely separate entity, down the Saranac River to the northeast.

The village lies within the boundaries of the Adirondack Park, west of Lake Placid. These two villages, along with nearby Tupper Lake, comprise what is known as the Tri-Lakes region.

== History ==
This area was occupied by Iroquoian-speaking peoples for hundreds of years, and by other Indigenous peoples before them. The historic Mohawk people extended their hunting grounds to this area.

The area was first settled by European Americans in 1819, more than three decades after the American Revolutionary War. As the Iroquois, mostly allies of the British, had been forced to cede their land to the United States following the war, millions of acres of New York were opened up to non-Native development in the postwar period.

The Jacob Smith Moody family from Keene, New Hampshire, was the first to settle here. In 1827, settlers Pliny Miller and Alric Bushnell established a logging facility with a dam and sawmill, around which the village developed. The first school was built in 1838. In 1849, William F. Martin built one of the first hotels in the Adirondack Mountains. His Saranac Lake House, known simply as &quot;Martin&#x27;s&quot;, was located on the southeast shore of Lower Saranac Lake. Martin&#x27;s soon became a favorite place for hunters, woodsmen, and socialites to meet and interact. 

In 1876, Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau arrived from New York City to treat his tuberculosis (TB) by a stay in the mountains. There was no medical treatment other than rest and nutrition at the time, and the disease was often fatal. Dry, cold air was considered to be good for patients, and sanitariums were also founded in European mountain resorts. Trudeau discovered that the fresh air and dry, alpine climate improved his health. In 1884, he founded his Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium, starting with a small cottage, called &quot;Little Red&quot;. Two sisters from New York City who suffered from TB became the first patients. Little Red, the first &quot;cure cottage&quot;, was built on a small patch of land on the north side of Mount Pisgah. The plot had been purchased for Trudeau by several of his hunting guides.

As more patients visited the region, including author Robert Louis Stevenson in 1887, Trudeau&#x27;s fame grew. Soon, the sanitarium had grown to such size that it was entitled to its own post office, which delivered mail to the many patients. The Trudeau Institute, an independent medical research center, developed from Trudeau&#x27;s work for the sanitarium. In 1964, the Trudeau Institute began researching the functions of the immune system and how it guards against many infectious diseases, including tuberculosis.

William S. Fowler was a real estate speculator and developer who owned several properties around Saranac Lake. One was a large property just outside the town on top of a hill. He named it &quot;Spion Kop&quot; in honor of a battle that was fought in the Boer War in South Africa. In commemoration, he placed miniature cannons on various parts of the property.

Several buildings were erected as cottages where people could &quot;cure&quot; from TB. In 1919, Fowler sold the property to the Northwestern Fire Insurance Company. They turned it into a private sanatorium for their employees.

In 1925, the sanatorium was sold to the National Vaudeville Artists. Around this time there were numerous vaudeville performers in Saranac Lake seeking cures at different locations. E. F. Albee, the owner and President of the National Vaudeville Artists, held benefit programs in New York City to raise funds to construct the large sanitarium. The older cure cottages were torn down and some were moved. By the end of the 1920s the Tudor Building was completed. It still stands today.

In the 1930s the National Vaudeville Artists no longer existed. After World War II antibiotics were used to treat TB, and the mountain sanitariums were converted to other uses. The Tudor Building was purchased by the Will Rogers Memorial Commission. In 1936, one year after Rogers&#x27; death, they renamed this building as the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital. A laboratory was built in later years and named the O&#x27;Donnell Memorial Laboratory in honor of R.J. O&#x27;Donnell, a well-known theater chain manager.

In the 1970s, New York State forced the closure of the hospital, as it did not meet contemporary codes and updating was cost-prohibitive. The Will Rogers building was adapted for other uses. It was operated as a night club, then as a timeshare vacation spot, and finally as apartments. Unable to attract enough renters, the owners abandoned the property, which deteriorated. In 1980, it was renovated for use as the press headquarters for the Winter Olympics. In 1995, the Kaplan Development Group purchased the property for adaptation as a retirement home for senior residents. It planned to restore the building&#x27;s historic details.

Telephone service was introduced in 1884, and the Chateaugay branch of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad reached Saranac Lake from Plattsburgh in 1887. Five years later, the Mohawk and Malone Railway main line reached nearby Lake Clear Junction. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad purchased it in 1894, and it was merged into the New York Central Railroad in 1913. The NYC became the leading railroad from New York City, via Utica, into the northern Adirondacks, and its Lake Clear Junction-Saranac Lake-Lake Placid Branch was a key traffic source until NYC passenger service ended on April 24, 1965. Railroads both carried passenger traffic to the growing resort areas of the Adirondacks and shipped out the millions of feet of lumber that were harvested from this area into the early 20th century.

The village was incorporated on June 16, 1892, and Dr. Trudeau was elected the first village president soon thereafter. Electricity was introduced on September 20, 1894, by installing water wheels on the former site of Pliny Miller&#x27;s mill. Paul Smith purchased the Saranac Lake Electricity Co. in 1907, and formed the Paul Smith&#x27;s Electric Light and Power and Railroad Company. It eventually became part of Niagara-Mohawk. At the same time, the village began to develop municipal facilities, such as public schools, and fire and police departments.

In 1892, John Rudolphus Booth, the Canadian lumber king, rented a cottage at Saranac Lake for his daughter, who used it for several years in seeking a TB cure. Booth brought skis with him, and introduced the sport of skiing to the area.

Starting in the 1890s and for the next 60 years, Saranac Lake was known as &quot;the Western Hemisphere&#x27;s foremost center for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;. An effective antibiotic was first used on human TB patients in 1921, but only after World War II did it begin to be widely used in the US. In the postwar period, sanatorium treatment became less important and was phased out completely by 1954. Among the last of the prominent patients who sought treatment for tuberculosis was Manuel Luis Quezon y Molina, the first Filipino president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, who died in Saranac Lake of the disease on August 1, 1944.

But the village had become a center of tuberculosis care, attracting many doctors and patients from around the world. They added to and supported the culture of the area, as did the wealthy who built Great Camps on the nearby Saranac and Saint Regis Lakes, the effect was to change the sleepy village of 300 of the 1880s into the vibrant &quot;little city&quot; of 8,000.

Author Mark Twain vacationed on Lake Flower in 1901 at the height of his fame. While there, he wrote a Conan Doyle spoof, &quot;A Double-Barreled Detective Story&quot;.

After multiple fires destroyed a large part of downtown, Saranac Lake rebuilt in the 1920s. The Hotel Saranac was built in the Art Deco style and still stands. Other permanent buildings were added to the townscape. During the Prohibition era, rum-running was common in the village, as smugglers brought liquor from over the border from Canada. Gangster Legs Diamond visited his brother Eddy, who had TB and stayed at a local cottage sanatorium. During the 1920s, entertainer Al Jolson and president Calvin Coolidge were semi-frequent visitors to the village; Jolson once performed a solo for three hours at the Pontiac Theater on Broadway.

Beginning in 1936, physicist Albert Einstein had a summer home in Saranac Lake, renting the cottage of local architect William L. Distin; he often sailed with his wife on Lake Flower. During World War II, Einstein summered frequently at Knollwood Club on Lower Saranac Lake. He heard with others from the radio that on August 6, 1945, the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima. A few days later, Einstein gave his first interview about this event at Knollwood.

In 1954, Saranac Lake hosted the world premiere of the Biblical epic film &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot;, in which actor Paul Newman made his debut. Several of the stars, including Virginia Mayo, visited the village and participated in the winter carnival parade.

Since the late 20th century, Saranac Lake has become a more conventional tourist destination. New York&#x27;s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, has visited there ever since he was a teenager and regularly vacations there with his family. The Hotel Saranac is a memorable early 20th century Art Deco structure. The former sanatorium is now used as the corporate call center for the American Management Association.

Numerous properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Dr. A. H. Allen Cottage, Berkeley Square Historic District, Bogie Cottage, Peyton Clark Cottage, Coulter Cottage, Cure Cottage at 43 Forest Hill Avenue, Denny Cottage, Fallon Cottage Annex, Freer Cottage, Hathaway Cottage, Helen Hill Historic District, Highland Park Historic District, Hill Cottage, The Homestead, Kennedy Cottage, Lane Cottage, Larom Cottage, Dr. Henry Leetch House, Lent Cottage, Little Red, Marquay Cottage, Marvin Cottage, Musselman Cottage, New York Central Railroad Adirondack Division Historic District, Partridge Cottage, Pittenger Cottage, Pomeroy Cottage, Will Rogers Memorial Hospital, Orin Savage Cottage, Paul Smith&#x27;s Electric Light and Power and Railroad Company Complex, Prospect Point Camp, Stevenson Cottage, Stuckman Cottage, Trudeau Sanatorium, Chester Valentine House, Wilson Cottage, and Witherspoon Cottage.

186 buildings in the village are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Culture ==

Many tourists come to the village, which is picturesque owing to its setting and the preservation of older architecture. Much of the village fronts on Lake Flower, which was created by a dam in the Saranac River and named after Governor Roswell P. Flower.

There are opportunities for canoeing and boating, hiking and climbing. In the summer, the Village of Saranac Lake offers free concerts in Riverside Park on Lake Flower and the Berkeley Green park. Camping is also a popular pastime in the Saranac Lake region.

Cross-country and downhill skiing, snowshoeing, ice skating, snowmobiling are winter activities. There is also an annual 10-day winter carnival, an event held in celebration of winter since 1897. Each year the carnival is given a theme - 2016&#x27;s theme was &quot;Adirondack Wildlife&quot;. The Winter Carnival parade reflects the theme, and Garry Trudeau, the creator of the comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; who grew up in the town, creates artwork with characters from his comic strip doing things related to the theme for a button that can be purchased each winter. The carnival&#x27;s main attraction is the ice palace, which is made with blocks of ice taken from Lake Flower and illuminated with colored lights, along with various winter activities and competitions. These include a parade, which normally has several bagpipe and drum marching bands and the &quot;Lawn Chair Ladies&quot;, along with more usual floats and local school bands. Each year a Winter Carnival King and Queen, who preside over carnival activities, are selected from village residents based upon their contribution to Saranac Lake, while the prince and princess are from the two local colleges, North Country Community College and Paul Smith&#x27;s College. There is also a winter rugby game.

A non-profit Village Improvement Society, dating from 1910, currently owns and maintains eight parks. The parkland along the lakefront, now owned by the village, is the result of the Society&#x27;s earlier efforts.

Every year the Can Am Rugby Tournament, the largest such tournament in the Western Hemisphere, is held in the village.

Saranac Lake has a number of galleries, the Adirondacks&#x27; only year-round, professional theatre, monthly art walks June through September, and a Plein Air festival. The organization Saranac Lake ArtWorks is composed of dozens of artists and arts-related businesses. Historic Saranac Lake is an architectural heritage organization that has nominated almost two hundred properties to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Economy==
After the local Ames Department Store closed due to bankruptcy and residents were forced to travel 50 miles to Plattsburgh for many consumer goods, the town was approached by Walmart, which offered to build a 120,000 square foot supercenter, but the community declined the offer, fearing that Walmart would negatively impact local business and increase traffic. As an alternative, a community-owned store was organized and shares were sold to community residents. $500,000 was raised by about 600 residents, who made the goal of an average investment of $800. The store, Saranac Lake Community Store, opened on October 29, 2011, in remodeled facilities in downtown Saranac Lake.

<doc id="150800" wikidata="Q3967622" url="?curid=150800" title="St. Regis Mohawk Reservation">
<text>St. Regis Mohawk Reservation (; ) is a Mohawk Indian reservation of the federally recognized Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, located in Franklin County, New York, United States. It is also known by its Mohawk name, [[Akwesasne]]. The population was 3,288 at the 2010 census. The reservation is adjacent to the Akwesasne reserve in Ontario (Akwesasne 59) and Quebec () across the St. Lawrence River. The Mohawk consider the entire community to be one unit and have the right to travel freely across the international border.

== Location ==
The reservation contains the community of St. Regis and borders the community of Hogansburg in the Town of Bombay. The Mohawk people dispute the Town of Bombay&#x27;s claim to jurisdiction within the &quot;Bombay Triangle&quot;, as these lands are part of the 1796 Treaty with the United States and have never been diminished by the US Congress.

Under the terms of the Jay Treaty (1794), the Mohawk people may pass freely across the Canada–United States border. The two parts of the reservation are separated by the St. Lawrence River and the 45th parallel.

The Mohawk are one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois League, historically based south of the Great Lakes and in present-day New York and Pennsylvania. This nation was located primarily in the Mohawk Valley west of what developed as Albany and were known as the &quot;Keepers of the Eastern Door&quot;. They were prepared to defend the Iroquoian territory against other tribes located to the east of the Hudson River.

The St. Regis Reservation, and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal government, adopted gambling in the 1980s. It has generated deep controversy. Broadly speaking, the elected chiefs and the Mohawk Warrior Society have supported gambling, while some traditional leaders have opposed it. Today, the reservation is home to the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino, which has generated revenues for tribal welfare.

The elected tribal governments on the New York and Canadian sides and the traditional chiefs of Akwesasne often work together as a &quot;Tri-Council&quot; concerning areas of shared interest, for example to negotiate land claims settlements with their respective national governments.

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and the Mohawk people view the reservation as a sovereign nation. Under US treaty law, the federal government has jurisdiction over certain crimes on the reservation, but the Mohawk have their own police force for other cases.

==Geography==

The reservation is at the international border of Canada and the United States along the St. Lawrence River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of . of it is land, and of it (9.76%) is water. It is bordered by the New York towns of Fort Covington (east), Bombay (south), Brasher (southwest), and Massena (west), and by the Akwesasne Indian reserve to the north in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The nearest city is Cornwall, Ontario, which lies to the northwest, across the Akwesasne Reserve.

In August 2021, the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation acquired 41.5 acres in Franklin County, New York.

==History==
The original settlement was known as Akwesasne, called Saint Régis by French Jesuit missionaries, after Jean François Régis, the priest canonized as a Catholic saint in 1737. He had expressed a desire to be a missionary to the Iroquois people. 

The settlement was founded about 1755 by several Catholic Iroquois families, primarily Mohawk, who moved upriver from the mission village of Caughnawaga, Quebec (now known as Kahnawake), which was south of Montreal. They were seeking better lives for their families, as they were concerned about negative influences of traders at Caughnawaga, who plied the Mohawk with rum. The Mohawk families were accompanied by Jesuit missionaries from Caughnawaga.

After the United States acquired this territory in settlement of its northern border, relations among the people and the varying jurisdictions became more complex. But according to the 1795 Jay Treaty settling the border, the Mohawk retained the right to travel freely across the border in either direction. Since the reservation was established, the Mohawk on both sides of the St. Lawrence River have lost land and been adversely affected by major infrastructure projects conducted by state and federal authorities. These include construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, what is now known as the Three Nations Crossing bridge, and dams on the rivers for hydroelectric power projects.

Since 1762, mills and dams were built by private, non-Native interests on the St. Regis River at what developed as the village of Hogansburg. It is now within the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation. 

In 1929 Erie Boulevard Hydropower built an 11-foot-high dam at the site to generate hydroelectric power. It disrupted the annual salmon fish run from the St. Lawrence, depriving the citizens of the reservation of one of their staple foods. The dam adversely affected the populations of salmon and other migratory fish. By 2010 the dam had become uneconomical. It would have cost too much to upgrade, which would have included current requirements to provide for fish passage in efforts to preserve the species. The owner gave up its federal license.

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal government applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take over and dismantle the dam, which they did in 2016. Based on restoration of fisheries after such dam removals in other locations across the country, they are optimistic that salmon and other migratory fish, such as walleye, will quickly return to the region. Thus 275 miles of the St. Regis River has been reopened to migratory fish that spend part of their lives in the Atlantic Ocean.

In 2013 the tribe received a $19 million settlement from &quot;GM, Alcoa, and Reynolds for pollution of tribal fishing and hunting grounds along the St. Lawrence River&quot;. The companies have undertaken cleanup of the pollution. The tribe intends to use this money to redevelop the former dam site as &quot;the focus of a cultural restoration program that will pair tribal elders with younger members of the tribe to restore the Mohawk language and pass on traditional practices such as fishing, hunting, basket weaving, horticulture and medicine, to name a few.&quot;

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,699 people, 904 households, and 668 families residing in the Indian reservation within the US boundary. The population density was 142.2/mi2 (54.9/km2). There were 977 housing units at an average density of 51.5/mi2 (19.9/km2). The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 97.41% Native American, 2.07% White, 0.07% from other races, and 0.44% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.74% of the population.

There were 904 households, out of which 44.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.9% were married couples living together, 23.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.0% were non-families. 22.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.97 and the average family size was 3.44.

In the Indian reservation, the population was spread out, with 34.1% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 18.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.2 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $32,664, and the median income for a family was $34,336. Males had a median income of $27,742 versus $21,774 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $12,017. About 19.4% of families and 22.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.3% of those under age 18 and 14.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Controversies==

===Drug and human smuggling===
Because of the latitude of this area, rivers freeze in winter, providing shortcuts for the Mohawk crossing the international border. These conditions also make the border more porous for smugglers of many items, including liquor, cigarettes, drugs, and people, including human trafficking. &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered this issue in February 2006 in an article headlined &quot;Drug Traffickers Find Haven in Shadows of Indian Country&quot;.

The Akwesasne police and government spokespersons have defended their work, saying they have had to take on an unfair federal burden of border enforcement while not receiving additional funding. Due to a quirk in the law, they were not eligible to receive grants from the federal Department of Homeland Security that were available to local jurisdictions to support the extra work at the border. The chief of the Akwesasne Mohawk police noted that drug smuggling was a problem that extended along the Canada–US border and was not limited to Akwesasne. In March 2006, the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation was awarded a $263,000 grant from the US Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Legal Services, in order to &quot;fight drug use, violent crime, and drug and human smuggling.&quot;

The FBI said that 300 people were caught illegally passing through the reservation from September 1995 to September 1996.

===Collection of state sales tax===
For decades New York state has threatened to collect sales tax from sales of gasoline and cigarettes on Native American reservations but has not done so. The legislature often passes such a resolution but the federally recognized tribe says that it has sovereign authority on its reservation and does not need to collect the state tax. 

New York residents often fail to report their applicable use taxes; this has become a problem both here and at areas surrounding other Indian reservations across New York. Merchants near the reservations complain that the tax-free sales constitute an unfair advantage for Native American-owned businesses. The Mohawk frequently respond that this is their only advantage, as they have suffered from centuries of discrimination and being dispossessed of their land.

While the government officials argue, a Zogby poll commissioned in 2006 by the Seneca Nation of New York, who are also Iroquoian and allies of the Mohawk, showed that 79% of New York residents did not think sales taxes should be collected from reservation sales.

==Education==
Salmon River Central School District covers the whole St. Regis Mohawk Reservation. The district has one school on the reservation:
* St. Regis Mohawk School - Pre-K to grade 6 - It is located on the reservation property. The State of New York owns the building and provides repairs, while the school district staffs the school and provides operational services.
The zoned secondary schools of the Salmon River district are Salmon River Middle School and Salmon River High School.

==In popular culture==
* The reservation is the setting for the movie &quot;Frozen River&quot; (2008). It depicts smuggling of illegal immigrants by Mohawk and associated Americans across the Canada–US border. The film was shot in Plattsburgh, New York.
* The reservation was the setting for the first, original &quot;Tom Swift&quot; children&#x27;s book series (1910–1941).
* The tribe was featured in Season 2, Episode 5 of the CBS drama &quot;, where a racist militia takes up arms against the tribe to defend the US border.

== Patent income==

In 2017, the tribe entered into an agreement with Allergan Plc, under which Allergan transferred intellectual property rights to the drug Restasis to the tribe in an attempt to shield those patent rights from legal challenges. Allergan will pay the tribe $13.75 million, plus $15 million a year in annual revenues. On February 23, 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office deemed the Restasis patents invalid and rejected the St Regis Tribe&#x27;s ability to use sovereign immunity to protect the Restasis patents. Following the announcement, both Allergan and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe appealed the ruling.

<doc id="150801" wikidata="Q3450753" url="?curid=150801" title="Dolgeville, New York">
<text>Dolgeville is a village in Herkimer and Fulton counties, New York, United States. The population was 2,206 at the 2010 census. The village is named after the industrialist Alfred Dolge.

The village is mostly in the eastern part of the town of Manheim (Herkimer County), but is partly in the western edge of the town of Oppenheim (Fulton County). Dolgeville is east of Utica.

==History==
The village was founded in 1794 by Samuel Low with the construction of two mills. A grist mill and later a saw mill were built by Captain John Favill on Ransom Creek about 1795. Soon a little settlement sprang up as other settlers moved in; with a blacksmith shop, tannery and school house. Families by the names of Ayers, Spencer, Ransom, Spofford, Lamberson, Brockett and Rundell soon followed and settled the adjoining lands which they cleared for farms.

The area was at first called &quot;Green&#x27;s Bridge&quot; in 1805, as a settler named Green built a bridge over East Canada Creek. In 1826 the area received its first post office, with Zephi Brockett as postmaster, and the area was renamed &quot;Brockett&#x27;s Bridge&quot; in his honor. In 1881 the citizens unanimously petitioned the authorities at Washington to change the name of the place from &quot;Brockett&#x27;s Bridge&quot; to &quot;Dolgeville&quot;. The village of Dolgeville was incorporated in 1891.
The village changed its name to Dolgeville because of the economic growth promoted by Alfred Dolge (1848–1922), a pioneering and benevolent industrialist. In addition to factories, Dolge built a railroad, laid out the village, built two schools, installed an electric system, a water system, sewage, a fire department, a free library, a concert hall, a gymnasium, public parks, a newspaper, and pioneered in a pension and profit sharing system for employees. Thomas Edison&#x27;s first water-powered dynamo was installed in Dolge&#x27;s factory. Dolge&#x27;s factory largely produced parts and materials for pianos. The Daniel Green shoe company partnered with Dolge after finding that the factory&#x27;s piano felt was also well-suited for slippers. Dolge&#x27;s factory and social endeavors failed financially in 1899, and the Dolge Company Factory Complex became property of the Daniel Green company. Daniel Green was the largest employer in the village until 1999, when it shuttered its operations there.

Lyndon Lyon, who lived in Dolgeville until his death in 1999, developed about 800 hybrid varieties of African violet and helped popularize its use as a houseplant. Lyon&#x27;s greenhouse in Dolgeville still operates and is known for violets and orchids, and Dolgeville&#x27;s annual Violet Festival commemorates him.

In 1965, a caver named James G. Mitchell became trapped under a waterfall while exploring a cave near Dolgeville. Despite a team of cave rescuers arriving on Air Force 2, Mitchell died. Mitchell&#x27;s entrapment and death became a national news story and raised awareness among cavers of the risk of hypothermia. Part of the cave collapsed during the initial attempt to retrieve Mitchell&#x27;s body, and the attempt was abandoned. At the time, the cave mouth was dynamited shut to prevent future mishaps. Mitchell&#x27;s corpse was finally retrieved in 2006 and returned to his family.

In late 2014, Alfred Dolge&#x27;s 1895 mansion, which stood behind the historic factory complex, was destroyed by fire. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined.

The Breckwoldt-Ward House, Menge House Complex, Alfred Dolge Hose Co. No. 1 Building, Dolge Company Factory Complex, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Beaversprite nature preserve is partially in the Fulton County portion of Dolgeville.

North Hudson Woodcraft Corp., which had manufactured piano parts for Steinway since the 1800s until about 2005, now manufactures other wood products such as kitchen cabinets and caskets. Other companies include Gehring-Tricot, which manufactures textile products, and Tumbleforms and Bergeron By Design, which manufacture physical therapy products.

<text>The Tuscarora Reservation (Nyučirhéʼę in Tuscarora) is an Indian reservation of the Tuscarora Nation (Skaru:reʔ Kayeda:kreh in Tuscarora) is an Indian reservation in Niagara County, New York. The reservation population was 1,152 at the 2010 census.

The Tuscarora Nation, previously named the Tuscarora Nation of New York, is a federally recognized tribe of Tuscarora people. The tribe&#x27;s headquarters is located in Lewiston, New York, and their elected chief is Tom Jonathan.

The Tuscarora is the Sixth Nation in the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Their Tuscarora language is an Iroquoian language.

== History ==
=== Precontact to 18th century ===
The Tuscarora tribe had migrated in ancient times from the New York area to the South, where they were based in the Carolinas. After an extended conflict with European settlers and other Native Americans at the beginning of the 18th century and defeat in the Tuscarora War, most of the tribe migrated North, beginning in 1722.

=== 19th century ===
They first located in the territory of the Oneida tribe in central New York. By 1765, they declared their tribe fully relocated and said that remnant Tuscarora who stayed in the South would no longer be considered part of the tribe. The Tuscarora and Oneida became allies of the American Continental cause during the American Revolution, and of the United States during the War of 1812. During both wars, they suffered attacks by British armed forces and their First Nations allies in central New York. The Tuscarora were given land from the Seneca tribe (territory which they had taken from the Neutral Nation in the Beaver Wars of the mid-17th century) in 1797. In 1803, the US government granted the Tuscarora a reservation in Niagara County.

University at Buffalo head football coach Frank Mount Pleasant was born on the reservation in 1884.

=== 20th century ===

In 1960, through the efforts of the powerful appointed official, Robert Moses of New York City, New York State seized of the Tuscarora reservation to form a reservoir for the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant operated by the New York Power Authority. New York needed but only received and had to pay $1,500 per acre per a United States Supreme Court Decision. This led to a displacement of tribal members and a serious disruption to their economy. After a lengthy court case and appeals, in 2003, the Power Authority agreed to compensate the tribe financially and return some unused land.

=== 21st century ===
On October 26, 2019, it was reported that a Niagara Power Project lost more than 600 acres when Robert Moses flooded the land to create a reservoir. From that time on the Reservation experienced and continues to experience a water shortage with the reservation now sitting on top of the highest point in Niagara. &quot; In 2012, 14 out of 15 wells tested positive for lead; 139 wells were tested for harmful bacteria and 69% tested positive for Total Coliforms, while 22% came back positive for E. coli.&quot;

==Geography==

<text>Brewerton is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Cicero in Onondaga County and the town of Hastings in Oswego County in the U.S. state of New York and a northern suburb of the city of Syracuse. It lies at the west end of Oneida Lake at its outlet into the Oneida River. The population was 4,549 at the 2020 census. Maps of the 19th century indicate that this area was once known as Fort Brewerton, while Brewerton meant the Cicero portion.

== History ==

The community is sited near the former Fort Brewerton, erected in 1759 to defend the passage from Albany to the port of Oswego. Settlers arrived in 1789 to engage in the fur trade. The Fort Brewerton Block House Museum contains local relics dating back to Paleo-Indian times. It is located next to the original fort.

In the late 18th century two Presbyterians, Rev. John Shepard and Deacon George Ramsey started preaching in the area near the Fort Brewerton embankment. Deacon Ramsey built a schoolhouse nearby which was used for both instruction and worship.

In 1948 the Brewerton Speedway was built by Alvin Richardson of Buffalo as a 1/4 mile dirt track. Brewerton was working on another track however production has stopped due to state funding.

Fort Brewerton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

==Geography==
Brewerton is located at (43.237428, -76.139369) on the Oneida River on the west end of Oneida Lake.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.6 km2), of which 3.2 square miles (8.2 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (5.11%) is water.

Brewerton has the largest elementary school in the Central Square School District, which is the geographically one of the largest school districts in the State of New York. 

Both U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 81 pass through the hamlet, connecting it to Watertown to the north and Syracuse to the south. In April 2007, the Town of Cicero redrew the traditional boundaries of Brewerton, moving the eastern line west to Interstate 81, and the southern line northward from Mudmill Road to Orangeport Road. This was done to allow Brewerton to remain eligible for Federal grant money. New housing developments had made Brewerton exceed guidelines for &quot;blighted&quot; areas that allow for improvement funds.

In recent years, Brewerton has become a major port for fishing on the already popular Oneida Lake. This is due to the recent Bass Masters outings at Oneida Shores County Park.

Brewerton is now a center in the growth of housing developments Miralago and Champlain at the lake.

<text>Onondaga Reservation is a Native American reservation in Onondaga County, New York, United States. It is the territory of the Onondaga Nation. It lies just south of the city of Syracuse. The population was 2,244 at the 2010 census.

The Onondaga Reservation is a politically independent entity, as the nation is federally recognized by the United States government. The Onondaga Nation has reached some accommodations with New York State on jurisdictional issues.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of 9.3 mi2 (24.1 km2). 9.2 mi2 (24.0 km2) of it is land and of it (0.54%) is water.

New York State Route 11A is a north-south highway in the reservation. The reservation is bordered by the Town of Onondaga and the Town of LaFayette.

==Demographics==
At the 2000 census there were 1,473 people, 304 households, and 292 families residing in the Indian reservation. The population density was 159.2/mi2 (61.5/km2). There were 311 housing units at an average density of 33.6/mi2 (13.0/km2). The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 51.8% Native American, 42.8% White, 1.7% Black or African American, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 3.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.34%.

Of the 304 households, 85.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.9% were married couples living together, 15.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 3.9% were non-families. 1.6% of households were one person, and 0.3% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 4.85 and the average family size was 4.67.

In the Indian reservation, the population was spread out, with 50.2% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 28.0% from 25 to 44, 11.7% from 45 to 64, and 3.5% 65 or older. The median age was 18 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 118.5 males.

The median household income was $65,655 and the median family income was $57,250. Males had a median income of $44,688 versus $28,750 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $15,425. About 8.6% of families and 7.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.6% of those under age 18 and 4.4% of those age 65 or over.

Many members of the Onondaga Nation decline to participate in the U.S. Census, as they do not consider themselves to be U.S. citizens. Therefore, census reportage of the Onondaga Reservation is notoriously untrustworthy. According to a resident speaking in 2001, at the time she spoke, there had been no non-Native residents on the reservation since 1973.

==Education==
The property is in the LaFayette Central School District. The district operates Onondaga Nation School (K-8 school), with high school students going to LaFayette Junior/Senior High School .

The State of New York owns the Onondaga Nation School building and authorizes repairs, while the school district staffs the building and provides operational services.

The Onondaga Nation School began in the 1850s, and a brick building opened in 1940 after a fire razed the previous wooden building.

<doc id="150808" wikidata="Q926058" url="?curid=150808" title="Peach Lake, New York">
<text>Peach Lake is a hamlet (and census-designated place) located mostly in the town of Southeast in Putnam County, New York, United States; a portion of the CDP is in the town of North Salem in Westchester County. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,629.

The community of Peach Lake is located on the northeastern side of a lake with the same name. The lake itself is in two counties. The community is south of Interstate 84.

== Communities ==
There are five communities that surround Peach Lake; one farm, three cooperatives and two home owner associations. Starting on the northern shore of the lake is Ryder Farm, which is an organic farm still owned by the original family from the 1700s. The large area of Peach Lake shoreline they own is the way it was hundreds of years ago. Going clockwise around the lake is Starr Ridge Manor 98 homes (only several on the lake), Vail&#x27;s Grove Cooperative 176 homes, Pietsch Gardens Cooperative 95 homes, Northern Westchester County Club (NWCC) aka &quot;Hotel Property&quot; 85 homes and Bloomerside Cooperative 100 homes.

== Peach Lake water quality ==

Working with the homeowner associations and cooperatives around the lake and with support from the Peach Lake Environmental Coalition, officials of the towns of Southeast and North Salem worked to improve water quality in the lake specifically targeting the reduction of phosphorus loading. To improve the lake&#x27;s water quality the following items were finished between 2012 and 2019:
* personnel from North Salem and Southeast worked with those in other government agencies to fund a $31,500,000 sewer project to provide sewers to homes around the lake. The distribution system and the sewer plant on the north end of Peach Lake was finished and all 484 homes and businesses hooked up by the spring of 2013. 
* In 2016 the North Salem officials secured a $815,000 grant from the NYS DEC, and the East of Hudson Watershed Corporation installed 8 Contech &quot;Jellyfish&quot; catch basins around the lake to remove additional phosphorus. 
* In the April of 2019, as part of the NYS HAB focus, Peach Lake became one of two lakes in the state to be part of a study using alum (aluminum sulfate) to lock the existing phosphorus into the sediment to further limit phosphorus loading in the lake.
* Continuing education of the residences is an ongoing project.

==History==


Peach Lake is located in two towns, North Salem and Southeast, and two counties, Westchester and Putnam. Originally surrounded by farming families, the Bloomer and Palmer families lived on the western side, the Ryder family lived on the northwest side, and to the east were the Vail family.

Prior to 1731, the eastern edge of the Bloomer farm was the border of Connecticut. The area from there to the current state border was given to New York as part of the OBLONG, EQUIVALENCY or Connecticut&#x27;s Panhandle agreement.

The area was a strong dairy community from the 1850s through 1915, when the Borden Condensed Milk factory was in production in Brewster. By 1915, the factory closed after New York City condemned much of the property along the rivers and lakes in the area to protect the water quality flowing into the newly created Croton Reservoir system.

The Bloomer family, originally from Rye, New York, started farming the property on the west side of the lake prior to 1760. In 1762 they purchased the land and built, along with the Palmer family, the Peach Lake Meeting House (Quaker Meeting house) at the southeastern corner of the Lake. This Peach Lake meeting house, like many others, starting at Long Island Sound and heading north, was built in the disputed area between the Connecticut and New York colonies called the Oblong.

The Vail family ran the dairy farm on the eastern side of the lake.

The Ryder family, who have for generations controlled the Putnam County National Bank, have farmed land on the northwest side of Peach Lake since the 18th century.

North Salem was part of the tribal land of a Wappinger Indian band known as the Kitawonks (or Kitchawanks), who laid claim to all the lands bordering the Kitchewan or Croton River that separates North Salem from present-day Somers. Although the name of the lake is Peach Lake, there was no peach orchards in the surrounding area. During the 1600s and 1700s, the lake was called Lake Pehquenakonck. Dutch documents, such as Van der Donck’s 1656 &quot;History of New Netherland&quot;, mention the area. Other maps from Dutch archives, circa 1685, show the &quot;Indian Tribes of the New World&quot; and locations of Indian villages, include Lake Pehquenakonck. The area was later named as Peach Pond, derived from the Indian word Pech-Quen. By the mid-1800s, the name was changed again, to Peach Lake.

The bulk of North Salem&#x27;s residential properties are made up of 1,900 single-family homes - some from the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Geography==
Peach Lake is located at (41.363521, -73.574454).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.76%, is water.

===The Lake===
Spring fed Peach Lake is located in the towns of North Salem and Southeast. The lake is long, wide at its center, and reaches a maximum depth of approximately . Its western side is deeper than the eastern, unequally scalloped by glacial gouging. A sharp thermocline is present at a depth of about where the water temperature may change within an inch. This thermocline protects the lake from excessive weed growth in areas of the lake that are deeper than the thermocline layer, as it is simply too cold for the weeds to start growing. This temperature gradient is caused by the natural springs that feed the lake. There are no rivers entering the lake and only a very small intermittent stream on the southeastern corner.

The lake is a Class B reservoir for the New York City water supply system and, unusually for the area, outflows north through Peach Lake Brook into the East Branch Reservoir in the town of Southeast, which is part of the Croton Reservoir system.

<text>Knaanic (also called Canaanic, Leshon Knaan, Judaeo-Czech, Judeo-Slavic) is a tentative name for a number of West Slavic dialects or registers formerly spoken by the Jews in the lands of the Western Slavs, notably the Czech lands, but also the lands of modern Poland, Lusatia, and other Sorbian regions. They became extinct in the Late Middle Ages. Very little is known about their difference from the surrounding Slavic languages. The largest number of samples of Knaanic written in Hebrew script are in Czech; therefore, most commonly Knaanic is associated with Old Czech.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the &quot;land of Knaan&quot;, a geo-ethnological term denoting the Jewish populations living principally in Czechia, though sometimes applied to all Jewish populations east of the Elbe River (as opposed to the Ashkenazi Jews, living to its west, or the Sephardi Jews of the Iberian Peninsula). As such, the land is often translated as simply &quot;Slavonia&quot; or Slavic Europe.

The term is derived from ancient Canaan (Hebrew: , ).

==History==
The language became extinct some time in the Late Middle Ages, possibly because of the expansion of the Ashkenazi culture and its own Yiddish language, descended from early Middle High German. That hypothesis is often backed by the large number of Yiddish loanwords of Slavic origin, many of which were no longer in use in Slavic languages at the time of the Ashkenazi expansion. They are believed to come from Knaanic rather than from Czech, Sorbian or Polish. The linguist Paul Wexler has hypothesised that Knaanic is actually the direct predecessor of Yiddish and that the language later became Germanised. In other words, the Knaanim, that is, the people speaking the Judaeo-Slavic languages, were the main cause of changes in Yiddish. That view has been dismissed by nearly all mainstream academics, however, and contrasts with the more widely accepted theories of Max Weinreich, who argued that Slavic loanwords were assimilated only after Yiddish had already been fully formed.
The Jewish commentator Rashi was aware of this language. 

===Coinage===
A possible early example of Knaanic is a 9th-century letter for a Jewish community of Ruthenia. One of the very few commonly-accepted examples of Knaanic is inscriptions on bracteate coins issued under Mieszko the Old and Leszek the White, two Polish rulers of 12th and 13th century. The last evidence of usage of the language (written with the Hebrew script) comes from the 16th century.


The reason that Knaanic inscriptions, which use Hebrew letters, appear on coins minted for a Polish duke is that at the time, he leased some mints to Jews. The mint masters were responsible for collecting bullion and striking coins as well as periodically taking in and restriking existing coins.

The inscriptions on the coins range widely. Some are Hebrew names, possibly those of the mintmasters. Some are the names of the towns in which the mint operated, for instance Kalisz, the burial place of Mieszko the Old. Some have the duke&#x27;s name. One in the National Bank of Poland&#x27;s numismatic collection bears the word &quot;bracha&quot;, Hebrew for blessing.

==Classification==
In the 15th edition of Ethnologue (2005) assigned code czk to it and said that the term &quot;Knaanic&quot; is used primarily for Jewish Czech, possibly also for other Jewish variants of West Slavic languages, extinct in the Middle Ages. The 16th edition (2009) no longer lists &quot;Knaanic&quot; among the West Slavic languages. It mentioned it only as an &quot;extinct or artificial&quot; language without further specification and refers to the Linguist List portal. 

 &quot;Ethnologue&quot; once again lists Knaanic as a Czech–Slovak language.

<text>The Poospatuck Reservation is a Native American reservation of the Unkechaugi band in the community of Mastic, Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is one of two Native American reservations in Suffolk County, the other being the Shinnecock Reservation. The population was 436 at the 2020 census.

The Unkechaugi are descendants of the Quiripi-speaking Native Americans, who occupied much of southern New England and central Long Island at the time of European encounter in the colonial era. Historically they spoke an Algonquian language. They have retained a community; the reservation is the smallest in New York State. The current 55 acre reservation was originally set aside for the Unkechaugs as a 175-acre plot by William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith after he purchased large tracts of land from Unkechaug John Mayhew in 1691. It is located in Mastic on the north side of Poospatuck Creek, on the east side of Poospatuck Lane, and south of Eleanor Avenue. Poospatuck is situated in the southeast corner of Suffolk County&#x27;s present-day Town of Brookhaven; and is the township&#x27;s sole Indian reservation. On account of the innumerable tobacco shops, the reservation is known synecdochally as &quot;Mastic Boges&quot; by those in neighboring towns. It is about 70 miles or 1½ hours east of New York City.

The reservation and its people are recognized as Native American by the state of New York but it has not received federal recognition from the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. However, the Unkechaug established that it met the criteria of a Tribe as set out in the Supreme Court case Montoya v. United States, 180 U.S. 261, 266 (1901). The Unkechaug proved beyond a preponderance of the evidence that they met the criteria of a common law definition of a tribe consisting of the following:
# A body of Indians of the same or similar race;
# United in a community under one leadership or government;
# Inhabiting a particular though sometimes ill-defined territory.
In a 2009 case, federal District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto held that the Unkechaug satisfied all 3 Montoya criteria thereby entitling the Unkechaug to Sovereign Immunity from lawsuits because they are a federal Tribe under federal common law.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a land area of , and a water area of . The reservation reports the size of the reservation is actually .

==Demographics==

The median age was 27 years. For every 100 females, there were 78.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.2 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $13,125, and the median income for a family was $17,500. Males had a median income of $47,500 versus $20,250 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $8,127. 36.6% of the population and 36.8% of families were below the poverty line.

<text>Shinnecock Reservation is a Native American reservation for members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation in the town of Southampton in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is the most easterly of the two Native American reservations in Suffolk County; the other being Poospatuck Reservation in the town of Brookhaven. It lies on the east side of Shinnecock Bay on southeastern Long Island, near Tuckahoe, Shinnecock Hills, and the village of Southampton. The population was 819 as of the 2020 census. Roughly that many tribal members additionally live off the reservation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of 1.3073 mi2 (3.3859 km2), all land.

==Demographics==

At the 2010 census there were 662 people and 256 households in the Indian reservation. The population density was 506.4/mi2 (195.5/km2). There were 204 housing units at an average density of 156.0/mi2 (60.2/km2). The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 6.04% White, 4.53% Black or African American, 76.59% Native American, 0.45% Asian, 0.03% from other races, and 12.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.34%.

Of the 256 households 36.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 11.7% are vacant, 8.6% are for rent.

The age distribution was 24.5% under the age of 18, 4.2% from 18 to 20, 7.4% from 20 to 24, 11.3% from 25 to 34, 18.7% from 35 to 49, 21.3% from 50 to 64, and 12.5% 65 or older. For every 100 females, there were 88.1 males.

According to the 2000 Census, the median household income was in the Indian reservation was $14,055, and the median income for a family was $14,143. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $13,750 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $8,843. About 61.3% of families and 50.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 66.1% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

== Tribal recognition and gambling prospects ==
The Shinnecock Nation formally requested federal recognition from the United States government in 1978 and received it in 2010. Recognition was supported by New York Governor David Paterson.

This enabled the tribe to move forward with its plans for a casino; it has already been discussing this with the state and local governments. Opposition to additional casinos in the New York market is based in part on dilution of demand: both the Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut and those in Atlantic City, New Jersey attract thousands of New Yorkers, and Aqueduct Racetrack opened a casino in 2011, and its proximity to the wealthy and powerful located in the neighboring Hamptons communities of the South Fork. 

The Nation has been in discussion with state and local officials on plans to build a Class III casino, as it wants to generate revenues for economic development and welfare for the tribe. It would share revenues with the state for such an enterprise off the reservation. The tribe and other parties prefer a location out of the Hamptons area, which is already bogged down with heavy traffic during the summer season, when the population of the Town of Southampton doubles. In addition, they would face heavy competition on eastern Long Island, as New Yorkers make up 30% of the customers of the highly successful Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Casinos in Connecticut.

The Shinnecock Indian Nation and their partners (Gateway Casino Resorts, LLC and Michael J. Malik Sr. dba MJM Enterprises and MJM Enterprises &amp; Development) paid D.C. lobbyists $1,140,000 from 2005 to 2009 to support their effort to gain recognition and approved gaming.

<text>Gibsonville (&quot;City of Roses&quot;) is a town in both Alamance and Guilford counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Most of Gibsonville is situated in the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point Combined Statistical Area and the eastern portion is in the Burlington, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area, encompassing all of Alamance County. According to the 2020 census, the population of Gibsonville was 8,971.

==History==
Joseph Gibson (1785-1857), whose father established farming and gold mining operations in Gibsonville as early as 1775, was a local farmer who provided grading services in 1851 for the newly formed North Carolina Railroad (NCRR) Company. Shortly afterwards Gibsonville began to emerge as a commerce center.

The first train arrived on October 9, 1855, and the depot was named Gibson Station in his honor. On February 18, 1871, the state legislature issued a charter officially establishing the Town of Gibsonville.

Gold mining played a minor role here when deposits were discovered on Gibson Hill (or Gold Hill) south of town in the early 1800s. In 1888, the Chifar Consolidated Gold Mine Company began crushing ore at a mine a half mile south of the depot in Gibsonville.

The town cemetery is located in that area, but no graves have yielded gold. Captain Billy Gilmer owned one of the first stores in town built before 1860, supplying farmers and miners. His wooden general store was at the corner of Main Street and Piedmont Street where Reno&#x27;s Pizza is now. Several wooden saloons were also located downtown during the frenzied gold mining days, making Gibsonville a rough and ready town with few restrictions.
The Depot Greens served as a holding area for livestock and agricultural goods being shipped out on the railroad, which was the primary economic purpose of Gibsonville. In 1886, a local self-taught entrepreneurial mill builder, Berry Davidson, constructed the steam powered Minneola textile mill on Railroad Avenue. Subsequently, he built the Hiawatha textile mill on Eugene Street in 1893. Together, these mills transformed Gibsonville from an agricultural shipping station into a vibrant small town with an industrial base.

In 1894, Dr. Jordan built the first two-story brick building downtown on the corner of Main Street and Lewis Street, where Wade&#x27;s Jewelry is situated now. The remainder of the brick buildings facing the Greens were built between 1905 and 1920. The early 1920s were a boom time for Gibsonville when Main Street was paved, water and sewer lines installed, and street lights erected. The wooden buildings were replaced with brick structures standing today.

Prior to 1912, the Gibsonville Development Company was founded by leading citizens A. B. Owens, J.W. Burke, and D. M. Davidson (son of Berry Davidson), plus P.L. Kivett later. These civic leaders were responsible for creating the town&#x27;s telephone exchange, Bank, lumber yard, the Gibsonville Hosiery Mill on Apple Street, multiple, plus several houses. They also expanded the Rock Creek Dairy into the largest dairy in the state.

The town&#x27;s population grew slowly from 111 residents in 1890 to more than 6,410 in 2010. Most of the rapid growth occurred after 1970 when the town&#x27;s population was 2,024 residents.

When the mills closed in the 1980s, the town slowly transformed itself into a commuter residential community for the Burlington and Greensboro metro area.

Gibsonville has been known as the &quot;City of Roses&quot; since at least 1920, when train passengers could see the large number of rose bushes along the railroad tracks at the Minneola Mill.

The Gibsonville School, Francis Marion Smith House, and Simeon Wagoner House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is almost evenly split between Alamance and Guilford counties, though biased towards Guilford County, but, is economically and geographically connected to the town of Elon, and Elon University in Alamance County. Gibsonville was named for Joseph Gibson, a prominent Guilford County planter of the antebellum period. Gibson&#x27;s Federal-style house remains near Gibsonville and is recognized as a Guilford County landmark property.

<text>Mebane ( ) is a city located mostly in Alamance County, North Carolina, United States, and partly in Orange County. The town was named for Alexander Mebane, an American Revolutionary War general and member of the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gannett 1905 https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n203 204&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated as &quot;Mebanesville&quot; in 1881, and in 1883 the name was changed to &quot;Mebane&quot;. It was incorporated as a city in 1987. The population as of the 2020 census was 17,797.

Mebane is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in North Carolina. Mebane straddles the Research Triangle and Piedmont Triad Regions of North Carolina. The bulk of the city is in Alamance County, which comprises the Burlington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, itself a component of the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, NC Combined Statistical Area. Two slivers in the eastern portion of the city are in Orange County, which is part of the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, itself a component of the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The town was incorporated as Mebansville in 1880. Its name was changed to Mebane three years later. It is named after Brigadier General Alexander Mebane, an officer during the American Revolution who later served as a U.S. Congressman.

The Charles F. and Howard Cates Farm, William Cook House, Cooper School, Cross Roads Presbyterian Church and Cemetery and Stainback Store, Durham Hosiery Mill No. 15, Griffis-Patton House, Thomas Guy House, Hawfields Presbyterian Church, Henderson Scott Farm Historic District, Mebane Commercial Historic District, Old South Mebane Historic District, Paisley-Rice Log House, White Furniture Company, and Woodlawn School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1939 as part of the New Deal, Margaret C. Gates won a competition sponsored by the Section of Painting and Sculpture of the Treasury Department to create a post office mural in Mebane. Her painting, &quot;Landscape—Tobacco Curing&quot;, which showed a man and a young boy walking in tandem on their way to work on a tobacco farm, was completed and installed in 1941. In 1965, when the post office was remodeled, the mural was damaged beyond repair, as officials tried to remove it for restoration. A local artist, Henry E. Rood III, was hired to create an exact replica of the painting to adorn the new facility.

While the North Carolina Department of Transportation had long-standing plans to reroute North Carolina Highway 119, currently running through the city&#x27;s downtown, to a new alignment further west, concerns in predominantly African-American communities along the proposed route, combined with longstanding dissatisfaction with access to municipal services, resulted in civil rights complaints being filed by the West End Revitalization Association and other local residents against the Department of Transportation and city government. Although a four-year moratorium on the project was established in 1999, the Federal Highway Administration eventually granted approval in December 2009.

In October 2014, the city council voted to adopt a new seal and slogan, replacing &quot;A progressive community, the perfect place to call home&quot; with &quot;Positively Charming&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.36%, is water.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 17,797 people, 5,763 households, and 3,745 families residing in the city.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 11,393 people living in the city. The population density was . There were 5,045 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 73.5% White, 20.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.2% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6% of the population.

==Telephone service==
Mebane straddles the Research Triangle and the Piedmont Triad areas of North Carolina. However, a majority of the phone numbers listed for the city are in the 919/984 area code, whereas the rest of Alamance County is situated in the 336/743 area code. When the Triad was split off into area code 910 in 1993, it was decided that Mebane would stay in 919 to keep the entire city within the same area code. This was retained even after the Triad split from 910 as its own area code, 336, in 1998. Since then, 984 has been introduced as an overlay with 919, followed by 743 as an overlay for 336.

==Media==
Reflecting that the city is split between two television markets, Spectrum&#x27;s Mebane system offers stations from both the Triad and Triangle. DirecTV, Dish Network and U-verse customers receive the Triad local feed, since most of the city is in Alamance County. Mebane has a weekly community newspaper, the Mebane Enterprise, which covers the Mebane city government, local arts and culture, high school sports and local breaking news.

==Airport==
Mebane is home to Hurdle Field, airport code 4W7.

Hurdle Field is no longer operational and is now a residential development.

==Education==
The Alamance County portion is served by the Alamance-Burlington School System (which was created by a merger between the Alamance County School System and the Burlington City School System in 1996), while the Orange County portion is served by Orange County Schools.

The public schools serving Mebane residents within Alamance County include Eastern Alamance High School, Hawfields Middle School, Woodlawn Middle School, Audrey W. Garrett Elementary School, South Mebane Elementary School, and E. M. Yoder Elementary School; all part of the Alamance - Burlington School System (ABSS).

Mebane residents in the Orange County portion are zoned to Efland Cheeks Elementary School, Gravely Hill Middle School, Orange Middle School, Orange High School, and Cedar Ridge High School.

There is one private school in Mebane, Bradford Academy, a classical Christian school started in 2008.

Mebane is within of several notable universities, including Duke University, UNC Chapel Hill, North Carolina Central University and Elon University. North Carolina State University &amp; Saint Augustine&#x27;s University are just over away in Raleigh.

Alamance Community College is a two-year college in Graham, west of Mebane.

==Commerce==

Downtown Mebane was named a Top Five Great Place in North Carolina for 2017. 
Downtown Mebane is home to many high-end home furnishing stores, antique shops, and trendy clothing stores. The downtown also houses a wide variety of restaurants. The downtown area also boasts several antique and curio shops, also with a local flair. Coffee shops are populated by many residents and attract many young professionals and students.

Garrett Crossing, a shopping center located on the south side of Mebane next to Interstate 85 and Interstate 40, include a big box retail anchor as well as dining and other smaller shops. A Tanger Outlet mall is located on Arrowhead Boulevard on the north side of I-85 in Mebane.

==Climate==
Beech Mountain has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), and is the coldest town in North Carolina as well as all of Southeastern US, with winters comparable to coastal New England and summers far cooler than the surrounding Piedmont and even other mountain towns. Summers are typically mild and rainy, with some cooler and warmer days sprinkled in. Winter temperatures are cold and very snowy, with daily highs around freezing and lows in the teens, though above freezing winter highs tend to keep the snowpack down.

==Recreation==
Beech Mountain has become known as a recreational mecca on the East Coast and is the main driver in its economy. Due to its high altitude, the cool summer temperatures make it an ideal place to escape the heat of the flat lands and the ample snowfall during the winter allows for over 3 months of skiing and snowboarding each year.

=== Hiking ===
Beech Mountain has over 28 miles of dedicated hiking trail within the town limits. Popular trails include Upper and Lower Pond Creek, which traverse along the banks of Pond Creek, and Grassy Gap Trail, which descends along Grassy Gap Creek to Buckeye Recreation Center. The Emerald Outback has become a popular hiking and trail running destination, boasting 11 miles of pristine trail mostly above 5,000&#x27; in altitude. Several overlooks exist facing the southward mountains in the trail system. Each summer, the recreation department provides guided hikes to view birds, flowers, plants, and other items along the trails.

=== Biking ===
Biking on Beech Mountain has been a staple since the early days of the town. Cyclists enjoy both road cycling and mountain biking opportunities atop the mountain. The recreation department maintains the Emerald Outback trail system and has invested into several trails with jumps, berms, and other features. During the summer months, Beech Mountain Resort opens their downhill bike park, which is accessible via chair lift. Several competitions take place on the downhill trails each year. Beech Mountain is also known for its road cycling. Highway 184 on the front side of the mountain is one of the most difficult climbs in the southern United States. It was made famous during the 1990s as it was the queen stage of the now defunct Tour DuPont, as well as during Lance Armstrong&#x27;s recovery from cancer treatment.

=== Fishing ===
While the mountain does not contain the large rivers typically associated with mountain trout fishing, there is a plethora of places to cast a rod within the town limits. Over 3 miles of the streams on the mountain are stocked with trout from the NC Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as Buckeye Lake and Lake Coffey. Fish include brown, rainbow, and brook trout. Guided tours are available through the Buckeye Recreation Center, as well as single day fishing licenses specific to Beech Mountain. Each year in June, the Kiddo Fishing Derby attracts several kids to Lake Coffey as the season opens for trout fishing.

=== Skiing and snowboarding ===
Beech Mountain was originally developed around the ski resort, Beech Mountain Resort. The resort was opened in 1967 and has expanded ever since. Currently, there are 17 trails and 8 lifts over 95 skiable acres. The mountain hosted large racing events during the 1970s that attracted several Olympians to the resort. After falling into disrepair at the turn of the century, the owners of the resort have begun making large capital improvements to bring the resort back to it prior grandeur. There is a wide range of terrain, including a beginner area, a terrain park with several jumps and features, more difficult terrain, and one of the top slopes in the south on the backside of the mountain in Oz Run.

=== Sledding and tubing ===
Beech Mountain is the only municipality in the southern United States to operate a free public sledding hill. Located across from the town hall building, the sled hill is open all winter long to children under the age of 12. The hill is no longer supervised during business hours, which roughly coincide with daylight. Patrons must bring their own sleds, which can be brought from home, rented or purchased at nearby merchants. Also, be prepared to pay hourly metered parking (the hill is a bit steep &amp; long to walk with small children), card accepted.

Beech Mountain Resort offers tubing, which users must purchase tickets in person for, only issued on the day of visit. Tubing tickets are sold in two hour blocks (times available based on weekday/weekend) but be aware that you actually get less because the tube lanes close at least 15 minutes prior to end of session. You can sign the waiver electronically online, which will save you time at the ticket booth.

=== Buckeye Recreation Center ===
The Buckeye Recreation Center is an indoor facility dedicated to expanding the recreational needs of residents and visitors alike and is the central hub of the town recreation department. The center opened in 2005 and includes a full-size gymnasium, indoor tennis court, 2 indoor pickleball courts, meeting areas, fitness area with state-of-the-art equipment, kids playroom, an indoor walking track, and lobby with free WiFi. Outside of the building, there are 2 outdoor tennis courts, a softball field, a walking path, and large ropes playground. Additionally, the center rents out canoes, kayaks, and other water equipment for use in nearby Buckeye Lake. During the summer, the center hosts a daycamp for kids of all ages, as well as several other activities and events for residents and visitors alike.

=== Other activities ===
With 63 miles of low traffic town roads, Beech Mountain offers a great place for road running and walking. Several running races take place on the mountain each year. During the winter months, less traveled roads are not plowed, which allows for usage of cross country skis and snowshoes. These activities are also permitted on the town maintained trails. The Beech Mountain Resort also offers ice skating in the winter, as well as roller skating and disc golf in the summer months.

<text>Seven Devils is a town in Avery and Watauga counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 313 at the 2020 census. The town, which is located in the Appalachian Mountains, is best known as the site of a popular wintertime tubing resort known as Hawksnest, which claims it has the largest tubing facility on the East Coast, and some of the town&#x27;s year round residents earn their living at the resort. Many others are retirees. Developed in the 1970s as a vacation home community, Seven Devils is home mostly to seasonal residents.

==History==
In the mid-1960s, seven men from the Winston-Salem area established the unincorporated community of Seven Devils with the vision of creating a recreational resort. The seven founders included four brothers, Herbert Reynolds, Frank Reynolds, Galloway Reynolds and Dan Reynolds, and their partners George Kempton, Ray Smith and Gardner Gidley. They wanted a unique name to attract visitors and decided upon &quot;Seven Devils&quot; based on a combination of factors. There were seven founders and seven distinct peaks from the ridge line of the Blue Ridge Parkway that viewed the area, and locals often said that &quot;the wind blows like the devil up there in the winter time.&quot;

In its early days, Seven Devils featured a campground, swimming lake, horseback riding trails and stables, rental cottages and a general store. The Seven Devils Golf &amp; Ski Resort opened in December 1968, attracting more visitors and residents. The town of Seven Devils was incorporated on June 30, 1979.

In the early 1980s, Jon Reynolds assumed ownership of the ski area and changed its name to Ski Hawksnest. The resort soon became a favorite among locals and college students, offering low ticket prices, a bar with live music, and a weekend night skiing session called &quot;Nighthawk&quot; that ran from 10pm to 4am. In 1993, Leonard Cottom, who owned the neighboring Hanging Rock Golf and Country Club, purchased the ski area, changing the name to Hawksnest Golf &amp; Ski Resort. In 2008, under the ownership of Lenny Cottom, Hawksnest closed for skiing to focus on snow tubing and ziplining.
