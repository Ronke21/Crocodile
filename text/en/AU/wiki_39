<text>Watauga is a city in Carter and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The population was 403 at the 2000 census, 458 at the 2010 census, 361 in the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==

Some of the earliest European pioneers in Tennessee settled in the vicinity of Watauga in the mid-18th century. William Bean, traditionally recognized as Tennessee&#x27;s first white settler, built his cabin at the mouth of Boone Creek, downstream from modern Watauga, in 1769. The Watauga Association, an early frontier government, operated out of nearby Elizabethton in the 1770s.

When the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad (ET&amp;V) was built in the 1850s, a railroad stop known as Carter&#x27;s Depot, or Carter&#x27;s Station, was established at what is now Watauga, where a trestle had been erected to carry the tracks across the Watauga River. Carter&#x27;s Depot consisted of a water tank, several storage buildings, a telegraph office, and a post office.

The trestle at Carter&#x27;s Depot held immense strategic importance during the Civil War, as the ET&amp;V was part of a vital supply line connecting Virginia with the rest of the South. The trestle was among those targeted by the East Tennessee bridge burnings in November 1861, though the conspirators found it too heavily guarded by Confederates. In late December 1862, General Samuel P. Carter conducted a raid into the region, overwhelming the Confederate detachment at Carter&#x27;s Depot before destroying the trestle. On October 1, 1864, a skirmish took place at Carter&#x27;s Depot, with Union forces under General Alvan C. Gillem pushing Confederates led by John C. Vaughn across the river.

<text>Silerton is a town in Hardeman and Chester counties in the western part of Tennessee. The population was 111 at the 2010 census.

==History==

In 1869, Jesse, Spencer, Horace, and Jame Siler, sons of Solomon Siler, and John, Josiah, James, and Edward Siler, the sons of James Siler, purchased the land after moving from Siler City, North Carolina. There they raised their families, many of whom are still related to Silerton residents today. With the arrival of the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1917, Silerton became a railroad town. The depot would be named after the Siler family, many of whom maintained important businesses in the area. Eventually, the town&#x27;s name would be changed to &quot;Silerton&quot; to avoid confusion with the nearby town of Serles. The town would also grow into a venue for the timber trade. In 1923, Silerton was incorporated as a municipality by a private act of the state legislature.

<doc id="151066" wikidata="Q81745" url="?curid=151066" title="Classical physics">
<text>Classical physics refers to physics theories that are non-quantum or both non-quantum and non-relativistic, depending on the context. In historical discussions, &quot;classical physics&quot; refers to pre-1900 physics, while &quot;modern physics&quot; refers to post-1900 physics, which incorporates elements of quantum mechanics and relativity. However relativity is based on classical field theory rather than quantum field theory and is often categorized with &quot;classical physics&quot;.

== Overview ==

&quot;Classical theory&quot; has at least two distinct meanings in physics. It can include all those areas of physics that do not make use of quantum mechanics, which includes classical mechanics (using any of the Newtonian, Lagrangian, or Hamiltonian formulations), as well as classical electrodynamics and relativity. Alternatively, the term can refer to theories that are neither quantum or relativistic.

Depending on point of view, among the branches of theory sometimes included in classical physics are:
* Classical mechanics
** Newton&#x27;s laws of motion
** Classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
* Classical electrodynamics (Maxwell&#x27;s equations)
* Classical thermodynamics

== Comparison with modern physics ==
In contrast to classical physics, &quot;modern physics&quot; is usually used to focus on those revolutionary changes created by quantum physics and theory of relativity. 

A physical system can be described by classical physics when it satisfies conditions such that the laws of classical physics are approximately valid.

In practice, physical objects ranging from those larger than atoms and molecules, to objects in the macroscopic and astronomical realm, can be well-described (understood) with classical mechanics. Beginning at the atomic level and lower, the laws of classical physics break down and generally do not provide a correct description of nature. Electromagnetic fields and forces can be described well by classical electrodynamics at length scales and field strengths large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. Unlike quantum physics, classical physics is generally characterized by the principle of complete determinism, although deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics do exist.

From the point of view of classical physics as being non-relativistic physics, the predictions of general and special relativity are significantly different from those of classical theories, particularly concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Traditionally, light was reconciled with classical mechanics by assuming the existence of a stationary medium through which light propagated, the luminiferous aether, which was later shown not to exist.

== Comparison to quantum physics ==

Mathematically, quantum physics equations are those containing tbe Planck constant. According to the correspondence principle and Ehrenfest&#x27;s theorem, as a system becomes larger or more massive the classical dynamics tends to emerge, with some exceptions, such as superfluidity. This is why we can usually ignore quantum mechanics when dealing with everyday objects and the classical description will suffice. Decoherence is the field of research concerned with the discovery of how the laws of quantum physics give rise to classical physics.

<text>Tullahoma is a city in Coffee and Franklin counties in southern Middle Tennessee, United States. The population was 20,339 at the 2020 census. In 2019, the population was estimated to be 19,555. It is the principal city of the Tullahoma micropolitan area (a 2009 estimate placed it at 99,927), which consists of Coffee and Moore counties and is the second largest micropolitan area in Tennessee. The city is also partially in the Winchester Micropolitan area.

==History==
Tullahoma was founded in 1852 as a work camp along the new Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. Its name is derived from the Choctaw language, and means &quot;red rock&quot;.

An alternative explanation (see Sam Davis Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Soldier of Tennessee&quot; and sources cited therein) of the name is that Peter Decherd, who donated the land for the railroad right-of-way (and was therefore given the right to name two stations along the line), named one station Decherd, after himself, and the other as Tulkahoma (later changed to Tullahoma). Tullahoma was the name of Decherd&#x27;s favorite horse, which had been named for a Choctaw chief captured by Decherd&#x27;s grandfather. (There was also a town called Tullahoma in Mississippi, which later changed its name to Grenada.)

The earliest settlement was by farmers from Virginia and North Carolina. Using African-American slave labor, they developed plantations for tobacco and hemp. Slaves also tended their livestock, both horses and cattle. Early families were named Moore, Decherd (pronounced as Deckerd), Anderson, Ragon, Montgomery, Ferrell, Stephenson, and Gunn.

They called a nearby spring Bottle Spring, though it was later known as John Gunn&#x27;s Spring, since it was on his property. Nowadays, it is called Big Springs. This spring provided water for the steam locomotives. Later it was exploited for health and tourist attractions, as the town developed spa facilities.

When the Civil War began in April 1861, Company B, 1st Regiment of Tennessee Volunteers, was formed in Tullahoma. It joined General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. The division fought in the battles of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Petersburg, before surrendering to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox.

During the war, Tullahoma served in 1863 as the headquarters for the Confederate Army of Tennessee. That year the Union Army undertook the Tullahoma Campaign, defeating Confederate forces and taking control of Middle Tennessee. Federal troops occupied this area for the duration of the war. As a result of the campaign, Union forces captured Chattanooga.

Tullahoma was little more than a rough frontier outpost, and had no paved streets. 1863 was a wet year, and the place became known to the bedraggled troops of both sides as a place of endless mud. An aide on Confederate General William Hardee&#x27;s staff is said to have written his own account of the origin of the name: &quot;It is from two Greek words – &#x27;Tulla&#x27; meaning mud, and &#x27;Homa,&#x27; meaning more mud.&quot;

The selection of Tullahoma as a headquarters by Confederate General Braxton Bragg has been much criticized by military historians. Although the location was strategic with regard to the road and rail network, it had no strong natural defenses. Bragg did little to fortify it while his forces occupied the area. Eventually the town was evacuated without a battle.

After the war, Tullahoma recovered slowly, but began to prosper owing to its railroad link. It became renowned for its educational facilities, a rarity in the area at the time.

At the turn of the 20th century, Tullahoma became a popular health destination, with many spas across town to take advantage of Big Springs.

Manufacturing was developed in the area, notably of shoes, clothing, and sporting goods. In 1924, the General Shoe Corporation was established here, which eventually developed as Genesco. The diversified apparel firm is Tennessee&#x27;s oldest listed firm on the New York Stock Exchange. Since the early 1900s, a variety of sports products have been manufactured in Tullahoma, including baseballs, bats, and golf clubs by Campbell Mfg, Wilsons, Worth Sports, Tennessee Tanning Co. and Rawlings.

In 1939, U.S. Route 41A was built through town. This improved access between the town and Nashville, to the northwest, and Chattanooga, to the southeast.

The noted whiskey brand of George Dickel is made in Cascade Hollow, just north of Tullahoma near Normandy, TN. Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey is distilled southwest of Tullahoma in Lynchburg.

From the 1930s to mid-20th century, the area benefited from considerable federal investment and development: the projects of the Tennessee Valley Authority constructed dams and related facilities to generate hydroelectric power and electrify many rural areas, as well as providing needed jobs during the Great Depression. Camp Forrest was established during World War II as an infantry training center and later POW camp. The Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) was constructed near Tullahoma after WWII as a major development and test center for the Air Force and other DOD organizations, as well as NASA. Woods Reservoir was built to provide cooling water for AEDC. It was instrumental in the development of numerous aerospace systems, as well development for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. It remains as the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world. Later the state established two institutions of higher learning here, the Motlow State Community College and an aerospace engineering graduate school, the University of Tennessee Space Institute.

Today manufacturing makes up a smaller part of the Tullahoma economy. The town&#x27;s growth has been steady though slow since the late 20th century, based on a mixture of education, services, tourism, and retail. The area is a major hub for aerospace, particularly aerospace ground testing, due to the presence of AEDC and the Space Institute. The former Sverdrup Technology Inc., now a subsidy of Jacobs Engineering, is a major supplier of wind tunnels, test equipment and support. Microcraft, Inc., which built the first air-breathing flight vehicles to reach Mach 7-10 under the NASA X-43a program, is located near the downtown square. A national aircraft preservation museum, Beechcraft Heritage Museum, was established on grounds south of the city&#x27;s municipal airport.

Tullahoma celebrated its 150th (sesquicentennial) anniversary on October 4, 2002.

Rock pioneer Little Richard Penniman died in Tullahoma in 2020.

The town was featured in the song, &quot;Tullahoma Dancing Pizza Man&quot; by Eddie Rabbitt off of the album &quot;Rocky Mountain Music.&quot;

<text>Goodlettsville is a city in Davidson and Sumner counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It was incorporated as a city in 1958 with a population of just over 3,000 residents; in 2020, the population was 17,789. It is part of the Nashville metropolitan area.

The northern half of Goodlettsville is in Sumner County, while the southern half is in Davidson County. In 1963, when the city of Nashville merged with the government of Davidson County, Goodlettsville chose to remain autonomous. The city is home to the corporate headquarters of Dollar General and the Rivergate Mall shopping center.

==History==
Long hunter and early Middle Tennessee settler Kasper Mansker was reportedly born on an immigrant ship bound for the American colonies. Little is known about his German ancestry or his early life. Mansker began to explore the wilds of Kentucky and Tennessee with a group of long hunters in 1769. A journey taken in 1772 introduced Mansker to the rich resources of Middle Tennessee, especially what is now Sumner County and Davidson County. Near a salt lick and a large creek now known as Mansker&#x27;s Creek in the present-day city of Goodlettsville, Mansker established his own fortified station, Mansker&#x27;s Station, in the winter of 1779–1780, which was a winter remembered for its severe temperatures.

Goodlettsville was named for A. G. Goodlett, pastor of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church from 1848 to 1853.

In April 1892, two daughters of the white Bruce family of Goodlettsville claimed to have been assaulted. African-American brothers Ephraim and Henry Grizzard were arrested as suspects. Henry was lynched and hanged in the town on April 24, 1892. His brother Ephraim had been jailed in Nashville for the same incident. On April 30, 1892, Ephraim Grizzard was taken from jail and lynched by a mob of 10,000 in the courthouse square. His body was taken to Goodlettsville, where it was burned.

===21st century===
Among the industries established in Goodlettsville is a Tyson Foods plant. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the state and city in the spring of 2020, the Metro Health department investigated a reported cluster of COVID-19 cases in April among employees working at the plant. They worked in close quarters and had difficulty avoiding contracting the disease, especially at a time when so little was known about its transmission. On April 22, 2020, 120 of the approximately 1,600 employees were confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participated in this investigation. Food processing plants proved to be high-risk environments for frontline employees as the pandemic progressed, although the company instituted social distancing and other measures. By May 22, 2020, some 345 Tyson employees had contracted COVID-19 at this plant. Another nearby plant had been closed to allow deep cleaning.

<doc id="151069" wikidata="Q150611" url="?curid=151069" title="Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Ferdinand I (10 March 1503, Alcalá de Henares, Castile– 25 July 1564, Vienna, Austria) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1556, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia from 1526, and Archduke of Austria from 1521 until his death in 1564. Before his accession as emperor, he ruled the Austrian hereditary lands of the House of Habsburg in the name of his elder brother, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Also, he often served as Charles&#x27; representative in the Holy Roman Empire and developed encouraging relationships with German princes. In addition, Ferdinand also developed valuable relationships with the German banking house of Jakob Fugger and the Catalan bank, Banca Palenzuela Levi Kahana.

The key events during his reign were the conflict with the Ottoman Empire, which in the 1520s began a great advance into Central Europe, and the Protestant Reformation, which resulted in several wars of religion. Although not a military leader, Ferdinand was a capable organizer with institutional imagination who focused on building a centralized government for Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia instead of striving for universal monarchy. He reintroduced major innovations of his grandfather Maximilian I such as the &quot;Hofrat&quot; (court council) with a chancellery and a treasury attached to it (this time, the structure would last until the reform of Maria Theresa) and added innovations of his own such as the &quot;Raitkammer&quot; (collections office) and the Hofkriegsrat, conceived to counter the threat from the Ottoman Empire, while also successfully subduing the most radical of his rebellious Austrian subjects and turning the political class in Bohemia and Hungary into Habsburg partners. While he was able to introduce uniform models of administration, the governments of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary remained distinct though. His approach to Imperial problems, including governance, human relations and religious matters was generally flexible, moderate and tolerant. Ferdinand&#x27;s motto was : &quot;Let justice be done, though the world perish&quot;.

==Biography==
Ferdinand was born in 1503 in Alcalá de Henares, Castile, the second son of Philip I of Castile and Joanna of Castile. He shared the same name, birthday (March 10th), culture and customs with his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand II of Aragon and became the latter’s favorite grandchild, their own mothers also had the same name, Juana Enriquez and Joanna of Castile. After the death of his father in 1506, his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand II of Aragon, assumed guardianship of the prince. He was raised in the royal household and received an education in literature, the sciences, and languages. Ferdinand was a good student and grew up to be a patron of the arts and a patron of scholars at his court. The prince did not learn German until he was a young adult. 

Music played an important part in his childhood. When he was an infant, his maternal grandmother, Isabella I of Castile, ordered that among the 24 servants attending the newborn, there should be four musicians. In 1505, after Isabella&#x27;s death, King Ferdinand established for the younger Ferdinand a household with 62 servants and his own music chapel. 

In the summer of 1518 Ferdinand was sent to Flanders following his brother Charles&#x27;s arrival in Castile as newly appointed King Charles I the previous autumn. Ferdinand returned in command of his brother&#x27;s fleet but en route was blown off-course and spent four days in Kinsale in Ireland before reaching his destination. With the death of his grandfather Maximilian I and the accession of his now 19-year-old brother, Charles V, to the title of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, Ferdinand was entrusted with the government of the Austrian hereditary lands, roughly modern-day Austria and Slovenia. He was Archduke of Austria from 1521 to 1564. Though he supported his brother, Ferdinand also managed to strengthen his own realm. By adopting the German language and culture later in his life, he also grew close to the German territorial princes.

After the death of his brother-in-law Louis II, Ferdinand ruled as king of Bohemia and Hungary (1526–1564). Ferdinand also served as his brother&#x27;s deputy in the Holy Roman Empire during his brother&#x27;s many absences, and in 1531 was elected King of the Romans, making him Charles&#x27;s designated heir in the empire. Charles abdicated in 1556 and Ferdinand adopted the title &quot;Emperor elect&quot;, with the ratification of the Imperial diet taking place in 1558, while the kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula, the Spanish Empire, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Netherlands and Franche-Comté went to Philip, son of Charles.

==Hungary and the Ottomans==

According to the terms set at the First Congress of Vienna in 1515, Ferdinand married Anne Jagiellonica, daughter of King Vladislaus II of Hungary and Bohemia on 22 July 1515. Both Hungary and Bohemia were elective monarchies, where the parliaments had the sovereign right to decide about the person of the king. Therefore, after the death of his brother-in-law Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia, at the Battle of Mohács on 29 August 1526, Ferdinand immediately applied to the parliaments of Hungary and Bohemia to participate as a candidate in the royal elections. On 24 October 1526 the Bohemian Diet, acting under the influence of chancellor Adam of Hradce, elected Ferdinand king of Bohemia under conditions of confirming traditional privileges of the estates and also moving the Habsburg court to Prague. The success was only partial, as the Diet refused to recognise Ferdinand as hereditary lord of the kingdom.

The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and John Zápolya, Voivode of Transylvania. They were supported by different factions of the nobility in the Hungarian kingdom. Ferdinand also had the support of his brother, the Emperor Charles V.

On 10 November 1526, John Zápolya was proclaimed king by a Diet at Székesfehérvár, elected in the parliament by the untitled lesser nobility (gentry).

Nicolaus Olahus, secretary of Louis, attached himself to the party of Ferdinand but retained his position with his sister, Queen Dowager Mary. Ferdinand was also elected King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, etc. by the higher aristocracy (the magnates or barons) and the Hungarian Catholic clergy in a rump Diet in Pozsony (&quot;Bratislava&quot; in Slovak) on 17 December 1526. Accordingly, Ferdinand was crowned as King of Hungary in the Székesfehérvár Basilica on 3 November 1527.

The Croatian nobles unanimously accepted the Pozsony election of Ferdinand I, receiving him as their king in the 1527 election in Cetin, and confirming the succession to him and his heirs. In return for the throne, King Ferdinand promised to respect the historic rights, freedoms, laws and customs of the Croats when they united with the Hungarian kingdom and to defend Croatia from Ottoman invasion.

Brendan Simms notes that the reason Ferdinand was able to gain this sphere of power was Charles V&#x27;s difficulties in coordinating between the Austrian, Hungarian fronts and his Mediterranean fronts in the face of the Ottoman threat, as well as in his German, Burgundian and Italian theatres of war against German Protestant princes and France. Thus the defense of central Europe was subcontracted to Ferdinand as well as many responsibilities involving the management of the empire. Charles V abdicated as archduke of Austria 1522, and nine years after that he had the German princes elect Ferdinand as King of the Romans, who thus became his designated successor. &quot;This had profound implications for state formation in south-eastern Europe. Ferdinand rescued Bohemia and Silesia from the Hungarian wreckage, making his north-eastern flank more secure. He told the Austrian Landtag, the assembled representatives of the nobility, at Linz in 1530 that &#x27;the Turks cannot be resisted unless the Kingdom of Hungary was in the hands of an Archduke of Austria or another German prince&#x27;. After some hesitation, Croatia and the Hungarian rump joined the Habsburgs. In both cases, the link was essentially a contractual one, directly linked to Ferdinand&#x27;s ability to provide protection against the Turks.&quot;

The Austrian lands were in miserable economic and financial conditions, but Ferdinand was forced to introduce the so-called Turk Tax (&quot;Türkensteuer&quot;) to finance his campaign against the Ottoman threat. In spite of the huge Austrian sacrifices, he was not able to collect enough money to pay for the expenses of the defence costs of Austrian lands. His annual revenues only allowed him to hire 5,000 mercenaries for two months; thus Ferdinand asked for help from his brother, Emperor Charles V, and started to borrow money from rich bankers like the Fugger family.

Ferdinand defeated Zápolya at the Battle of Tarcal in September 1527 and again in the Battle of Szina in March 1528. Zápolya fled the country and applied to Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent for support, making Hungary an Ottoman vassal state.

This led to the most dangerous moment of Ferdinand&#x27;s career, in 1529, when Suleiman took advantage of this Hungarian support for a massive but ultimately unsuccessful assault on Ferdinand&#x27;s capital: the Siege of Vienna, which sent Ferdinand to refuge in Bohemia. A further Ottoman invasion was repelled in 1532 (see Siege of Güns). In that year Ferdinand made peace with the Ottomans, splitting Hungary into a Habsburg sector in the west (Royal Hungary), and John Zápolya&#x27;s domain in the east (Eastern Hungarian Kingdom), the latter effectively a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire.

Together with the formation of the Schmalkaldic League in 1531, this struggle with the Ottomans caused Ferdinand to grant the Nuremberg Religious Peace. As long as he hoped for a favorable response from his humiliating overtures to Suleiman, Ferdinand was not inclined to grant the peace which the Protestants demanded at the Diet of Regensburg which met in April 1532. But as the army of Suleiman drew nearer he yielded and on 23 July 1532 the peace was concluded at Nuremberg where the final deliberations took place. Those who had up to this time joined the Reformation obtained religious liberty until the meeting of a council and in a separate compact all proceedings in matters of religion pending before the imperial chamber court were temporarily paused.

In 1538, in the Treaty of Nagyvárad, Ferdinand induced the childless Zápolya to name him as his successor. But in 1540, just before his death, Zápolya had a son, John II Sigismund, who was promptly elected king by the Diet. Ferdinand invaded Hungary, but the regent, Frater George Martinuzzi, Bishop of Várad, called on the Ottomans for protection. Suleiman marched into Hungary (see Siege of Buda (1541)) and not only drove Ferdinand out of central Hungary, he forced Ferdinand to agree to pay tribute for his lands in western Hungary.

John II Sigismund was also supported by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I of , his mother&#x27;s father, but in 1543 Sigismund made a treaty with the Habsburgs and Poland became neutral. Prince Sigismund Augustus married Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, Ferdinand&#x27;s daughter.

Suleiman had allocated Transylvania and eastern Royal Hungary to John II Sigismund, which became the &quot;Eastern Hungarian Kingdom&quot;, reigned over by his mother, Isabella Jagiellon, with Martinuzzi as the real power. But Isabella&#x27;s hostile intrigues and threats from the Ottomans led Martinuzzi to switch round. In 1549, he agreed to support Ferdinand&#x27;s claim, and Imperial armies marched into Transylvania. In the Treaty of Weissenburg (1551), Isabella agreed on behalf of John II Sigismund to abdicate as king of Hungary and to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary and regalia. Thus Royal Hungary and Transylvania went to Ferdinand, who agreed to recognise John II Sigismund as vassal Prince of Transylvania and betrothed one of his daughters to him. Meanwhile, Martinuzzi attempted to keep the Ottomans happy even after they responded by sending troops. Ferdinand&#x27;s general Castaldo suspected Martinuzzi of treason and with Ferdinand&#x27;s approval had him killed.

Since Martinuzzi was by this time an archbishop and Cardinal, this was a shocking act, and Pope Julius III excommunicated Castaldo and Ferdinand. Ferdinand sent the Pope a long accusation of treason against Martinuzzi in 87 articles, supported by 116 witnesses. The Pope exonerated Ferdinand and lifted the excommunications in 1555.

The war in Hungary continued. Ferdinand was unable to keep the Ottomans out of Hungary. In 1554, Ferdinand sent Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq to Constantinople to discuss a border treaty with Suleiman, but he could achieve nothing. In 1556 the Diet returned John II Sigismund to the eastern Hungarian throne, where he remained until 1570. De Busbecq returned to Constantinople in 1556, and succeeded on his second try.

The Austrian branch of Habsburg monarchs needed the economic power of Hungary for the Ottoman wars. During the Ottoman wars the territory of the former Kingdom of Hungary shrank by around seventy percent. Despite these enormous territorial and demographic losses, the smaller, heavily war-torn Royal Hungary had remained economically more important to the Habsburg rulers than Austria or Kingdom of Bohemia even at the end of the 16th century. Out of all his countries, the depleted Kingdom of Hungary was, at that time, Ferdinand&#x27;s largest source of revenue.

==Consolidation of power in Bohemia==

When he took control of the Bohemian lands in the 1520s, their religious situation was complex. Its German population was composed of Catholics and Lutherans. Some Czechs were receptive to Lutheranism, but most of them adhered to Utraquist Hussitism, while a minority of them adhered to Roman Catholicism. A significant number of Utraquists favoured an alliance with the Protestants. At first, Ferdinand accepted this situation and he gave considerable freedom to the Bohemian estates. In the 1540s, the situation changed. In Germany, while most Protestant princes had hitherto favored negotiation with the emperor and while many had supported him in his wars, they became increasingly confrontational during this decade. Some of them even went to war against the emperor, and many Bohemian (German or Czech) Protestants or Utraquists sympathized with them.

Ferdinand and his son Maximilian participated in the victorious campaign of Charles V against the German Protestants in 1547. The same year, he also defeated a Protestant revolt in Bohemia, where the estates and a large part of the nobility had denied him support in the German campaign. This allowed him to increase his power in this realm. He centralized his administration, revoked many urban privileges and confiscated properties. Ferdinand also sought to strengthen the position of the Catholic Church in the Bohemian lands, and favoured the installation of the Jesuits there.

==Ferdinand and the Augsburg Peace of 1555==
In the 1550s, Ferdinand managed to win some key victories on the imperial scene. Unlike his brother, he opposed Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and participated in his defeat. This defeat, along with his German ways, made Ferdinand more popular than the emperor among Protestant princes. This allowed him to play a critical role in the settlement of the religious issue in the empire.

After decades of religious and political unrest in the German states, Charles V ordered a general Diet in Augsburg at which the various states would discuss the religious problem and its solution. Charles himself did not attend, and delegated authority to his brother, Ferdinand, to &quot;act and settle&quot; disputes of territory, religion and local power. At the conference, which opened on 5 February, Ferdinand cajoled, persuaded and threatened the various representatives into agreement on three important principles promulgated on 25 September:

# The principle of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Whose realm, his religion&quot;) provided for internal religious unity within a state: the religion of the prince became the religion of the state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince&#x27;s religion were allowed to leave, an innovative idea in the sixteenth century. This principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle.
# The second principle, called the &quot; (ecclesiastical reservation), covered the special status of the ecclesiastical state. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the men and women living in that state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not spelled out in the agreement.
# The third principle, known as &quot; (Ferdinand&#x27;s Declaration), exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practised there since the mid-1520s, allowing for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.

===Problems with the Augsburg settlement===
After 1555, the Peace of Augsburg became the legitimating legal document governing the co-existence of the Lutheran and Catholic faiths in the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire, and it served to ameliorate many of the tensions between followers of the &quot;Old Faith&quot; (Catholicism) and the followers of Luther, but it had two fundamental flaws. First, Ferdinand had rushed the article on &#x27; through the debate; it had not undergone the scrutiny and discussion that attended the widespread acceptance and support of &#x27;. Consequently, its wording did not cover all, or even most, potential legal scenarios. The &quot;&quot; was not debated in plenary session at all; using his authority to &quot;act and settle,&quot; Ferdinand had added it at the last minute, responding to lobbying by princely families and knights.

While these specific failings came back to haunt the empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure to take into account the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the so-called evangelical and reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.

===Charles V&#x27;s abdication===
In 1556, amid great pomp, and leaning on the shoulder of one of his favourites (the 24-year-old William the Silent), Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The Spanish Empire, which included Spain, the Habsburg Netherlands, Kingdom of Naples, Duchy of Milan and Spain&#x27;s possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. Ferdinand became suo jure monarch in Austria and succeeded Charles as Holy Roman Emperor. This course of events had been guaranteed already on 5 January 1531 when Ferdinand had been elected the King of the Romans and so the legitimate successor of the reigning emperor.

Charles&#x27;s choices were appropriate. Philip was culturally Spanish: he was born in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother&#x27;s affairs in the empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere.

Charles&#x27; abdication had far-reaching consequences in Imperial diplomatic relations with France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories, and even from some of the Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip&#x27;s ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity Charles had not blocked the Reformation, and had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in a Dutch rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip&#x27;s militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant ebb and flow of Spanish men and provisions on the so-called Spanish Road from northern Italy, through the Franche-Comté, to and from Flanders.

==Holy Roman Emperor (1556–1564)==

Charles abdicated as emperor in August 1556 in favor of his brother Ferdinand. Given the settlement of 1521 and the election of 1531, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor and &quot;suo jure&quot; Archduke of Austria. Due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the Imperial succession until 3 May 1558. The Pope refused to recognize Ferdinand as emperor until 1559, when peace was reached between France and the Habsburgs. During his reign, the Council of Trent came to an end. Ferdinand organized an Imperial election in 1562 in order to secure the succession of his son Maximilian II. Venetian ambassadors to Ferdinand recall in their Relazioni the emperor&#x27;s pragmatism and his ability to speak multiple languages. Several issues of the Council of Trent were solved after a compromise was personally reached between Emperor Ferdinand and Morone, the papal legate.

===In the Empire===
An important invention of Ferdinand was the &quot;Hofkriegsrat&quot; (Aulic War Council), officially established in 1556 to coordinate military affairs in all Habsburg lands (inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire). Together with the (established in 1559, merging the Imperial and Austrian Chancelleries, thus also dealing with affairs of both Imperial and Habsburg lands) and the (the Finance Chamber, which received imperial taxes from the &quot;Reichspfennig meister&quot;), it formed the core of the Habsburg government in Vienna. The &quot;Reichshofrat&quot; was revived to deal with affairs concerning imperial prerogatives. In 1556, an ordinance was issued to ensure Imperial and dynastic affairs were managed separately (by two groups of officials from the same institution) though. In his time, the influence of the Estates in these institutions were limited. For each &quot;Länder&quot;group, regiments (or governments) and treasury offices were created.

Unlike Maximilian I and Charles V, Ferdinand I was not a nomadic ruler. In 1533, he moved his residence to Vienna and spent most of his time there. After experiencing the Turkish siege of 1529, Ferdinand worked hard to make Vienna an impregnable fortress. After his 1558 accession, Vienna became the imperial capital.

===Administration of Royal Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia===
Since 1542, Charles V and Ferdinand had been able to collect the Common Penny tax, or &quot;Türkenhilfe&quot; (Turkish aid), designed to protect the empire against the Ottomans or France. But as Hungary, unlike Bohemia, was not part of the empire, the Imperial aid for Hungary depended on political factors. The obligation was only in effect if Vienna or the empire was threatened.

The western part of Hungary over which Ferdinand had dominion became known as Royal Hungary. As the ruler of Austria, Bohemia and Royal Hungary, Ferdinand adopted a policy of centralisation and, in common with other monarchs of the time, the construction of an absolute monarchy. In 1527, soon after ascending the throne, he published a constitution for his hereditary domains (&quot;&quot;) and established Austrian-style institutions in Pressburg for Hungary, in Prague for Bohemia, and in Breslau for Silesia.

Ferdinand was able to introduce more uniform governments for his realms and also strengthen his control over finance in Bohemia, which provided him with half of his revenue. The governments basically remained independent of each other though. An Austrian could make a career in Bohemian administration but usually only after naturalization, except for some royal protégés such as Florian Griespeck, while it was virtually unheard of (in contrast with the future) for a Bohemian to gain advancement in the Austrian government. An elected king himself, he gradually nudged the monarchy towards becoming hereditary, which would finally succeed under Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor.
In 1547 the Bohemian Estates rebelled against Ferdinand after he had ordered the Bohemian army to move against the German Protestants. After suppressing the revolt, he retaliated by limiting the privileges of Bohemian cities and inserting a new bureaucracy of royal officials to control urban authorities.
Ferdinand was a supporter of the Counter-Reformation and helped lead the Catholic response against what he saw as the heretical tide of Protestantism. For example, in 1551 he invited the Jesuits to Vienna and in 1556 to Prague. Finally, in 1561 Ferdinand revived the Archdiocese of Prague, which had been previously liquidated due to the success of the Protestants.

After the Ottoman invasion of Hungary the traditional Hungarian coronation city Székesfehérvár came under Ottoman occupation. Thus, in 1536 the Hungarian Diet decided that a new place for coronation of the king as well as a meeting place for the Diet itself would be set in Pressburg. Ferdinand proposed that the Hungarian and Bohemian diets should convene and hold debates together with the Austrian estates, but all parties refused such an innovation.

In Hungary, the monarchy remained elective until 1627 (with Habsburgs&#x27; female inheritance rights being acknowledged in 1723), although the kings that followed Ferdinand would always be Habsburgs.

A rudimentary union between Austria, Hungary and Bohemia was formed though, on the basis of common legal status. Ferdinand had an interest in keeping Bohemia separate from imperial jurisdiction and making the connection between Bohemia and the empire looser (Bohemia did not have to pay taxes to the empire). As he gained the rights of an Imperial prince-elector as king of Bohemia, he was able to give Bohemia (as well as associated territories such as Upper and Lower Lusatia, Silesia and Moravia) the same privileged status as Austria, therefore affirming his superior position in the empire.

==Death and succession==

In December 1562, Ferdinand had Archduke Maximilian, his eldest son elected King of the Romans. This was followed with succession in Bohemia, and in 1563, the crown of Hungary.

Ferdinand died in Vienna in 1564 and is buried in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. After his death, Maximilian ascended unchallenged.

==Legacy==

Ferdinand&#x27;s legacy ultimately proved enduring. Though lacking resources, he managed to defend his land against the Ottomans with limited support from his brother, and even secured a part of Hungary that would later provide the basis for the conquest of the whole kingdom by the Habsburgs. In his own possessions, he built a tax system that, though imperfect, would continue to be used by his successors. His handling of the Protestant Reformation proved more flexible and more effective than that of his brother and he played a key part in the settlement of 1555, which started an era of peace in Germany. His statesmanship, overall, was cautious and effective. On the other hand, when he engaged in more audacious endeavours, like his offensives against Buda and Pest, it often ended in failure.

Fichtner remarks that Ferdinand was a mediocre military commander (thus the many difficulties in dealing with the Ottomans in Hungary) but an energetic and very imaginative administrator, who produced a framework for his empire that endured into the eighteenth century. The core included a court council, privy council, central treasury and a body for military affairs, with the written business conducted by a common chancery. In his time and in practice, Bohemia and Hungary resisted cooperating with the structure but the German territories widely imitated it.

Ferdinand was also a patron of the arts. He embellished Vienna and Prague. The University of Vienna was reorganized. He also called Jesuits to the capital city, attracted architects and scholars from Italy and the Low Countries to create an intellectual &quot;milieu&quot; surrounding the court. He promoted scholarly interest in Oriental languages. The humanists he invited had a major influence on his son Maximilian. He was particularly fond of music and hunting. While not a gifted commander, he was interested in military matters and participated in several campaigns during his reign.

He was the last King of Germany crowned in Aachen.

==Marriage and children==
On 26 May 1521 in Linz, Austria, Ferdinand married Anna of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547), daughter of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary and his wife Anne of Foix-Candale. They had fifteen children, all but two of whom reached adulthood:

==Coinage==
Ferdinand I has been the main motif for many collector coins and medals. The most recent one is the Austrian silver 20-euro Renaissance coin issued on 12 June 2002. A portrait of Ferdinand I is shown on the reverse of the coin, while on the obverse a view of the Swiss Gate of the Hofburg Palace can be seen.

<doc id="151075" wikidata="Q646230" url="?curid=151075" title="Monteagle, Tennessee">
<text>Monteagle is a town in Franklin, Grundy, and Marion counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee, in the Cumberland Plateau region of the southeastern part of the state. The population was 1,238 at the 2000 census – 804 of the town&#x27;s 1,238 residents (64.9%) lived in Grundy County, 428 (34.6%) in Marion County, and 6 (0.5%) in Franklin County. The population at the 2020 census was 1,393.

The Marion County portion of Monteagle is part of the Chattanooga–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Franklin County portion is part of the Tullahoma, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Monteagle is famous for the treacherous stretch of Interstate 24 that passes through the town. It is here that the highway passes over what is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Monteagle&quot; or &quot;Monteagle Mountain&quot;, a section of the southern Cumberland Plateau which is a major landmark on the road between Chattanooga and Nashville. The interstate regularly shuts down in inclement weather, routing traffic onto U.S. Route 41. In the Jerry Reed song &quot;The Legend&quot;, which is the opening track in the film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, Reed tells the story of the Bandit miraculously surviving brake failure on the &quot;Monteagle Grade&quot;. There is also a song called &quot;Monteagle Mountain&quot; by Johnny Cash on the album &quot;Boom Chicka Boom&quot;.

The town is home to DuBose Conference Center and the Monteagle Sunday School Assembly. The Highlander Folk School, long involved in the labor movement and the civil rights movement, was located here from 1932 to 1961. Rosa Parks attended workshops there shortly before the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

==History==

Monteagle has long served as a popular point to cross the Cumberland Plateau due to its location along a relatively narrow stretch of the plateau in southern Tennessee. One of the last groups of Cherokees removed from the Southeastern United States along the Trail of Tears passed through what is now Monteagle en route to Oklahoma in late October 1838. This group consisted of approximately 700 Cherokee led by John Bell and escorted by U.S. Army Lieutenant Edward Deas.

The town of Monteagle was originally known as &quot;Moffat Station&quot; after John Moffat, a Scottish-Canadian temperance activist who purchased over of land in the area in 1870. In 1872, Moffat donated of land to Fairmount College, a women&#x27;s college that had decided to relocate to the area from Jackson, Mississippi. The grounds of the school are now home to the DuBose Conference Center, named for one of the school&#x27;s early pastors. In 1882, the Chautauqua-inspired Monteagle Sunday School Assembly was established to train Sunday school teachers.

The name of Moffat Station was later changed to &quot;Mount Eagle&quot;, and afterwards to &quot;Mounteagle&quot;. The spelling had been changed to &quot;Monteagle&quot; by the time the town incorporated in 1962.

==Geography==
Monteagle is located in the southwest corner of Grundy County and the northwest corner of Marion County at (35.239941, -85.834372). The Marion-Grundy county line runs east-to-west through the center of town. The town limits extend west into Franklin County as well.

The town straddles a narrow stretch of the Cumberland Plateau known colloquially as &quot;Monteagle Mountain&quot;. This stretch of the plateau is approximately wide, with steep drop-offs to the northwest and southeast. Monteagle lies at an elevation of just under above sea level. By comparison, two nearby cities, Cowan (to the northwest) and South Pittsburg (to the southeast), lie at elevations of less than above sea level.

Interstate 24 passes through the town just south and west of the town center, with access from Exits 134 and 135. I-24 leads northwest to Nashville and southeast to Chattanooga. U.S. Route 41 is Main Street through the town, leading east to Tracy City and northwest to Manchester. U.S. Route 41A branches off from US 41 in Monteagle and leads southwest to Sewanee. Winchester is to the west via US 41A.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.48%, is water. The north side of town drains off the plateau into Layne Cove and is part of the Elk River watershed, while the south side drains into Ladd Cove and Cave Cove, part of the Battle Creek watershed. Both watersheds flow to the Tennessee River.

===Climate===
Monteagle&#x27;s climate is subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) under Köppen, typical of Tennessee. However, it&#x27;s temperate (&quot;Do&quot;) under Trewartha due to only having 7 months over . Additionally, its high precipitation means that it&#x27;s a rainforest climate more typical of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains (see Appalachian temperate rainforest).

<doc id="151076" wikidata="Q296863" url="?curid=151076" title="Ferdinand I of León">
<text>Ferdinand I ( 1015 – 24 December 1065), called the Great (&quot;el Magno&quot;), was the count of Castile from his uncle&#x27;s death in 1029 and the king of León after defeating his brother-in-law in 1037. According to tradition, he was the first to have himself crowned Emperor of Spain (1056), and his heirs carried on the tradition. He was a younger son of Sancho III of Navarre and Muniadona of Castile, and by his father&#x27;s will recognised the supremacy of his eldest brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre. While Ferdinand inaugurated the rule of the Navarrese Jiménez dynasty over western Spain, his rise to preeminence among the Christian rulers of the peninsula shifted the focus of power and culture westward after more than a century of Leonese decline. Nevertheless, &quot;[t]he internal consolidation of the realm of León–Castilla under Fernando el Magno and [his queen] Sancha (1037–1065) is a history that remains to be researched and written.&quot;

==Date and order of birth==
There is some disagreement concerning the order of birth of Sancho III&#x27;s sons, and of Ferdinand&#x27;s place among them. He was certainly a younger son, and he was probably born later than 1011, by which date his parents are known to have married. Most, and the most reliable, charters name Sancho&#x27;s sons in the order Ramiro, García, Gonzalo, then Ferdinand. Three documents from the Cathedral of Pamplona list them in this way, as well as four from the monastery of San Juan de la Peña. One charter from Pamplona, dated 29 September 1023, is witnessed by Sancho&#x27;s mother, Jimena Fernández, his wife Muniadona, her children, listed García, Ferdinand then Gonzalo, and their brother, the illegitimate Ramiro.

In five documents of the monastery of San Salvador de Leire, Ferdinand is listed after Gonzalo. Two of these are dated to 17 April 1014. If authentic, they place Ferdinand&#x27;s birth before that date. Three further documents from Leire are among the only ones to place Ferdinand second among the legitimate sons, but they suffer from various anachronisms and interpolations. Two preserved diplomas of Santa María la Real de Irache also put Gonzalo ahead of him. On the basis of these documents, Gonzalo Martínez Díez places Ferdinand third of the known legitimate sons of Sancho III (Ramiro being a bastard born before Sancho&#x27;s marriage to Muniadona), and his birth no earlier than 1015. The &quot;Crónica de Alaón renovada&quot;, which Martínez Díez dates to 1154, but which other scholars dismiss as a late medieval concoction, lists García, Ferdinand and Gonzalo as Sancho III&#x27;s sons by Muniadona in that order, but in the same passage mistakenly places Gonzalo&#x27;s death before his father&#x27;s.

==Count of Castile (1029–37)==
Ferdinand was barely in his teens when García Sánchez, Count of Castile, was assassinated by a party of exiled Castilian noblemen as he was entering the church of John the Baptist in León, where he had gone to marry Sancha, sister of Bermudo III, King of León. In his role as feudal overlord, Sancho III of Navarre nominated his younger son Ferdinand, born to the deceased count&#x27;s sister Muniadona, as count of Castile. Although Sancho was recognised as the ruler of Castile until his death, Ferdinand was granted the title &quot;count&quot; (&quot;comes&quot;) and was prepared to succeed in Castile. On 7 July 1029, before a council in Burgos, the capital of Castile, Óneca, aunt of the late García and queen Muniadona, formally adopted Sancho and Muniadona, making them her heirs. The record of the council is the first recorded instance of Ferdinand bearing the title of count. A later charter from the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña, dated 1 January 1030, explicitly lists Sancho as king in León (the overlord of Castile) and Ferdinand as count in Castile. The first indication that Ferdinand was independently reigning over Castile, or was at least recognised as count in his own right, is a charter of 1 November 1032 from the monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza, which does not mention his father, but dates it to the time of &quot;Fernando Sánchez bearing the county&quot;. Sancho&#x27;s decision to name his son as count in Castile preserved its high degree of autonomy, although no Castilian document after 1028 is dated by the reign of Bermudo III nor is he ever named as king of León. The only sovereign whose regnal year was used was Sancho III, making Ferdinand the first count of Castile not to recognise the suzerainty of the king of León.

Sancho III arranged for Ferdinand to marry García of Castile&#x27;s intended bride, Sancha of León, in 1032. The lands between the Cea and Pisuerga rivers went to Castile as her dowry. After his father&#x27;s death on 18 October 1035, Ferdinand continued to rule in Castile, but he was not, as many later authors have it, king of Castile. Contemporary documents stress his status as count and his relationship of vassalage to the king of León. A document issued by his brother Ramiro on 22 August 1036 at San Juan de la Peña was drawn while &quot;emperor Bermudo [was] reigning in León and count Ferdinand in Castile, king García in Pamplona, king Ramiro in Aragon, and king Gonzalo in Ribagorza.&quot; Two private Castilian documents dated 1 January 1037 both express Ferdinand&#x27;s continuing vassalage to the Leonese monarch explicitly, dating themselves by the reign of &quot;king Bermudo and Ferdinand, count in his realms&quot;.

In a dispute over the territory between the Cea and Pisuerga, Ferdinand, nominally a vassal of Bermudo III, defeated and killed his suzerain at the Battle of Tamarón on 4 September 1037. Ferdinand took possession of León by right of his wife, and on 22 June 1038 had himself crowned and anointed king in León.

==King of León (1037–65)==

===Relations with Navarre===

On 15 September 1054, Ferdinand defeated his elder brother García at the Battle of Atapuerca and reduced Navarre to a vassal state under his late brother&#x27;s young son, Sancho García IV. Although Navarre at that time included the traditionally Castilian lands of Álava and La Rioja, Ferdinand demanded the cession only of Bureba. Over the next decade, he gradually extended his control over more of the western territory of Navarre at the expense of Sancho IV, although this was accomplished peacefully and is only detectable in the documentary record.

===Relations with al-Andalus===

====War with Zaragoza====
In 1060, according to the &quot;Historia silense&quot;, Ferdinand invaded the &quot;taifa&quot; of Zaragoza through the upland valley of the eastern Duero in the highlands around Soria. He captured the fortresses of San Esteban de Gormaz, Berlanga and Vadorrey, and afterwards proceeded through Santiuste, Huermeces and Santamara as far as the Roman road that lay between Toledo and Zaragoza. The success of the campaign was made possible by the preoccupation of the Zaragozan emir, Ahmad al-Muqtadir, with attacking the neighboring &quot;taifa&quot; of Tortosa and defending his northeastern frontier from Ramiro I of Aragon and Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona. The emir, up until then paying tribute to Sancho IV of Navarre, submitted to Ferdinand and agreed to pay &quot;parias&quot;. Although probably originally meant to be temporary, Ferdinand managed to enforce the tribute until his death.

====War with Toledo====
With al-Muqtadir sidelined as a threat, Ferdinand turned his attention to Yahya ibn Ismail al-Mamun, emir of Toledo. It is probable that Ferdinand already maintained close relations with the Toledan court, and was perhaps protector of the Mozarabic Christian community in Toledo. In 1058, the last known Mozarabic bishop of Toledo, Pascual, was consecrated in León. In 1062, Ferdinand invaded the east of al-Mamun&#x27;s &quot;taifa&quot;, taking Talamanca and besieging Alcalá de Henares. After seeing his country plundered, al-Mamun agreed to pay &quot;parias&quot; and Ferdinand left.

====Great raid on Badajoz and Seville====
In 1063, using the new income from his &quot;parias&quot;, Ferdinand organised a &quot;great raid, or &quot;razzia&quot;&quot; into the &quot;taifas&quot; of Seville and Badajoz. Seville, and probably Badajoz also, paid a ransom for his withdrawal. This attack was probably also designed to remove Badajoz as a threat during his siege of Coimbra the next year.

====Reconquests in Portugal====
Although the sources are unclear, it is possible that as early as 1055 Ferdinand attacked the &quot;taifa&quot; of Badajoz. His first serious campaign of &quot;Reconquista&quot; was an invasion of the lower basin of the Duero between the coast, which had long been held by León, and the mountains. On 29 November 1057 his army conquered Lamego and its valleys. Having secured the Duero, Ferdinand began to bring the valley of the Mondego under his control, first taking Viseu in its middle stretch on 25 July 1058 and then moving down towards the sea. It was &quot;a long and grueling battle&quot; before Coimbra, at the mouth of the Mondego, was taken on 25 July 1064 after a six-month siege.

====War with Valencia====
In 1065, Ferdinand embarked on his last military campaign. He invaded the &quot;taifa&quot; of Valencia and laid siege to the city itself but did not have the forces to take the city. During the retreat from the city he ambushed and defeated the pursuing forces of the emir Abd al-Malik ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Muẓaffar late in the autumn at the Battle of Paterna. The emir&#x27;s father-in-law, al-Mamun of Toledo, seized control of Valencia, and the frightened emir of Zaragoza renewed his tribute payments to León. Ferdinand fell ill in November and returned to his kingdom.

==Emperor of Spain==
Ferdinand was first titled &quot;emperor&quot; not by himself or his own scribes, but by the notaries of his half-brother, the petty king Ramiro I of Aragon, whose notaries were also calling Ferdinand&#x27;s predecessor as king of León by the same title. In a royal Aragonese charter of 1036, before the Battle of Tamarón, Ramiro refers to his brother as &quot;emperor in Castile and in León and in Astorga&quot;. A similarly worded charter was issued in 1041 and again in 1061, where the order of kingdoms is reversed and Astorga ignored: &quot;emperor in León and in Castile&quot;. The first use of the imperial style in a charter of his own, preserved in the cartulary of Arlanza, dates to the year 1056: &quot;under the rule of the emperor King Ferdinand and the empress Queen Sancha ruling the kingdom in León and in Galicia as well as in Castile&quot;. On this basis, Ferdinand is sometimes said to have had himself crowned emperor in 1056.

The imperial title was only used on one other occasion during his reign. A document of 1058 dates itself &quot;in the time of the most serene prince Lord Ferdinand and his consort Queen Sancha&quot; and later qualifies him as &quot;this emperor, the aforesaid Ferdinand&quot;.

==Death and succession==

After becoming ill during the Siege of Valencia and the Battle of Paterna, Ferdinand died on 24 December 1065, in León, with many manifestations of ardent piety, having laid aside his crown and royal mantle, dressed in the robe of a monk and lying on a bier covered with ashes, which was placed before the altar of the Basilica of San Isidoro. By his will, Ferdinand divided his kingdom among his three sons: the eldest, Sancho, received Castile; the second, Alfonso, León; and from the latter the region of Galicia was carved off to create a separate state for García. Ferdinand&#x27;s two daughters each received cities: Elvira that of Toro and Urraca that of Zamora. In giving them these territories, he expressed his desire that they respect his wishes and abide by the split. However, soon after Fernando&#x27;s death, Sancho and Alfonso turned on García and defeated him. They then fought each other, the victorious Sancho reuniting their father&#x27;s possessions under his control in 1072. However, Sancho was killed that same year and the territories passed to Alfonso.

==Posthumous reputation==

The &quot;Chronicon complutense&quot;, probably written shortly after Ferdinand&#x27;s death, extols him as the &quot;exceedingly strong emperor&quot; (&quot;imperator fortissimus&quot;) when mentioning the siege of Coimbra. After his death, Ferdinand&#x27;s children took to calling him &quot;emperor&quot; and &quot;the great&quot; (&quot;magnus&quot;). In 1072, Alfonso, Fedinand&#x27;s second son, referred to himself as &quot;offspring of the Emperor Ferdinand&quot;. Two years later (1074), Urraca and Elvira referred to themselves as &quot;daughters of the Emperor Ferdinand the Great [or, the great emperor Ferdinand]&quot;. In a later charter of 1087, Ferdinand is referred to first as &quot;king&quot;, then as &quot;great emperor&quot;, and finally just as &quot;emperor&quot; alongside his consort, who is first called &quot;queen&quot; then &quot;empress&quot;.

In the fourteenth century a legend appeared in various chronicles according to which the pope, the Holy Roman emperor, and the king of France demanded a tribute from Ferdinand. In certain versions the pope is named Urban (although it could not have been either Urban I or Urban II) and in other versions Victor (which is plausibly identifiable with Victor II). Ferdinand was prepared to pay, but one of his vassals, later known as El Cid, who in reality was a youth during Ferdinand&#x27;s reign, declared a war on the pope, the emperor and the Frank, and the latter rescinded their demand. For this reason &quot;Don Fernando was afterwards called ‘the Great’: the peer of an emperor&quot;. In the sixteenth century this account re-appeared, extended and elaborated, by Juan de Mariana, who wrote that in 1055, at a synod in Florence, the Emperor Henry III urged Victor II to prohibit under severe penalties the use of the imperial title by Ferdinand of León.

This story is generally regarded as apocryphal, although some modern authors have accepted it uncritically or seen a kernel of historical truth in it. Spanish historian A. Ballesteros argued that Ferdinand adopted the title in opposition to Henry III&#x27;s imperial pretensions. German historian E. E. Stengel believed the version found in Mariana on the grounds that the latter probably used the now lost acts of the Council of Florence. Juan Beneyto Pérez was willing to accept it as based on tradition and Ernst Steindorff, the nineteenth-century student of the reign of Henry III, as being authentically transmitted via the &quot;romancero&quot;. Menéndez Pidal accepted the account of Mariana, but placed it in the year 1065.

<doc id="151080" wikidata="Q152157" url="?curid=151080" title="Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Matthias (24 February 1557 – 20 March 1619) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1612 to 1619, Archduke of Austria from 1608 to 1619, King of Hungary and Croatia from 1608 to 1618 and King of Bohemia from 1611 to 1617. His personal motto was &quot;Concordia lumine maior&quot; (&quot;Unity is stronger in the light&quot;).

Matthias played a significant role in the familial opposition of the Habsburgs against his brother Emperor Rudolf II. After gaining power, he showed little political initiative of his own. The course of his politics was determined by Cardinal Melchior Klesl until his fall in 1618. As a consequence of his failed religious and administrative policies, the Bohemian Revolt, the initial theatre of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, began during the final year of Matthias&#x27; reign.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Matthias was born in the Austrian capital of Vienna as the fourth son of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and of Maria of Spain. His brothers were Rudolf (who became Emperor Rudolf II), Ernest, Maximilian (from 1585 Grand Master of the Teutonic Order), Albert (archbishop of Toledo, later governor of the Netherlands), and Wenceslaus (Grand Prior of the Order of Malta in Castile). He also had six sisters. His sister Anna was married to King Philip II of Spain and his sister Elisabeth to King Charles IX of France. Almost nothing is known about his upbringing. One of his teachers was the writer and historian Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq. Upon Maximilian II&#x27;s death, the family&#x27;s estates and property were all inherited by Rudolf, the eldest son. The other sons, including Matthias, were compensated with cash pensions and appointments to church or state positions. Matthias married Archduchess Anna of Austria, daughter of his uncle Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria and became his heir in Further Austria in 1595. The marriage did not produce surviving children.

===Governor in Netherlands===
In 1578, Matthias was invited to the Seventeen Provinces by the States-General of the rebellious provinces, which offered him the position of Governor-General. Matthias had come into contact with Gautier van der Gracht, the envoy of the Dutch provinces, at the Regensburg Reichstag in 1576. Philippe III de Croÿ, Duke of Aarschot, and other representatives of a rather moderate party agreed with Matthias to make him the governor of the Netherlands against the will of his uncle, Philip II of Spain, the hereditary ruler of the provinces and without the knowledge of Emperor Rudolf II. Matthias accepted the appointment, but the position was not recognised by Philip II. He set down the rules for religious peace within most of the United Provinces. His work is noted in Article 13 of the 1579 Union of Utrecht, which established freedom of religion as a locally determined issue. Matthias continued as titular governor for the rebels until their deposing of Philip II and declaration of full independence in 1581, when he returned home to Austria.

===Governor of Austria===
He returned to Austria in 1583, where he settled in Linz with a small household. He made several unsuccessful attempts to get elected as bishop of (Münster, Liège, Speyer). In 1586, negotiations for the succession of Polish King Stephen Báthory were equally unsuccessful. He also applied for the regency in Tyrol and Further Austria. It was only after his brother Ernest was appointed General Governor in the Netherlands in 1593, where he ruled from 1594, that Matthias secured governance over Austria.

He was immediately confronted with the vigorous advocacy of their religious rights among the Protestant estates. The problems were exacerbated by the high taxes and the troops who were raised as a result of the Long Turkish War. In 1595 and 1597 the farmers in Lower and Upper Austria revolted in the hope of negotiating with the emperor. Matthias forced the insurgents into submission with mercenary troops.

After the uprising had been quelled, Matthias&#x27;s policies on religion changed. If there had been Protestants at his court, he now went on a strict Counter-Reformation course. His chancellor had been Melchior Khlesl, bishop and administrator of Wiener Neustadt from 1599 and a supporter of the Counter-Reformation. Matthias appointed him in 1594 to 1595 and again in 1598 to 1600 as nominal commander in chief in the Turkish War and as his representative to the Hungarian Diet.

===Power struggle among Habsburg brothers===

With great concern, the Habsburgs observed the increasing psychological decline of the ageing emperor. After Ernest&#x27;s death in 1595, Matthias became the oldest archduke. From 1599 onward, Matthias in vain urged the childless emperor to arrange his succession, as Matthias was rejected. The crisis carried on in 1604 during the uprising of Stephen Bocskai in Hungary. Matthias initially avoided an argument with the emperor, but Bishop Klesl urged him to take command in the Brothers&#x27; Quarrel with Rudolf. In November 1600 at Schottwien, Archdukes Matthias, Maximilian and Ferdinand signed an agreement of concerted opposition against the emperor. In 1606, they declared Rudolf insane (document dated 25 April), appointed Matthias as the head of the family and began to oust Rudolf. It was Matthias, not the emperor, who had brokered the Peace of Zsitvatorok with the Ottomans and in 1606 had ended the conflict in Hungary by granting freedom of religion in Hungary and guaranteed the right of Transylvania to elect its own independent princes in the future.

As unrest resurfaced in Hungary and spread into parts of Moravia and Austria, Matthias attempted to use the opposition in the power struggle against the emperor. He joined the rebellious Diet of Hungary and the Lower and Upper Austrian estates in Pressburg in 1608 and in Moravia shortly later. In April 1608, Matthias marched on Prague and besieged the city. Although he could not fully win over the Bohemian estates, he forced Rudolf to negotiate and to sign a peace treaty in June 1608, which unsurprisingly resulted in the redistribution of power. Rudolf kept Bohemia, Silesia and Lusatia, and Matthias received Hungary, Austria and Moravia.

However, the takeover of power did not proceed according to customary protocol. Matthias, as the new sovereign, had not guaranteed the privileges of the estates before they officially paid homage to him. He tried to reverse the order, which led to the so-called &quot;Homage Dispute&quot;. As most of the estates were Protestant in Austria and Moravia, their nobles then formed the powerful Horner Confederation (Horner Bund) and paid homage only after a guarantee of their religious rights. The Horner Confederation continued to exist until the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

===Sovereign rule===

Matthias was crowned King of Bohemia on 23 May 1611 and was, after Rudolf&#x27;s death on 20 January 1612, elected Holy Roman Emperor. On 4 December 1611, he married his cousin Archduchess Anna of Austria, but the union failed to produce children. Matthias allegedly fathered an illegitimate son, Matthias of Austria, by an unknown mother.

The court and the administration were gradually moved from Prague to Vienna after 1612. The new emperor was less interested in art than Rudolf II had been, and most court artists soon turned their backs on his court. Matthias maintained, however, a close relationship with the painter Lucas van Valckenborch. For the private crown of his brother Rudolf II, he had a sceptre and an orb made. The emperor&#x27;s wife founded the Capuchin Church and the Imperial Crypt in Vienna as the future burial site of the Habsburg family. Matthias had allegedly found a spring in the area of today&#x27;s Schönbrunn Palace. It is said that it became the eponymous name of the area and the palace from his remark: &quot;Look, what a beautiful spring&quot; (beautiful: &quot;schön&quot;, spring: &quot;Brunn[en]&quot;).

After Matthias&#x27;s imperial accession, his kingship was dominated by Klesl, who hoped to bring about a compromise between Catholic and Protestant states within the Holy Roman Empire to strengthen the empire. Matthias had already been forced to grant religious concessions to Protestants in Austria and Moravia, as well as in Hungary, when he had allied with them against Rudolf. Matthias imprisoned Georg Keglević, the Commander-in-chief, General, Vice-Ban of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia and since 1602 baron in Transylvania, but soon freed again. The Principality of Transylvania was a fully-autonomous area of Hungary but under the nominal suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, where it was the time of the Sultanate of Women.

Matthias&#x27;s conciliatory policies were opposed by the more intransigent Catholic Habsburgs, particularly Matthias&#x27;s brother Archduke Maximilian, who hoped to secure the succession for the inflexible Catholic Archduke Ferdinand, who later became Emperor Ferdinand II. The Protestant Bohemians were concerned about their religious freedom and so fiercely opposed all Catholic officials who were appointed by Matthias, particularly Archduke Ferdinand, who was elected King of Bohemia in June 1617. The dispute came to a head in the Bohemian Protestant revolt, which provoked Matthias to imprison Klesl and to revise his policies. However, he was old and ailing and was unable to prevent Maximilian&#x27;s faction from taking over. He died of natural causes at 62 on 20 March 1619. Ferdinand, who had already been crowned King of Bohemia (1617) and of Hungary (1618), succeeded Matthias as Holy Roman Emperor.

==Burial==
As the Imperial Crypt at Vienna had not yet been completed, Anna († in 1618) and Matthias († in 1619) were temporarily buried in St. Maria&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Monastery. Not until 1633 would they be transferred to the Imperial Crypt at the Capuchin Church. Emperor Matthias is one of the 41 people who received a &quot;separate burial&quot;, as their bodies are distributed among all three traditional Viennese burial sites of the Habsburgs (Imperial Crypt, Herzgruft, Ducal Crypt).

<text>Fall Branch is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington and Greene counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The population was 1,291 at the 2010 census. Some areas in Sullivan also use the Fall Branch ZIP code.

Fall Branch is part of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==
One of the earliest settlers at Fall Branch was Isaac White, a Revolutionary War veteran who arrived in the area in 1781. He eventually established a farm at what is now the intersection of Interstate 81 and State Highway 93. Another early settler, Gabriel Morgan, built a grist mill at Fall Branch in the early 1800s. The mill stood until the 1930s, when it was torn down.

By the early 1800s, Fall Branch was known as &quot;Crouch Town&quot;, after a family of early settlers. The name had changed to &quot;James&#x27; Cross Roads&quot; by 1830, when a post office was established. The name &quot;Falls Branch&quot; had been adopted by 1854, and the &quot;s&quot; was dropped from &quot;Falls&quot; in 1883, giving the community its current name. The name was inspired by the waterfall the community&#x27;s main creek, also called Fall Branch, spills over just before it empties into Horse Creek.

In 1836, Fall Branch was designated as the county seat of the proposed &quot;Powell County&quot;, which would have consisted of parts of Washington, Greene, Sullivan, and Hawkins counties. While voters approved of the new county, it was rejected by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the grounds that it failed to meet the minimum size required by the state constitution for new counties.

A school, Fall Branch Seminary, was established at Fall Branch in 1842. Fall Branch High School, initially a two-year school, was established before 1900. The high school was consolidated with several other smaller schools to form Daniel Boone High School in nearby Gray in 1971.

A number of buildings dating to the 19th century still stand in Fall Branch. The Masonic Lodge, home to Johnson Lodge No. 274, was completed in 1869. The Joseph Sheppard House, constructed in the late 1850s, was believed to have been used to hide Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. The Bud White Home was constructed by a local physician, Jonathan Blair White, in 1869. The Hopper House, used as a boarding home for early Fall Branch Seminary students, was constructed in the first half of the 19th century.

<text>Morristown is a city in and the county seat of Hamblen County, Tennessee, United States. Morristown also extends into Jefferson County on the western and southern ends. The city lies within the Ridge and Valley region of the Appalachians, along Cherokee Lake on the Holston River. The city&#x27;s population was recorded to be 30,431 at the 2020 United States census. It is the principal city of the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses Hamblen and Jefferson counties. (Grainger County was included in the metropolitan area until 2023). The Morristown metropolitan area is also part of the Knoxville-Morristown-Sevierville Combined Statistical Area.

Established in 1855, Morristown developed into a thriving community due to its strategic location at the intersection of two major stagecoach routes. It would experience turmoil from battles in its immediate area and its change of control under Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War. Following the war, Morristown furthered its industrial growth with companies expanding rail access, making it a prominent logistics hub into the 20th century. Since the mid-20th century, the city has established itself as the regional economic hub and metropolis of the Lakeway Area region following efforts to expand the industrial sector of the city&#x27;s economy into a market with over 100 companies, providing a workforce of an estimated 30,000 people.

==History==
===Early years and establishment===
Before its settlement by European-Americans, the area of Morristown was inhabited by Native Americans, predominately members of the Cherokee tribe. During the Cherokee&#x27;s inhabitance, the area was based around two major pathways, an east-west route that was later developed into the Great Stage Road in the settlement era, and a north-south route known as Buffalo Trail, named for a legend stating the path was formed from herds of buffalo traveling from Asheville, North Carolina to the Powell River near the Cumberland Gap for the river&#x27;s salt licks.

The settlement of Morristown was established by trans-Appalachian pioneer Gideon Morris, a farmer who arrived with his brothers Daniel and Absalom from the Watauga Settlement, a semi-autonomous government based on land that was leased to European-American settlers from the inhabiting Cherokee tribes. Prior to his settlement, Morris had fought alongside John Sevier in the Cherokee Expedition in 1776, and obtained land grants after serving in the American Revolutionary War at the Battle of Kings Mountain.

Morris, along with his siblings, petitioned to have the Watauga Settlement annexed in the State of North Carolina. With the petition&#x27;s success, the settlement was named Morristown, and land grants containing present-day Hamblen and Jefferson counties were assigned to Morris and his brothers in 1787 by North Carolina state officials. The Morris household built their first home off of present-day South Cumberland Street in Morristown, which remained occupied by descendants of the Morris family for several generations.

From 1792 to 1793, the community&#x27;s main street was added onto a major stagecoach route connecting it to Knoxville and Abingdon, Virginia, aiding further early settlement efforts. Among these settlers was frontiersman John Crockett, who arrived and settled east of the Morris residence in 1794 with his son, famed pioneer and folk-hero Davy Crockett who was seven years old at the time. John Crockett constructed a log cabin that later served as a tavern, and a hospital treating smallpox during the American Civil War. After the Civil War, the Crockett Tavern was destroyed to prevent further infections of smallpox. The current-day Crockett Tavern Museum sits at the approximate location of the former tavern and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. John&#x27;s son, Davy resided in Morristown until 1809, when he relocated to Middle Tennessee to go into Tennessee state politics. 

By 1833, Morristown developed into a small village, consisting of a post office, a general store, a blacksmith and machine shop which was the first major enterprise in the town, and several log cabin residences along the main stagecoach route known as the Great Stage Road that divided the community into two counties, Grainger to the north, and Jefferson to the south. Morristown Academy, the community&#x27;s first documented school, opened to students in 1830. In 1855, Morristown was incorporated into a city to provide new services to the community&#x27;s growing population. Railroad access became available to Morristown when construction completed on the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad in 1858, which was the first railroad line to be operational in the state of Tennessee. Morristown was serviced by its first newspaper, the &quot;American Statesman&quot;, in 1857 after relocating to Morristown from Dandridge, the seat of Jefferson County. By 1860, Morristown was recorded by the United States Census Bureau to have an initial population of 500 as an incorporated city.

Between 1855 and 1870, Morristown&#x27;s municipal limits were divided along Main Street into Grainger and Jefferson counties. Many residents brought concerns regarding transportation and communication access in Morristown, and neighboring communities such as Russellville and Panther Springs raised concerns as well regarding accessibility to Morristown. After working with government officials from the neighboring counties and the state government, Hamblen County was formed from portions of Grainger, Jefferson, Hawkins, and Greene counties. Morristown was chosen as the county seat of Hamblen County shortly after its formation in 1870.

===Civil War===
As the Civil War approached, the town&#x27;s sympathies were divided between the Union and secessionist sides. In December 1863, some 25,000 Confederate Army soldiers under the command of General James Longstreet arrived at Bethesda Presbyterian Church, northeast of the town, to spend the winter, after the Battle of Bean&#x27;s Station. They remained there until February 1864 and used the Bethesda Church building as a hospital. Military engagements occurred near the church in both October and November 1864. On October 28, 1864, Union General Alvan C. Gillem attacked Confederate forces under General John C. Vaughn in the Battle of Morristown. They fought in and around the town with Gillem routing Vaughn&#x27;s Confederates in what became known as &quot;Vaughn&#x27;s Stampede.&quot; Vaughn was forced to retreat to Carter&#x27;s Station on the Watauga River in northeastern Tennessee. The battle resulted in about 335 total casualties. In the Battle of Bull&#x27;s Gap (&quot;Gillem&#x27;s Stampede&quot;) in November, Confederate forces under General John C. Breckinridge prevailed over Gillem&#x27;s troops, chasing the Union forces westward to a defensive position at Strawberry Plains near Knoxville. During one of these skirmishes, a cannonball penetrated one of the church walls, causing structural damage that was repaired by reinforcing the walls with large iron rods. The Union Army used the church as a hospital for soldiers wounded in these operations. Many soldiers from both sides are interred in the Bethesda Church cemetery. Eighty of the wartime burials are unidentified.

===Later 19th century developments===
Morristown saw a steady shift into an industrially-based economy in the early beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, around the early to late 19th century. The first industry in the area was the Shields Paper Mill, located on the Holston River, operating from 1825 to 1861. Other prominent early businesses included the Morristown Manufacturing Company and the later Knoxville-based J. F. Goodson Coffee Company in 1882.

From 1891 to 1928, Morristown was a terminal on the Knoxville and Bristol Railroad, commonly known by locals as the &quot;Peavine Railroad.&quot; The railroad was a branch line of the Southern Railway that ran from downtown Morristown on Main Street to Corryton, a bedroom community outside of Knoxville. The Peavine Railroad had first operated between Morristown and Bean Station, with plans to connect north to the Cumberland Gap, but instead extended west through Grainger County towards Knoxville due to feasibility concerns regarding construction through the Clinch Mountain valley.

===Mid 20th century to present day ===
==== American Enka and the labor movement ====
In 1944, the American Enka Company, a rayon fiber producer based out of Asheville, North Carolina, began construction on a 230-acre plant in the Lowland region of Morristown, beginning operations in 1947.
In March 1950, workers at the facility walked out on strike. Officials from American Enka Company then advertised for replacements of the striking workers. Tensions soon built when residents of Morristown and Lowland appeared at the gates of the Enka plant to apply for the listed jobs. Violence then followed, with shots fired, cars damaged, and one adjacent house destroyed by dynamite. The then-governor of Tennessee, Gordon Browning, dispatched National Guard troops to restore order at the Enka factory. By the end of the strike, and following acts of violence and vandalism, its story had become national front-page news, and on-site congressional hearings regarding labor relations and the labor movement were held in Morristown, led by Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey.

In 1985, the American Enka facility was acquired by BASF and continued under their operations until 1992, when it was sold to Lenzing AG. The plant closed in 2005, after the company that operated the plant, Liberty Fibers, filed for bankruptcy. The plant site and its adjacent wastewater treatment plant have since been annexed into the Morristown city limits.

====Industrial development====
Beginning in 1959, following then presidential candidate John F. Kennedy&#x27;s exposure to poverty in Appalachia, Morristown officials began a joint effort with Tennessee economic development representatives to establish the city as a major industrial hub, and the program began with the construction and completion of the East Tennessee Valley Industrial District (ETVID) industrial park in eastern Morristown near Russellville. In 1962, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of chains, the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company opened a plant to manufacture its steel thimble roller chains.

By 1978, the ETVID industrial park had reached its estimated capacity, prompting city officials to develop a second industrial park. After acquiring a site in western Morristown near Morristown Regional Airport in the same year, city officials developed the site into the Morristown Airport Industrial District (MAID) industrial park in 1981. Five months after the park&#x27;s completion, two companies opened facilities at the MAID. As overall economic prosperity continued to make gains in Morristown, city officials and development representatives have cited Morristown&#x27;s industrial development initiative as an example of economic growth:

In the 1990s, the City of Morristown acquired over near Interstate 81 exit 8 for its third industrial park, the East Tennessee Progress Center (ETPC). Initial site development such as roadway and utility upgrades were completed in 2001. Several large manufacturers opened facilities at the site, but further infrastructure upgrades, grading work, and property acquisition was done on the site throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

Following the 2007-2012 global economic crisis, Morristown saw the loss of one of its largest employers, Berkline, which closed after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011. The furniture manufacturer, which relocated to the city in 1937, eliminated 602 jobs and ended an era of Morristown being known as a predominately furniture manufacturing hub:

In 2018, Belgian bus manufacturer Van Hool announced the construction of a facility at the ETPC (East Tennessee Progress Center), one of the largest industrial development projects in the history of Morristown. The project expects to create an estimated 650 jobs, over $47 million in private investment and an influx of interest of further industrial development in the Morristown area.

====Downtown emergence and the &quot;Skymart&quot; project====
By 1833, Morristown had its first post office and store located along Main Street. Fourteen years later, railroad lines were built, stimulating further commercial growth until the beginning of the American Civil War. Morristown&#x27;s Main Street district, measuring approximately , arose from the intersection of two railroad lines, gradually turning Morristown into wholesale/retail hub after the end of the Civil War.

At the start of the 20th century, new buildings were erected in the downtown area, including the Henry Street Post Office, the First National Bank Building, and the Princess Theater. The Princess Theater was the first theater in Morristown and showcased touring musical acts, ministerial shows, pageants, films, and special Grand Ole Opry performances. Following the opening of theaters in neighboring shopping complexes, the Princess Theater closed in 1982, and was demolished in 1995.

Following the 1950s, the downtown district saw losses in revenue, as a suburban shopping mall on the city&#x27;s west side jeopardized businesses downtown. The city developed a plan to modernize Main Street by creating an &quot;overhead sidewalk&quot; as part of the nationwide push for urban renewal projects, enabling businesses to form on the second floor of existing buildings while serving as a canopy for passage below. Building owners spent nearly $2 million ($16 million today) upgrading their properties and linking them to ramps, while the government contributed over $5 million to build the elevated walkways. The underground channel for Turkey Creek was also enlarged and rerouted. In 1962, Turkey Creek, which bisects the street, flooded and damaged the downtown commercial district. The project was completed in 1967, becoming the first second-story sidewalk system in an American city. Over time, the Skymart has served as little more than a remnant of the idealism of 1960s urban renewal projects. Despite the aftermath of the project, the overhead sidewalks still stand in the downtown area.

Morristown is embarking on a resurrection of the Skymart, eyeing the structure as a key redevelopment tool for turning downtown into a social and commercial hub. It has been made a key element in a greenway master plan along Turkey Creek, with plans to connect downtown Morristown to Cherokee Park and Cherokee Lake. In an effort to renew public interest, city officials, the Crossroads Downtown Partnership, and the Morristown Area Chamber of Commerce hold events in the city&#x27;s downtown or the &quot;Skymart District&quot; throughout the year, mainly during the warmer months of May to September.

Morristown Utilities System (MUS) provides electricity, water, sewer, and fiber broadband internet to the City of Morristown and several eastern Hamblen County residents and businesses. It provides services to approximately 15,000 customers.

Appalachian Electric Cooperative (AEC), a utilities company based out of New Market in neighboring Jefferson County, provides electricity and fiber broadband internet for western and northern portions of Morristown, portions of Hamblen County, Jefferson County (including New Market, Baneberry, Jefferson City, Dandridge, and White Pine), and Grainger County (including Bean Station and Rutledge). AEC, as of June 2018, provides services to 46,000 customers.

===Transportation===

Morristown is an automobile-dependent city, almost entirely reliant on roadway infrastructure to support its large commuting-base residing inside the city and from surrounding counties.

All U.S. routes, state routes in Morristown, along with I-81, are maintained by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) in TDOT Region 1, which consists of 24 counties in East Tennessee. Streets, sidewalks, and greenways in the Morristown-Hamblen area are maintained by either the Hamblen County Highway Department or the City of Morristown Public Works Department.

In 2002, the United States Census Bureau declared the municipalities of Morristown, Jefferson City, White Pine, and portions of unincorporated Hamblen and Jefferson counties as a part of an urbanized area. The Lakeway Area Metropolitan Transportation Planning Organization (LAMPTO) was created following the requirement of a designated MTPO for all urbanized areas in the United States. The LAMPTO plans and coordinates regional transportation projects in Morristown and its urbanized area.

====Major highways====
The sole interstate highway serving Morristown is Interstate 81, which connects the city to Interstate 40 in nearby Dandridge to the west, and the Tri-Cities region in northeasternmost Tennessee to the east.

U.S. Route 25E-Tennessee State Route 32 is the principal north–south route in Morristown, and connects the city from Interstate 81 at exit 8, to U.S. Route 11W in Bean Station. US 25E also extends to Interstate 75 in Corbin, Kentucky, serving as a popular alternate route of I-75 regarding construction and congestion in Knoxville. The route is given the designation Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor S from I-81 in Morristown to the Tennessee-Kentucky state line at the Cumberland Gap, and as High-Priority Corridor 12 of the National Highway System.

U.S. Route 11E-Tennessee State Route 34 is the principal east–west route in Morristown, paralleling the I-40-I-81 corridor, and connecting the city to Jefferson City to the west, and Greeneville to the east.

Tennessee State Route 160 is a bypass route of US 11E, and serves the city with access to I-81 at exit 12, US 25E, and US 11E.

Tennessee State Route 66 is a connector route to serving Morristown, connecting the city to I-81 exit 4 in White Pine, and to SR 160 and US 11E in west Morristown.

<doc id="151083" wikidata="Q150599" url="?curid=151083" title="Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Ferdinand II (9 July 1578 – 15 February 1637) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia from 1619 until his death in 1637. He was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Maria of Bavaria, who were devout Catholics. In 1590, when Ferdinand was 11 years old, they sent him to study at the Jesuits&#x27; college in Ingolstadt because they wanted to isolate him from the Lutheran nobles. A few months later, his father died, and he inherited Inner Austria–Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and smaller provinces. His cousin, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was the head of the Habsburg family, appointed regents to administer these lands.

Ferdinand was installed as the actual ruler of the Inner Austrian provinces in 1596 and 1597. Rudolf II also charged him with the command of the defense of Croatia, Slavonia, and southeastern Hungary against the Ottoman Empire. Ferdinand regarded the regulation of religious issues as a royal prerogative and introduced strict Counter-Reformation measures from 1598. First, he ordered the expulsion of all Protestant pastors and teachers; next, he established special commissions to restore the Catholic parishes. The Ottomans captured Nagykanizsa in Hungary in 1600, which enabled them to invade Styria. A year later, Ferdinand tried to recapture the fortress, but the action ended in November 1601 with a defeat, due to unprofessional command of his troops. During the first stage of the family feud known as the Brothers&#x27; Quarrel, Ferdinand initially supported Rudolph II&#x27;s brother, Matthias, who wanted to convince the melancholic emperor to abdicate, but Matthias&#x27; concessions to the Protestants in Hungary, Austria, and Bohemia outraged Ferdinand. He planned an alliance to strengthen the position of the Catholic Church in the Holy Roman Empire, but the Catholic princes established the Catholic League without his participation in 1610.

Philip III of Spain, who was the childless Matthias&#x27; nephew, acknowledged Ferdinand&#x27;s right to succeed Matthias in Bohemia and Hungary in exchange for territorial concessions in 1617. Spain also supported Ferdinand against the Republic of Venice during the Uskok War in 1617–18. The Diets of Bohemia and Hungary confirmed Ferdinand&#x27;s position as Matthias&#x27; successor only after he had promised to respect the Estates&#x27; privileges in both realms. The different interpretation of the Letter of Majesty, which summarized the Bohemian Protestants&#x27; liberties, gave rise to an uprising, known as the Second Defenestration of Prague on 23 May 1618. The Bohemian rebels established a provisional government, invaded Upper Austria, and sought assistance from the Habsburgs&#x27; opponents. Matthias II died on 20 March 1619. Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor on 28 August 1619 (Frankfurt), two days before the Protestant Bohemian Estates deposed Ferdinand (as king of Bohemia). News of his deposition arrived in Frankfurt on the 28th but Ferdinand didn&#x27;t leave the city until he had been crowned. The rebel Bohemians offered their crown to the Calvinist Frederick V of the Palatinate on 26 August 1619.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War began in 1618 as a result of inadequacies of his predecessors Rudolf II and Matthias. But Ferdinand&#x27;s acts against Protestantism caused the war to engulf the whole empire. As a zealous Catholic, Ferdinand wanted to restore the Catholic Church as the only religion in the Holy Roman Empire and to wipe out any form of religious dissent. The war left the empire devastated and its population did not recover until 1710.

==Childhood==

Born in the castle in Graz on 9 July 1578, Ferdinand was the son of Charles II, Archduke of Austria, and Maria of Bavaria. Charles II, who was the youngest son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, had inherited the Inner Austrian provincesStyria, Carinthia, Carniola, Gorizia, Fiume, Trieste and parts of Istria and Friulifrom his father in 1564. Being a daughter of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, by Charles II&#x27;s sister Anna, Maria of Bavaria was her husband&#x27;s niece. Their marriage brought about a reconciliation between the two leading Catholic families of the Holy Roman Empire. They were devout Catholics, but Charles II had to grant concessions to his Lutheran subjects in 1572 and 1578 to secure the predominantly Protestant nobles and burghers&#x27; financial support for the establishment of a new defense system against the Ottoman Empire.

Ferdinand&#x27;s education was managed primarily by his mother. He matriculated at the Jesuits&#x27; school in Graz at the age of 8. His separate household was set up three years later. His parents wanted to separate him from the Lutheran Styrian nobles and sent him to Ingolstadt to continue his studies at the Jesuits&#x27; college in Bavaria. Ferdinand chose Paul the Apostle&#x27;s words&quot;To Those Who Fight Justly Goes the Crown&quot;as his personal motto before he left Graz in early 1590. His parents asked his maternal uncle, William V, Duke of Bavaria, to oversee his education.

==Reign==

===Inner Austria===

====First years====

Charles II died unexpectedly on 10 July 1590, having named his wife, his brother Archduke Ferdinand II, their nephew Emperor Rudolf II, and his brother-in-law Duke William V the guardians of Ferdinand. Maria and William V tried to secure the regency for her, but Rudolph II, who was the head of the Habsburg family, appointed his own brothersfirst Ernest in 1592, and then in 1593, Maximilian IIIto the post. The Estates of Inner Austria urged the emperor to procure Ferdinand&#x27;s return from Bavaria; Maria resisted this, and Ferdinand continued his studies at the Jesuit university. Ferdinand and his maternal cousin, Maximilian I, were the only future European rulers to have pursued university studies in the late 16th century. He regularly attended classes, although his delicate health often forced him to stay in his chamber. His religiosity was reinforced during his studies: he did not miss the Masses on Sundays and feast days, and made pilgrimages to Bavarian shrines.

Ferdinand completed his studies on 21 December 1594; Rudolph II permitted him to return to Graz only two months later. Before leaving for his homeland, Ferdinand solemnly promised to support the university and the Jesuits. Maximilian III renounced the regency and the emperor made the 17-year-old Ferdinand his own regent. Ferdinand chose the Jesuit Bartholomew Viller as his confessor. A burgher from Graz who had converted to Catholicism, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, became one of his most trusted courtiers. The weak position of Catholicism in Graz astonished Ferdinand, especially when he realized that only his relatives and most trusted courtiers celebrated the Eucharist during the Easter Mass.

Ferdinand reached the age of majority in late 1596. He was first officially installed as ruler in Styria in December. He avoided discussion of religious affairs with the Estates, taking advantage of their fear of an Ottoman invasion and the peasant uprisings in Upper Austria. Early the following year, the representatives of the other Inner Austrian provinces swore fealty to him. He left unchanged the traditional system of government, appointing only Catholics to the highest offices. He and his mother then met with Rudolph II in Prague, where Ferdinand informed the emperor of his plans to strengthen the position of Catholicism. The emperor&#x27;s advisors acknowledged Ferdinand&#x27;s right to regulate religious issues, yet requested he not provoke his Protestant subjects. Rudolph II gave Ferdinand responsibility for the defense of Croatia, Slavonia and the southeastern parts of Royal Hungary against the Ottomans. He visited Nagykanizsa, Cetin Castle and the nearby fortresses and ordered their repair.

Ferdinand made an unofficial journey to Italy before getting fully involved in state administration. He named his mother regent and left Graz on 22 April 1598. He met with Pope Clement VIII in Ferrara in early May, and briefly mentioned that he wanted to expel all Protestants from Inner Austria, which the Pope discouraged. Ferdinand continued his journey, visiting the Holy House in Loreto. At the shrine, he ceremoniously pledged that he would restore Catholicism, according to his first biography, written after his death by his confessor, Wilhelm Lamormaini.

====Counter-Reformation====

Ferdinand returned to Graz on 20 June 1598. Johannes Kepler, who had been staying in the town, noted that the Protestant burghers watched Ferdinand&#x27;s return with some apprehension. He had already made unsuccessful attempts to appoint Catholic priests to churches in predominantly Lutheran towns prior to his Italian journey. A former Jesuit student, Lorenz Sonnabenter, whom Ferdinand had sent to a parish in Graz, made a formal complaint against the local Lutheran pastors on 22 August, accusing them of unlawfully interfering in his office. Ferdinand&#x27;s mother and Jesuit confessor urged him to take vigorous measures. He ordered the expulsion of all Protestant pastors and teachers from Styria, Carinthia and Carniola on 13 September, emphasizing that he was the &quot;general overseer of all ecclesiastical foundations in his hereditary lands&quot;. When the Protestant nobles and burghers protested against his decree, he replied that the Estates had no jurisdiction in religious affairs. He summoned Italian and Spanish mercenaries to Graz. Due to his firm actions, no riots broke out when the leaders of the Protestant community left Graz on 29 September.

Ferdinand forbade the Estates of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola to hold a joint assembly. The Styrian nobles and burghers unsuccessfully sought assistance from Rudolph II and their Austrian peers against him. Although he issued new decrees to strengthen the position of the Catholic Church without seeking the Estates&#x27; consent, the Estates granted the subsidies that he had demanded from them. After the Styrian general assembly was dissolved, Ferdinand summarized his views of the Counter-Reformation in a letter to the delegates. He claimed that the unlawful prosecution of Catholics had forced him to adopt strict measures, adding that the Holy Spirit had inspired his acts. In October 1599, Ferdinand set up special commissions, consisting of a prelate and a high officer, to install Catholic priests in each town and village, and authorized them to apply military force if necessary. During the visit of the commissioners, local Protestants were to choose between conversion or exile, although in practice peasants were rarely allowed to leave. The commissioners also burnt prohibited books. Ferdinand did not force the Lutheran noblemen to convert to Catholicism, but forbade them to employ Protestant priests.

====Brothers&#x27; Quarrel and Turkish war====

Ferdinand married his cousin, Maria Anna of Bavaria, in Graz on 23 April 1600. Their marriage improved the relationship between the Habsburgs and the Wittelsbachs, which had deteriorated because of the appointment of Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Leopold V to the Bishopric of Passau. Around the same time, the relationship between Rudolph II and his brother, Matthias, deteriorated. Fearing that the Protestant prince-electors could take advantage of his childless brother&#x27;s death to elect a Protestant emperor, Matthias wanted to convince Rudolph II to name him as his successor. Matthias discussed the issue with his younger brother, Maximilian, and with Ferdinand at a secret meeting in Schottwien in October 1600. They agreed to jointly approach the emperor, but the superstitious and melancholic Rudolph flatly refused to talk about his succession.

The Uskoksirregular soldiers of mixed origin along the northeastern coast of the Adriatic Seamade several attacks against the Venetian ships, claiming that the Venetians cooperated with the Ottomans. The Venetians urged Ferdinand to prevent further piratical actions. In 1600, he sent an envoy to the Uskoks, whom the Uskoks murdered. Ottoman raids against the borderlands continued and the expenses of the defence of Croatia, Slavonia and southwestern Hungary were almost exclusively financed from Inner Austria. Ferdinand could never properly manage financial affairs, and the most important fortresses were poorly supplied. The Ottomans occupied Nagykanizsa on 20 October 1600, which left the Styrian border almost defenseless against Ottoman raids. Ferdinand urged the Pope and Philip III of Spain to send reinforcements and funds to him. The Pope appointed his nephew, Gian Francesco Aldobrandini, as the commander of the papal troops. Ferdinand&#x27;s counselors warned him against a counter-invasion before further reinforcements arrived, but Aldobrandini convinced him to lay siege to Nagykanizsa on 18 October 1601. After his troops were decimated by hunger and bad weather, Ferdinand was forced to lift the siege and return to Styria on 15 November.

The Ottomans failed to exploit this victory, as Rudolph II&#x27;s troops managed to defeat them near Székesfehérvár. This victory restored Rudolph&#x27;s self-confidence, and he decided to introduce severe Counter-Reformation measures in Silesia and Hungary, outraging his Protestant subjects. The Calvinist magnate István Bocskai rose up against Rudolph, and most Hungarian noblemen joined him before the end of 1604. Taking advantage of his relatives&#x27; anxiety, Matthias persuaded Ferdinand, Maximilian and Ferdinand&#x27;s brother, Maximilian Ernest, to start new negotiations concerning Rudolph&#x27;s succession. At their meeting in Linz in April 1606, the four archdukes concluded that the emperor was incompetent and decided to replace him with Matthias in Bohemia, Hungary and Upper and Lower Austria. Ferdinand later claimed that he only signed the secret treaty because he feared that his relatives could otherwise accuse him of pursuing the throne for himself. Rudolph did not abdicate the throne, and announced that he was thinking of appointing Ferdinand&#x27;s brother, Leopold, his successor. In fact, the emperor authorised Matthias to start negotiations with Bocskai. The resulting agreement was included in the Treaty of Vienna, which granted religious freedom to Hungarian Protestants and prescribed the election of a palatine (or royal deputy) in Hungary on 23 June 1606. The subsequent Peace of Zsitvatorok put an end to the war with the Ottoman Empire on 11 November 1606.

Rudolph II convoked the Imperial Diet to Regensburg and appointed Ferdinand as his deputy in November 1607. At the opening session of the Diet on 12 January 1608, Ferdinand demanded funds from the Imperial Estates on the emperor&#x27;s behalf to finance 24,000 troops. The delegates of the Protestant princes stated that they would vote for the tax only if the Catholic Estates accepted their interpretation of the Religious Peace of Augsburg, especially their right to retain the lands they had confiscated from Catholic clerics in their realms. Ferdinand urged both parties to respect the Religious Peace, but without much success. He started negotiations with William V of Bavaria about the formation of an alliance of the Catholic princes, but his uncle wanted to establish it without the Habsburgs&#x27; participation. After the Diet was closed in early May, the Electoral Palatinate, Brandenburg, Würtemberg and other Protestant principalities formed an alliance, known as the Protestant Union, to defend their common interests.

Ferdinand&#x27;s appointment as the emperor&#x27;s deputy to the Diet implied that Rudolph regarded Ferdinandthe only Habsburg who had already fathered childrenas his successor. Matthias made public his secret treaty with Ferdinand, and the emperor pardoned Ferdinand. Matthias concluded a formal alliance with the representatives of the Hungarian and Austrian Estates and led an army of 15,000 strong to Moravia. The envoys of the Holy See and Philip III of Spain mediated a compromise in June 1608. According to the Treaty of Lieben, Rudolph retained most Lands of the Bohemian Crown and the title of Holy Roman Emperor, but had to renounce Hungary, Lower and Upper Austria and Moravia in favor of Matthias. Both brothers were forced to confirm the privileges of the Estates in their realms, including religious freedom.

===Matthias&#x27;s successor===

====Negotiations and alliances====

Ferdinand&#x27;s mother died on 29 April 1608, while he was staying in Regensburg. With her death, as historian Robert Bireley noted, Ferdinand &quot;lost the most important person in his life, the one who more than any other had formed his character and his outlook.&quot; He requested the scholar Caspar Schoppe, whom he had met at the Imperial Diet, to elaborate a detailed plan for an alliance of the Catholic monarchs. Schoppe argued that the alliance was to guarantee the Religious Peace, but he also demanded the restoration of Catholicism in all former ecclesiastic principalities and the return of the confiscated Church lands. Ferdinand embraced Schoppe&#x27;s views and appointed him to start negotiations with Pope Paul V about a &quot;just war&quot; for the defence of the interests of Catholics, but the Pope avoid making a commitment, because he did not want to outrage Henry IV of France. Ferdinand also tried to strengthen his relationship with his Bavarian relatives, because Matthias&#x27; rebellion against Rudolph II and his concessions to the Protestants had shocked Ferdinand. However, William V and Maximilian of Bavaria ignored him when they and the three ecclesiastical electorsthe archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologneestablished the Catholic League in February 1610. Only Philip III of Spain, who promised financial aid to the League, could persuade the Catholic princes to accept Ferdinand as a director and the vice-protector of the League in August.

Cooperating with Rudolph II&#x27;s principal advisor, Melchior Klesl, Bishop of Vienna, Ferdinand persuaded the emperor to seek a reconciliation with Matthias. Ferdinand and other imperial princes came to Prague to meet with the emperor on 1 May 1610. He stayed neutral in the family feud, which enabled him to mediate between the two brothers. They reached a compromise, but Rudolph refused to name Matthias as his successor. Instead, he adopted Ferdinand&#x27;s younger brother, Leopold, who had hired 15,000 mercenaries at his request. Leopold invaded Bohemia in February 1611, but the troops of the Bohemian Estates defeated him. The Bohemian Estates dethroned Rudolph and elected Matthias king on 23 May 1611. Since Rudolph retained the title of emperor, his succession in the Holy Roman Empire remained uncertain. Matthias, Ferdinand and Maximilian III assembled at Vienna to discuss the issue with Philip III&#x27;s envoy, Baltasar de Zúñiga, in December. They decided to support Matthias&#x27;s election as King of the Romans (which could have secured his right to succeed Rudolph II), but the three ecclesiastical electors opposed the plan because of Matthias&#x27;s concessions to the Protestants in Hungary, Austria and Bohemia.

Matthias was elected Holy Roman Emperor only months after Rudolph II died on 20 June 1612. Since Matthias and his two surviving brothers, Maximilian III and Albert VII were childless, his succession in Austria, Bohemia, Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire was uncertain. Matthias made Ferdinand the governor of Lower and Upper Austria and appointed him as his representative in Hungary, but Klesl became his most influential advisor. Klesl wanted to forge a new princely alliance in the Holy Roman Empire with the participation of both Catholic and Protestant princes. Ferdinand and Maximilian III regarded his plan dangerous and sent envoys to Rome to convince the Pope about the importance of a pure Catholic alliance. Although the Catholic League was renewed, it declared, in accordance with Klesl&#x27;s proposal, the defense of the imperial constitution as its principal purpose instead of the protection of Catholicism. Philip III of Spain announced his claim to succeed Matthias in Bohemia and Hungary, emphasizing that his mother, Anna, the sister of Matthias, had never renounced her right to the two realms. Matthias and Ferdinand discussed the issue with Zúñiga in Linz in June and July 1613, but they did not reach an agreement. Maximilian III and Albert VII who preferred Ferdinand to Philip III renounced their claims in favor of him in August 1614, but Klesl made several efforts to delay the decision.

====Uskok War and royal elections====

Ferdinand sent troops against the Uskoks&#x27; principal center at Senj to put an end to their piratical raids in 1614. Dozens of Uskok commanders were captured and beheaded, but his action did not satisfy the Venetians who invaded Istria and captured Habsburg territories in 1615. They besieged Gradisca from 12 February to 30 March, but they could not capture the fortress. Ferdinand sought assistance from Spain and the Venetians received support from the Dutch and English, but neither side could achieve a decisive victory in the Uskok War.

Matthias adopted Ferdinand as his son in 1615, but without proposing Ferdinand&#x27;s election as king of the Romans, because he feared that Ferdinand would force him to abdicate. In early 1616, Ferdinand pledged that he would not interfere in state administration in Matthias&#x27;s realms. Klesl who regarded Ferdinand as the Jesuits&#x27; puppet continued to oppose his appointment as Matthias&#x27;s successor. On 31 October 1616, Ferdinand and Maximilian III agreed to achieve the removal of Klesl, but Ferdinand wanted to conclude an agreement with Philip III about Matthias&#x27;s succession before making further steps. Philip&#x27;s new envoy at Vienna, Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 7th Count of Oñate, and Ferdinand signed a secret treaty on 29 July 1617. Philip acknowledged Ferdinand&#x27;s right to inherit Matthias&#x27;s realms, but Ferdinand promised to cede territories in Alsace, along with Finale Ligure and the Principality of Piombino in Italy to Philip after he succeeded Matthias as Holy Roman Emperor. Philip also granted 1 million thalers to Ferdinand to finance the war against the Venetians. The Venetians again laid siege to Gradisca in March 1617. Ferdinand needed further funds, but the Estates did not vote new taxes.

Matthias fell seriously ill in late April 1617. Ignoring Klesl&#x27;s advice, he convoked the Diet of Bohemia to secure Ferdinand&#x27;s succession. He announced that his two brothers had abdicated in favor of Ferdinand, but the majority of the Bohemian delegates denied the Habsburgs&#x27; hereditary right to Bohemia. After some negotiations, all delegates but two noblemen and two burghers agreed to &quot;accept&quot; Ferdinand as king on 6 June. Ferdinand promised to respect the Letter of Majestya royal diploma that guaranteed religious freedom in the Lands of the Bohemian Crownonly after consulting with the local Jesuits. He was crowned king in the St. Vitus Cathedral on 29 June. Ten regents (seven Catholics and three Protestants) were appointed and they established a censor office in Prague.

Ferdinand and Matthias met with the Lutheran John George I, Elector of Saxony in Dresden who promised to support Ferdinand at the imperial elections. John George also agreed to convince the two other Protestant electors, Frederick V of the Palatinate and John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, to vote for Ferdinand. Ferdinand hired new troops against the Venetians and volunteers also joined his army. The Catholic Bohemian nobleman, Albrecht von Wallenstein, recruited 260 soldiers at his own expense. The Venetians abandoned the Siege of Gradisca on 22 September, but peace was restored only in early 1618, after Ferdinand agreed to resettle the Uskoks from the coastline and ordered the destruction of their ships. The Venetians abandoned the territories that they had occupied in Istria and a permanent Austrian garrison was placed at Senj.

Matthias convoked the Diet of Hungary to Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in early 1618. After the Hungarian delegates achieved the appointment of a new palatine (or royal lieutenant) and the confirmation of the Estates&#x27; privileges, they proclaimed Ferdinand king on 16 May 1618. He appointed the Catholic magnate, Zsigmond Forgách, as the new palatine.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War===

====Bohemian revolt====
The application of the Letter of Majesty was controversial in Bohemia. The Protestants argued that it allowed them to build churches on Catholic prelates&#x27; lands, but the Catholics did not accept their interpretation. Royal officials arrested Protestant burghers who wanted to build a church in Broumov and destroyed a newly built church in Hrob. The Protestants principally blamed two of the four Catholic royal governors, Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice and Vilém Slavata of Chlum, for the violent acts. On 23 May 1618, Jindřich Matyáš Thurnone of the two Czech magnates who had not accepted Ferdinand&#x27;s successionled a group of armed noblemen to the Prague Castle. They captured the two governors and one of their secretaries and threw them out of the window. The Third Defenestration of Prague was the start of a new uprising. Two days later, the Protestant Estates elected directors to form a provisional government and started to raise an army.

Ferdinand was staying in Pressburg when he was informed of the Bohemian events on 27 May 1618. He urged Matthias to send an envoy to Prague, but Matthias&#x27; envoy could not reach a compromise. Ferdinand was crowned king of Hungary on 1 July, and he returned to Vienna two weeks later. Ferdinand and Maximilian III decided to get rid of Klesl, although the cardinal supported their demand for a more determined policy against the Bohemian rebels. After a meeting with Klesl at his home, they invited him to the Hofburg, but Ferdinand ordered his arrest at the entrance of the palace on 20 July. Ferdinand was automatically excommunicated for the imprisonment of a cardinal, but Pope Paul V absolved him before the end of the year. Ferdinand started negotiations with the rebels with the mediation of John George I of Saxony. He demanded the dissolution of the provisional government and the rebels&#x27; army. Instead of obeying his orders, the rebels concluded an alliance with the Estates of Silesia, Upper and Lower Lusatia, and Upper Austria. Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy hired Ernst von Mansfeld to assist the Bohemians. Mansfeld and his mercenaries captured Plzeň, which was an important center of the Bohemian Catholics, and the rebels made raids into Lower Austria. From September 1618, Pope Paul V paid a monthly subsidy to Ferdinand to contribute to the costs of the war and Philip III of Spain also promised support to him.

Emperor Matthias died on 20 March 1619. Maximilian of Bavaria encouraged Ferdinand to adopt an aggressive policy against the Bohemian rebels, but Ferdinand again confirmed the Letter of Majesty and urged the Bohemians to send delegates to Vienna. The directors ignored Ferdinand&#x27;s acts and made further preparations for an armed conflict. Wallenstein stormed into Olomouc and seized 96,000 thalers from the Moravian treasury on 30 April. He gave the booty to Ferdinand, but the king returned it to the Moravian Estates. The Protestant Estates of Upper Austria demanded the confirmation of their religious and political liberties before recognizing Ferdinand as Matthias&#x27; successor. Thurn and his 15,000 troops laid siege to Vienna on 5 June. Since only 300 soldiers were staying in the town, Ferdinand sent envoys to his commander at Krems, Henri Duval, Count of Dampierre and entered into negotiations with the Upper Austrian Protestants about their demands. Dampierre and his troops reached Vienna by boat and forced the Protestant delegates to flee from the Hofburg. After Ferdinand&#x27;s general, Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, 2nd Count of Bucquoy, defeated the Bohemian rebels in the Battle of Sablat, Thurn lifted the siege on 12 June.

Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg, Archbishop of Mainz, convoked the electors&#x27; meeting to Frankfurt. Ferdinand avoided the rebellious Upper Austria and approached the assembly through Salzburg and Munich. The Bohemians sent envoys to the conference and denied Ferdinand&#x27;s right to vote as their king, but the electors ignored their demand. The Estates of all Lands of the Bohemian Crown formed a confederation on 31 July. They deposed Ferdinand on 22 August, and four days later, they offered the crown to Frederick V of the Palatinate. Frederick had tried to convince the electors to elect Maximilian I of Bavaria as the new Holy Roman Emperor. Maximilian did not accept the candidacy and Ferdinand was unanimously elected as emperor on 28 August. The news about 
Ferdinand&#x27;s deposition in Bohemia reached Frankfurt on the same day, but he did not leave the town before being crowned on 9 September. Gabriel Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania, made an alliance with the Bohemians and invaded Upper Hungary (mainly present-day Slovakia) in September. After learning of Bethlen&#x27;s success, Frederick V accepted the Bohemian crown on 28 September.

Ferdinand concluded a treaty with Maximilian I in Munich on 8 October 1619. Maximilian became the head of a renewed Catholic League and Ferdinand promised to compensate him for the costs of the war. He was still in Munich when Bethlen and Thurn united their forces and laid siege to Vienna in November. Ferdinand sought assistance from his staunchly Catholic brother-in-law, Sigismund III of Poland. Sigismund did not intervene, however, he did hire mercenaries from the Cossack lands which invaded Upper Hungary and forced Bethlen to hurry back to Transylvania in late January 1620. Ferdinand and Bethlen concluded a 9-month truce, which temporarily acknowledged Bethlen&#x27;s conquests in Hungary. Abandoned by Bethlen, Thurn was forced to lift the siege. Ferdinand ordered Frederick to abandon Bohemia before 1 July, threatening him with an imperial ban. John George I of Saxony promised support against the Bohemian rebels in exchange for Lusatia, but Bethlen made a new alliance with the Bohemian Confederation and they sent envoys to Constantinople to seek Sultan Osman II&#x27;s assistance.

Ferdinand continued the negotiations with the Estates of Lower and Upper Austria about his recognition as Matthias&#x27; successor in both provinces. After his new confessor, the Jesuit Martin Becanus, assured him that he could grant concessions to the Protestants to secure their loyalty, Ferdinand confirmed the Lutherans&#x27; right to practise their religion in Lower Austria, save the towns on 8 July 1620. Five days later, the vast majority of the noblemen swore fealty to him. Before long, Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, who was the commander of the army of the Catholic League, occupied Upper Austria, Bucquoy defeated the last rebels in Lower Austria and John George of Saxony invaded Lusatia. Maximilian I retained Upper Austria as a security for Ferdinand&#x27;s debts and the local Estates swore fealty to him on 20 August. The Diet of Hungary dethroned Ferdinand and elected Bethlen king on 23 August. The envoy of Louis XIII of France, Charles de Valois, Duke of Angoulême, tried to mediate a compromise between Ferdinand and his opponents, but Ferdinand was determined to force his rebellious subjects into obedience. The united troops of Maximilian I of Bavaria, Tilly and Bucquoy invaded Bohemia and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Bohemians and their allies in the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620.

====Consolidation====

Maximilian I of Bavaria urged Ferdinand to adopt strict measures against the Bohemians and their allies, and Ferdinand declared Frederick V an outlaw on 29 January 1621. Ferdinand charged Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein and Cardinal Franz von Dietrichstein with the government of Bohemia and Moravia, respectively, and ordered the establishment of special courts of justice to hear the rebels&#x27; trials. The new tribunals sentenced most leaders of the rebellion to death, and 27 of them were executed in the Old Town Square in Prague on 21 June. The estates of more than 450 nobles and burghers were fully or partially confiscated. Ferdinand demanded further trials, but Liechtenstein convinced him to grant a general pardon, because Mansfeld&#x27;s troops had not been expelled from western Bohemia. Bethlen also wanted to continue the war against Ferdinand, but the Ottomans did not support him. After lengthy negotiations, Bethlen renounced the title of king of Hungary, after Ferdinand ceded him seven Hungarian counties and two Silesian duchies in the Peace of Nikolsburg on 31 December 1621. By that time, Ferdinand had banned all Protestant pastors from Prague, ignoring John George I of Saxony&#x27;s protests.

Ferdinand could not pay off his mercenaries&#x27; salaries. Liechtenstein, Eggenberg, Wallenstein and other noblemen established a consortium that also included the Jewish banker, Jacob Bassevi, and Wallenstein&#x27;s financial manager, Hans de Witte. They persuaded Ferdinand to lease all Bohemian, Moravian and Lower Austrian mints to them for one year in return for 6 million gulden on 18 January 1622. The consortium minted debased silver coins, issuing almost 30 million gulden. They used the bad money to purchase silver and the rebels&#x27; confiscated property and also to pay off the lease. The liberal issue of the new currency caused &quot;the western&#x27;s worlds first financial crisis&quot;, featured by inflation, famine and other symptoms of economic and social disruption. Dietrichstein and the Jesuits urged Ferdinand to intervene, and he dissolved the consortium in early 1623.

Ferdinand met his second wife, the 23-year-old Eleonora Gonzaga, in Innsbruck on 1 February 1622. She was crowned as queen of Hungary in Sopron where the first Italian opera was performed in the Habsburgs&#x27; realms during the festivities that followed the coronation. Ferdinand had convoked the Diet of Hungary to Sopron to assure the Hungarian Estates that he would respect their privileges. The Diet elected a Lutheran aristocrat, Count Szaniszló Thurzó, as the new palatine.

The united Imperial and Spanish armies inflicted decisive defeats on the Protestant troops in the Holy Roman Empire in May and June 1622. Tilly conquered the capital of the Palatinate, Heidelberg, on 19 September. Ferdinand convoked the German princes to a conference to Regensburg, primarily to talk about the future of the Palatinate. He reached the town on 24 November, but most Protestant princes sent delegates to the convention. He had secretly promised the transfer of Frederick V&#x27;s title of elector to Maximilian I and his heirs, but most of his allies did not support the plan. They only agreed to bestow the title on Maximilian personally. Ferdinand had to yield, but assured Maximilian that he had not abandoned their original plan. He invested Maximilian with the electoral title on 25 February 1623, but the envoys of the electors of Brandenburg and Saxony and the Spanish ambassador were absent from the ceremony.

Ferdinand decided to unite the Habsburgs&#x27; hereditary landsInner Austria, Upper and Lower Austria and Tyrolinto a new kingdom. He informed his brothers, Leopold and Charles, about his plan in a letter on 29 April 1623, but they rejected it. Leopold wanted to establish his own principality. He renounced the bishoprics of Passau and Strasbourg in favor of Ferdinand&#x27;s younger son, Leopold Wilhelm, and retained Further Austria and Tyrol (that he had administered since 1619).

Deprived of the Palatinate, Frederick V had made a new alliance with the Dutch Republic. Bethlen used Ferdinand&#x27;s refusal to give one of his daughters to him in marriage as a pretext to join the new coalition. Christian of Brunswick was dispatched to invade Bohemia from the north, while Bethlen attacked from the east, but Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly routed Brunswick in the Battle of Stadtlohn on 6 August 1623. The Ottomans denied support to Bethlen and he was forced to sign a new peace treaty in Vienna in May 1624. The treaty confirmed the provisions of the previous Peace of Nikolsburg.

====Restoration====
Becanus who died in late 1623 was succeeded by Lamormaini as Ferdinand&#x27;s confessor. Lamormaini awakened Ferdinand&#x27;s determination to adopt strict measures against the Protestants. At his initiative, Ferdinand decided to unite the medical and law faculties of the Charles University in Prague with the theological and philosophical faculties of the Jesuits&#x27; local college to strengthen the Jesuits&#x27; control of higher education. The new archbishop of Prague, Ernst Adalbert of Harrach did not renounce the control of the university and also wanted to prevent the Jesuits from seizing the estates of the Charles University. Valerianus Magnus, the head of the Capuchins in Bohemia, and the Holy See supported Harrach, but Ferdinand did not relent.

Ferdinand ceremoniously renewed his oath about the restoration of Catholicism in his realms on 25 March 1624. First, he banned Protestant ceremonies in Bohemia proper and Moravia, even prohibiting the noblemen to hold Protestant pastors on 18 May. Maximilian I of Bavaria, who still held Upper Austria in pledge, proposed a cautious approach in the province, but Ferdinand ordered the expulsion of all Protestant pastors and teachers on 4 October. A year later, he prescribed that all inhabitants were to convert to Catholicism in Upper Austria by the following Easter, allowing only noblemen and burghers to choose to leave the province. The Upper Austrian peasants rose up in a rebellion and took control of the territories to the north of the Danube in May–June 1626. They sent delegates to Ferdinand in Vienna, but he did not give them an audience. Instead, he sent troops from Lower Austria to assist the Bavarian army in the crushing of the rebellion which was accomplished by the end of November. Tens of thousands of Protestants left Upper Austria during the following years.

Ferdinand also took advantage of his peace with Bethlen to strengthen his position in Hungary. The Diet of Hungary confirmed the right of his son, Ferdinand III, to succeed him in October 1625. Ferdinand also achieved the election of a Catholic magnate, Count Miklós Esterházy, as the new palatine with the support of the Archbishop of Esztergom, Cardinal Péter Pázmány.

====Conclusion====
The chief minister of Louis XIII of France, Cardinal Richelieu, started to forge an alliance against the Habsburgs in 1624. French troops were garrisoned along the French frontiers and Richelieu sent envoys to the wealthy and ambitious Christian IV of Denmark and other Protestant rulers to convince them to form a new league. Christian IV raised new troops and stationed them in his Duchy of Holstein (in the Lower Saxon Circle of the Holy Roman Empire) and persuaded the other Lower Saxon rulers to make him the commander of their united armies in early 1625. Initially, Ferdinand wanted to avoid the renewal of armed conflicts, but Maximilian of Bavaria urged him to gather an army against the new Protestant alliance. Wallenstein, who had accumulated immeasurable wealth in Bohemia, offered to hire mercenaries for him, but Ferdinand still hesitated. He authorized Maximilian to invade the Lower Saxon Circle if it were necessary to stop a Danish attack only in July. In the same month, Maximilian ordered Tilly to move his troops into Lower Saxony, and Wallenstein invaded the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Halberstadt, but a fierce rivalry between the two commanders prevented them from continuing the military campaign.

The electors of Mainz and Saxony demanded that Ferdinand should convoke the electors to a new convention to discuss the status of the Palatinate, but Ferdinand adopted a delaying tactic. In a letter, he informed Maximilian of Bavaria about his plan to grant a pardon to Frederick V in exchange for Frederick&#x27;s public submission and an indemnification for the costs of the war, but he also emphasized that he did not want to deprive Maximilian of the electoral title. The English, Dutch and Danish envoys concluded an alliance against the Catholic League in The Hague on 9 December 1625. Bethlen promised to launch a new military campaign against Royal Hungary and Richelieu agreed to send a subsidy to him. Taking advantage of the peasant revolt in Upper Austria, Christian IV departed from his headquarters in Wolfenbüttel, but Tilly routed his troops in the Battle of Lutter on 26 August 1626. Mansfeld had invaded Silesia and reached Upper Hungary, but Bethlen made a new peace with Ferdinand on 20 December 1626, because he could not wage war alone against the emperor.

Ferdinand deprived the dukes of Mecklenburg from their duchies for their support to Christian IV in February 1627. In the same month, Wallenstein occupied Mecklenburg, Pomerania and Holstein, and invaded Denmark.

His devout Catholicism and negative view of Protestantism caused immediate turmoil in his non-Catholic subjects, especially in Bohemia. He did not wish to uphold the religious liberties granted by the Letter of Majesty signed by the previous emperor, Rudolph II, which had guaranteed freedom of religion to the nobles and cities. Additionally, Ferdinand as an absolutist monarch infringed several historical privileges of the nobles. Given the great number of Protestants among the ordinary population in the kingdom, and some of the nobles, the king&#x27;s unpopularity soon caused the Bohemian Revolt. The Third Defenestration of Prague of 22 May 1618 is considered the first step of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In the following events he remained a staunch backer of the Anti-Protestant Counter Reformation efforts as one of the heads of the German Catholic League. Ferdinand succeeded Matthias as Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. Supported by the Catholic League and the Kings of Spain and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Ferdinand decided to reclaim his possession in Bohemia and to quash the rebels. On 8 November 1620 his troops, led by the Flemish general Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, smashed the rebels of Frederick V, who had been elected as rival King in 1619. After Frederick&#x27;s flight to the Netherlands, Ferdinand ordered a massive effort to bring about re-conversion to Catholicism in Bohemia and Austria, causing Protestantism there to nearly disappear in the following decades, and reducing the Diet&#x27;s power.

In 1625, despite the subsidies received from Spain and the Pope, Ferdinand was in a bad financial situation. In order to muster an imperial army to continue the war, he applied to Albrecht von Wallenstein, one of the richest men in Bohemia: the latter accepted on condition that he could keep total control over the direction of the war, as well as over the booties taken during the operations. Wallenstein was able to recruit some 30,000 men (later expanded up to 100,000), with whom he was able to defeat the Protestants in Silesia, Anhalt and Denmark. In the wake of these Catholic military successes, in 1629 Ferdinand issued the Edict of Restitution, by which all the lands stripped from Catholics after the Peace of Passau of 1552 would be returned.

His military success caused the tottering Protestants to call in Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden. Soon, some of Ferdinand&#x27;s allies began to complain about the excessive power exercised by Wallenstein, as well as the ruthless methods he used to finance his vast army. Ferdinand replied by firing the Bohemian general in 1630. The leadership of the war thenceforth passed to Tilly, who was however unable to stop the Swedish march from northern Germany towards Austria. Some historians directly blame Ferdinand for the large civilian loss of life in the Sack of Magdeburg in 1631: he had instructed Tilly to enforce the edict of Restitution upon the Electorate of Saxony, his orders causing the Belgian general to move the Catholic armies east, ultimately to Leipzig, where they suffered their first substantial defeat at the hands of Adolphus&#x27; Swedes in the First Battle of Breitenfeld (1631).

Tilly died in battle in 1632. Wallenstein was recalled, being able to muster an army in only a week, and immediately staked a tactical, if not strategic, victory at the September Battle of Fürth, quickly followed by his forces expelling the Swedes from Bohemia. In November 1632, however, the Catholics were defeated in the Battle of Lützen (1632), while Gustavus Adolphus was himself killed.

A period of minor operations followed. Perhaps because of Wallenstein&#x27;s ambiguous conduct, he was assassinated in 1634. Despite Wallenstein&#x27;s fall, the imperial forces recaptured Regensburg and were victorious in the Battle of Nördlingen (1634). The Swedish army was substantially weakened, and the fear that the power of the Habsburgs would become overwhelming caused France, led by Louis XIII of France and Cardinal Richelieu, to enter the war on the Protestant side. (Louis&#x27;s father Henry IV of France had once been a Huguenot leader.) In 1635 Ferdinand signed his last important act, the Peace of Prague (1635), yet this did not end the war.

Ferdinand died in 1637, leaving to his son Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, an empire still engulfed in a war and whose fortunes seemed to be increasingly chaotic. Ferdinand II was buried in his Mausoleum in Graz. His heart was interred in the Herzgruft (heart crypt) of the Augustinian Church, Vienna.

<text>White Pine is a town in Jefferson and Hamblen counties in Tennessee, United States. It is part of the Morristown metropolitan area. The population was 2,471 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Before the settlement of the area by European settlers, the White Pine area was inhabited by an early group of Woodland Indians. The area was used by the group as a site for several large burial grounds and a trail used later by settlers of the community.
European settlers first arrived in present-day White Pine during the final years of the American Revolutionary War. The community was originally known as &quot;Dandridge Crossing&quot;, based on its proximity to the Jefferson County seat, Dandridge. After the American Civil War, a railroad route was constructed in the area, crossing a prominent stagecoach path. The town was later founded in 1870 due to the growth of the area. The town was renamed to White Pine in 1873, after a large pine tree that once stood along Main Street. Twenty years later, White Pine was officially incorporated.

In 1905, a major portion of the town&#x27;s downtown district was lost in a major fire, leading to the later dissolution of the town, In 1915, White Pine incorporated once again into a town after the completion of rebuilding efforts in the central business district. During the 19th and early 20th century, several businesses were established in the downtown area, including a medical clinic, a pharmacy, a hardware store, and a grocery store.

In 1926, White Pine High School was built in the town. It remained operational until 1976.

In 1963, construction began on Interstate 81 in White Pine. The later completion of I-81 prompted the relocation of businesses from White Pine&#x27;s central business district to along the exits of I-81.

==Geography==
White Pine is located in northeastern Jefferson County. The town limits extend north to the Hamblen County line, crossing into Hamblen County at Interstate 81 exit 8.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

It is about east of Knoxville.
The Southern and Southeastern border of White Pine runs along the Douglas Lake.

In 1838 the Bell&#x27;s detachment of the Trail of Tears traveled through Adamsville. Settlers from North Carolina and Maury County, Tennessee migrated to the area and the settlement developed an agricultural economy. When the Battle of Shiloh was fought in 1862, Union Army soldiers were camped in Adamsville. Prior to that battle, the Skirmish at Adamsville resulted in a Confederate victory.

<text>Ferdinand III (Ferdinand Ernest; 13 July 1608 – 2 April 1657) was Archduke of Austria, King of Hungary and Croatia from 1625, King of Bohemia from 1627 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1637 to his death.

Ferdinand ascended the throne at the beginning of the last decade of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and introduced lenient policies to depart from the old ideas of divine rights under his father, as he had wished to end the war quickly. After military defeats and against a background of declining power, Ferdinand was compelled to abandon the political stances of his Habsburg predecessors in many respects to open the long road towards the much-delayed peace treaty. Although his authority as emperor was weakened after the war, his position in Bohemia, Hungary and Austria was stronger than that of his predecessors before 1618.

Ferdinand was the first Habsburg monarch to be recognised as a musical composer.

==Early life==
Ferdinand was born in Graz as the third son of Emperor Ferdinand II of Habsburg and his first wife, Maria Anna of Bavaria, and was baptised as &quot;Ferdinand Ernst&quot;. He grew up in Carinthia with loving care from his parents and developed great affection for his siblings and his father with whom he always found a consensus in future disagreements. At his father&#x27;s court, he received religious and scholarly training from Jesuits. The Maltese knights Johann Jacob von Dhaun (member of the Lower Austrian estate, a union of the local nobility) and Christoph Simon von Thun (the head of Ferdinand&#x27;s Imperial court and household) had greatly influenced the education of the young archduke. Simon von Thun instructed Ferdinand in military matters. Ferdinand is said to have spoken several languages, but how many and to what degree is unclear. After the deaths of his brothers Karl (1603) and Johann Karl (1619), he was designated as his father&#x27;s successor and systematically prepared to take over the reign. Like his father, he was a devout Catholic, but he had a certain aversion to the influence of the Jesuits, who had ruled his father&#x27;s court.

Ferdinand became Archduke of Austria in 1621. On 8 December 1625, he was crowned King of Hungary, on 27 November 1627 King of Bohemia. Ferdinand enhanced his authority and set an important legal and military precedent by issuing a Revised Land Ordinance, which deprived the Bohemian estates of their right to raise soldiers and reserved that power for the monarch. His father was unable to secure him the election as king of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg of 1630. After he had unsuccessfully applied for the supreme command of the Imperial army and to participate in campaigns of Albrecht von Wallenstein, he joined Wallenstein&#x27;s opponents at the Imperial court in Vienna and was involved in the arrangements on his second deposition in early 1634.

He married the Spanish Infanta, his cousin Maria Anna of Spain, after years of negotiations with Spanish relatives in 1631. Although it was in the middle of the war, the elaborate wedding was celebrated over fourteen months. The marriage produced six children, including his successors, Ferdinand IV of Hungary and Emperor Leopold I. His loving and intelligent wife and her brother, the Spanish Cardinal Infante Ferdinand, had a great influence on Ferdinand and formed the most important link between the Habsburg courts in Madrid, Brussels and Vienna in the difficult period of the war for the Habsburgs after the death of Wallenstein.

==Commander in chief==
After Wallenstein&#x27;s assassination, Ferdinand III personally took command over the Imperial army on 2 May 1634 and was supported by the generals Matthias Gallas and Ottavio Piccolomini, the military adviser Johann Kaspar von Stadion and the political adviser &quot;Obersthofmeister&quot; (Lord Chamberlain) Maximilian von und zu Trauttmansdorff. He achieved his first major military successes in July 1634 by regaining the city of Regensburg, which had been captured and occupied by the Swedish Empire in November 1633. In August 1634, the city of Donauwörth was recaptured, which had been occupied by Sweden since April 1632. In September 1634, those successes were surpassed by the decisive victory of the Battle of Nördlingen, a joint effort with the help of the Spanish forces under Cardinal Infante Ferdinand.

As a consequence, the Swedes lost control over southern Germany and retreated to the northern Germany. Ferdinand gained a wider political influence even if his personal contribution in Nördlingen had been rather limited. His influence increased further after the fall of the powerful Imperial minister, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, who had domineered the politics of Ferdinand II.

In 1635, Ferdinand III worked as Imperial commissioner in the negotiations for the Peace of Prague, as he tried to persuade the prince electors to adopt the idea of concerted warfare. He also advocated the inclusion of the still-reluctant Protestant estates into the peace process. Even after the resignation of the supreme command, Ferdinand continued to occupy himself with theoretical military issues. Raimondo Montecuccoli later dedicated one of his works to him.

==Sovereign rule==
===Wartime reign===

Ferdinand III was elected as king of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg on 22 December 1636. Upon the death of his father on 15 February 1637, Ferdinand became emperor. His political adviser Trauttmansdorff advanced to the position of Prime Minister of Austria and chief diplomat but was replaced by Johann Ludwig von Nassau-Hadamar in 1647 because of health, which had begun to deteriorate. Trauttmansdorff was succeeded as &quot;Obersthofmeister&quot; by the later Prime Minister Johann Weikhard of Auersperg, who also taught the royal heir, Ferdinand IV. Unlike his father, Ferdinand III employed no spiritual counsellor.

When Ferdinand became emperor, vast sections of the imperial territories had been absolutely devastated by two decades of war. The population was completely exhausted and massively diminished; countless people were impoverished, disabled, sick or homeless; and many had lost their families and had abandoned all moral standards. Ferdinand did not endeavour to continue the war, but the momentum of the war, the political circumstances and his reluctance to act prevented a quick end to the war. Any hope to make early peace with France and Sweden did not materialise.

With the intervention of France in 1635, the war flared up again. After initial success and a combined Spanish-Imperial campaign into the heart of France in 1636, the military situation of the emperor sharply deteriorated. The Swedes regained initiative with victory at the Battle of Wittstock in 1636 and threatened his recently-gained allies: Brandenburg-Prussia and Saxony. Ferdinand reacted by redirecting his main army under Gallas from France to northern Germany in 1637. Gallas could contain the Swedes in Pomerania until severe lack of supplies forced him to retreat back to Bohemia in late 1638. At the same time, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, a German Protestant in French service, took the Habsburg possessions in Alsace and the stronghold of Breisach after a long siege. To check the advance of Swedish General Johan Banér, who invaded Bohemia via Saxony in 1639, Ferdinand had to recall Piccolomini&#x27;s army from the Spanish Netherlands, which largely ended direct military co-operation with Spain. Although Piccolomini and the emperor&#x27;s brother Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, as the new Imperial commander, could repel Banér back to the Weser river in 1640, the Bohemian lands now underwent continuous threat, and the emperor permanently lost control over northern Germany.

An Imperial Diet was arranged for 1641 in Regensburg, where the estates discussed possible peace arrangements. It turned out to be problematic that the Emperor had excluded princes, who had previously been on the opposing side, as well as the Protestant administrators of various princes of the Imperial Diet. However, it finally succeeded in making all imperial estates agree with the exception of the Electoral Palatinate, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Hesse-Kassel to the resolutions of the Diet. In 1641, a preliminary peace was signed in Hamburg between Ferdinand, Spain, France and Sweden, and a final peace congress was to convene in Osnabrück and Münster. An alliance between Sweden and France was fully effective since 1642. The Swedes won the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1642. One year later, France decisively defeated Spain at the Battle of Rocroi and could now dedicate more troops to the German theatre.

===Peace negotiations===

Negotiations for a peace agreement began in 1644 in Münster and Osnabrück and lasted until 1648 while the war continued.

The negotiations in Westphalia turned out to be difficult and began with a dispute over the rules of procedure. The emperor had to give in to pressure from France and Sweden and to admit all imperial estates to the congress and receive the &quot;ius belli ac pacis&quot;. In addition to peace between the parties involved, the internal constitution of the empire was also newly regulated. The Imperial Court received weekly reports on the negotiations. Even though the reports had been produced by officials, the process also proved to be an extremely busy time for the emperor since despite all of his advisers, he had to make the decisions. The study of the documents suggests that Ferdinand was a monarch with expertise with a sense of responsibility and the willingness to make difficult decisions. In the course of the negotiations, Ferdinand had to reconsider his original goals according to the deteriorating military situation. His advisor Trauttmansdorff suggested a great battle to end the war favourably.

The emperor personally took part in the campaign against the Swedes, which ended with a defeat at the Battle of Jankau on 6 March 1645. The Swedish army under Lennart Torstensson then advanced to Vienna. To raise morale in the city, the emperor circled the city in a large procession with an image of the Virgin Mary. As the Swedish army drew closer, Ferdinand left the city. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm managed to drive off the opponents. At times, Ferdinand managed to get Prince George I Rákóczi of Transylvania, an ally of France and Sweden, on his side. In the 1645 Peace of Linz, the emperor had to guarantee the Hungarian estates the right of imperial representation and freedom of religion for the Protestants, which prevented the Counter-Reformation and future absolutist rule in Hungary.

The Habsburgs could no longer win the war without the support of their Spanish allies. Domestic difficulties stopped Spanish financial and military support for Ferdinand in 1645. Without foreign military funds, the Imperial troops were incapable of offensive operations, which weakened Ferdinand&#x27;s position in negotiations. He reissued the instructions for the peace talks for Trautmannsdorf, who left for Westphalia as chief negotiator. The documents were kept strictly secret and were published only in 1962. Reviews revealed that Ferdinand had surrendered numerous previous claims and was ready for greater concessions than were ultimately necessary.

===Results of war===

The empire suffered considerable territorial losses. The Three Bishoprics, effectively under French control since 1552, were officially ceded to France. The Netherlands and Switzerland gained complete independence. Within the empire, Sweden received Rügen and Western Pomerania, as well as the bishoprics of Bremen-Verden and the city of Wismar, as Imperial fiefs. The Tyrolean cadet line of the Habsburgs lost the Sundgau and Breisach in the Upper Rhine to France, as well as supremacy over the Décapole. Further transfers of property took place in various regions of the empire. Bavaria retained its electoral dignity that it had won at the beginning of the war, a further (eighth) electoral estate being created in the Palatinate.

The implementation of the Counter-Reformation in the core countries of Ferdinand was sanctioned. Only in some parts of Silesia were certain concessions made to the Protestants. From now on, the institutions of the empire would be equally occupied by Catholics and Protestants. The imperial estates could enforce considerable rights. That included the right to form alliances with foreign powers even if they were not allowed to be directed against the emperor or the empire. The largest territories benefited most from those regulations. Ferdinand&#x27;s attempt at absolutist rule of the empire failed, but the empire and the imperial office remained significant.

The emperor considered the peace agreement to be no catastrophic defeat, and thanks to Trautmannsdorff&#x27;s negotiating skills, worse was prevented. As a matter of fact, the consequences for the Austrian hereditary lands were comparatively favourable. The expropriations in Bohemia and the &quot;Verneuerte Landesordnung&quot; (Renewed Regional Order) of 1627 remained untouched. Upper Austria, which had been pledged to Bavaria, stayed under Habsburg house rule without paying a refund.

Despite many losses, the constitutional position of the emperor after the Peace of Westphalia permitted an active imperial policy in co-operation with parts of the estates. In the Habsburg monarchy, the prerequisites for the development of a uniform absolutist state remained intact. Thus, imperial policies of the peace negotiations succeeded in that respect despite the failure to meet some of the original negotiation goals.

===Postwar===

At the Nuremberg peace congress of 1649/1650, the final withdrawal of foreign troops and the political settlement of the relationship with Sweden and France were carried out during which hostilities nearly started again.

Empress Maria Anna of Spain had died giving birth to her last child on 13 May 1646. Ferdinand remarried to another first cousin, Maria Leopoldine of Austria (1632–1649), on 2 July 1648. The wedding ceremony, held in Linz, was notably splendid. The marriage, however, lasted little more than a year and ended with Maria Leopoldine&#x27;s own premature death in childbirth.

Ferdinand&#x27;s last marriage was to Eleonora Magdalena Gonzaga of Mantua-Nevers in 1651. Empress Eleonora was very pious and donated, among other things, for the Ursuline monastery in Vienna and the Order of the Starry Cross for noble women. She was also well educated and interested in art. She also composed music and wrote poetry and, together with Ferdinand, was the centre of the Italian Academy.

Ferdinand&#x27;s sovereign power in the Austrian hereditary lands, as well his royal power in Hungary and Bohemia, was significantly greater than his predecessor&#x27;s had been before 1618. Princely power was strengthened, and the influence of the estates was massively reduced. The church reform towards the Counter-reformation continued. Ferdinand formed a standing army from the remains of the Imperial army that was soon to show great effectiveness under his successor, Leopold I. Under Ferdinand the fortifications of Vienna were massively expanded and updated, as he invested a total sum of over 80,000 fl.

Despite a considerable loss of authority in the empire, Ferdinand remained active in imperial politics. He would also re-establish his positions in the empire&#x27;s institutions. Ferdinand had the Aulic Council restructured, which competed with the Imperial Chamber Court. It had already been recognized at the Peace of Westphalia and remained in effect until 1806. In late 1652, he summoned a &quot;Reichstag&quot; in Regensburg, which lasted until 1654. The event was the last traditional imperial diet and was replaced by the future Perpetual Reichstag, with its permanent congress of emissaries. The Reichstag decided that the content of the peace treaties in Münster and Osnabrück under imperial law should become part of the imperial constitution.

The emperor managed to postpone some of the constitutional questions that were particularly dangerous for his power. The fact that some of the nobles who had been raised by his father to the rank of prince gained a seat and a vote in the Reichstag also speaks for his growing strength. At this Reichstag, he also made an alliance with Poland-Lithuania against Sweden. His empire came to Poland&#x27;s support during the Second Northern War. Ferdinand also brought about the royal election of his son Ferdinand IV, who, however, died in 1654. Because his second son, Leopold, was still too young to be elected as King of the Romans, Ferdinand delayed the opening and the conclusion of the Deputationstag after the Reichstag to gain time until the next election. Finally, Leopold was crowned King of Hungary and Bohemia. In 1656, Ferdinand sent an army into Italy to assist Spain in its struggle with France.

==Death and burial place==

Ferdinand died on 2 April 1657 and rests in the Capuchin Crypt in Vienna. His interior organs were separately buried in the Ducal Crypt.

==Marriages and children==

On 20 February 1631, Ferdinand III married his first wife, Maria Anna of Spain (1606–1646). She was the youngest daughter of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. They were first cousins, as Maria Anna&#x27;s mother was a sister of Ferdinand&#x27;s father. They were parents to six children:
* Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans (8 September 1633 9 July 1654)
* Archduchess Maria Anna &quot;Mariana&quot; of Austria (22 December 1634 16 May 1696). At the age of 14, she was married to her maternal uncle Philip IV of Spain. Their daughter Margaret Theresa of Spain married Mariana&#x27;s brother Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.
* Archduke Philip August of Austria (15 July 1637 22 June 1639)
* Archduke Maximilian Thomas of Austria (21 December 1638 29 June 1639)
* Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (9 June 1640 5 May 1705)
* Archduchess Maria of Austria (13 May 1646)

On 2 July 1648 in Linz, Ferdinand III married his second wife, Archduchess Maria Leopoldine of Austria (1632–1649). She was a daughter of Leopold V, Archduke of Austria, and Claudia de&#x27; Medici. They were first cousins as male-line grandchildren of Charles II, Archduke of Austria, and Maria Anna of Bavaria. They had a single son:
* Archduke Karl Josef of Austria (7 August 1649 27 January 1664). He was Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights from 1662 to his death.

On 30 April 1651, Ferdinand III married Eleonora Gonzaga. She was a daughter of Charles IV Gonzaga, Duke of Rethel. They were parents to four children:
* Archduchess Theresia Maria Josefa of Austria (27 March 1652 26 July 1653)
* Archduchess Eleonora Maria of Austria (21 May 1653 17 December 1697); married first Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki, King of Poland, and then Charles Léopold, Duke of Lorraine.
* Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha of Austria (30 December 1654 4 April 1689); married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine.
* Archduke Ferdinand Josef Alois of Austria (11 February 1657 16 June 1658)

==Music==
Ferdinand III was a well-known patron of music and a composer. He studied music under Giovanni Valentini, who bequeathed his musical works to him, and had close ties with Johann Jakob Froberger, one of the most important keyboard composers of the 17th century. Froberger lamented the emperor&#x27;s death and dedicated to him one of his most celebrated works, &quot;Lamentation faite sur la mort très douloureuse de Sa Majesté Impériale, Ferdinand le troisième&quot;; a tombeau for Ferdinand III&#x27;s death was composed by the violinist Johann Heinrich Schmelzer. Some of Ferdinand&#x27;s own compositions survive in manuscripts: masses, motets, hymns and other sacred music, as well as a few secular pieces. His &quot;Drama musicum&quot; was praised by Athanasius Kircher, and the extant works, although clearly influenced by Valentini, show a composer with an individual style and a solid technique.

Recordings of Ferdinand&#x27;s compositions include:
:&quot;Jesu Redemptor Omnium. Deus Tuorum. Humanae Salutis&quot;. With Schmelzer: &quot;Lamento Sopra La Morte de Ferdinand III.&quot; Joseph I: Regina Coeli. Leopold I: Sonata Piena; Laudate Pueri. Wiener Akademie, dir. Martin Haselböck, CPO 1997.
:Ferdinand III: Hymnus &quot;Jesu Corona Virginum&quot;. On &quot;Musik für Gamben-Consort&quot;. Klaus Mertens, Hamburger Ratsmusik, dir. Simone Eckert CPO 2010

<text>Kingsport is a city in Sullivan and Hawkins counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2020 census, its population was 55,442. Lying along the Holston River, Kingsport is commonly included in what is known as the Mountain Empire, which spans a portion of southwest Virginia and the mountainous counties in northeastern Tennessee. It is the largest city in the Kingsport–Bristol metropolitan area, which had a population of 307,613 in 2020. The metro area is a component of the larger Tri-Cities region of Tennessee and Virginia, with a population of 508,260 in 2020.

The name &quot;Kingsport&quot; is a simplification of &quot;King&#x27;s Port&quot;, originally referring to the area on the Holston River known as King&#x27;s Boat Yard, the head of navigation for the Tennessee Valley.

==History==

Kingsport was developed after the Revolutionary War, at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Holston River. In 1787 it was known as &quot;Salt Lick&quot; for an ancient mineral lick. It was first settled along the banks of the South Fork, about a mile from the confluence. The Long Island of the Holston River is near the confluence, which is mostly within the present-day corporate boundaries of Kingsport. The island was an important site for the Cherokee, colonial pioneers and early settlers, and specifically mentioned in the 1770 Treaty of Lochaber.

Early settlements at the site were used as a staging ground for other pioneers who were traveling overland on the Wilderness Road leading to Kentucky through the Cumberland Gap. First chartered in 1822, Kingsport became an important shipping port on the Holston River. Goods originating for many miles around from the surrounding countryside were loaded onto barges for the journey downriver to the Tennessee River at Knoxville.

In the Battle of Kingsport (December 13, 1864) during the Civil War, a force of 300 Confederates under Colonel Richard Morgan stopped a larger Union force for nearly two days. An army of over 5,500 troops under command of Major General George Stoneman had left Knoxville to raid Confederate targets in Virginia: the salt works at Saltville, the lead works at Wytheville, and the iron works in Marion. While Col. Morgan&#x27;s small band held off a main Union force under Major General Cullem Gillem on the opposite side the Holston River, Union Col. Samuel Patton took a force of cavalry to a ford in the river north and came down behind the Confederates. Out-numbered, out-flanked, and demoralised by the bitter winter weather, Col. Morgan surrendered. The Confederates suffered 18 dead, and 84 prisoners of war were sent to a Union prison in Knoxville.

The city lost its charter after a downturn in its fortunes precipitated by the Civil War.

On September 12, 1916, Kingsport residents demanded the death of circus elephant Mary (an Asian elephant that performed in the Sparks World-famous Shows Circus). She had killed city hotel worker Walter Eldridge, who was hired by the circus the day before as an assistant elephant trainer. Eldridge was attacked and killed by the elephant while he was leading her to a pond. The elephant was impounded by the local sheriff. Leaders of several nearby towns threatened to prevent the circus from performing if it included the elephant. The circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the situation was to hold a public execution. On the following day, she was transported by rail to Erwin, Tennessee, where a crowd of over 2,500 people assembled in the Clinchfield Railroad yard to watch her hang from a railroad crane.

Re-chartered in 1917, Kingsport was an early example of a &quot;garden city&quot;. Part of it was designed by city planner and landscape architect John Nolen of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was nicknamed as the &quot;Model City&quot; from this plan, which organized the town into areas for commerce, churches, housing and industry. Most of the land on the river was devoted to industry. Most of the Long Island is now occupied by Eastman Chemical Company, which is headquartered in Kingsport. As part of this plan, Kingsport built some of the earliest traffic circles (roundabouts) in the United States.

Into the 1950s, two important public works projects were constructed: the Boone Dam and the Fort Patrick Henry Dam, hydroelectric dams built along the South Fork Holston River. Kingsport was among the first municipalities to adopt a city manager form of government, to professionalize operations of city departments. It developed its school system based on a model promoted by Columbia University. Pal&#x27;s Sudden Service, a regional fast-food restaurant chain, opened its first location in 1956 and is headquartered in Kingsport. In 2001, Pal&#x27;s Sudden Service, won the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, becoming the first restaurant company to receive the award.

==Sports==
The city is home to the Kingsport Axmen, a collegiate summer baseball team of the Appalachian League. The nickname is in reference to frontiersman Daniel Boone, who began the Wilderness Road in Kingsport. The Axmen play their home games at Hunter Wright Stadium, which is named after former mayor Hunter Wright.

Professional baseball was first played in Kingsport, by the Kingsport Indians in the Appalachian League from 1921 to 1925. The team went dormant for 12 years before it returned to the circuit as the Kingsport Cherokees from 1938 to 1955—with the exception of the 1942 season as the Kingsport Dodgers and as members of the Mountain States League in 1953 and 1954. The club was later known as the Kingsport Orioles (1957), Kingsport Pirates (1960–1963), Kingsport Royals (1969–1973), and Kingsport Braves (1974–1979). The Kingsport Mets were members of the Appy League from 1980 to 2020, except for the 1983 season when the New York Mets temporarily relocated the team to Sarasota, Florida, as the Gulf Coast League Mets, while their home ballpark was being renovated.

Kingsport uses the council-manager system, which was established in 1917 when the city was re-chartered. Kingsport is governed locally by a seven-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen. The citizens elect the mayor to a two-year term and the six aldermen to four-year terms. The elections take place in odd-numbered years, with the mayor and three aldermen elected every two years. New terms begin on July 1. The board elects a vice mayor from among the six aldermen. The council or board then hires a professional city manager.

<doc id="151090" wikidata="Q1397087" url="?curid=151090" title="Farragut, Tennessee">
<text>Farragut is a suburban town located in Knox and Loudon counties in the State of Tennessee, United States. The town&#x27;s population was 23,506 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Knoxville Metropolitan Area. The town is named in honor of Union Admiral David Farragut, who was born just east of Farragut at Campbell&#x27;s Station in 1801, and fought in the American Civil War.

==History==
The area was originally known as Campbell&#x27;s Station after a fort and stage coach station erected by Captain David Campbell (1753–1832) in 1787. The brick Campbell&#x27;s Station Inn was built in 1810 and still stands on Kingston Pike within sight of the Farragut Town Hall. The Civil War Battle of Campbell&#x27;s Station was fought there on November 16, 1863.

The historic unincorporated village of Concord (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) was founded in 1854 just east of what would become the eastern boundary of Farragut. Concord is located on the main rail line to Atlanta and main channel of the Tennessee River, and was an important transloading center for the Tennessee marble industry in the late 19th century. Picturesque buildings, antebellum homes as well as several very old churches sit along the river.

The original Farragut High School was built by the community in 1904, and moved to its current location in 1976. Some parts of Farragut are zoned for Hardin Valley Academy in the neighboring suburb of Hardin Valley, built in 2008.

In early December 1979, the Knoxville City Council would vote to annex right-of-way acreage of I-40 in the Farragut area, prompting community residents to petition an incorporation election. On January 16, 1980, Farragut would vote to incorporate as a town preventing further annexation by Knoxville, which was trying to shore up its tax base by annexing affluent communities along Kingston Pike. The effort was led by a group of citizens who called themselves the Farragut Community Group. The first mayor, Bob Leonard, was elected April 1, 1980, along with four aldermen. Alderman Eddy Ford became mayor in 1993 and served in that position until April 2009, when he failed to win re-election, losing to Dr. Ralph McGill, another of the original founders of the town government.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 16.2 square miles (42.1 km2), of which 16.1 square miles (41.7 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (1.05%) is water.

The town of Farragut is bound to the north by I-40/75, except at Campbell&#x27;s Station Road, Snyder Road, and the Outlets Drive area; to the south by Turkey Creek Road and the Norfolk Southern Railroad line; to the west at the Loudon County line; and to the east by Lovell Road (on the north side of Kingston Pike and Thornton Heights) and Concord Hills subdivisions (on the south side of Kingston Pike).

Farragut is situated in a hilly area between Blackoak Ridge to the north and the Tennessee River (Fort Loudoun Lake) to the south. Its municipal area is mostly located south of the merged Interstate 40 (I-40)/I-75, with the exception of a few neighborhoods. Kingston Pike, a merged stretch of U.S. Route 70 (US 70) and US 11, traverses the town. Concord lies immediately southeast of Farragut, and Hardin Valley lies opposite Blackoak Ridge to the north. The unincorporated community of Dixie Lee Junction lies along Kingston Pike, just across the Loudon County line.

<text>Iron City is a census-designated place and former city in Lawrence and Wayne counties, Tennessee. 

Iron City was incorporated as a city from 1887 to 1901, and again from 1962 until 2010, its residents voting to disincorporate in the latter year.

The United States Census bureau treated the community as a Census-designated place for both the 2010 and 2020 census. It had a population of 328 in 2010 and 274 in 2020.

==History==
Iron City gets its name from an iron foundry that operated in its vicinity in the late 19th century. While iron ore was mined in southwestern Lawrence County as early as the 1830s, the industry really began to thrive in 1886, when a branch railroad line to the area was completed. Iron City incorporated the following year. At its height, Iron City supported a population of about 1,000, and included two hotels and two banks.

==Geography==
Iron City is situated in the Shoal Creek Valley, north of the Tennessee-Alabama state line. Iron City is surrounded by rugged hills on the north, south, and west, and by the creek on the east.

State Route 227 passes east-to-west through Iron City, connecting it to St. Joseph across the hills to the east and State Route 13 south of Collinwood to the west. State Route 242, which intersects SR 227 in Iron City, connects the community with Westpoint and Lawrenceburg to the northeast. Poplar Street/Pruitton Road connects Iron City with Lauderdale County, Alabama, to the south, becoming County Road 61 at the state line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.9 square miles (2.4 km2), all land.

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.2 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $20,625, and the median income for a family was $28,889. Males had a median income of $20,729 versus $15,500 for females.

<doc id="151093" wikidata="Q1495814" url="?curid=151093" title="Spring Hill, Tennessee">
<text>Spring Hill is a city in Maury and Williamson counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee, located approximately south of Nashville. Its population as of 2022 is 55,800. Spring Hill is recognized as the 4th fastest growing city in Tennessee by the U.S. Census Bureau and is included in the Nashville metropolitan area.

==History==
The first settlers of Spring Hill arrived in 1808 and the city was established in 1809. Albert Russell was the first person to build a home on the land that became Spring Hill.

Spring Hill was the site of a Civil War battle, now known as the Battle of Spring Hill, on November 29, 1864.

Later, Spring Hill was the home of a preparatory school, Branham and Hughes Military Academy, the campus of which now serves as the main campus of Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home, a ministry associated with the Churches of Christ.

On January 10, 1963, an F3 tornado tore through the center of the town, damaging many buildings and causing $500,000 in damage.

===Recent growth===
As the Nashville metro area continues to grow, Spring Hill has seen rapid growth in recent years with a population of 23,462 in 2007, a 2010 census population of 29,036 and a population of 31,140 in 2012. In 2018, Spring Hill officially hit 40,000 residents.

In November 2015, the Spring Hill Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved the ‘Spring Hill Rising: 2040’ comprehensive plan. The plan outlines the city&#x27;s long-term development vision and ways to accomplish that vision. In 2016, the city hired Chicago-based planning and zoning consultant, Camiros Ltd, to oversee the creation of a new zoning code to implement the vision described in ‘Spring Hill Rising: 2040’.

On December 4, 2017, entities building a Chick-fil-A tore down a grain silo. A memorial plaque to the silo opened in 2018. The silo had no major recorded history but was perceived by the town community as a landmark that signaled the beginning of the town. The idea of the memorial was originally posited as a joke but became serious.

About 2.8% of families and 3.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.4% of those under the age of 18 and 2.9% of those age 65 and over.

==Economy==
Spring Hill was the site of the Saturn Corporation production facility, which operated from 1990 to 2007. The Saturn S-Series, Saturn ION, and Saturn VUE were produced there. In 2007, General Motors Corporation (GM), the parent company of Saturn, shut down the facility to retool it for production of other GM vehicles and renamed it Spring Hill Manufacturing. The plant reopened in February 2008 and became the assembly point for the new Chevrolet Traverse. However, after a battle among plants in Spring Hill, Orion Township, Michigan and Janesville, Wisconsin, GM announced on June 26, 2009, that they had chosen to build a new small car in Orion Township. Nearly 2,500 Spring Hill auto workers were faced with lay-off, buy-out and early retirement. The vehicle assembly part of the Spring Hill plant was idled in late 2009 when production of the Traverse was moved to Lansing, Michigan, while production of power trains and metal stamping continued. In November 2011, GM announced plans for retooling of the vehicle assembly portion of the plant for use as an &quot;ultra-flexible&quot; plant which will initially be used to build the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain but will be designed for rapid retooling to other vehicles of similar size. In April 2021 General Motors and South Korean joint-venture partner LG Energy Solutions stated they would build a second Ultium Cells battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, having revealed plans for a $2.3 billion plant that is operating as of March 2024.

Spring Hill has gone through rapid development and growth in recent years, causing General Motors to reopen their auto plant and begin hiring locally again, which will hire 1,000 new people. In addition, companies such as Ryder and Goodwill have announced new facilities in the Spring Hill area.

==Government==
Spring Hill is run by a mayor elected at-large and a board of eight aldermen.

==Education==
The city is served by both Maury County Public Schools and the Williamson County School District, depending on which county one is located in.

==Infrastructure==
Interstate 65 passes through the eastern part of the city. Two exits are within Spring Hill city limits. Exit 53 serves Tennessee State Route 396. Exit 55, at June Lake Blvd, opened on May 31, 2024, and serves the northern part of the city and Southern Williamson County. State Route 396, known locally as Saturn Parkway, provides an east–west freeway connection into the city with two exits before terminating at Beechcroft Road near the GM plant. U.S. Route 31 is the main north–south arterial through Spring Hill. It is alternatively called both Columbia Pike on the south side of town and Nashville Highway on the north side. State Route 247 is a major east–west road through the city.

==Arts and culture==
Rippavilla Plantation, which is located at 5700 Main Street (US 31, Nashville Highway), offers educational activities and an annual corn maze among other attractions. The historic Battle of Spring Hill site is located off Kedron Road and is open for self-guided tours year round.

Some scenes from the 1986 movie At Close Range, starring Sean Penn, Christopher Walken, and Kiefer Sutherland, were filmed in Spring Hill.

<doc id="151094" wikidata="Q150665" url="?curid=151094" title="Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Charles VI (; ; 1 October 1685 – 20 October 1740) was Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy from 1711 until his death, succeeding his elder brother, Joseph I. He unsuccessfully claimed the throne of Spain following the death of his relative, Charles II. In 1708, he married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, by whom he had his four children: Leopold Johann (who died in infancy), Maria Theresa, Maria Anna (Governess of the Austrian Netherlands), and Maria Amalia (who also died in infancy).

Four years before the birth of Maria Theresa, faced with his lack of male heirs, Charles provided for a male-line succession failure with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. The Emperor favoured his own daughters over those of his elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, in the succession, ignoring the Mutual Pact of Succession he had signed during the reign of his father, Leopold I. Charles sought the other European powers&#x27; approval. They demanded significant terms, among which were that Austria close the Ostend Company. In total, the states of Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, the Dutch Republic, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark, Savoy-Sardinia, and Bavaria, plus the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire, recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria, and Prussia later reneged. Charles died in 1740, sparking the War of the Austrian Succession, which plagued his successor, Maria Theresa, for eight years.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Archduke Charles (baptized &quot;Carolus Franciscus Josephus Wenceslaus Balthasar Johannes Antonius Ignatius&quot;), the second son of the Emperor Leopold I and of his third wife, Princess Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg, was born on 1 October 1685.

Following the death of Charles II of Spain, in 1700, without any direct heir, Charles declared himself King of Spain—both were members of the House of Habsburg. The ensuing War of the Spanish Succession, which pitted France&#x27;s candidate, Philip, Duke of Anjou, Louis XIV of France&#x27;s grandson, against Austria&#x27;s Charles, lasted for almost 14 years. The kingdoms of Portugal, England, Scotland, Ireland and the majority of the Holy Roman Empire endorsed Charles&#x27;s candidature. He also received support in the Crown of Aragon, but not the Crown of Castile, which favoured Philip. Charles III, as he was known, disembarked in his kingdom in 1705, and stayed there for six years, only being able to exercise his rule in Catalonia, until the death of his brother, Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor; he returned to Vienna to assume the imperial crown.

Not wanting to see Austria and Spain in personal union again, the new Kingdom of Great Britain withdrew its support from the Austrian coalition, and the war culminated with the Treaties of Utrecht, Rastatt and Baden three years later. The former, ratified in 1713, recognised Philip as King of Spain; however, the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of Milan, the Austrian Netherlands and the Kingdom of Sardinia—all previously possessions of the Spanish—were ceded to Austria. To prevent a union of Spain and France, Philip was forced to renounce his right to succeed his grandfather&#x27;s throne. Charles was extremely discontented at the loss of Spain, and as a result, he mimicked the staid Spanish Habsburg court ceremonial, adopting the dress of a Spanish monarch, which, according to British historian Edward Crankshaw, consisted of &quot;a black doublet and hose, black shoes and scarlet stockings&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s father and his advisors went about arranging a marriage for him. Their eyes fell upon Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, the eldest child of Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. She was held to be strikingly beautiful by her contemporaries.

===Succession to the Habsburg dominions===

When Charles succeeded his brother in 1711, he was the last male Habsburg heir in the direct line. Since Habsburg possessions were subject to Salic law, barring women from inheriting in their own right, his own lack of a male heir meant they would be divided on his death. The Pragmatic Sanction of 19 April 1713 abolished male-only succession in all Habsburg realms and declared their lands indivisible, although the Diet of Hungary only approved it in 1723.

Charles had three daughters, Maria Theresa (1717–1780), Maria Anna (1718–1744) and Maria Amalia (1724–1730) but no surviving sons. When Maria Theresa was born, he disinherited his nieces who were the daughters of his elder brother Joseph, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia. It was this act that undermined the chances of a smooth succession as set out in a Pact arranged by his father, and obliged Charles to spend the rest of his reign seeking to ensure enforcement of the sanction from other European powers.
Charles agreed to a demand from Britain that he close a trading company, the Ostend Company, which was based in the Austrian Netherlands and that he himself founded in 1722. Other signatories included Britain, France, the Dutch Republic, Spain, Russia, Denmark-Norway and Savoy-Sardinia, but subsequent events underlined Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s comment that the best guarantee was a powerful army and full treasury. Charles&#x27;s nieces were married to the rulers of Saxony and Bavaria, both of whom ultimately refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet. France, despite publicly agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735, signed a secret treaty with Bavaria in 1738 promising to back the &#x27;just claims&#x27; of Charles Albert of Bavaria.

In the first part of his reign, the Habsburg monarchy continued to expand thanks to the success in the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), adding Banat to Hungary and establishing direct Austrian rule over Serbia and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). This extended Austrian rule to the lower Danube.
The War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720) followed. It too ended in an Austrian victory; by the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Charles swapped Sardinia, which went to the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, for Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, which was harder to defend than Sardinia. The treaty also recognised Philip V of Spain&#x27;s younger son, Don Carlos (the future Charles III of Spain) as heir to the Duchy of Parma and Grand Duchy of Tuscany; Charles had previously endorsed the succession of the incumbent Grand Duke&#x27;s daughter, Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine.

Peace in Europe was shattered by the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738), a dispute over the throne of Poland between Augustus of Saxony, the previous king&#x27;s elder son, and Stanisław Leszczyński. Austria supported the former, France the latter; thus, a war broke out. By the Treaty of Vienna (1738), Augustus ascended the throne, but Charles had to give the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to Don Carlos, in exchange for the much smaller Duchy of Parma and Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The question of Charles&#x27;s elder daughter&#x27;s marriage was raised early in her childhood. She was first betrothed to Léopold Clément of Lorraine, who was supposed to come to Vienna and meet Maria Theresa. Instead, he died of smallpox in 1723, which upset Maria Theresa. Léopold Clément&#x27;s younger brother, Francis Stephen, then came to Vienna to replace him. Charles considered other possibilities (such as Don Carlos) before announcing the engagement to Francis. At the end of the War of the Polish Succession, France demanded that Francis surrender the Duchy of Lorraine (his hereditary domain), to Stanisław Leszczyński, the deposed king of Poland, who would bequeath it to France at his death. Charles compelled Francis to renounce his rights to Lorraine and told him: &quot;No renunciation, no archduchess.&quot;

Charles had a number of sexual relationships with male courtiers, including his Master of the Horse, Prince Schwarzenberg, and a hunter&#x27;s boy. The love of his life was Michael Joseph, Count Althann, a groom of the bedchamber, whom he called &quot;my only heart, my comfort...my soul mate&quot;, and with whom he slept regularly. Althann&#x27;s death in 1722, after a relationship of nineteen years, devastated him.

In 1737, the Emperor embarked on another Turkish War, in alliance with Russia. Its start was promising. Already in the autumn of the same year, imperial troops took Niš and tried to consolidate gains in 1738, but during the next year Habsburg armies suffered several defeats. By the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), emperor Charles had to cede several regions to the sultan, including Bosnian section of Posavina, central regions of Serbia, and Wallachia Minor (Oltenia). Popular discontent at the costly war reigned in Vienna; Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, was dubbed a French spy by the Viennese.

===Religious policies===
As a devout Catholic, emperor Charles supported the reestablishment of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical structures in various regions that were liberated from the Ottoman rule and incorporated into the Habsburg Monarchy by the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718). In the same time, several questions related to the rights and liberties of other Christian denominations were regulated. In the Kingdom of Hungary, significant portion of both nobility and people belonged to the Reformed Church (Calvinists), while eastern and southern regions were also inhabited by Eastern Orthodox Christians, mainly Serbs and Romanians. On several occasions, emperor Charles issued confirmations of old privileges that were granted to Eastern Orthodox subjects by previous Habsburg monarchs (emperors Leopold I and Joseph I), and in 1732 an official collection of those documents was published. 

===Death and legacy===
The Emperor, after a hunting trip across the Hungarian border in &quot;a typical day in the wettest and coldest October in memory&quot;, fell seriously ill at the Favorita Palace, Vienna, and he died on 20 October 1740 in the Hofburg. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot; Voltaire wrote that Charles died after consuming a meal of death cap mushrooms. Charles&#x27;s life opus, the Pragmatic Sanction, was ultimately in vain. Maria Theresa was forced to resort to arms to defend her inheritance from the coalition of Prussia, Bavaria, France, Spain, Saxony and Poland—all party to the sanction—who assaulted the Austrian frontier weeks after her father&#x27;s death. During the ensuing War of the Austrian Succession, Maria Theresa saved her crown and most of her territory but lost the mineral-rich Duchy of Silesia to Prussia and the Duchy of Parma to Spain.

At the time of Charles&#x27;s death, the Habsburg lands were saturated in debt; the exchequer contained a mere 100,000 florins; and desertion was rife in Austria&#x27;s sporadic army, spread across the Empire in small, ineffective barracks. Contemporaries expected that Hungary would wrench itself from the Habsburg yoke upon his death.

Emperor Charles VI has been the main motif of many collectors&#x27; coins and medals. One of the most recent samples is high-value collectors&#x27; coin the Austrian Göttweig Abbey commemorative coin, minted on 11 October 2006. His portrait can be seen in the foreground of the reverse of the coin.

<text>Lynchburg is a city in the south-central region of the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is governed by a consolidated city-county government unit whose boundaries coincide with those of Moore County. Lynchburg is best known as the location of Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery, whose famous Tennessee whiskey is marketed worldwide as the product of a city with only one traffic light. Despite the operational distillery, which is a major tourist attraction, Lynchburg&#x27;s home county of Moore is a dry county. Sampling whiskey is permitted in the distillery, however. The population was 6,461 at the 2020 census.

Lynchburg is part of the Tullahoma–Manchester micropolitan area.

The downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Lynchburg Historic District.

==History==
Settlers first arrived in the Lynchburg area around 1801. Main Street was originally the main road, and roughly followed the route of East Fork Mulberry Creek. Residences were generally located in the western half of Lynchburg, while industries were situated along the creek in the eastern half. One early settler, Thomas Roundtree, established a cotton mill along the creek in the vicinity of the modern Jack Daniel&#x27;s Distillery. By the 1830s, another settler, William P. Long, was operating a gristmill and cotton gin. Early Lynchburg was also home to a large tannery.

The origin of the city&#x27;s name is unclear. An article in an 1876 issue of the &quot;Lynchburg Sentinel&quot; suggests an early settler named the city after his native Lynchburg, Virginia. The &quot;WPA Guide to Tennessee&quot; (1939) states the city was named after an early resident named Tom Lynch. An article by Jeanne Ridgway Bigger in the spring 1972 issue of the &quot;Tennessee Historical Quarterly&quot; states that the city was named after a &quot;Judge Lynch&quot;, who presided over a vigilante committee that met in the city sometime after the War of 1812.

During the Civil War, residents of Lynchburg generally supported the Confederacy. Company E of the Confederate Army&#x27;s 1st Tennessee Cavalry consisted primarily of Lynchburg residents. A monument to the area&#x27;s Confederate soldiers stands on the lawn of the Moore County Courthouse.

In 1871, Moore County was created from parts of Lincoln, Bedford, Coffee, and Franklin counties (Lynchburg had been part of Lincoln). In June 1873, Lynchburg was chosen as the county seat of Moore, due in part to its central location within the new county&#x27;s boundaries. The county commissioners established a courthouse square along Main Street, the pattern of which was influenced by the square in nearby Shelbyville. Two schools, the Lynchburg Male and Female Institute and the Lynchburg Normal School, were established during this period, and several church congregations built elaborate new churches.

During the 1870s, Lynchburg was situated at the center of an agrarian economic triangle consisting of Tullahoma to the northeast, Shelbyville to the northwest, and Fayetteville to the south. As such, the city developed into an important mule trading center. The city also had a rising number of distilleries. By the 1880s, fifteen registered distilleries were operating in Moore County, with the most productive being Tom Eaton&#x27;s Distillery, and the second-most productive being the now-famous Jack Daniel&#x27;s. The distilleries provided a convenient market for local corn growers, and the leftover corn slop (after the alcohol was extracted) was used as feed for hogs and cattle.

On December 4, 1883, a fire destroyed nearly half of Lynchburg, including the courthouse and much of the courthouse square. A new courthouse (the present building) was completed in 1885. A separate jail (now a museum) was erected across the street in 1893. The rise of automobile traffic and the establishment of a state highway system in the early 20th century led to a commercial boom in Lynchburg, and many of the buildings on the courthouse square were built during this period. By 1920, Lynchburg had several schools and churches, a weekly newspaper, two banks, and several &quot;flourishing business establishments&quot;.

The passage of a state law barring the manufacture of liquor in 1909 effectively shut down the city&#x27;s distilleries. Although prohibition was repealed at the federal level in 1933, it remained in effect in Tennessee. Lem Motlow (1869–1947), a state senator and nephew of Jack Daniel, led efforts to repeal the state&#x27;s prohibition laws. In 1937, the state repealed the law barring the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, and Motlow reopened the Jack Daniel&#x27;s Distillery. In 1939, the state passed a &quot;local option&quot; law, allowing each county to choose (via referendum) whether or not to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages.

Motlow State Community College opened its campus in 1969 on 187 acres of land donated by Reagor Motlow and family in the northern part of Moore County in what is today part of Lynchburg.

==History==

===East Tennessee Land Company===

Harriman was founded as a Temperance Town in 1889 by temperance movement activists led by New York-born minister and plant manager Frederick Gates. Seeking a land venture that could attract industrial and economic development while avoiding the vice-driven pitfalls of late 19th century company towns, Gates and fellow prohibitionists chartered the East Tennessee Land Company in May 1889. In subsequent months, the company acquired several hundred thousand acres of land around what is now Harriman, including the plantation of Union Army colonel and state senator, Robert K. Byrd. The company&#x27;s early investors included 1888 Prohibition Party presidential candidate General Clinton B. Fisk, who served as the company&#x27;s first president, Quaker Oats co-founder Ferdinand Schumacher, and publishers Isaac K. Funk and A. W. Wagnalls.

The East Tennessee Land Company&#x27;s plan was to purchase land, build a town based on prohibitionist and other reform movement principles, and establish subsidiary companies to attract industry. After a successful land auction in Harriman in 1890, the company established three subsidiaries: the East Tennessee Mining Company to administer the region&#x27;s coal and iron extraction operations, the Harriman Coal &amp; Iron Railroad Company to develop the local railroad system, and the Harriman Manufacturing Company to attract industries by providing start-up capital. To project its prosperity and advertise Harriman, the company built an imposing brick headquarters (now Harriman City Hall), with its four picturesque Norman towers, at the corner of Walden Avenue and Roane Street near the center of the new town. By 1892, several rolling mills, factories, and other businesses had relocated to Harriman.

To help finance its early operations, the East Tennessee Land Company borrowed just over one million dollars from the Central Trust Company of New York. In late 1891, capital markets in the U.S. began to freeze, leading to the Panic of 1893. The East Tennessee Land Company, unable to pay the interest on its million-dollar loan, attempted a last-ditch stock sale to raise money to pay off the loan, but the sale failed. In November 1893, the company was forced into bankruptcy.

===Development of Harriman===
Harriman is named for Walter Harriman, a governor of New Hampshire whose son, Walter C. Harriman, was managing director of the East Tennessee Land Company. As a colonel (later general) in the Union Army during the Civil War, he had traveled on foot through the area with his 11th New Hampshire Regiment and camped for several days on the Emory River near the future site of the city. An elderly local later told the directors that Harriman had said that the site would be the perfect place for a town, and based on this conversation, the directors chose the name of &quot;Harriman&quot;.

The site of Harriman was chosen primarily for its proximity to Emory Gap, where the Cincinnati Southern Railway joined the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway. The city, platted on Christmas Day in 1889, was laid out in a grid pattern that conformed to the Emory&#x27;s oxbow bend at the base of Walden Ridge. The block bounded by Roane, Walden, Morgan, and Clinton streets was set aside for the city&#x27;s public buildings (this block is now the location of the city hall, library, and fire department). Lots in the heights around Cumberland and Clinton streets (now Cornstalk Heights) were substantially larger, as it was expected that the city&#x27;s wealthy and professional-class residents would buy homes here. The areas along the river (Emory Street) were for mills and residential areas for skilled laborers.

The initial land auction for Harriman was held in late February 1890, and was attended by over 4,000 prospective buyers from across the nation. Several hundred lots were sold, raising over $600,000. The most expensive lots were along Roane Street and in what is now Cornstalk Heights, most of which sold for over $2,000 apiece, while the lots closer to the river typically sold for less than $500 apiece. Shortly after the initial auction, the company platted several more lots outside the city in what is now the Walnut Hills and Oak View neighborhoods for the city&#x27;s wage workers.

===20th century===
In spite of the East Tennessee Land Company&#x27;s collapse, Harriman continued to grow, although its growth was very gradual. The American Temperance University was established in 1894, and operated out of the East Tennessee Land Company&#x27;s abandoned headquarters. In 1929, the combination of the stock market crash and a devastating flood of the Emory River wiped out much of the city&#x27;s industry. A paper mill and two hosiery mills provided the largest share of jobs in the city through the rest of the twentieth century, with the paper mill (a Mead Corporation property) and the hosiery companies (Harriman Hosiery, formerly a Burlington Corp. plant, and independent Roane Hosiery) operating into the 1980s.

The city got a boost in the 1940s and 1950s from heavy automobile traffic along US-27, which was a primary route connecting the Great Lakes region with Florida before I-75 was completed. The routing of Interstate 40 through southwestern Harriman connected the community more closely with Knoxville but never produced the kind of modern industrial development inside the town that community leaders expected.

The city, still quaint but clearly different now from its economic heyday, still shows considerable evidence of being a &quot;planned community&quot;. Its streets still remain in its original grid pattern, as the collapse of the East Tennessee Land Company in 1893 &quot;froze&quot; the city in its original developmental state. There remains a considerable number of homes—especially in Cornstalk Heights—displaying Victorian architecture as well—many of which have been either painstakingly maintained or restored. The Temperance heritage was slow to depart. There was no liquor store in Harriman until 1992.

==Education==
Harriman was home to American Temperance University from 1893 until 1908.

<text>White House is a city in Robertson and Sumner counties in the United States state of Tennessee. The population was listed as 12,982 in the 2020 census. It is approximately twenty-two miles north of downtown Nashville.

==History==

===Settlers===
The area that is now White House was purchased around 1828 by Richard Stone Wilks, a settler from Virginia. A trail running from Kentucky to Nashville, originally created by Native Americans, cut through the area. This trail was originally known as the Louisville &amp; Nashville Turnpike during the mid-19th century. In 1928, the trail was renamed US Highway 31W.

===Naming the town===
In the mid-19th century, the Carter, Thomas, and Hough Stagecoach Company traveled the L&amp;N Turnpike carrying passengers. A typical stop along the way was a white, two-story house built by Wilks in 1829. The house was a popular stop for lodging, food, and changing out horses. President Andrew Jackson was even heard to have stayed here during his travels between his home and the White House. During this time, houses were rarely painted white, particularly in this underdeveloped area. The stage coach drivers began to call this stop and the surrounding area White House.

===Original White House torn down, building replaced===
The monument for which the town was named was torn down in 1951 to make way for new development. However, in 1986, the community erected a replica of the original building. The reproduction, called the White House Inn Library and Museum, currently sits in the center of town next to the Fire Department. It contains the library, a museum with artifacts from the area&#x27;s early years, and the city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce. In 2015, the replica White House Inn Library and Museum was turned solely into a museum and Chamber of Commerce after the city built a new library.

===Growth and development===
White House was incorporated in 1971. Currently, the young town is experiencing population growth, economic progress, and community development, with many apartment projects and subdivisions planned for the area. There are over 800 homes planned for the area, and at least 5 apartment subdivisions are planned for the city. The city is located north of Nashville within the greater Nashville region, and is anticipated to grow rapidly in the future as a suburb of Nashville.

<text>Lytle is a city in Atascosa, Bexar, and Medina counties in Texas, United States. The population was 2,914 at the 2020 census. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Lytle grew out of 321 acres located around the head of Atascosa Creek, patented to Henry Volkner in 1856. Volkner was the assignee of Mahan Matter, and the patent was signed by Elisha M. Pease, Governor of Texas. In 1870, Volkner sold the 321 acres for $175 to Fitch S. Adams. Lytle&#x27;s first school was built on Adams&#x27; property with a verbal agreement that as long as the school building was there, the land it stood would belong to the school.

In 1881, officials from the International–Great Northern Railroad made an agreement with B. G. Andrews in which he was to give land for a new station (&quot;Andrews Station&quot;). There was some misunderstanding in making the deed, and the dispute ended with Mr. Andrews refusing to submit the property deed. Traildriver and cattleman Captain John Thomas Lytle (1844–1907) then secured land some three miles southwest of Andrews Station, and one morning in 1882 railroad employees loaded Andrews Station on two flat cars, and moved it to the present site near the Lytle-McDaniel Ranch, which became known as Lytle or Lytle Station. When a post office was granted in 1883, the town also consisted of a general store, a bar, and a casketmaker named W. J. Garnand, who also became the first postmaster. An undated newspaper clipping entitled &quot;Pioneer of Lytle&quot; reads, &quot;...W. J. Garnand was the first man to locate in the town of Lytle. That was in 1883. He was the first postmaster there and has been a leading citizen all the time.&quot;

In 1884, Lytle had a population of fifty and the town included a union church, a district school, a hotel, and a physician. By 1892 the population doubled and grew to include four general stores, two livestock breeders, and a Methodist church. Lytle&#x27;s early settlers were primarily engaged in farming and raising cattle. Over time, Lytle became a major shipping point for cattle, and for years the old stock pens and loading chute were familiar landmarks until they were removed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cotton and corn were also two important crops, and cotton gins were located in both Lytle and in now-abandoned Benton City. In the late 1890s, coal mining also contributed to the local economy. By 1896, the population had risen to 150. By 1914 the town had grown to include telephone service, another general store, two lumberyards, and a weekly newspaper called &quot;The Herald&quot;, and the population had grown to 600. Lytle School had 127 students. During the Great Depression, the school was enlarged as part of a WPA project.

After World War II, the Chamber of Commerce raised enough money together with property owner participation to pave the streets. Later, a pitch by W. C. Loessberg and a group of volunteers led to the town being incorporated on October 27, 1951. On May 28, 1955, a bond election was passed to drill the Edwards well for city water service, and the Lytle Volunteer Fire Department was also founded that year. Another bond election passed to give the city a gas system in 1960, and a sewer system in 1961. More streets were paved in 1971, and a garbage removal and ambulance service were added in 1974. Since that time, the city has continued to grow.

==Geography==
Lytle is located in the northern corner of Atascosa County. Most of the city lies in Atascosa County; only small portions extend into Bexar and Medina counties.

Interstate 35 passes through the southeastern part of the city, with access from Exit 131.

<doc id="151107" wikidata="Q1796694" url="?curid=151107" title="Body Worlds">
<text>Body Worlds (German title: &quot;Körperwelten&quot;) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other anatomical structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of plastination. Gunther von Hagens developed the preservation process which &quot;unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry&quot;, in the late 1970s.

A series of &quot;Body Worlds&quot; anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, but this has not been independently verified, and in 2004 von Hagens returned seven corpses to China because they showed evidence of being executed prisoners. A competing exhibition, , openly sources its bodies from &quot;unclaimed bodies&quot; in China, which can include executed prisoners.

In addition to temporary traveling exhibitions, permanent &quot;Body Worlds&quot; exhibits exists in Berlin, Amsterdam, Heidelberg, Guben, and San Jose, CA.

==Description==

The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laypeople about the human body, leading to better health awareness. Each &quot;Body Worlds&quot; exhibition contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective organs shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.

To produce specimens for &quot;Body Worlds&quot;, von Hagens employs around 100 people at his laboratory in Guben, Germany. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the giraffe that appears in &#x27;Animal Inside Out&#x27;. The specimen took three years to complete—ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.

Many of the whole-body specimens are partially dissected in the Écorché style of 17th and 18th century European tradition, while others are sliced in various anatomical planes to permit understanding of anatomical structure. In addition, more than 200 specimens of real human organs and organ systems are typically separately displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the whole-body specimens, such as the &quot;Tai Chi Man&quot;, demonstrate interventions, and include prosthetics such as artificial hip joints or heart valves. Often featured is a liver with cirrhosis, and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed for side by side comparison. A prenatal display may feature fetuses and embryos, some with congenital disorders.

==Exhibitions==

&quot;Body Worlds&quot; exhibitions have received more than 50 million visitors, making them the world&#x27;s most popular touring attraction. &quot;Body Worlds&quot; was first presented in Tokyo in 1995, and related exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe, and Asia. &quot;Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem&quot; (concerning the brain and nervous system) opened in 2005 at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. it was showing at the Telus World of Science in Vancouver. Several &quot;Body Worlds&quot; exhibits (as well as von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Among the plastinates seen were the &quot;Poker Playing Trio&quot; (which plays a key role in one scene) and &quot;Rearing Horse and Rider&quot;.

&quot;Body Worlds 3 &amp; The Story of the Heart&quot; (concerning the cardiovascular system) opened on 25 February 2006, at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the Buffalo Museum of Science in Buffalo, New York. , it was showing at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in Denver, Colorado. &quot;Body Worlds 4&quot; debuted 22 February 2008 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester in England and was in the Cureghem Cellars in Brussels until March 2009. &quot;Body Worlds &amp; The Mirror of Time&quot; (featuring human development and aging) debuted at The O2 in London in October 2008. &quot;Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens (The cycle of life)&quot; opened in Heidelberg in January 2009. &quot;Body Worlds Vital&quot; was inaugurated at the Universum museum of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2012.

In 2017, the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California, opened a semi-permanent exhibition called &quot;Body Worlds Decoded&quot;. Sponsored by venture capitalist John Doerr and his wife Ann, the exhibit features plastinated specimens supplemented by augmented reality and a digital anatomy table. The exhibit is intended to run for at least 10 years.

==Education==
&quot;Body Worlds&quot; has prepared free teaching guides for secondary school education, typically made available through organizations hosting its exhibitions.

In 2005, the New York University College of Dentistry experimented with replacing traditional laboratory dissection with the study of dissected and plastinated slices of specimens, for the training of beginning dental students.

==Regulatory framework==
===Czech Republic===
In July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban &quot;advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages&quot;.

===France===
On Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the Paris exhibition of &quot;Our Body: The Universe Within&quot;, that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a &quot;violation of the respect owed to them&quot;. &quot;Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery&quot;, said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his &quot;Body Worlds&quot; franchise. Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in Lyon and Marseille.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The UK Parliament created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in England and Wales under the Human Tissue Act 2004. This requires a licence to be granted by the Human Tissue Authority. The Human Tissue Act superseded the Anatomy Act 1832, which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report) to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the Alder Hey organs scandal. There was initially controversy over whether the exhibition needed a licence in compliance with the Anatomy Act 1984. But, after consideration by the Department of Health, it was found that the legislation had not been designed to relate to exhibitions like Body Worlds and so no licence was required. In March 2008, the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry was granted such a licence to hold &quot;Body Worlds 4&quot; and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.

====Scotland====
The Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry: &quot;Subsection 9: If the Scottish Ministers think it desirable to do so in the interests of education, training or research, they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or, as the case may be, the part, and a person is authorized under this subsection to so display a body or a part of a body if, at the time of the display he is licensed under this subsection.&quot;

Various organizations gave evidence to the Scottish Executive during the consultation process, including the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Wellcome Trust, and the Museums Association.

===United States===
Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.

National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (2006) passed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws which states that &quot;an anatomical gift of a donor&#x27;s body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education&quot;, and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.

In early 2008, former US Republican Representative W. Todd Akin proposed an amendment to the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to &quot;make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States.&quot; The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is &quot;too broad&quot; and that &quot;Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.&quot; The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.

====California====
California&#x27;s proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman Fiona Ma, tried to &quot;require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display—or their next of kin—had consented&quot;.

Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof. It was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on 26 September 2008.

====Florida====
The state of Florida prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and &quot;Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state&#x27;s anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition&quot;. The Museum of Science and History in Jacksonville and the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa have hosted BODY WORLDS exhibitions. 

====Hawaii====
In January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state. HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term &quot;dead human body&quot; to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000. HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.

====New York====
In June 2008, New York State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin. BODY WORLDS was hosted at Discovery Times Square in New York City. 

====Pennsylvania====
Representative Mike Fleck&#x27;s proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display. BODY WORLDS exhibitions have been hosted in Philadelphia at the Franklin Institute and in Allentown at the Da Vinci Science Center. 

====Washington====
The state of Washington considered a bill that would &quot;require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Consent===
There have been several reports of corpses in the Body Worlds exhibit being prepared and shown without consent. In January 2004, the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported, based on internal emails and records as well as statements from von Hagens, that his company had acquired corpses from executed Chinese prisoners. In response to the article, von Hagens said that he has told his Chinese employees not to accept bodies that were executed, and returned seven cadavers to China that had head injuries, including at least two with bullet holes in the skull. In 2004, von Hagens obtained an injunction against &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; for making the claims. Paul Harris, director of North Carolina&#x27;s State Board of Funeral Services, has stated, &quot;Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate, a statement from an embalmer, donation documents... That&#x27;s a reasonable standard to apply.&quot; Assemblywoman Fiona Ma (D-San Francisco) said, &quot;These displays do have important educational benefits, but using bodies against a person&#x27;s will is unacceptable&quot;.

In 2002, two Russian doctors from the University of Novosibirsk were charged with illegally supplying von Hagens with 56 bodies, including convicts, homeless people, and mentally ill people, without consent from their relatives. Von Hagens said that none of the body parts were used in the Body Worlds exhibitions. Bodies from the Kyrgyz State Medical Academy were also found to have been obtained illegally in 2005.

Consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethical standards, raising ethical concerns. &quot;[P]aperwork is... separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy.&quot; Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate &quot;Body Worlds&quot; before the show&#x27;s US debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.

===Import laws===
International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as &quot;art collections&quot;) do not require Centers for Disease Control stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers. In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 &quot;items in anatomical collections&quot;. This customs code encompasses &quot;zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections.&quot;

===Ethical concerns about cadaver displays===
In an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at Baylor University, a private Baptist-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to &quot;the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance.&quot;

In a 2006 lecture entitled &quot;Plasti-Nation: How America was Won&quot;, Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.

Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit. Concerned with how &quot;some kids process&quot; these &quot;graphic&quot; images, Des McKay, school superintendent in Abbotsford, British Columbia (near Greater Vancouver), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings. In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev. Christoph Reiners questions what effect the exhibits will have on the values of children attending for school field trips. Others—such as the Catholic Schools Office of Phoenix—acknowledge the educational content of Body Worlds. Reporting on the exhibition at the O2 bubble in 2008/2009, Melanie Reid of The Times stated &quot;(Body Worlds) should be compulsory viewing for every child of 10 or over&quot;.

===Religious objections===
Religious groups, including some rabbis have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body. A group of Catholic Christians voiced their opinions towards the Body Worlds exhibition in a reflection paper written by the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. This was in response to the arrival of the Body Worlds Exhibition in the Milwaukee Public Museum in 2014. The group were largely in favour of the exhibition due to its educational goals. But, the paper also discussed fears surrounding whether the exhibit&#x27;s educational aims were secondary to the experience of voyeurism. There were also concerns over the display of plastinated fetuses, due to beliefs surrounding abortion.

===Sex plastinate===
In 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate. In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.

===Lessening donor organ availability===
In 2007, the Bishop of Manchester launched a campaign to coincide with the opening of &quot;Body Worlds&quot; in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being &quot;body snatchers&quot; and &quot;robbing the NHS&quot;, arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the National Health Service of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for &quot;a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses&quot;.

===Press limitations===
Von Hagens has maintained tight copyright control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors were not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers were required to sign restrictive agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003. In recent years, the restriction on photography has been relaxed for personal non-publication use only.

===Sale of plastinates===
The &quot;Body Worlds&quot; website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for &quot;research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes&quot;—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.

== Competitors ==
The success of &quot;Body Worlds&quot; has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including &quot;BODIES... The Exhibition&quot; and &quot;Our Body: The Universe Within&quot; in the United States, &quot;Bodies Revealed&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;Body Exploration&quot; in the Republic of China, &quot;Mysteries of the Human Body&quot; in South Korea, &quot;Jintai Plastomic: Mysteries of the Human Body&quot; in Japan, &quot;Cuerpos Entrañables&quot; in Spain.

Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens&#x27; plastinates; von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued &quot;Body Exploration&quot; and &quot;Bodies Revealed&quot;.
The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the counterparty asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.

Such lawsuits have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from &quot;Bodies Revealed&quot;, the exhibition went on successfully.

Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company Premier Exhibitions. They started their first &quot;Bodies Revealed&quot; exhibition in Blackpool, England which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their &quot;Bodies Revealed&quot; and &quot;BODIES... The Exhibition&quot; exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 were Mexico City; Atlanta, Georgia, US; London; and Las Vegas, Nevada.

Unlike &quot;Body Worlds&quot;, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr Roy Glover, a spokesperson for &quot;BODIES... The Exhibition&quot; said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers from China, a category which the Laogai Research Foundation has charged could include executed prisoners. In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: &quot;Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner.&quot;

<doc id="151108" wikidata="Q976529" url="?curid=151108" title="Elgin, Texas">
<text>Elgin ( ) is a city in Bastrop County in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 9,784 at the 2020 census.

In 1995, the Texas Legislature proclaimed Elgin the &quot;Sausage Capital of Texas&quot;. Elgin is also known as the Brick Capital of the Southwest due to the presence of three operating brickyards in the mid-20th century (two of which are still open).

== History ==

In 1871, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad (succeeded by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) built through the area and established a flag stop called Glasscock named for George W. Glasscock, a local resident and Republic of Texas soldier who lived in the area in the 1830s. Glasscock was renamed on August 18, 1872, for Robert Morris Elgin, the railroad&#x27;s land commissioner, following the practice of naming new railroad towns after officers of the company. Elgin was established. The original plat placed the train depot in the center of a one-square-mile area.

The original plan for the Houston and Texas Central Railroad was to have run from McDade, east of Elgin, southwest to the Colorado River at a point somewhere between Bastrop and Webberville, then to Austin following the river. These plans, however, were thwarted due to a major flood of the Colorado River in 1869, hence the rerouting of the railroad through what is now Elgin.

Elgin was incorporated, received a post office in 1873, and a Baptist Sunday school began meeting in a private home. Much of the town&#x27;s early population was drawn from nearby Perryville, which the railroad had bypassed. Perryville, or Hogeye as it was nicknamed, was located to the south. The town was known by three different names: the name Young&#x27;s Settlement was chosen, probably in honor of the Michael Young family; Perryville, possibly for Perry Young, who was Michael Young&#x27;s son; and Hogeye. The post office was officially named Young&#x27;s Settlement, and the churches and Masonic Lodge carried the name Perryville. The name Hogeye was given to the stage stop at the Litton home where dances were held and, according to legend, the fiddler knew only one tune: &quot;Hogeye&quot;, which he played over and over as the crowd danced on the puncheon floor.

In 1879, Elgin was described as a &quot;thriving depot town&quot; of 400. It had a newspaper, a gin, and a gristmill. Three years later Methodists erected the first church building in town. In 1884, Elgin had five general stores, two druggists, three cotton gins, and a saloon; that year, Thomas O&#x27;Conner started a brick-making enterprise that eventually led Elgin to adopt the epithet &quot;Brick Capital of the Southwest.&quot; In 1885, a group of citizens met in Elgin to organize a new north–south railroad which would run from Taylor, the rail head for the Missouri, Kansas and Texas (&quot;Katy&quot;) Railroad to the north, through Elgin to Bastrop, the county seat, to the south. The Taylor, Elgin, and Bastrop Railroad was formed in 1886 and began building the line. That same year, the &quot;Katy&quot; acquired the line and continued the construction on to Houston. Thus, Elgin became the beneficiary of two major rail lines with eight passenger trains daily, adding to Elgin&#x27;s business as a shipping point for cotton, wool, and livestock. By 1890, Elgin had a population of 1,100 and supported two hotels, a broom factory, two doctors, a dentist, and the &quot;Elgin Courier&quot; newspaper. The following year oil was discovered southeast of town, but the strike was not large. Coal proved better for the economy, when the large coal belt nearby was mined in the early 20th century, bringing Latin-Americans and African-Americans to the area, as both free and slave labor.

The year 1900 resulted in a bumper crop of cotton and Elgin prospered. Elgin grew slowly but steadily through the 20th century, from 1,258 in 1904 to 4,846 in 1990. The city incorporated in 1901, electing Charles Gillespie, building contractor, as mayor, as well as J.D. Hemphill as marshal, W.E. McCullough, J. Wed Davis, Ed Lawhon, Max Hirach, and F.S. Wade as aldermen. Local law enforcement was established to enforce newly established civil and criminal codes. By 1910, Elgin was enjoying a period of great prosperity as families from out on the prairie and surrounding communities moved to town and built nice homes.

By 1940, Elgin was also the site of two big brick and tile plants. Elgin enterprise was stimulated during World War II by the proximity of the army training facility Camp Swift. A third brick company was established in the town in the mid-1950s, lured by the high-quality clay deposits in the area. In addition to the brick plants, a local sausage factory processed thousands of pounds of beef and pork a week; Elgin Hot Sausage continued to enjoy a widespread reputation, and Elgin rapidly became the most important agricultural center in Bastrop County. Five cotton gins and a cotton oil mill were in operation at the same time. Other industries included feed and grain processing and hydraulic press manufacturing.

By the 1980s, proximity to Austin had begun to attract commuters to Elgin. In the mid-1980s, the &quot;Elgin Courier&quot; was still being published, the sausage had achieved wider fame, and two brick and tile plants were still in operation. Elgin was also the site of a furniture plant and a leather works.

The eastern side of town was heavily damaged by a high-end EF2 tornado on March 21, 2022.

In 2022, city voters approved the decriminalization of possession of misdemeanor amounts of marijuana.

<text>Copperas Cove ( ) is a city located in central Texas at the southern corner of Coryell County with smaller portions in Lampasas and Bell counties. Founded in 1879 as a small ranching and farming community, today the city is the largest in Coryell County, with 36,670 at 2020. The city&#x27;s economy is closely linked to nearby Fort Cavazos (formerly known as Fort Hood), making it part of the Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The first evidence of human habitation in the Five Hills area dates back to at least 4,000 BC. Artifacts, such as skeletal remains, arrowheads, and other stone tools, have been found along local creek beds and valley floors. These first residents were nomadic hunters, traveling in small groups following migrating buffalo herds. When the Spanish came to Texas, a small Plains tribe known as the Tonkawa inhabited the area. The powerful Comanche controlled a vast stretch of land to the north and west, making Coryell County a hostile battleground as settlers moved into the area.

In 1825, Mexico provided Stephen F. Austin with a land grant encompassing a large area including present-day Copperas Cove. Starting in the 1830s, the first European settlers came into the Five Hills region; however, the area lacked stability until after the Civil War. Substantial settlement did not arrive until the development of the cattle industry during the 1870s, when a feeder route of the Chisholm Trail was cut through the region. Settlement centered around a local general store about two miles southwest of present-day downtown. In 1878, residents applied for a post office under the name &quot;Cove&quot;, so chosen for the site&#x27;s sheltered location. However &quot;Cove&quot; was already taken by a nearby community (now called Evant). Inspired by the taste of nearby spring water, residents amended the name to &quot;Copperas Cove&quot; (officially in 1901). The post office was established in March 1879, with Marsden Ogletree as the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The original building remains today and is the site of the Ogletree Gap Heritage Festival.

Copperas Cove&#x27;s fortunes were greatly improved when, in 1882, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway expanded into the region. Local resident Jesse M. Clements lobbied to obtain train service and provided the railroad company with the necessary right-of-way about two miles northeast of town. Residents soon moved to a new set of streets laid out by the company&#x27;s engineer, E.F. Batte. The train depot at Copperas Cove served as the shipping point for farmers and ranchers in the area between Cowhouse Creek and the Lampasas River. Businesses opened to provide services for these area residents, including a steam gristmill-cotton gin, three hotels, a barber shop, and an opera house. Many of the town&#x27;s early buildings remain to this day, focusing around the block of Avenue D between Main Street and 1st Street. By 1900, the population had reached 475, and residents voted to form their own school district. A private bank opened in 1906, and residents elected Jouett Allin their first mayor in 1913. The town continued to prosper over the coming years, depending largely on local agriculture, of which cotton played a dominant role. Copperas Cove reached a then-peak population of 600 in 1929, but entered a state of decline with the onset of the Great Depression. During the 1930s, the local bank failed, several businesses closed, and many people left to look for work in other areas. By 1940, only 356 people remained.

In 1942, Copperas Cove received new life when the US government located Camp Hood next to the struggling community. By the time the cantonment was upgraded to Fort Hood in 1950, the town had over a thousand residents. The population continued to increase rapidly, reaching almost 5,000 in 1960 and more than doubling each of the next two decades, eventually coming to the present count of 32,032 at the 2010 census. During this period, the city limits greatly expanded, encompassing acres of newly built tract housing with upgraded roads and services. The establishment of the fort drastically altered the character of the city. Soldiers from across the country would bring their families and settle in Copperas Cove, often remaining after concluding their military service. In addition to diversifying the ethnic and religious composition of the city, Fort Hood altered the local economy. Since much of the area farmland was acquired by the federal government, businesses within Copperas Cove now largely provide services for Fort Hood soldiers and their families. In 2023, Fort Hood was renamed Fort Cavazos.

==Geography and climate==
Copperas Cove is located in the Limestone Cut Plains of central Texas, within an agglomeration of hills situated between the Lampasas River and Cowhouse Creek valleys, known as the &quot;Five Hills&quot; area. Copperas Cove&#x27;s climate is humid subtropical with hot summers, cool winters, and rainy springs. The average high in August is , and the average low in January is . May is the rainiest month. The city lies within Tornado Alley, and twisters have been known to touch down in the area. Rainfall averages per year, making the land suitable for agriculture without irrigation, though the region is prone to drought.

The area&#x27;s thin layer of topsoil tends to be a light, crumbly caliche—capable of sustaining many agricultural plants, but susceptible to depletion and erosion. Before ranchers and farmers began altering the landscape, the area was once part of a vast grassland. Bison, deer, and pronghorn grazed on tall native grasses. However, because of overgrazing, land clearing, and the suppression of wildfires, these native grasses have been mostly replaced by invasive weeds and tough, woody trees, including Texas live oak, Texas red oak, red juniper (red cedar), and mesquite.

Copperas Cove has a suburban cityscape typical among American small towns developed in the post-World War II era. The majority of commercial activity occurs along the main thoroughfare, US Highway 190. Since most of Copperas Cove has been built after 1950, the extent of the town&#x27;s walkable, historic downtown is considerably smaller than nearby, less populated communities, such as Lampasas or Gatesville. Most residential neighborhoods are low-density, single-family homes. Because of changing economic conditions in recent decades, intensive farming and ranching has largely left the area, making land fairly cheap to develop. After a brief slowdown of development during the 1980s, new subdivisions resumed expansion into the surrounding countryside.

==Transportation==

The major thoroughfare through town is Interstate 14/U.S. Highway 190, connecting Cove to Interstate 35 in Belton, to the east, and to U.S. Highway 281 in Lampasas, to the west. FM 116 runs north through town, connecting the city to Gatesville to the north.

Public transportation is provided within the city by HOP, whose buses can be recognized by their teal and purple color. The region is served by the Killeen Regional Airport (GRK) located a few miles outside of town.

<doc id="151112" wikidata="Q150652" url="?curid=151112" title="William I, German Emperor">
<text>William I (Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig; 22 March 1797 – 9 March 1888), or Wilhelm I, was King of Prussia from 1861 and German Emperor from 1871 until his death in 1888. A member of the House of Hohenzollern, he was the first head of state of a united Germany. He was head of state of Prussia from 1858, when he became regent for his brother Frederick William IV. During the reign of his grandson Wilhelm II, he was known as Emperor William the Great (German: &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Große&quot;).

The second son of Prince Frederick William and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, William was not expected to ascend to the throne. His grandfather, King Frederick William II died the year he was born, and his father was crowned Frederick William III. William fought with distinction during the War of the Sixth Coalition, and afterwards became a prominent figure within the Prussian Army. In 1840, his childless elder brother became King of Prussia, making him heir presumptive. William played a major role in crushing the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany, although he was briefly forced into exile in England. Frederick William IV suffered a stroke in 1857 and was left incapacitated, and William was formally named Prince Regent a year later. In 1861, William ascended to the Prussian throne on his elder brother&#x27;s death.

Upon ascension, William immediately came into conflict with the liberal Landtag over his proposed military budget. In response, he appointed Otto von Bismarck to the post of Minister President in order to force through his proposals, beginning a partnership that would last for the rest of his life. On the foreign front, William oversaw Prussian victories in the Second Schleswig War and the Austro-Prussian War, establishing Prussia as the leading German power. In 1871, through Bismarck&#x27;s maneuvers, the unification of Germany was achieved following the Franco-Prussian War. The German Empire was proclaimed and William was granted the title of German Emperor. Even though he had considerable power as &quot;Kaiser&quot;, William largely left the affairs of the state to Bismarck. Later in life he was the target of multiple failed assassination attempts, which enabled Bismarck to push through a series of anti-socialist laws. In 1888, which came to be known as the Year of the Three Emperors, William died at the age of 90 after a short illness and was succeeded by his son Frederick. Frederick, already suffering from cancer, died 99 days later and the throne passed to Wilhelm II.

==Early life and military career==
The future king and emperor was born William Frederick Louis of Prussia () in the in Berlin on 22 March 1797. As the second son of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Prince Frederick William, himself son of King Frederick William II, William was not expected to ascend to the throne. His grandfather died the year he was born, at age 53, in 1797, and his father Frederick William III became king. He was educated from 1801 to 1809 by , who was also in charge of the education of William&#x27;s brother, the Crown Prince Frederick William. At age twelve, his father appointed him an officer in the Prussian army. 

William served in the army from 1814 onward. Like his father, he fought against Napoleon I of France during the part of the Napoleonic Wars known in Germany as the (&quot;Wars of Liberation&quot;, otherwise known as the War of the Sixth Coalition), and was reportedly a very brave soldier. He was made a captain () and won the Iron Cross for his actions at Bar-sur-Aube. The war and the fight against France left a lifelong impression on him, and he had a long-standing antipathy towards the French.

In 1815, William was promoted to major and commanded a battalion of the &quot;1. Garderegiment&quot;. He fought under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher at the Battles of Ligny and Waterloo. In 1817, he accompanied his sister Charlotte to Saint Petersburg, when she married Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, becoming Empress Alexandra Feodorovna.

In 1816, William became the commander of the and in 1818 was promoted to . The next year, William was appointed inspector of the VII. and VIII. Army Corps. This made him a spokesman of the Prussian Army within the House of Hohenzollern. He argued in favour of a strong, well-trained, and well-equipped army. In 1820, William became commander of the and in 1825 was promoted to commanding general of the III. Army Corps.

Around this time, William became romantically linked with his cousin, Polish noblewoman Elisa Radziwill. In 1826, William was forced to break off the relationship by his father, who deemed it an inappropriate match. It is alleged that Elisa had an illegitimate daughter by William who was brought up by Joseph and Caroline Kroll, owners of the Kroll Opera House in Berlin, and was given the name Agnes Kroll. She married a Carl Friedrich Ludwig Dettman (known as &quot;Louis&quot;) and emigrated to Sydney, in 1849. They had a family of three sons and two daughters. Agnes died in 1904.

In 1829, William married Princess Augusta, the daughter of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Maria Pavlovna, the sister of Nicholas I. Their marriage was outwardly stable, but not a very happy one. In 1834-37 he had the Old Palace in Berlin built as a new family home, in which he continued to live later as king and emperor, while he only used the Berlin Palace for representative purposes.

On 7 June 1840 his older brother became King of Prussia. Since he had no children, William was first in line to succeed him to the throne and thus was given the title . Against his convictions but out of loyalty towards his brother, William signed the bill setting up a Prussian parliament in 1847 and took a seat in the upper chamber, the Prussian House of Lords.
During the Revolutions of 1848, William successfully crushed a revolt in Berlin that was aimed at Frederick William IV. The use of cannons made him unpopular at the time and earned him the nickname (Prince of Grapeshot). Indeed, he had to flee to England for a while, disguised as a merchant. He returned and helped to put down an uprising in Baden, where he commanded the Prussian army. In October 1849, he became governor-general of the Rhine Province and Province of Westphalia, with a seat at the Electoral Palace, Koblenz.

During their time at Koblenz, William and his wife entertained liberal scholars such as the historian Maximilian Wolfgang Duncker, August von Bethmann-Hollweg and . William&#x27;s opposition to liberal ideas gradually softened.

In 1854, the prince was raised to the rank of a field-marshal and made governor of the federal Fortress of Mainz. In 1857 Frederick William IV suffered a stroke and became mentally disabled for the rest of his life. In January 1858, William became Prince Regent for his brother, initially only temporarily but after October on a permanent basis. Against the advice of his brother, William swore an oath of office on the Prussian constitution and promised to preserve it &quot;solid and inviolable&quot;. William appointed a liberal, Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, as Minister President and thus initiated what became known as the &quot;New Era&quot; in Prussia, although there were conflicts between William and the liberal majority in the Landtag on matters of reforming the armed forces.

==Life as King==

On 2 January 1861, Frederick William IV died and William ascended the throne as William I of Prussia. In July, a student from Leipzig attempted to assassinate William, but he was only lightly injured. Like Frederick I of Prussia, William travelled to Königsberg and there crowned himself at the Schlosskirche. William chose the anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, 18 October, for this event, which was the first Prussian coronation ceremony since 1701 and the only coronation of a German king after 1806. William refused to comply with his brother&#x27;s wish, expressed in Frederick William&#x27;s last will, that he should abrogate the constitution.

William inherited a conflict between Frederick William and the liberal Landtag. He was considered to be politically neutral as he intervened less in politics than his brother. In 1862 the Landtag refused an increase in the military budget needed to pay for the already implemented reform of the army. This involved expanding the peacetime army from 150,000 to 200,000 men and the annual number of new recruits from 40,000 to 63,000. However, the truly controversial part was keeping the length of military service (raised in 1856 from two years) at three years. When his request (backed by his Minister of War Albrecht von Roon) was refused, William first considered abdicating, but his son, the Crown Prince, advised strongly against it. Then, on the advice of Roon, William appointed Otto von Bismarck as Minister President in order to force through the proposals. Under the Prussian constitution, the Minister President was responsible solely to the king, not to the Landtag. Bismarck, a conservative Prussian Junker and loyal friend of the king, liked to see his working relationship with William as that of a vassal to his feudal superior. Nonetheless, it was Bismarck who effectively directed affairs, domestic as well as foreign; on several occasions he gained William&#x27;s assent by threatening to resign.

During his reign, William was the commander-in-chief of the Prussian forces in the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. After the latter was won by Prussia, William wanted to march on to Vienna and annex Austria, but was dissuaded from doing so by Bismarck and his son Crown Prince Frederick. Bismarck wanted to end the war quickly, so as to allow Prussia to ally with Austria if it needed to at a later date; Frederick was also appalled by the casualties and wanted a speedy end to hostilities. During a heated discussion, Bismarck threatened to resign if William continued to Vienna; Bismarck got his way. William had to content himself with becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the northern two-thirds of Germany. Prussia annexed several of Austria&#x27;s allies north of the Main, as well as Schleswig-Holstein. Saxe-Lauenburg was already in a personal union with Prussia since 1865 (which became a full union in 1876).

In 1867, the North German Confederation was created as a federation (federally organised state) of the North German and Central German states under the permanent presidency of Prussia. William assumed the &quot;Bundespräsidium&quot;, the presidium of the Confederation; the post was a hereditary office of the Prussian crown. Not &quot;expressis verbis&quot;, but in function he was the head of state. Bismarck intentionally avoided a title such as &quot;Präsident&quot; as it sounded too republican. William became also the constitutional &quot;Bundesfeldherr&quot;, the commander of all federal armed forces. Via secret treaties with the South German states, he also became commander of their armies in times of war. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, William was in command of all the German forces at the crucial Battle of Sedan.

==German Emperor==
During the Franco-Prussian War, the South German states joined the North German Confederation, which was reorganized as the German Empire &quot;(Deutsches Reich).&quot; The title of &quot;Bundespräsidium&quot; was replaced with the title of German Emperor &quot;(Deutscher Kaiser).&quot; This was decided on by the legislative organs, the Reichstag and Bundesrat, and William agreed to this on 8 December in the presence of a Reichstag delegation. The new constitution and the title of Emperor came into effect on 1 January 1871.

William, however, hesitated to accept the constitutional title, as he feared that it would overshadow his own title as King of Prussia. He also wanted it to be &quot;Kaiser von Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Emperor of Germany&quot;), but Bismarck warned him that the South German princes and the Emperor of Austria might protest. William eventually—though grudgingly—relented and on 18 January, he was formally proclaimed as emperor in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. The date was chosen as the coronation date of the first Prussian king in 1701. In the national memory, 18 January became the day of the foundation of the Empire (&quot;Reichsgründungstag&quot;), although it did not have a constitutional significance.
To many intellectuals, the coronation of William was associated with the restoration of the Holy Roman Empire. Felix Dahn wrote a poem, &quot;Macte senex Imperator&quot; (&#x27;Hail thee, old emperor&#x27;) in which he nicknamed William &quot;Barbablanca&quot; (whitebeard), a play on the name of the medieval emperor Frederick &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (redbeard). According to the King asleep in mountain legend, Barbarossa slept under the Kyffhäuser mountain until Germany had need of him. William I was thus portrayed as a second coming of Barbarossa. The Kyffhäuser Monument portrays both emperors.

In 1872, he arbitrated a boundary dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States, deciding in favor of the U.S. and placing the San Juan Islands of modern-day Washington within U.S. national territory, thus ending the 12-year bloodless Pig War.

In his memoirs, Bismarck describes William as an old-fashioned, courteous, infallibly polite gentleman and a genuine Prussian officer, whose good common sense was occasionally undermined by &quot;female influences&quot;. This was a reference to William&#x27;s wife, who had been educated by, among others Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and was intellectually superior to her husband. She was also at times very outspoken in her opposition to official policies as she was a liberal. William, however, had long been strongly opposed to liberal ideas. Despite possessing considerable power as Kaiser, William left the task of governing mostly to his chancellor, limiting himself to representing the state and approving Bismarck&#x27;s every policy. In private he once remarked on his relationship with Bismarck: &quot;It is difficult to be emperor under such a chancellor.&quot;

===Assassination attempts and anti-socialist laws===
On 11 May 1878, a plumber named Emil Max Hödel failed in an assassination attempt on William in Berlin. Hödel used a revolver to shoot at the then 81-year-old Emperor, while he and his daughter, Princess Louise, paraded in their carriage on &quot;Unter den Linden&quot;. When the bullet missed, Hödel ran across the street and fired another round which also missed. In the commotion one of the individuals who tried to apprehend Hödel suffered severe internal injuries and died two days later. Hödel was seized immediately. He was tried, convicted, sentenced to death, and executed on 16 August 1878.

A second attempt to assassinate William I was made on 2 June 1878 by Karl Nobiling. As the Emperor drove past in an open carriage, the assassin fired two shots from a shotgun at him from the window of a house off the &quot;Unter den Linden&quot;. William was severely wounded and was rushed back to the palace. Nobiling shot himself in an attempt to commit suicide. While William survived this attack, the assassin died from his self-inflicted wound three months later.

Despite the fact that Hödel had been expelled from the Social Democratic Party, his actions were used as a pretext by Bismarck to ban the party. To do this, Bismarck partnered with Ludwig Bamberger, a Liberal, who had written on the subject of Socialism, &quot;If I don&#x27;t want any chickens, then I must smash the eggs.&quot; These attempts on William&#x27;s life thus became the pretext for the institution of the Anti-Socialist Laws, which were introduced by Bismarck&#x27;s government with the support of a majority in the Reichstag on 18 October 1878, for the purpose of fighting the &quot;socialist&quot; and working-class movement. These laws deprived the Social Democratic Party of Germany of its legal status; prohibited all organizations, workers&#x27; mass organizations and the socialist and workers&#x27; press; decreed confiscation of socialist literature; and subjected Social-Democrats to reprisals. The laws were extended every 2–3 years. Despite the reprisals the Social Democratic Party increased its influence among the masses. Under pressure of the mass working-class movement the laws were repealed on 1 October 1890.

===Later years and death===
In August 1878, Alexander II of Russia, William&#x27;s nephew, wrote a letter (known as &quot;Ohrfeigenbrief&quot;) to him complaining about the treatment Russian interests had received at the Congress of Berlin. In response William, his wife Augusta, and his son the crown prince travelled to Russia (against the advice of Bismarck) to mend fences in face-to-face talks. However, by once again threatening to resign, Bismarck overcame the opposition of William to a closer alliance with Austria-Hungary. In October, William agreed to the Dual Alliance (&quot;Zweibund&quot;) between Germany and Austria-Hungary, which was directed against Russia.

Another assassination attempt failed on 28 September 1883 when William unveiled the &quot;Niederwalddenkmal&quot; in Rüdesheim. A group of anarchists had prepared an attack using dynamite which failed due to the wet weather.
The Berlin Conference of 1884–85 organized by Otto von Bismarck can be seen as the formalization of the Scramble for Africa. Claiming much of the left-over territories in Africa and Oceania that were yet unclaimed, Germany managed to build the large German colonial empire.

Despite the assassination attempts and William&#x27;s unpopular role in the 1848 uprising, he and his wife were very popular, especially in their later years. Many people considered them the personification of &quot;the old Prussia&quot; and liked their austere and simple lifestyle. William died on 9 March 1888 in Berlin after a short illness, at age 90. He was buried on 16 March at the Mausoleum at Park Charlottenburg. He was succeeded by his son Frederick, who was already fatally unwell himself (suffering from throat cancer). Frederick spent the 99 days of his reign fighting his illness before dying and being succeeded by his eldest son Wilhelm on 15 June.

To honour him a large number of memorials/statues were erected all over the country over the following years. The best known among them are the Kyffhäuser monument (1890–96) in Thuringia, the monument at Porta Westfalica (1896) and the mounted statue of William at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz (1897). The National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument in Berlin was destroyed by the government of East Berlin in 1950.

<text>Fort Cavazos is a United States Army post located near Killeen, Texas. The post is named after Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, a native Texan and the US Army’s first Hispanic four-star general. Formerly named Fort Hood for Confederate General John Bell Hood, the post is located halfway between Austin and Waco, about from each, within the U.S. state of Texas. The post is the headquarters of III Armored Corps and First Army Division West and is home to the 1st Cavalry Division and 3rd Cavalry Regiment, among others.

Its origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The War Department announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August. As originally constructed, Fort Cavazos had an area of , with billeting for 6,007 officers and 82,610 enlisted personnel. The main cantonment of Fort Cavazos had a total population of 53,416 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. Fort Cavazos was the most populous U.S. military installation in the world. The main business area is in Bell County, with the training countryside area of the post in Coryell County. In April 2014, the base&#x27;s website listed 45,414 assigned soldiers and 8,900 civilian employees covering an area of .

==History==

===Foundation===
During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp. The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.

About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the &quot;Cradle of Killeen,&quot; provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Cavazos area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.

In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General John Bell Hood, who commanded Hood&#x27;s Texas Brigade during the American Civil War, part of a series of new training camps named for notable regional military leaders together with Camps Carson, Campbell and Atterbury.

The original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional in Bell County and in Coryell County near Gatesville, Texas were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as North Camp Hood. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the United States Disciplinary Barracks.

At the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops, which was maintained until early 1944.

In 1944, the number of tank destroyer battalions in training at the post declined rapidly. Field artillery battalions and the Infantry Replacement Training Center replaced them in March 1944. By September, the Infantry Center was the largest activity on post with 31,545 troops. The total camp population on the last day of 1944 was 50,228.

During the last year of World War II the post&#x27;s mission shifted and its population drastically decreased. As the war came to an end, troop training slowed and equipment reclamation and demobilization were prioritized. A separation center was established in September 1945, and as the year ended, post strength had fallen to 1,807 prisoners and about 11,000 troops. The Infantry Replacement Training Center was officially shut down on 7 January 1946.

===Cold War===
The 2nd and 20th Armored Divisions were sent to Camp Hood after returning from Europe in January 1946, but the 20th was soon inactivated, leaving less than 5,000 at the post. The 2nd Armored would remain at the post until its inactivation at the end of the Cold War. Camp Hood was retained postwar as an armored training center and on 15 April 1950 was officially renamed Fort Hood as a result of its permanent status.

In mid-1954, III Corps moved from California to the post. The Corps supervised the training of combat units at Fort Hood and other Fourth Army stations from 1954 to 1959 when III Corps was inactivated. Probably the most famous trainee to come through the post was Elvis Presley, arriving on 28 March 1958. Other than receiving record amounts of mail (3–4 bags per day), he was treated like all other trainees. On 19 September, Presley shipped out for Germany.
During this period, the 4th Armored Division was reactivated and deployed to Germany as part of the &quot;Gyroscope&quot; concept of unit movement.

In September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the U.S. Army Strategic Army Corps (STRAC). At the same time, the basing of the 1st Armored Division there made it a two-division post. On 15 June 1963 Killeen Base was turned over to the Army.

===Vietnam War ===
During the late 1960s, Fort Hood trained and deployed a number of units and individuals for duty in Vietnam. As the United States ended its role in the conflict, thousands of returning soldiers completed their active duty with one of the divisions. During this time, the post was modernized. On 13 September 1965, Darnall Hospital opened. In 1970, construction began on Palmer Theater and Venable Village was dedicated. Modern barracks were springing up around post. The wood buildings of the post were replaced with brick structures.

In August 1968, forty-three African American GIs, who objected to being sent to Chicago for riot-control duty during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, were court martialed and jailed by the US Army. Many of the soldiers were decorated and wounded veterans who had completed tours of duty in Vietnam.

In October 1969, Killeen Base was designated as West Fort Hood and the airfield&#x27;s name was designated as Robert Gray Army Airfield. The base was named after a Killeen native who was a pilot of a B-25 bomber on the famous Doolittle Raid in Tokyo in 1942. He was killed later in World War II flying combat missions. With the redesignation came a change in mission at West Fort Hood. Nuclear weapons were removed; they had been secretly kept there since 1947.

In 1971, the colors of the 1st Cavalry Division came to the post from Vietnam, resulting in the reflagging of the 1st Armored Division, the colors of which were sent to Germany to reflag the 4th Armored Division.

From 23 December 1972, to 19 January 1973, elements of the 13th Support Brigade deployed to the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake to assist in disaster relief serving at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua.

===Proving grounds===
Since the early 1970s, the post has played a major role in the training, testing, and introduction of new equipment, tactics, and organizations. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command&#x27;s Test and Experimentation Command (now the U.S. Army Operational Test Command), located at West Fort Hood has been a primary player. Fort Hood fielded the M1 Abrams tank, M2/3 Bradley Infantry/Cavalry Fighting Vehicle, the Multiple Launch rocket System (MLRS), and the AH-64 Apache helicopter.

In January 1975, the 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized, as the Army&#x27;s newest armored division. Since fielding the M-1 Abrams in 1980, force modernization has continued as a major focus. The 1st Cavalry became the first division to field the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Humvee, the Multiple Launch Rocket System and Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) tactical communications.

===1990–2000 Army deployments===
In August 1990, the post was alerted for deployments to Southwest Asia as part of the joint forces participating in Operation Desert Shield. The deployment to Saudi Arabia began in September, extending into mid-October.

On 21 May 1991, with the reactivation of its 3rd Brigade (&quot;Greywolf&quot;) the 1st Cavalry Division became the largest division in the Army upon its return to the United States. In October 1992, the Engineer Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reactivated. Through the Engineer Restructuring Initiative, the nucleus of the brigade was formed around the 8th Engineer Battalion. The 20th Engineer Battalion was brought from Fort Campbell, KY, to join the brigade, and the 91st Engineer Battalion was activated to complete the brigade.

In November 1992, the unit designations for the battalions remaining from the former &quot;Tiger&quot; Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division were returned prior to the activation of the division at the post on 2 December 1992. This action was done to realign the historical designations of units to their parent divisions. On 29 November 1992, the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry was designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry; 1st Battalion, 67th Armor to 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, and 1st Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery to 2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery. On 16 December 1992, 1st Cavalry Division units designated to accomplish realignments for historical purposes and included the 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor reflagged as 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry; 3rd Battalion, 32nd Armor to 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry; and Battery A, 333rd Field Artillery to Battery B, 26th Field Artillery.

During the post war periods called Operation Desert Calm and Operation Provide Comfort, post units continued to serve in the Persian Gulf area. From December 1992 to May 1993, post soldiers deployed to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope to command and control the Joint Task Force Support Command. In the fall of 1994, the post&#x27;s units participated in the largest deployment since Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm executed split base operations in the Caribbean Basin, Central America and Southwest Asia, in support of Operations Vigilant Warrior and Sea Signal V, as well as other contingency operations.

13th Corps Support Command Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the headquarters in December 1992 to Mogadishu to serve as the nucleus of Joint Task Force Support Command. Their major units included the 593rd Support Group (Fort Lewis), 36th Engineer Group (Fort Benning), 7th Transportation Group (Fort Eustis), and 62d Medical Group (Fort Lewis). The command headquarters returned to Fort Hood in May 1993.

As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) reductions, the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), then located at Fort Polk Louisiana, was reflagged as the 2nd Armored Division in late 1992. By mid-1993, the division at Fort Hood had completed changes of unit names to those associated with the 5th Division, and began participation in the early stages of the Army&#x27;s Experimental Force, Force XXI.

In 1995, the 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the U.S. 4th Infantry Division. Twenty-five years after making its home in Colorado, the 4th Infantry Division was again restationed to meet the Army&#x27;s requirements but this move would be quite different from others. It became a split-based organization with six brigades and three separate battalions stationed at the post and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team remaining at Fort Carson. By December 1995, the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) assumed responsibility as the Army&#x27;s Experimental Force (Force XXI), and on 15 December 1995, its colors were unfurled for the first time over central Texas and the post.

Since the 1990s, post units have supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October 1998, The 1st Cavalry Division was the first United States division to assume authority of the Multinational Division (North) area of operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mission was to conduct operations to enforce the military provisions set forth by the Dayton Peace Accords.

In 1998, the Ironhorse Division was designated to be the Army&#x27;s first Multi-Component unit. The main objective being to enhance Total Force integration, optimize the unique capabilities of each component, and improve the overall readiness of the Army. The program was developed to leverage the strengths of the Army&#x27;s three components (active, reserve and National Guard). As such, 515 positions within the division have been designated as reserve component. These positions include individuals, a unit from the Wyoming National Guard and dual-mission units from the Texas Army National Guard.

In addition to peacekeeping efforts, the post&#x27;s units routinely participate in national and international disaster relief efforts. Hours after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, III Corps units were ready to move out to provide assistance. Fort Hood units also aided Managua, Nicaragua, after an earthquake ravaged the city.

During the 1990s, the post continued an extensive building program to modernize. This modernization continues today, with emphasis on quality of life, force projection and training. The Robertson Blood Center, Soldier Development Center, and a new commissary at Warrior Way have been completed. Many other improvements were made to improve the Power Projection Mission of the post such as improvements to the railhead and the runway at Gray Army Airfield. Training ranges have been upgraded.

===2000–2009 Army deployments===
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Army&#x27;s modernization was in full swing. Some of these new advances in technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank, the M2A2 Operation Desert Storm (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M109A6 Paladin howitzer, the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, the AH-64D Apache Longbow Helicopter, and the M6 Bradley Linebacker.

Fort Hood was the first installation selected to privatize post housing under the residential communities initiative. Under this initiative, new housing units, remodeled housing and community improvements will be added to the post.

In 2001, the War on Terror became a prime focus. The post transitioned from an open to a closed post with the help of military police from reserve units. The 1st Cavalry sent additional troops to Kuwait to protect against possible aggressive actions from Iraq. The 4003rd Garrison Support Reserve unit fills vacancies left by deploying units on post. Fort Cavazos has a key role as a training base for mobilizing Reserve and National Guard units to support the Homeland Defense effort.

Many Fort Hood units were deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom, and to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In December 2003, the 4th Infantry Division captured Saddam Hussein. In the spring of 2004, the 1st Cavalry Division followed the 4th Infantry Division deploying to Iraq. Task Force ODIN was created at the post.

In September 2005, 13th COSCOM and key enablers were called to support Joint Task Force Katrina/Rita hurricane relief and went on to serve as the senior joint logistical support command for JTF Katrina. 13th COSCOM eventually provided one hundred million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation.

In 2009, Fort Carson, Colorado&#x27;s First Army Division West re-stationed to Fort Hood in order to consolidate its mission to conduct reserve component mobilization training and validation for deployment, switching places with 4th Infantry Division, which relocated to Fort Carson.

===2007 navigation exercise incident===
On 12 June 2007, the body of Lawrence George Sprader, Jr was found at about 8:30 p.m. in a brushy area located within the Central Texas Army post&#x27;s training ground. He had gone missing for days while conducting an exercise for testing basic map-reading and navigation skills. A massive search had been conducted, with over 3,000 parties scouring the countryside. According to autopsy records, he had died from hyperthermia and dehydration. According to an Army investigatory report, there were &quot;a multitude of procedural violations, judgment errors and alleged acts of misconduct by Army trainers that not only contributed to Sprader&#x27;s death but put some 300 other soldiers in danger that day, including about two dozen who required medical attention.&quot;

===2009 shooting===
On 5 November 2009 a gunman, who regarded himself as a mujahid waging &quot;jihad&quot; against the United States, opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood and killed 13 people while wounding 32 others. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army Major and psychiatrist, was the gunman. He was shot and then arrested by Department of the Army police officers Sergeant Mark Todd and Sergeant Kimberly Munley.

Eyewitnesses to the actual events said: &quot;...Major Hasan wheeled on Sergeant Munley as she rounded the corner of a building and shot her, putting her on the ground. Then Major Hasan turned his back on her and started putting another magazine into his semiautomatic pistol. It was at that moment that Senior Sgt. Mark Todd, a veteran police officer, rounded another corner of the building, found Major Hasan fumbling with his weapon and shot him.&quot;

In 2013, Hasan was convicted of thirteen counts of premeditated murder and thirty-two counts of attempted premeditated murder for the thirty soldiers and two civilian police officers injured in the shooting. On 23 August 2013, Hasan was found guilty on all charges and was sentenced to death.

A memorial site in Killeen, featuring 13 granite columns inscribed with the names and likenesses of the victims, was dedicated in March 2016. The memorial was financed by donations and built by volunteers.

===2011 attack plot===
Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, an AWOL private, was arrested near Fort Hood, and in a statement by the police chief of Killeen, Texas, the man told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post. At his trial in August 2012, Abdo stated, through a cloth mask, &quot;I will continue until the day the dead are called to account for their deeds.&quot; Abdo was sentenced to life in prison for the plot.

===2014 shootings===
On 2 April 2014, a shooting spree occurred at several locations on the base, leaving three people dead and fourteen others wounded. The gunman then died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was later identified as 34-year-old Ivan Lopez, an Iraq War veteran.

===2014–2023===
A sexual assault prevention officer on the base, Sergeant First Class Gregory McQueen, was dishonorably discharged in March 2015, having been convicted of organizing a prostitution ring.

Currently, Fort Cavazos has nearly 65,000 soldiers and family members and serves as a home for the following units: Headquarters III Corps; First Army Division West; the 1st Cavalry Division; 13th Sustainment Command (formerly 13th Corps Support Command); 89th Military Police Brigade; 504th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade; 85th Civil Affairs Brigade; 1st Medical Brigade; and the 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. Fort Cavazos also includes Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and the Medical And Dental Activities as tenant units.

, Killeen, Texas, started a land-use study to &quot;identify and mitigate compatibility and encroachment issues that may impact training, operations&quot;.
;Command climate and culture
In 2020, a debate around renaming US military bases named after Confederate generals emerged during protests sparked from the murder of George Floyd. Fort Hood was one such base at the center of the controversy.

39 soldiers stationed at the base died or went missing in 2020. The murder of Vanessa Guillén at Fort Hood in April 2020 brought national attention to the base and the broader culture of sexual harassment in the military. Hundreds of people protested at the gates of Fort Hood in June demanding justice for Guillén. In August, a San Antonio man was arrested and charged with making terroristic threats after threatening to commit a mass shooting at Fort Hood in retaliation for Guillén&#x27;s killing. 14 commanders were subsequently fired or suspended with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy citing &quot;leadership failures&quot;. An investigation by Fort Hood Independent Review Committee (FHIRC), a panel McCarthy established, found that there was a &quot;permissive environment for sexual assault and sexual harassment at Fort Hood.&quot; Army regulation AR-600-20 (24 July 2020) now requires the filing of commander&#x27;s critical information reports (CCIRs) 8 days after a SHARP (sexual harassment/assault response &amp; prevention) complaint by a victim. 
Fort Hood CID investigators assigned to their cases are hampered by a checklist mentality from their beginnings as junior investigators straight out of initial training from Fort Leonard Wood, according to the FHIRC report. The majority of CID investigators are then detailed to protective services for senior Pentagon officials, thereby moving straight to middle management CID positions without the requisite experience in criminal investigation. After Private Carlton L. Chee was the 28th death of 2020 in September, Congress launched an investigation of Fort Hood, citing the deaths and other felonies that occurred on the fort between 2014-2019. Commanders at the FORSCOM, III Corps, and Fort Hood levels now have specific actions to complete upon a sexual assault review board complaint. The Army CID is being restructured: a civilian director reporting directly to the Secretary of the Army will oversee criminal probes. The Provost Marshal and the Military Police will no longer undertake criminal investigations. A new branch like those in the Air Force and Navy for Special Agents will be instituted. FORSCOM now requires the selection of investigating officers from outside an installation&#x27;s brigade-sized element, which is processing a complaint.

More than 100 night vision goggles (NVGs) from an arms room were gradually stolen from March until May 2021. Several dozen were subsequently offered for sale on the internet from a reseller in Corpus Christi, Texas as of 9 July 2021; some devices had already been sold and shipped. CID and Homeland security believe the NVGs were stolen from shipping containers at Fort Hood.

===2023 renaming===
The fort is one of the U.S. Army installations named for Confederate soldiers that was renamed by The Naming Commission. On May 24, 2022 the commission recommended the fort be renamed to Fort Cavazos, named after Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, a native Texan and the US Army’s first Hispanic four-star general. The recommendation report was finalized and submitted to Congress on October 1, 2022, giving the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin the authority to rename the post to Fort Cavazos. On January 5, 2023, William A. LaPlante, US under-secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment (USD (A&amp;S)) directed the full implementation of the recommendations of the Naming Commission, DoD-wide. Fort Hood was officially renamed Fort Cavazos on May 9, 2023.

On May 4, 2023, Hood Army Airfield was renamed Yoakum–DeFrenn Army Heliport.

==Antiwar activity==
The post has served as a hub for antiwar activity during both the Vietnam War (e.g. the &quot;Fort Hood Three&quot; incident) and the War on Terror.

From 1968 to 1973, the Oleo Strut was a G.I. coffeehouse located near post in Killeen, Texas. The coffee house was featured in the documentary &quot;Sir! No Sir!&quot;.

In 2009, the tradition of the Oleo Strut continued when the Under the Hood Café opened. The location serves as an outreach center for antiwar activists to reach out to area soldiers, and provide them with support. Under the Hood Café announced on 10 November 2014 that it would close by the end of the year.

Recently several soldiers supported by Under the Hood have taken public acts of resistance, including Amnesty International prisoner of conscience Travis Bishop.

==Demographics==

Fort Cavazos first appeared under its original name Fort Hood as an unincorporated community in the 1970 U.S. Census and then as a census designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census. The CDP was renamed from Fort Hood to Fort Cavazos in 2023.

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 28,295 people, 2,893 households, and 2,720 families residing in the Fort Cavazos CDP.

As of the census of 2000, there were 33,711 people, 5,819 households, and 5,679 families residing in the Fort Cavazos CDP. The population density was 2,255.7 people per square mile (870.6/km2). There were 5,941 housing units at an average density of 397.5 per square mile (153.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 50.7% White, 31.6% African American, 1.2% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, 8.7% from other races, and 4.8% from two or more races. 16.7% of the population were Hispanics or Latinos of any race.

There were 5,818 households, out of which 87.6% had children under the age of eighteen living with them, 87.1% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.4% were non-families. Two percent of all households were made up of individuals, and 0.0% had someone living alone who is sixty-five years of age or older. The average household size was 3.92 and the average family size was 3.95.

The age distribution was 33.3% under the age of eighteen, 32.3% from eighteen to twenty-four, 33.1% from twenty-five to forty-four, 1.2% from forty-five to sixty-four, and 0.1% who were sixty-five years of age or older. The median age was twenty-one years. For every one hundred females there were 163.4 males. For every one hundred females over the age of eighteen there were 209.4 males. All of these statistics are typical for military bases.

The median income for a household on the base was $32,552, and the median income for a family was $32,296. Males had a median income of $18,884 versus $17,101 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $11,078. 9.5% of the population and 8.3% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 11.0% of those under the age of eighteen and 25.8% of those sixty-five and older were living below the poverty line.

==Military base==

Fort Cavazos is a large United States military installation; it is the home of III Armored Corps, 1st Cavalry Division, 13th Sustainment Command, First Army Division West, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Medical Brigade and many other Forces Command and other units.

The 4th Infantry Division completed its move from Fort Hood to Fort Carson, Colorado, exchanging positions with several units. The 4th Infantry Division Museum closed at Fort Hood for the last time on 29 May 2009 to complete its move to Colorado although most of the outdoor pieces remained at Fort Hood as part of the new 3CR Museum.

Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Fort Hood was billed as the largest military base in the free world (Fort Moore is larger in personnel, Fort Bliss in land area). During peacetime, Fort Hood is a gated post, with the 1st Cavalry Division Museum, the Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA), and a number of other facilities that are open to the public. Access to the cantonments became restricted starting in July 2001. However, passes are available to visit the two museums on post, and the lake area remains open to the public without restriction since it is outside the cantonments. Various events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, which has one of the largest fireworks displays in the country, are open to the public.

Shortly after the 2000 census, responsibility for post housing was turned over to privatized partnership with Actus Lend Lease. Under the terms of the contract, most of the housing has been remodeled or rebuilt, and hundreds of new units have been built or are in the process of being built, operating as Fort Hood Family Housing, and later as Cavalry Family Housing. The nine schools on Fort Cavazos are part of the Killeen Independent School District.

Fort Cavazos consists of three sections: the main cantonment, West Fort Hood, and North Fort Hood. The main cantonment is bounded by Killeen on the east and Copperas Cove on the west. The Fort Cavazos main cantonment area, otherwise referred to as Main post, holds its own airfield, Yoakum–DeFrenn Army Heliport. North Fort Hood is bounded by Gatesville to the northwest. West Fort Hood, bounded by Killeen and Copperas Cove, includes Fort Cavazos&#x27; second airfield, Robert Gray Army Airfield, which has been expanded for civilian use (Killeen Regional Airport (GRK)) and additional training areas. To the east and southeast, the reservation is bounded by Harker Heights, Nolanville, Belton, and Morgan&#x27;s Point Resort.

<text>Cibolo is a city in Guadalupe and Bexar counties in Texas, United States. It is part of the San Antonio–New Braunfels metropolitan statistical area. Cibolo voted to become an independent township on October 9, 1965. As of the 2020 census, Cibolo had a population of 32,276, up from 15,349 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Cibolo voted to become an independent township on October 9, 1965; the &quot;City Fathers&quot; were Mayor M.O. Grooms, Councilman Carl Biser, Councilman Ted Dykes, Councilman Alwin Lieck, Councilman Fred Niemietz, and Councilman D.O. Trotti. 

Before the first European settlers arrived, the Comanche and several other Native American tribes lived in Cibolo. The name &quot;Cibolo&quot; means &quot;buffalo&quot;. The community first established when the Southern Pacific Railroad cut through the area en route to major cities such as Houston and San Antonio. Over time, Cibolo developed into the suburb it is today.

In 1867, George Schlather built a store on land purchased by his father Jacob. In 1882, the Schlathers sold the store to Charles Fromme, who renamed it Fromme&#x27;s Store. The community also became known by this name. In 1877, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway station serving the area was called Cibolo Valley. In 1883, the US Post Office opened a branch in the town and called it Cibolo. By 1890, its population was 100 people.

Beginning in the 21st century, Cibolo has experienced high levels of growth, increasing 733% since 2000, when the population was 3,035 people. Between 2000 and 2010, the population increased 545% to 19,580 people. As Cibolo has grown, its share of the county population has also increased. In 2000, Cibolo accounted for only 3.4% of Guadalupe County&#x27;s population, but between 2000 and 2010, Cibolo captured 38.9% of the county&#x27;s growth, and its share of the population increased to 14.9%. Between 2010 and 2013, Cibolo acquired 22.3% of the growth in Guadalupe County, and today Cibolo accounts for 17% of the county&#x27;s population.

==Geography==
Cibolo is in western Guadalupe County, on the north side of Cibolo Creek. A small portion of the city, south of West Schaefer Road, crosses a bend of Cibolo Creek to enter Bexar County. Santa Clara and Marion border Cibolo to the east. New Berlin, Zuehl, and St. Hedwig border Cibolo to the south. Schertz borders Cibolo to the north and west. The city of New Braunfels is to the northeast, and downtown San Antonio is to the southwest.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Cibolo has a total area of , of which , or 0.07%, is covered by water.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
* Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is about an hour away via I-35.
* San Antonio International Airport is 30 minutes away via I-35 and I-410.

===Major thoroughfares===
* Interstate 35, Duluth-Des Moines-Kansas City-Wichita-Oklahoma City-DFW Metroplex-Austin-Cibolo-San Antonio-Laredo
* Interstate 10, Jacksonville-Houston-Cibolo-San Antonio-Fort Stockton-El Paso-Los Angeles
* , Kirby-I 35-Randolph AFB-Cibolo-Marion-McQueeney-Seguin
* , Cibolo
* The proposed Cibolo Parkway as an extension of FM 1103. The Parkway would create a direct route from I-35 to I-10.

==== Cibolo Parkway (Proposed) ====
In 2006, the City of Cibolo incorporated mobility needs into the Cibolo Future Land Use Map, Future Thoroughfare Plan, and Capital Improvement Plan.

In 2007, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) completed a study for a possible FM 1103 extension in Cibolo south to I-10. However, TxDOT determined that right-of-way acquisition issues and funding precluded such an extension for the near future. The biggest hurdles included crossing floodplains and an overpass over both FM78 and the Union Pacific Railroad.

In 2015, with explosive development in the FM 1103 area continuing, the Cibolo City Council stated they wanted to investigate options to build the extension and it formed a blue-ribbon committee of citizens to study the matter. In 2016, the committee recommended a private-public partnership to develop the road as a tollway.

In 2017, the Cibolo City Council approved an agreement with the Texas Turnpike Corporation (TTC) to move forward with the project. As of early 2018, the TTC is still conducting its feasibility study for the road to see if it is a viable project for them. 
In the agreement, the City of Cibolo would own the road, while TTC would finance the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the estimated $125 million and roughly 11-mile roadway. In exchange, TTC would collect tolls from roadway users for 50 years. At one point TTC projected the toll rate to be $0.20 a mile, with exemption for city-owned vehicles.

On January 14, 2020, the Cibolo City Council voted unanimously to terminate the agreement between the City and TTC and Cibolo Turnpike, LP (CTLP), drawing demands for mediation from CTLP.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, 32,276 people, 9,106 households, and 7,863 families were residing in the city.

As of the census of 2000, 3,035 people, 1,092 households, and 848 families were residing in the city. The population density was . The 1,176 housing units had an average density of .

Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 19.01% of the population.

Of the 1,092 households, 42.8% had children under 18 living with them, 65.3% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.3% were not families. About 19.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.0% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.78, and the average family size was 3.19.

In the city, the age distribution was 29.4% under 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 35.6% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 6.2% who were 65 or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.8 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 90.3 males.

By the mid-2010s, Cibolo was one of the fastest-growing small cities in the United States, experiencing a nearly 900% increase in population since 2000 and growing from 3,000 to the current estimate of about 30,000 residents. Actual figures are disputed, however, due to such a huge explosion of population in such a short period of time. This has caused problems in the city, due to such unanticipated growth making developments difficult to keep up with the rapidly increasing population, and a limited amount of land.

<text>Frederick III (Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl; 18 October 183115 June 1888), or Friedrich III, was German Emperor and King of Prussia for 99 days between March and his death in June 1888, during the Year of the Three Emperors.

Known informally as &quot;Fritz&quot;, he was the only son of Emperor  Wilhelm I and was raised in his family&#x27;s tradition of military service. Following the unification of Germany in 1871 his father, then King of Prussia, became German Emperor. Upon Wilhelm&#x27;s death at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888, the thrones passed to Frederick, who had been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years. Frederick was suffering from cancer of the larynx when he died at the age of 56, following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition.

Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, the oldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology led them to support progressive and democratic reform. Despite his family&#x27;s conservative and militaristic background, Frederick had developed liberal tendencies as a result of his ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As crown prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck&#x27;s policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the executive be curbed to the benefit of the Reichstag. Liberals in both Germany and Great Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick would move to institute democratic reforms in the German Empire.

Frederick and Victoria were great admirers of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband. They planned to rule as joint monarchs, as had Princess Victoria&#x27;s parents, and to reform what they saw as flaws in the government. Fredrick planned to institute responsible government, transforming the Empire into a liberal constitutional monarchy inspired by Britain, with ministers bound to the instructions of the Reichstag, rather than the Emperor. However, Frederick&#x27;s illness prevented him from effectively establishing policies and measures to achieve this, and such moves as he was able to make were later abandoned by his son and successor, Wilhelm II. The timing of Frederick&#x27;s death and the brevity of his reign are important topics among historians. His premature demise is considered a potential turning point in German history; and whether or not he would have made the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still a popular discussion among historians.

==Personal life==

===Early life and education===

Frederick William was born in the New Palace at Potsdam in Prussia on 18 October 1831. He was a scion of the House of Hohenzollern, rulers of Prussia, then the most powerful of the German states. Frederick&#x27;s father, Prince Wilhelm, was the second son of King Frederick Wilhelm III and, having been raised in the military traditions of the Hohenzollerns, developed into a strict disciplinarian. William fell in love with his cousin Elisa Radziwill, a princess of the Polish nobility, but the court felt Elisa&#x27;s rank was not suitable for the bride of a Prussian prince and forced a more suitable match. The woman selected to be his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar, had been raised in the more intellectual and artistic atmosphere of Weimar, which gave its citizens greater participation in politics and limited the powers of its rulers through a constitution; Augusta was well known across Europe for her liberal views. Because of their differences, the couple did not have a happy marriage and, as a result, Frederick grew up in a troubled household, which left him with memories of a lonely childhood. He had one sister, Louise (later Grand Duchess of Baden), who was seven years his junior and very close to him. Frederick also had a very good relationship with his uncle, the future King Frederick William IV, who has been called &quot;the romantic on the throne&quot;.

Known informally as &quot;Fritz&quot;, Frederick grew up during a tumultuous political period as the concept of liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, and to create a German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick&#x27;s life.

Despite the value placed by the Hohenzollern family on a traditional military education, Augusta insisted that her son also receive a classical education. Accordingly, Frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and the liberal arts. His private tutor was Ernst Curtius, a famous archaeologist. Frederick was a talented student, particularly good at foreign languages, becoming fluent in English and French, and studying Latin. He also studied history, geography, physics, music and religion, and excelled at gymnastics; as required of a Prussian prince, he became a very good rider. Hohenzollern princes were made familiar with the military traditions of their dynasty at an early age; Frederick was ten when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the First Guard Infantry Regiment of Foot. As he grew older, he was expected to maintain an active involvement in military affairs. However, at the age of 18, he broke with family tradition and entered the University of Bonn where he studied history, law and governance, and public policy. During his time at Bonn (1850–1852), his teachers included Ernst Moritz Arndt and Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. His time spent at the university, coupled with the influence of less conservative family members, were instrumental in his embrace of liberal beliefs.

The Prince was slightly injured in the 1851 Avenwedde rail accident.

In 1853, Frederick was initiated into Freemasonry by his father, then Prince William of Prussia, and would later become Master of the Order of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany. During his brief reign, he would serve as the patron of the German Freemasons.

===Marriage and family===

Royal marriages of the 19th century were arranged to secure alliances and to maintain blood ties among the European nations. As early as 1851, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her German-born husband, Prince Albert, were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband. They desired to maintain their family&#x27;s blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage would lead to the liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of both Victoria and Albert, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured Baron Stockmar&#x27;s idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia. Frederick&#x27;s father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a Russian grand duchess as his daughter-in-law. However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain. In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the Great Exhibition but in truth, she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert&#x27;s daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Princess Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.

Frederick proposed to Victoria in 1855, when she was 14 years old. The betrothal of the young couple was announced on 19 May 1857, at Buckingham Palace and the Prussian Court, and their marriage took place on 25 January 1858 in the Chapel Royal of St. James&#x27;s Palace, London. To mark the occasion, Frederick was promoted to major-general in the Prussian army. Although it was an arranged marriage, the newlyweds were compatible from the start and their marriage was a loving one; Victoria too had received a liberal education and shared her husband&#x27;s views. Of the two, Victoria was the dominant one in the relationship. The couple often resided at the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace and had eight children: Wilhelm in 1859, Charlotte in 1860, Henry in 1862, Sigismund in 1864, Victoria in 1866, Waldemar in 1868, Sophia in 1870 and Margaret in 1872. Sigismund died at the age of 2 and Waldemar at age 11, and their eldest son, Wilhelm, suffered from a withered arm—probably Erb&#x27;s Palsy due to his difficult and dangerous breech birth, although it could have also resulted from a mild case of cerebral palsy. Wilhelm, who became emperor after Frederick&#x27;s death, shared none of his parents&#x27; liberal ideas; his mother viewed him as a &quot;complete Prussian&quot;. This difference in ideology created a rift between Wilhelm and his parents (which was exacerbated by Bismarck&#x27;s interference), and relations between them were strained throughout their lives.

===Religion===
Emperor Frederick III was a Lutheran member of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces. It was a United Protestant denomination, bringing together Reformed and Lutheran believers.

==Crown Prince of Prussia==

When his father succeeded to the Prussian throne as King William I on 2 January 1861, Frederick became the Crown Prince. Already twenty-nine years old, he would be Crown Prince for a further twenty-seven years. The new king was initially considered politically neutral; Frederick and Prussia&#x27;s liberal elements hoped that he would usher in a new era of liberal policies. The liberals managed to greatly increase their majority in the Prussian Diet (&quot;Landtag&quot;), but William soon showed that he preferred the conservative ways. On the other hand, Frederick declared himself in complete agreement with the &quot;essential liberal policy for internal and foreign affairs&quot;. As Crown Prince, he had conflicts with Otto von Bismarck, the chancellor whom his father had appointed.

Because William was a dogmatic soldier and unlikely to change his ideas at the age of sixty-four, he regularly clashed with the Diet over policies. In September 1862, one such disagreement almost led to Frederick being crowned and replacing his father as king; William threatened to abdicate when the Diet refused to fund his plans for the army&#x27;s reorganization. Frederick was appalled by this action, and said that an abdication would &quot;constitute a threat to the dynasty, country and Crown&quot;. William reconsidered, and instead on the advice of Minister of War Albrecht von Roon appointed Otto von Bismarck, who had offered to push through the military reform even against the majority of the Diet, as Minister-President. The appointment of Bismarck, an authoritarian who would often ignore or overrule the Diet, set Frederick on a collision course with his father and led to his exclusion from affairs of state for the rest of William&#x27;s reign. Frederick insisted on bloodless &quot;moral conquests&quot;, unifying Germany by liberal and peaceful means, but it was Bismarck&#x27;s policy of blood and iron that prevailed. Frederick&#x27;s protests against Bismarck&#x27;s policies peaked at Danzig on 4 June 1863, where at an official reception in the city he loudly denounced Bismarck&#x27;s restrictions on freedom of the press. He thereby made Bismarck his enemy and his father extremely angry. Consequently, Frederick was excluded from positions of political power throughout his father&#x27;s reign. Retaining his military portfolio, he continued to represent Germany and its Emperor at ceremonies, weddings, and celebrations such as Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887. Frederick would spend a large portion of time in Britain, where Queen Victoria frequently allowed him to represent her at ceremonies and social functions.

Frederick fought in the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed military action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself. Frederick experienced his first combat in the Second Schleswig War. Appointed to supervise the supreme German Confederation commander Field Marshal Wrangel and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their Austrian allies defeated the Danes and conquered the southern part of Jutland, but after the war, they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the Austro-Prussian War. Frederick &quot;was the only member of the Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the Duke of Augustenberg and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as &quot;fratricide&quot;.&quot; Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, &quot;Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.&quot;

However, when war with Austria broke out, Frederick accepted command of one of Prussia&#x27;s three armies. He commanded the Second Army, with General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal as his chief of staff. At first, the Austrian Army defeated the Second Army in the Battle of Trautenau on 27 June 1866. However, next day, Frederick ordered his divisions to attack the Austrian X Corps from early in the morning, which brought Prussia&#x27;s victory. His plan was successful, leading the victory of Battle of Burkersdorf. On that day, when the two battles (Battle of Burkersdorf, and Battle of Skalitz) were fought by his Second Army, he was at Kosteletz in order to reach the battlefield easily. On 29 June, Frederick ordered his army to advance. He established his headquarters in Kaile. Now he reached the Elbe. On June 30, Helmuth von Moltke ordered him to station his army in the Elbe. At Moltke&#x27;s command, he didn&#x27;t order the advance but, from 8 o&#x27;clock on July 3, his troops started the advance. The timely arrival of his army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive Battle of Königgrätz, which won the war for Prussia. Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay. A few days before Königgrätz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: &quot;Who knows whether we may not have to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?&quot;
Four years later Frederick was in action again, this time during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, in which he was once more paired with Blumenthal and commanded the Third Army, consisting of troops from the southern German states by some political reasons. He was praised for his leadership after defeating the French at the battles of Wissembourg and Wörth, and met with further successes at the Battle of Sedan and during the siege of Paris. Frederick was promoted to field marshal on 28 October 1870. Frederick&#x27;s humane treatment of his country&#x27;s foes earned him their respect and the plaudits of neutral observers. After the Battle of Wörth, a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince&#x27;s many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds, extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick. Following his victory, Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists, &quot;I do not like war gentlemen. If I should reign I would never make it.&quot; One French journalist remarked that &quot;the Crown Prince has left countless traits of kindness and humanity in the land that he fought against.&quot; For his behaviour and accomplishments, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote a tribute to Frederick in July 1871, stating that &quot;the Prince has won as much honour for his gentleness as for his prowess in the war&quot;. After the war, Frederick was awarded with Grand Cross of the Iron Cross.

==Crown Prince of the German Empire==

In 1871, following Prussia&#x27;s victories, the German states were united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent to the new German monarchy. Although William thought the day when he became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father&#x27;s and Bismarck&#x27;s policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country&#x27;s liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire&#x27;s army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father&#x27;s effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin&#x27;s new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to contemplate suicide.

During an effort led, between 1879 and 1881, by the &quot;völkisch&quot; historian Heinrich von Treitschke and the court chaplain, Adolf Stoecker, to dis-emancipate German Jews, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were in opposition, Victoria writing that she saw &quot;Treitschke and his supporters as lunatics of the most dangerous sort&quot;, and opining that Pastor Stoecker properly belonged in an insane asylum. She went on to write that she felt ashamed of her adopted country because people like Treitschke and Stoecker &quot;behave so &quot;hatefully&quot; towards people of a different faith and another race who become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!&quot;. Clad in the uniform of a Prussian field marshal, Frederick, together with Victoria, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for tolerance in contrast to what Victoria called Treitschke&#x27;s &quot;disgraceful attacks&quot;. Shortly afterward, Frederick gave a speech denouncing the anti-Semitic movement in Germany as &quot;a shameful blot on our time&quot;, adding that &quot;We are ashamed of the &quot;Judenhetze&quot; [agitation against Jews] which has broken all bounds of decency in Berlin, but which seems to flourish under the protection of the Court clerics.&quot; In 1881, Frederick and Victoria again attended a synagogue service, this time in Wiesbaden &quot;to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are&quot;. Frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for &quot;poor, ill-treated Jews&quot; of Europe. Frederick&#x27;s mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, wrote to thank him for his speech, saying she was proud that her daughter had married someone like him, but within &quot;Junker&quot; circles, Frederick was widely criticised for his actions in support of the Jews. Prominent among the Crown Prince&#x27;s critics was his eldest son, Wilhelm, who called his father a weak, cowardly man controlled by his British wife and the Jews. Beyond Wilhelm, many of the &quot;reactionary and &#x27;chauvinistic&#x27; circles in Germany&quot; had, in the words of the British historian John C. G. Röhl, come to the &quot;conviction that the Crown Prince and his liberal English wife were an alien, un-German force that must not be allowed to accede to the throne&quot;.

==Illness and decline==

Frederick had been a heavy smoker for many years. At a ball held by William on 31 January 1887, a guest reported the Crown Prince &quot;was so hoarse that he could hardly say a word.&quot; His hoarseness continued through February, and was diagnosed as a thickening of the mucous membrane over the vocal cords, caused by &quot;a chronic laryngeal catarrh.&quot; On 7 February, Frederick consulted a doctor, Karl Gerhardt, who scraped a wire across the membrane for 10 days in an attempt to remove thickened tissue. After the procedure proved unsuccessful, Gerhardt cauterised the left vocal cord with an electric wire on 15 March in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a vocal fold nodule. Due to Frederick&#x27;s highly inflamed throat, Gerhardt was unable to remove the entire growth. After several cauterisations, and with no signs of improvement, Frederick and his wife went to the spa of Bad Ems, where he drank the mineral waters and underwent a regimen of gargles and inhaling fresh air, with no effect.

On 17 May, Gerhardt and other doctors, including Ernst von Bergmann, diagnosed the growth as laryngeal cancer. Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, Morell Mackenzie; he also recommended a thyrotomy to gain better access to the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx – a total laryngectomy – if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told. Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign epithelioma. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince&#x27;s palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment. Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a biopsy of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist Rudolf Virchow for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover &quot;in a few months.&quot; While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie&#x27;s opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick&#x27;s throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it. On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.

On 13 June, the Crown Prince left Potsdam for London to attend his mother-in-law&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and to consult Mackenzie. He never saw his father alive again. He was accompanied by Victoria and their three younger daughters, along with Gerhardt; on 29 June, Mackenzie reported that he had successfully operated at his Harley Street clinic, and had removed &quot;&quot;nearly&quot; the entire growth.&quot; Frederick spent July with his family at Norris Castle on the Isle of Wight. However, when Frederick visited Mackenzie&#x27;s office on 2 August for a follow-up examination, the growth had reappeared, necessitating its cauterisation the same day, and again on 8 August – an ominous indication that it was indeed malignant. Felix Semon, a distinguished German throat specialist with a practice in England, and who had been closely following Frederick&#x27;s case, submitted a report to the German Foreign Secretary in which he strongly criticised Mackenzie&#x27;s cauterisations, and gave his opinion that the growth, if not malignant, was suspect, and should continue to be biopsied and examined. On 9 August, Frederick travelled to Braemar in the Scottish Highlands with Dr. Mark Hovell, a senior surgeon at the Throat Hospital in London. Although a further examination by Mackenzie on 20 August revealed no sign of a recurrent growth, Frederick said he had the &quot;constant feeling&quot; of something &quot;not right inside&quot;; nonetheless, he asked Queen Victoria to knight Mackenzie, who duly received a knighthood in September.

Despite the operations on his throat and having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports that his father was gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick&#x27;s lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, consulted the distinguished laryngologist Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick&#x27;s throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie&#x27;s treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a &quot;momentary chill.&quot; However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick&#x27;s throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.
Upon arriving in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick&#x27;s throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting that if the Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him no more than three months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that &quot;Fritz&#x27;s throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety &amp; he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less.&quot; On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at Baveno on the shore of Lake Maggiore, with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick&#x27;s recovery &quot;in 3 or 4 months,&quot; wrote Victoria. Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick&#x27;s 56th birthday the following day. At the end of October, Frederick&#x27;s condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick&#x27;s throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was &quot;very hoarse again&quot; and easily became depressed about his health. General Alfred von Waldersee observed that Frederick&#x27;s health had grave implications as if William died soon and his son succeeded, &quot;a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one.&quot; His son Wilhelm reported to Albert, King of Saxony that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick&#x27;s throat was being treated by &quot;blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx.&quot;

On 3 November, Frederick and his entourage departed for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while there was no immediate danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had &quot;unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn,&quot; and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick&#x27;s disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared on the right side of the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, &quot;To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?&quot; Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering &quot;foreigner&quot; who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father &quot;whether he is ill or not, [and] whether the K[aiser] is then unable permanently to perform his duties,&quot; would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick&#x27;s condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who re-examined Frederick&#x27;s throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.

On 26 December 1887, Frederick wrote that his &quot;chronic catarrh&quot; appeared to be taking &quot;a turn for the better&quot;, and that &quot;a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!&quot; A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected right side of his throat becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and &quot;embarrassing bouts of suffocation&quot;. A tracheal tube was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Bergmann almost killed Frederick by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann&#x27;s actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick&#x27;s neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask &quot;Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?&quot; and complain that &quot;Bergmann ill-treated [me]&quot;.

Even after the tracheotomy, Frederick continued to run high fevers and suffered from headaches and insomnia. His violent coughing continued, bringing up bloody sputum. Apart from Mackenzie, the other doctors, led by Bergmann, now held the firm opinion that the Crown Prince&#x27;s disease was cancer and that it had possibly spread to his lungs. The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer was conclusively confirmed on 6 March, when the anatomist Professor Wilhelm Waldeyer, who had come to San Remo, examined Frederick&#x27;s sputum under a microscope and confirmed the presence of &quot;so-called cancroid bodies...from a cancerous new growth&quot; in the larynx. He further said that there were no signs of any growths in the lungs. Though it finally settled the question, Waldeyer&#x27;s diagnosis threw all of Mackenzie&#x27;s treatment of Frederick into doubt. The diagnosis and treatment of Frederick&#x27;s fatal illness caused some medical controversy well into the next century.
==Brief reign and death==

Three days after Frederick was confirmed to be suffering from cancer, his father Emperor William I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on 9 March 1888, upon which Frederick became German Emperor and King of Prussia. His son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news to his father in Italy. Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, &quot;...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Emperor! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense.&quot; Germany&#x27;s progressive elements hoped that William&#x27;s death, and thus Frederick&#x27;s succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines. Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered a continuation of the old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia. The new emperor reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his &quot;pitiful&quot; appearance. The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve. In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his uniform tunic and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as empress. Too ill to march in his father&#x27;s funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.

As the German Emperor, he officially received Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, and attended the wedding of his son Prince Henry to his niece Princess Irene. However, Frederick reigned for only 99 days, and was unable to bring about much lasting change. The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick III&#x27;s reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm II to the throne. An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect, although he did force Robert von Puttkamer to resign as Prussian Minister of the Interior on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the Reichstag elections. Dr. Mackenzie wrote that the emperor had &quot;an almost overwhelming sense of the duties of his position&quot;. In a letter to Lord Napier, Empress Victoria wrote &quot;The Emperor is able to attend to his business, and do a great deal, but not being able to speak is, of course, most trying.&quot; Frederick had the fervour but not the time to accomplish his desires, lamenting in May 1888, &quot;I cannot die ... What would happen to Germany?&quot;

From April 1888, Frederick became so weak he was unable to walk, and was largely confined to his bed; his continual coughing brought up large quantities of pus. In early June, the cancer spread to and perforated his esophagus, preventing him from eating. He suffered from bouts of vomiting and ran high fevers, but remained alert enough to write a last diary entry on 11 June: &quot;What&#x27;s happening to me? I &quot;must&quot; get well again; I have &quot;so&quot; much to do!&quot; Frederick III died in Potsdam at 11:30 a.m. on 15 June 1888, and was succeeded by his 29-year-old son Wilhelm II. Frederick III is buried in a mausoleum attached to the Friedenskirche in Potsdam. After his death, William Ewart Gladstone described him as the &quot;Barbarossa of German liberalism&quot;. Empress Victoria went on to continue spreading Frederick&#x27;s thoughts and ideals throughout Germany, but no longer had power within the government. His premature demise is considered a potential turning point in German history.
==Legacy==
Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and successes during the Second Schleswig, Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars, he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct. Frederick believed a state should not act against the popular opinion of its inhabitants. He had a long history of liberalism, and had discussed his ideas and intentions with Victoria and others before his reign. Admiring Prince Albert and the British parliamentary system, Frederick and his wife planned to rule as co-monarchs and liberalize Germany through the appointment of more liberal ministers. They intended to severely limit the office of Chancellor, and reorganize Germany to include many elements of British liberalism. Many historians, including William Harbutt Dawson and Erich Eyck, consider that Frederick&#x27;s early death put an end to the development of liberalism within the German Empire. They believe that, given a longer reign and better health, Frederick might indeed have transformed Germany into a more liberal democratic country, and prevented its militaristic path toward war. Dr. J. McCullough claims that Frederick would have averted World War I—and by extension the resulting Weimar Republic—while other historians such as Michael Balfour go even further by postulating that, as the end of World War I directly affected the state of the world&#x27;s development, the liberal German Emperor might also have prevented the rise of Adolf Hitler and by extent, preventing the outbreak of World War II. Author Michael Freund states outright that both world wars would have been averted had Frederick lived longer. Frederick&#x27;s life inspired historian Frank Tipton to speculate: &quot;What would have happened had his father died sooner or if he himself had lived longer?&quot;
Other historians, including Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, oppose the idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe that he would not have dared to oppose both his father&#x27;s legacy and Bismarck to change Germany&#x27;s course. A natural soldier, he was steeped in his family&#x27;s strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William&#x27;s and Bismarck&#x27;s policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick&#x27;s liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.

Frederick&#x27;s children—Wilhelm in particular—held various political positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced the horrors of war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family&#x27;s military heritage, coming under Bismarck&#x27;s tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick&#x27;s and Victoria&#x27;s liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents. Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government; shortly after his father&#x27;s death he proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I, and made no reference to Frederick III. Wilhelm II abandoned all of his father&#x27;s policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.

Bismarck&#x27;s plan of undermining Frederick and Victoria, and of using Wilhelm II as a tool for retaining his own power, led to his own downfall. As it turned out, Wilhelm did share his father&#x27;s conviction that the position of the chancellor was too strong and should be modified in favour of a more powerful Emperor. Bismarck only realized this when Wilhelm II was about to dismiss him:

Churches honouring Frederick include the Kaiser-Friedrich-Gedächtniskirche in Berlin and the former Kalthof Church in Königsberg (Kaliningrad, Russia). Mount Frederick William in the Jervis Inlet area of the British Columbia Coast in Canada is named in his honour.

Frederick &quot;described the Imperial Constitution as &quot;ingeniously contrived chaos.&quot;&quot; According to Michael Balfour:

<text>Schertz ( ) is a city in Guadalupe, Bexar, and Comal counties in the U.S. state of Texas, within the metropolitan area. The population was 42,002 at the 2020 census, up from 31,465 at the 2010 census. Schertz was settled by Alsatian emigrants in the 1800s.

==History==

Schertz is the third-largest city in the San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan area and the largest city of the Randolph Metrocom, which consists of cities surrounding Randolph Air Force Base. The Metrocom is located on San Antonio&#x27;s far northeast side. In addition to Schertz, other Randolph Metrocom communities include Live Oak, Kirby, Converse, Marion, Cibolo, Universal City, Windcrest, Garden Ridge, and Selma. These towns are located in Comal, Bexar, and Guadalupe counties and combined have a total of 355,000 residents and growing rapidly.

Since the late 1990s, Schertz experienced substantial growth. In five years, from 2000 to 2005, the city&#x27;s population jumped from 18,694 to 26,463. In 2006 alone, the population rose from 26,463 to 34,000.

The first settlers came to Schertz around 1843. Some of the families on the immediate land surrounding Schertz were the Boettigers, Schertzs, Schneiders, Seilers, Maskes, and Mergeles. Members of the Schertz family still reside in the city. The first name of Schertz was &quot;Cibolo Pit&quot;, then &quot;Cut Off&quot;, thus named because when Cibolo Creek flooded, the settlement was cut off.

The first settlers planted wheat, oats, and corn, which did not need special equipment to harvest and process. In later years, cotton was planted, and proved to be a productive cash crop. In 1870, the first gin was built by the Schertz family. It was powered by mules and then later by steam. This gin was located where the post office is at the present time. The second cotton gin built by Weyel and Kallies was between First and Second streets. In later years, there also was a corn sheller and lumber yard. The first school, built in 1890, was across Cibolo Creek where the Randolph Stables are now located. In 1917 a new two-story brick school was built, later torn down to make room for the O&#x27;Henry School. The land for the school was donated by Adolph Schertz.

In 1876, one of the largest boosts to Schertz came when the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railroad was built through the town. This gave the people a chance to travel to San Antonio by rail instead of wagon or buggy, besides goods being shipped in and out. The first post office was established in 1882. At that time Schertz was still known as Cut Off. In 1899 it officially became Schertz. Sebastian Schertz owned and operated a general store when the railroad was constructed.

A big and very active shooting club was located on the site that is now the City Park. There was an annual shooting tournament called &quot;Koenig Schiessen&quot; or &quot;King Shoot&quot;. This was a two-day affair with people coming from San Antonio by train. The last night, a big dance was held to close the event for that year. A piece of live coal, blown from a switch engine that was carrying gravel cars to or from the rock crusher, is believed to have blown on the shingle roof of the dance hall, setting it on fire and completely destroying it. It was later rebuilt, but eventually the club disbanded. The rockcrusher was at one time located in Cibolo Creek across from the public utilities of the city of Schertz. This was destroyed in 1913 when Cibolo Creek had its biggest recorded flood.

The first church in Schertz is the present day United Methodist Church on First Street. One of the oldest business buildings, the red brick building on Main Street, was built by Willie Schertz. It is now a plumbing and hardware store and Masonic meeting place. It was the first mercantile store. On the site of the present-day Schertz Bank, a two-story hotel, a five-room hospital and drug store complex was built in 1909. The hotel was built by Henry Ebert. Dr. Watson was the resident doctor. This doctor used two methods of transportation to see his patients, a horse-drawn hack for good roads and horseback for emergencies in bad weather and long distances. In 1917 another red brick hospital on Main Street was built by Dr. C.M. Cotham and Miss Cora Karbach, a nurse. It served the surrounding communities for many years and is now an old apartment house. The first bank was chartered in 1913, and one of the first bankers was Mr. Glass. He organized the National Home Guard during World War I, which drilled at night in the second story of the building that at the present time is the Masonic Lodge meeting place.

Randolph Field (now Randolph Air Force Base) was a boon to Schertz in the late 1920s. Farm land was bought as the Air Corps needed for the air academy (the &quot;West Point of the Air&quot;), which opened in 1930. There were three sites considered. The present site was chosen because there was less fog in the area and the fog lifted earlier in the day, which meant more flying time. All of this boosted the economy not only for Schertz and the surrounding communities but also for the areas of New Braunfels, Seguin, and San Antonio.

The V.F.W. of Schertz was chartered in 1946. The first fire protection was from the Randolph Field Fire Department. Schertz businesses and citizens organized a fire department, and the first business meeting of the Schertz Fire Department was February 8, 1956. Archie Woodward was the first fire chief. A combination fire station and city hall were built, and the Schertz library is now in this building. A new library has recently been built next to the previous library. Schertz was incorporated as a city by the state of Texas in 1958.

==Geography==
The original center of Schertz is located in western Guadalupe County. City Hall, located at 1400 Schertz Parkway, is also in Guadalupe County. Large tracts of the city now extend north into Comal County and south into Bexar County. Cibolo Creek, forming the boundary between Guadalupe and Bexar counties, runs through the city just south of the historic downtown. Schertz is bordered by Cibolo to the east, a narrow strip of San Antonio to the south along Interstate 10, Converse and Randolph AFB to the southwest, Universal City and Selma to the west, Garden Ridge to the north, and New Braunfels to the northeast.

Interstate 35 runs through the northern part of the city, with access from exits 174 through 180. I-35 runs southeast to downtown San Antonio and from the northeastern city limits to the center of New Braunfels.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Schertz has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.63%, is water.

A portion of the property of Randolph Field extends beyond the limits of the titular census-designated place, into the Schertz city limits.

A large number of Schertz&#x27;s population is connected with the military due to the presence of adjacent Randolph Air Force Base and nearby Fort Sam Houston and Lackland Air Force Base, which can result in some degree of population turnover due to the transient nature of military service.

<text>Selma is a city in Bexar, Comal, and Guadalupe counties in Texas, United States. It is part of the San Antonio metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 10,952 at the 2020 census, up from 5,540 at the 2010 census. Selma was settled by German and Polish immigrants in the mid-1800s.

The Retama Park horse-racing track is located in Selma.

==History==

Selma was settled in 1847 by immigrants from several European countries. The name Selma is a traditional German feminine name. In 1849, the Harrison and Brown stagecoach stop was built in Selma to handle passengers and freight on the San Antonio to Austin stagecoach line. John Harrison and his wife Martha moved to Selma in 1852, and he became the first postmaster of the town when the post office opened in 1856. Harrison was also co-owner of the Harrison and McCulloch stage line, which ran a postal route through Selma. Harrison&#x27;s house still stands by Cibolo Creek, where it was built and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

German and Polish immigrants constituted most of the next wave of immigrants who settled in the area. By 1885, the population was 145, and at the turn of the century, the population peaked at 600. The population went into a rapid decline, so much so that by 1906, the post office was closed. Selma&#x27;s population dropped to 100 in 1940. The city incorporated in 1964 and has seen tremendous growth along the Interstate 35 corridor since 2000.

The Retama Racing Park opened in 1995, and The Forum, a 110-shop outdoor mall, opened in 2000. The old Harrison and Brown stagecoach stop was restored and rechristened the Selma Stage Stop, along with a visitor center and park.

Today, Selma is a bustling suburb of San Antonio, but it retains its German and European heritage in its name and in the descendants of Europeans who still call this town home.

<text>Valley Mills is a city in Bosque and McLennan counties in central Texas, United States. The population was 1,229 at the 2020 census.

The McLennan County portion of Valley Mills is part of the Waco Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Valley Mills was named for a flour mill established on the banks of the Bosque River in 1867 by Dr. E.P. Booth and Asbury Stegall.

In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (GC&amp;SF) laid tracks a mile south of the community, across the Bosque River. Merchants, hoping to benefit from the railroad, began moving their stores across the river, to the tracks.

On February 17, 1882, a cyclone (tornado) hit the new townsite, destroying a large number of buildings. Nevertheless, the remaining residents from the community&#x27;s original site moved across the river and rebuilt their homes. Thus, by the end of 1882 Valley Mills had extended into McLennan County.

Dairy farming and stock raising were the principal industries of the community. By 1900, however, the railroad and the nearby Chisholm Trail had made Valley Mills a prosperous retail and trading center for Bosque and McLennan counties. The community&#x27;s population reached 855 by 1905. Like many rural Texas communities, Valley Mills declined during the 1930s. Following World War II, however, as farm prices increased and ranching prospered, the economy grew, and the population, which had declined to 803 by 1937, increased to 1,037 by the mid-1950s. During the next three decades Valley Mills maintained its position as a leading retail market and shipping point for Bosque and McLennan counties.

The town was hit by an F-5 tornado on May 6, 1973, nearly 20 years after the infamous 1953 Waco Tornado, and despite its F-5 rating, there were no deaths in the Valley Mills tornado.

In 1984, it had a newspaper, a municipal airport, more than 25 businesses, several dairy farms and ranches, and a population of 1,236. A new school was opened in 1988; it and four churches were the social centers of the community. In 1990, the population was 1,085. In 2010, the population was 1,203.

<text>Pearland ( ) is a city in Brazoria County, with portions extending into Fort Bend and Harris counties, in Texas, United States. The city of Pearland is a principal city within the metropolitan statistical area. At the 2020 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population was 125,828, up from a population of 91,252 at the 2010 census. Pearland&#x27;s population growth rate from 2000 to 2010 was 142 percent, which ranked Pearland as the 15th-fastest-growing city in the U.S. during that time period, compared to other cities with a population of 10,000 or greater in 2000. Pearland is the third-largest city in the Greater Houston area after Houston and Pasadena, Texas.

==History==
Pearland had its beginnings near a siding switch on the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in 1882. When a post office was established in 1893, the community was named &quot;Mark Belt&quot;. On September 24, 1894, the plat of &quot;Pear-Land&quot; was filed with the Brazoria County courthouse by Witold von Zychlinski, a man of Polish nobility. At the time Pearland had many fruits harvested by residents. Zychlinski saw the pear trees and decided that &quot;Pearland&quot; would make a good name for the community.

In the 1800s, Pearland consisted of prairie. Residents harvested fruit and vegetables such as cantaloupes, corn, figs, pears and watermelons. Pearland was promoted by developers Allison &amp; Richey Land Company as an &quot;agricultural Eden&quot;. The first subdivision was called &quot;Suburban Gardens&quot;.

The Galveston hurricane of 1900 and the Galveston hurricane of 1915 destroyed most of the city&#x27;s fruit trees and slowed growth for a considerable period of time, and caused a period of desertification in the area. In 1914, with agriculture rebounding and the end of desertification, Pearland had a population of 400, but a devastating freeze in 1918 was another setback to the local farming enterprises. Oil was discovered nearby in 1934, which led to the development of the Hastings Oilfield, though it did not spur much growth, as the population fluctuated between 150 and 350. In the 1930s and 1940s, Pearland had many dance halls and beer joints that entertained people from the Hastings and Manvel oil fields.

From the 1970s, the town has grown to its present-day population. By 1990, the city limits had extended into Harris County. In the 1990s, home developers began buying large tracts of land, changing the geography of the city. Former rice fields filled with houses. The historic town center of Pearland is at the intersection of Texas State Highway 35/Main and Broadway. West Pearland has a lot of suburban development, while East Pearland has older houses and, according to Maggie Galehouse of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Pearland&#x27;s &quot;rural roots still show&quot; in the east side. Pearland&#x27;s main east–west corridor is Farm to Market Road 518/Broadway.
