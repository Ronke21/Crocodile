<text>The Apollo Lunar Module (LM ), originally designated the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), was the lunar lander spacecraft that was flown between lunar orbit and the Moon&#x27;s surface during the United States&#x27; Apollo program. It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.

Structurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the two-stage Lunar Module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the Apollo command and service module (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the Lunar Module from lunar orbit to the Moon&#x27;s surface. During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then flew back to the command module, after which it was also discarded.

Overseen by Grumman, the LM&#x27;s development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Regardless, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo–Saturn space vehicle. The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.65 billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.29 billion using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.

Ten Lunar Modules were launched into space. Of these, six were landed by humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two flown were tests in low Earth orbit: Apollo 5, without a crew; and Apollo 9 with a crew. A third test flight in low lunar orbit was Apollo 10, a dress rehearsal for the first landing, conducted on Apollo 11. The Apollo 13 Lunar Module functioned as a lifeboat to provide life support and propulsion to keep the crew alive for the trip home, when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion &quot;en route&quot; to the Moon.

The six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10&#x27;s &quot;Snoopy&quot;) was discarded in a heliocentric orbit after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit. The other three LMs were destroyed during controlled re-entry in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere: the four stages of Apollo 5 and Apollo 9 each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13&#x27;s &quot;Aquarius&quot; re-entered as a unit.

==Operational profile==
At launch, the Lunar Module sat directly beneath the command and service module (CSM) with legs folded, inside the Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA) attached to the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the trans-lunar injection (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.

Soon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM performed a maneuver whereby it separated, turned around, came back to dock with the Lunar Module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the Lunar Module pilot entered the LM to power up temporarily and test all systems except propulsion. The Lunar Module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.

After achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the Lunar Module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the landing gear, the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM&#x27;s perilune to within about of the surface, about uprange of the landing site.

As the craft approached perilune, the descent engine was started again to begin powered descent. During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft&#x27;s forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about , then, in the final approach phase, down to about . During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.

Astronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach. The final landing phase began about uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough propellant to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut&#x27;s suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.

The original extravehicular activity plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside &quot;to maintain communications&quot;. Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.

Beginning with Apollo 14, extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.

When ready to leave the Moon, the LM&#x27;s ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon&#x27;s surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a heliocentric orbit. The Apollo 11 ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.

==History==

The Lunar Module (originally designated the Lunar Excursion Module, known by the acronym LEM) was designed after NASA chose to reach the Moon via Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) instead of the direct ascent or Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.

===Contract letting and construction location===
In July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. Grumman was awarded the contract officially on November 7, 1962. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350 million. There were initially four major subcontractors: Bell Aerosystems (ascent engine), Hamilton Standard (environmental control systems), Marquardt (reaction control system) and Rocketdyne (descent engine).

The Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS) was developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory; the Apollo Guidance Computer was manufactured by Raytheon (a similar guidance system was used in the command module). A backup navigation tool, the Abort Guidance System (AGS), was developed by TRW. The landing gear was manufactured by Héroux. 

The Apollo Lunar Module was assembled in a Grumman factory in Bethpage, New York.

===Design phase===

The Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer Thomas J. Kelly. The first LEM design looked like a smaller version of the Apollo command and service module (a cone-shaped cabin atop a cylindrical propulsion section) with folding legs. The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats to improve the astronauts&#x27; visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.

As the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky extra-vehicular activity spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch ().

The configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from Space Technology Laboratories (TRW) in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was cancelled.

Power was initially to be produced by fuel cells built by Pratt and Whitney similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.

The initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.

In June 1966, the name was changed to Lunar Module (LM), eliminating the word &quot;excursion&quot;. According to George Low, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, this was because NASA was afraid that the word &quot;excursion&quot; might lend a frivolous note to Apollo. Despite the name change, the astronauts and other NASA and Grumman personnel continued to pronounce the abbreviation as () instead of the letters &quot;L-M&quot;.

===Astronaut training===
Comparing landing on the Moon to &quot;a hovering operation&quot;, Gus Grissom said in 1963 that although most early astronauts were fighter pilots, &quot;now we&#x27;re wondering if the pilot making this first moon landing shouldn&#x27;t be a highly experienced helicopter pilot&quot;. To allow astronauts to learn lunar landing techniques, NASA contracted Bell Aerosystems in 1964 to build the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV), which used a gimbal-mounted vertical jet engine to counter five-sixths of its weight to simulate the Moon&#x27;s gravity, in addition to its own hydrogen peroxide thrusters to simulate the LM&#x27;s descent engine and attitude control. Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the Dryden Flight Research Center led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV&#x27;s were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong.

===Development flights===
LM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a Saturn IB. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM&#x27;s development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1&#x27;s flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as Apollo 5. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.

LM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until Apollo 9 on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was cancelled to keep the program timeline on track. Apollo 10 launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff. The LM descended to above the lunar surface, then jettisoned the descent stage and used its ascent engine to return to the CSM.

===Production flights===

The first crewed lunar landing occurred on July 20, 1969, in the Apollo 11 LM-5 &quot;Eagle&quot;. Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the command module &quot;Columbia&quot; splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s goal: &quot;...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth&quot;.

This was followed by landings by Apollo 12 (LM-6 &quot;Intrepid&quot;) and Apollo 14 (LM-8 &quot;Antares&quot;). In April 1970, the Apollo 13 LM-7 &quot;Aquarius&quot; saved the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured, disabling the CSM. &quot;Aquarius&quot; served as a &quot;lifeboat&quot; for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its descent stage engine was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module&#x27;s batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean on April 17, 1970. The LM&#x27;s systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including two depressurization and repressurization cycles, causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without pressurization cycles and loss of oxygen).

Hover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its perilune back to the normal .

===Extended J-class missions===

The Extended Lunar Module (ELM) used on the final three &quot;J-class missions&quot;—Apollo 15, 16, and 17—was upgraded. The descent engine thrust was increased by the addition of a extension to the engine bell, and the descent propellant tanks were enlarged. A waste storage tank was added to the descent stage, with plumbing from the ascent stage. These upgrades allowed stays of up to 75 hours on the Moon. The Lunar Roving Vehicle was folded up and carried in Quadrant 1 of the descent stage. It was deployed by the astronauts after landing.

==Specifications==


&quot;Weights given here are an average for the original pre-ELM spec vehicles.&quot;

===Ascent stage===

The ascent stage contained the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contained its own ascent propulsion system (APS) engine and two hypergolic propellant tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the Apollo command and service module. It also contained a reaction control system (RCS) for attitude and translation control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward extravehicular activity hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.

Internal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a very high frequency (VHF) communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a unified S-band system and steerable parabolic dish antenna for communication with Earth; an extravehicular activity antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts&#x27; Portable Life Support Systems through the LM; primary (PGNCS) and backup (AGS) guidance and navigation systems; an Alignment Optical Telescope for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and a system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.

During rest periods, while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung across the cabin. The return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as on Apollo 17), plus their exposed photographic film.

===Descent stage===

The descent stage&#x27;s primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a throttleable Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine with four hypergolic propellant tanks. A continuous-wave Doppler radar antenna was mounted by the engine heat shield on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing.

Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized Kapton foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the &quot;porch&quot;) in front of the ascent stage&#x27;s extravehicular activity hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin and the surface. The landing pad of each leg incorporated a surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)

Equipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the modular equipment stowage assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut&#x27;s surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A United States flag for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.

The Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (later the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package) was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened, looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that communications were being received using the LM&#x27;s S-band antenna but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled Modular Equipment Transporter (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions (Apollo 15 and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement Portable Life Support System (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters to purge carbon dioxide from the LM.

==Proposed derivatives==
=== Apollo Telescope Mount ===

One proposed Apollo application was an orbital solar telescope constructed from a surplus LM with its descent engine replaced with a telescope controlled from the ascent stage cabin, the landing legs removed and four &quot;windmill&quot; solar panels extending from the descent stage quadrants. This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn IB, and docked with a crewed command and service module, named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).

This idea was later transferred to the original wet workshop design for the &quot;Skylab&quot; orbital workshop and renamed the Apollo Telescope Mount to be docked on a side port of the workshop&#x27;s multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a &quot;dry workshop&quot; design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.

The telemetry subsystem of the Apollo Telescope Mount included two VHF telemetry transmitters from the Apollo Saturn IB launch vehicle. An instrument that was attached to the &quot;Skylab&quot; was a telescope designed to photograph the solar disk in X-ray light. The imaging mirror is a prototype fabricated at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1967.

===LM Truck===
The Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed lunar base. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the &quot;truck&quot; while the orbiting crew returned to Earth. In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.

==Depiction in film and television==
The 1995 Ron Howard film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, a dramatization of that mission starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton, was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the &quot;Aquarius&quot; and the Command Module &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In 2013, in the television show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, a fictionalized version of Howard is depicted as having the Apollo 11 &quot;LEM&quot; in his office, which his character claims was used to fake the 1969 moon landing.

The development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; episode entitled &quot;Spider&quot;. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named &quot;Spider&quot; after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, &quot;Eagle&quot;, used by Apollo 11.

The Apollo 11 Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; is depicted in the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;, a biopic of Neil Armstrong. The 2024 film &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; is set against the backdrop of the Apollo 11 mission; in the film, the co-protagonist is tasked with creating a fake moon landing in case the actual mission fails.

<doc id="151934" wikidata="Q1260116" url="?curid=151934" title="Droitwich Spa">
<text>Droitwich Spa (often abbreviated to Droitwich ) is an historic spa town in the Wychavon district in northern Worcestershire, England, on the River Salwarpe. It is located approximately south-west of Birmingham and north-east of Worcester.

The town was called Salinae in Roman times, then later called Wyche, derived from the Anglo-Saxon Hwicce kingdom, referred to as &quot;Saltwich&quot; according to Anglo-Saxon charters, with the Droit (meaning &quot;right&quot; in French) added when the town was given its charter on 1 August 1215 by King John. The &quot;Spa&quot; was added in the 19th century when John Corbett developed the town&#x27;s spa facilities. The River Salwarpe running through Droitwich is likely derived from &quot;sal&quot; meaning &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;weorp&quot; which means &quot;to throw up&quot; - i.e. &quot;the river which throws up salt&quot; - which overflows from the salt brines.

The town is situated on massive deposits of salt, and salt has been extracted there since ancient times. The natural Droitwich brine contains of salt, ten times stronger than sea water and rivaled only by the Dead Sea.

==History==
During the Roman era the settlement was known as &quot;Salinae&quot; and was located at the crossroads of several Roman roads. Railway construction in 1847 revealed Roman mosaic pavements. In the ninth century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, a text that discusses various landscape folklore across Britain, the hot spring of Droitwich Spa appears to be described in a passage that suggests that the spa was still built up at that time: &quot;The third marvel is a hot pool, which is in the country of the Hwicce [near Worcester] and is surrounded by a wall made of bricks and stone. Men go into it to bathe at all times, and the temperature changes for each of them as they wish: if one man wants a cold bath, it will be cold, and if another wants a hot bath, it will be hot.&quot;

King John&#x27;s charter was renewed by James VI and I on 8 November 1625, establishing the governance of the town and markets. Droitwich remained a fairly small town until the 1960s, when the population was still barely 7,000, but since then it has grown considerably from overspill from Birmingham with many housing estates being developed in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2014, new housing consent was granted to large developments at Copcut (750 houses) and Yew Tree Hill (765 houses) with a number of other in-fill developments

In July 2007, Droitwich was hit heavily by the UK-wide flooding caused by some of the heaviest rainfall in many years. The flooding was pictured in UK-wide news, having flooded the majority of the heavily subsided high street. Many shops in the high street remained closed almost a year later.

===Salt and brine===
Rock salt and brine was extracted by the Romans and this continued through to the Middle Ages. A salt tax was levied by the king until it was abolished in 1825. A local family named Wintour owned up to 25 salt evaporating pans in the area by the 1600s.

Brine rose naturally to the surface at three sites along the River Salwarpe within Vines Park in the centre of Droitwich. Unusually the brine was fully saturated with sodium chloride, and was extremely valuable because it was economic to boil, and the yield of salt was high. Because of its value the brine was divided into shares, one share comprising which produced of salt annually in the set boiling period. When it rained, particularly in the winter when brine was not being boiled, the rain water which is less dense than saltwater, settled on top of the brine and was readily removed.

Originally brine for boiling was extracted with buckets lowered into the pits which were naturally replenished. Upwich, the deepest of the three pits at , supplied most of the brine, while the pit at Netherwich was only deep. The Middlewich pit, located between the two, was adversely affected by brine extraction at the other two pits and fell into disuse. Steynor in the 17th century discovered the pit and set up business for himself, but eventually due to the lack of brine he failed to compete with the town monopoly.

The underground brine reservoirs were only deep and in 1725 boreholes were sunk to the base of the pits, accessing brine in almost unlimited quantities and independent of the natural brine flow, and the monopoly ceased. Pumps were used to draw brine, and production increased. As a result, parts of the town succumbed to subsidence.

In the mid-19th century, Droitwich became famous as a spa town. Unlike other places, the medicinal benefits were not derived from drinking the spa water, which is almost saturated brine, but from the muscular relief derived from swimming and floating in such a dense, concentrated salt solution, at the town&#x27;s brine baths (first opened in 1830). The spa water at Droitwich is the warmest in the United Kingdom outside Bath, but it does not meet the most common definition of a hot spring as the water is below standard human body temperature.

The original Brine Baths have long since closed, but a new brine bath (part of the Droitwich Spa private hospital) opened to the public for relaxation and hydrotherapy but this too was closed in December 2008 due to a dispute between the operator and Wychavon District Council over health and safety inspections.

The salt industry was industrialised and developed in the 19th century by John Corbett who built the nearby Chateau Impney for his Franco-Irish wife in the French &#x27;château&#x27; style. He was responsible for the redevelopment of Droitwich as a Spa.

===Asylums, workhouses and the town hall===

Droitwich&#x27;s first workhouse was set up on Holloway in 1688 and the last finally abolished in the 1920s.

Droitwich Lunatic Asylum was established in 1791. Records at the Worcestershire County Record Office show its presence in 1837 to 1838. An advert in the Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (the forerunner of the British Medical Association) in 1844, records that Martin Ricketts, of Droitwich, was the Surgeon and Sir Charles Hastings from the Worcester Infirmary was the Physician.

The Old Town Hall, which is in St Andrews Street, was completed in 1826.

==Industry and commerce==

===Transport===

In 1714 the first Turnpike in Worcestershire was opened to Worcester. A commemorative plaque was unveiled by Lt. Col. Patrick Holcroft the Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire in Victoria Square on 1 June 2014.

Collectively known as the Droitwich Canal, two canals met in the town centre. These are the Droitwich Barge Canal built by James Brindley in 1771 and the Droitwich Junction Canal built in 1854. The Junction canal linked Droitwich to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The canals were abandoned in 1939 but a restoration program saw them re-opened in 2011.

The railway station, formerly on the Great Western Railway, is just outside the town centre with trains to Birmingham, Worcester, Kidderminster and Stourbridge.

Regular buses operate from the town centre to Worcester and Bromsgrove along with town services and an infrequent service (133) to Kidderminster. These are operated by various operators.

===Broadcasting===
 north-east of Droitwich is the central longwave broadcasting facility for the UK, (Wychbold BBC transmitter), which is also used for transmissions in the medium wave range; see Droitwich transmitting station. The transmitting station was sited near Droitwich, which was close to UK centres of population when it was established in the 1930s. Considerable care was taken to avoid placing the masts above underground brine, due to the risk of subsidence; however, there are anecdotal reports that the huge block of underground salt was desirable by providing good grounding and increased signal strength.

===Retail===
Droitwich shopping is mainly focused in the traditional town centre around Victoria Square, leading to the St Andrew&#x27;s Square shopping centre and down to the original High Street, with its local pubs and an eclectic mix of traditional shops. Farmers&#x27; markets are also held regularly in Victoria Square.

In the central St Andrew&#x27;s Square shopping precinct are several chain stores. On 14 July 2005, Waitrose opened a new supermarket in the grounds of the old covered market, directly behind the heavily subsided High Street. In 2008, a new Aldi store opened on the small retail park by Roman Way while the new Parkridge Retail Park was opened in 2007 with two new stores, Carpetright, since closed, and Land of Leather.

===Lido===
Until the late 1990s Droitwich Spa Lido was open as a public open-air salt-water swimming pool. Following its closure various schemes were proposed, with significant legal and commercial arguments as to the viability of re-building and reopening this facility.

During autumn of 2006, work started on renovating the lido and it was reopened on Monday 18 June 2007. The Lido Park remains a pleasant and popular space, with Droitwich Cricket Ground on its edge as well as a bandstand with regular performances. 

===Entertainment===
The Norbury Theatre hosts regular shows year-round, including an annual pantomime, and also shows films.

On the outskirts of the town is the famous Chateau Impney, built in the style of a traditional French chateau, which is now a hotel, restaurant and conference centre. In Droitwich, the Raven Hotel is a wattle and daub hotel that holds a central position within the town.

There is also the private Dodderhill School (formerly named Whitford Hall and Dodderhill), an independent school for girls from 3 to 16 years (with some boys present in the nursery school). During 2019 the school merged with Royal Grammar School (RGS) Worcester, under the name RGS Dodderhill.

There are six churches in Droitwich including the Anglican church of
St Andrew&#x27;s, a Norman building where St Richard was probably baptised. The church tower was demolished in the 1920s after becoming dangerous due to land subsidence. St. Augustine&#x27;s at Dodderhill, completed in 1220 and rebuilt in the 18th century on a hill, was the site of a former Roman fort and a later Anglo-Saxon church. St Peter&#x27;s, built on the site of a former Saxon church, has parts, including the chancel, that date from Norman times, and has a memorial to Edward Winslow, one of the Pilgrim Fathers, who was born in the parish.

St Nicholas was built in Victorian times near the railway station; and the Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart and St Catherine of Alexandria, on a building styled on the Roman basilica churches of Ravenna in Italy, has the feature of the interior walls being covered almost entirely of mosaic and marble designed by Gabriel Pippet.

<text>Shotgun Angel is the second album by Christian rock band Daniel Amos, released in 1977. It was their final album for Maranatha! Music and their last album performed in their early country rock sound.

==Background==
The album is named after the song of the same name, which finished side one of the album. The song was written earlier by Bill Sprouse Jr. for his band The Road Home which featured future Daniel Amos drummer Ed McTaggart. After Sprouse&#x27;s untimely death at age twenty-six, sound engineer Mike Shoup dug up an old four-track tape of the song and asked Dom Franco of the Maranatha! group Bethlehem to add pedal steel guitar to the song. When Daniel Amos heard it they decided to record it themselves and enlisted Franco to play the pedal steel and Shoup and McTaggart to add the CB radio voices on the recording.

Although DA&#x27;s previous release was largely country, this album marked the start of a return to the band&#x27;s pre-label roots, rock and roll, which took some of their country fans by surprise. &quot;Shotgun Angel&quot; was half country and half rock opera. The &#x27;side two&#x27; of the LP featured lush orchestrations and a string of rock songs linked together in a way that was reminiscent of The Beatles &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; album. The band even made a number of concert performances at this time with a full orchestra backing them.

==Reissues==
In 1986, the entire &quot;side two&quot; of the album was remixed and re-released on a collection called &quot;The Revelation&quot; with some narration by Chuck Smith included between songs. The song &quot;Soon!&quot; was also added. The first appearance of the album on CD was in 1990.

In 2001 M8 put together a two-CD &quot;Shotgun Angel: 25th Anniversary Edition&quot;. The first CD was a re-issue of the original album while the second featured a two-part interview with Terry Taylor and Jerry Chamberlain on &quot;Rock &amp; Religion Radio Show&quot;. While the band&#x27;s management had involvement in the artwork of the release, the overall finished product was disappointing due to the label&#x27;s poor quality control. The release included audio glitches, and even band members names were misspelled. Almost immediately, the band wanted to revisit the album with what it saw as an appropriate reissue once the timing was right and the budget was available.

In the years that followed the band&#x27;s audio archives were cleaned-up and transferred to digital format. The first results of these efforts were released in 2006 with the two-disc deluxe 30th Anniversary edition of &quot;Daniel Amos&quot;, expanded editions of Terry Taylor&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Darn Floor - Big Bite&quot; and not long after &quot;Shotgun Angel&quot;.

Stunt Records&#x27; Tom Gulotta and Eric Townsend were put in charge of putting a new &quot;Shotgun Angel&quot; reissue together, which would be released in connection with Born Twice Records. Gulotta cleaned up the original album master and made sure that digital glitches that were even found on the original CD release were corrected. The entire album was remastered and Townsend began remixing the band&#x27;s original 1976 four-track pre-production demos and portions of the album&#x27;s original 24-track masters for the bonus disc, in an effort to give listeners a new a unique way of hearing some of the album&#x27;s tracks. Some band members were able to uncover numerous unpublished photos which would be used in the project&#x27;s artwork and packaging. Other band members pored over the liner notes and lyrics to make corrections to errors found on all previous releases - including the original Maranatha! release. This culminated in June 2011 with &quot;Shotgun Angel: Collectors Deluxe Edition&quot; a two-disc set. It includes a 24-page booklet with full lyrics, unreleased songs, studio outtakes and other rarities.

==Reception==

AllMusic showed a mixed reaction in their retrospective review, noting the overt similarity to the Eagles and deeming the rock opera of side two &quot;a little too wide-eyed and doomsaying for most modern audiences&quot;. However, they praised the track &quot;Better,&quot; comparing it to the psychedelic rock work of The Beatles. Critiques from other publications offered the following: &quot;This record is a flat-out winner. Brilliant.&quot; from Campus Life Magazine; &quot;Shotgun Angel&#x27; is truly an offering of excellence to the Lord.&quot; from Buzz magazine (UK), and &quot;Not until now have we seen an album that is as versatile, professional, or as serious musically as is Daniel Amos&#x27; Shotgun Angel.&quot; from the Cornerstone newspaper. In Powell&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music he offers that it sounds &quot;like nothing ever produced in contemporary music, Christian or otherwise&quot; even though he notes comparisons with Queen, Pink Floyd and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

<doc id="151942" wikidata="Q93235" url="?curid=151942" title="Vaccinium vitis-idaea">
<text>Vaccinium vitis-idaea is a small evergreen shrub in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is known colloquially as the lingonberry, partridgeberry, foxberry, mountain cranberry, or cowberry. It is native to boreal forest and Arctic tundra throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Commercially cultivated in the United States Pacific Northwest and the Netherlands, the edible berries are also picked in the wild and used in various dishes, especially in Nordic cuisine.

==Description==
&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; spreads by underground stems to form dense clonal colonies. Slender and brittle roots grow from the underground stems. The stems are rounded in cross-section and grow from in height. Leaves grow alternately and are oval, long, with a slightly wavy margin, and sometimes with a notched tip.

The flowers are bell-shaped, white to pale pink, long. &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; begins to produce flowers from five to ten years of age. They are pollinated by multiple insect species, including &quot;Andrena lapponica&quot; and several species of bumblebee.

The fruit is a red berry across, with an acidic taste, ripening in late summer to autumn. While bitter early in the season, they sweeten if left on the branch through winter. Cytology is 2n = 24.

=== Related species ===
&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; differs from the related cranberries in having white flowers with petals partially enclosing the stamens and stigma, rather than pink flowers with petals reflexed backwards, and rounder, less pear-shaped berries. &quot;Vaccinium oxycoccos&quot; is similar.

Hybrids between &quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; and &quot;V. myrtillus&quot;, named &quot;Vaccinium × intermedium&quot; Ruthe, are occasionally found in Europe.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Varieties ===
There are two regional varieties or subspecies of &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot;, one in Eurasia and one in North America, differing in leaf size:
* &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; var. &quot;vitis-idaea&quot; L.—syn. &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; subsp. &quot;vitis-idaea&quot;.&quot;cowberry&quot;. Eurasia. Leaves are long.
* &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; var. &quot;minus&quot; Lodd.—syn. &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; subsp. &quot;minus&quot; (Lodd.) Hultén.&quot;lingonberry&quot;. North America. Leaves are long.

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; is most commonly known in English as &#x27;lingonberry&#x27; or &#x27;cowberry&#x27;. The name &#x27;lingonberry&#x27; originates from the Swedish name () for the species deriving from Old Norse &quot;lyngr&quot;, a cognate (thus also a doublet) to &#x27;ling&#x27;.

The genus name &quot;Vaccinium&quot; is a classical Latin name for a plant, possibly the bilberry or hyacinth, and may be derived from the Latin , &#x27;berry&#x27;. The specific name is derived from Latin (&#x27;vine&#x27;) and , the feminine form of (literally &#x27;from Mount Ida&#x27;, used in reference to raspberries &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;).

Worldwide, &quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; is known by at least 25 other common English names, including:
* bearberry
* beaverberry
* cougarberry
* foxberry
* lowbush cranberry
* mountain bilberry
* mountain cranberry
* partridgeberry (in Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island)
* quailberry
* red whortleberry
* redberry (in Labrador and the Lower North Shore of Quebec)
==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to boreal forest and Arctic tundra throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including Eurasia and North America.

==Ecology==
&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; keeps its leaves all winter even in the coldest years, unusual for a broad-leaved plant, though in its natural habitat it is usually protected from severe cold by snow cover. It is extremely hardy, tolerating temperatures as low as −50 °F (−45 °C) or lower, but grows poorly where summers are hot. It prefers some shade (as from a forest canopy) and constantly moist, acidic soil. Nutrient-poor soils are tolerated but not alkaline soils.

== Conservation ==
The plant is endangered in Michigan. The &quot;minus&quot; subspecies is listed as a species of special concern and believed extirpated in Connecticut.

== Cultivation ==
Lingonberry has been commercially cultivated in the Netherlands and other countries since the 1960s.

Some cultivars are grown for their ornamental rather than culinary value. In the United Kingdom, the Koralle Group has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==

=== Culinary ===
Raw lingonberries are 86% water, 13% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain negligible fat. In a reference amount, lingonberries supply 54 kcal, and are low-to-moderate sources of vitamin C, B vitamins, and dietary minerals.

The berries collected in the wild are a popular fruit in northern, central and eastern Europe, notably in the Nordic countries, the Baltic states, central and northern Europe. In some areas, they can be picked legally on both public and private lands in accordance with the freedom to roam.

The berries are quite tart, so they are often cooked and sweetened before eating in the form of lingonberry jam, compote, juice, smoothie or syrup. The raw fruits are also frequently simply mashed with sugar, which preserves most of their nutrients and taste. This mix can be stored at room temperature in closed but not necessarily sealed containers, but in this condition, they are best preserved frozen. Fruit served this way or as compote often accompanies game and liver dishes.

In Sweden the traditional Swedish meatballs are served with lingonberry jam alongside boiled or mashed potatoes and gravy sauce. In Sweden, Finland and Norway, reindeer and elk steaks are traditionally served with gravy and lingonberry sauce. Preserved fruit is commonly eaten with meatballs, as well as potato pancakes. A traditional Swedish dessert is (literally &#x27;lingonberry pears&#x27;), consisting of fresh pears which are peeled, boiled and preserved in (lingonberry juice) and is commonly eaten during Christmas. This was very common in old times, because it was an easy and tasty way to preserve pears. In Sweden and Russia, when sugar was still a luxury item, the berries were usually preserved simply by putting them whole into bottles of water. This was known as (watered lingonberries); the procedure preserved them until next season. This was also a home remedy against scurvy.

This traditional Russian soft drink, known as &quot;lingonberry water&quot;, is mentioned by Alexander Pushkin in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. In Russian folk medicine, lingonberry water was used as a mild laxative. A traditional Finnish dish is sautéed reindeer () with mashed potatoes and lingonberries on the side, either raw, thawed or as a jam. In Finland, whipped semolina pudding flavored with lingonberry () is also popular. In Poland, the berries are often mixed with pears to create a sauce served with poultry or game. The berries can also be used to replace redcurrants when creating Cumberland sauce.

The berries are also popular as a wild picked fruit in Eastern Canada, for example in Newfoundland and Labrador and Cape Breton, where they are locally known as partridgeberries or redberries, and on the mainland of Nova Scotia, where they are known as foxberries. In this region they are incorporated into jams, syrups, and baked goods, such as pies, scones, and muffins.

In Sweden lingonberries are often sold as jam and juice, and as a key ingredient in dishes. They are used to make Lillehammer berry liqueur; and, in East European countries, lingonberry vodka is sold, and vodka with lingonberry juice or &quot;mors&quot; is a cocktail.

The berries are an important food for bears and foxes, and many fruit-eating birds. Caterpillars of the case-bearer moths &quot;Coleophora glitzella&quot;, &quot;Coleophora idaeella&quot; and &quot;Coleophora vitisella&quot; are obligate feeders on &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; leaves.

Alaska natives mix the berries with rose hip pulp and sugar to make jam, cook the berries as a sauce, and store the berries for future use. The Dakelh use the berries to make jam. The Koyukon freeze the berries for winter use. Inuit dilute and sweeten the juice to make a beverage, freeze and store the berries for spring, and use the berries to make jams and jellies. The Iñupiat use the berries to make two different desserts, one in which the berries are whipped with frozen fish eggs and eaten, and one in which raw berries are mashed with canned milk and seal oil. They also make a dish of the berries cooked with fish eggs, fish (whitefish, sheefish or pike) and blubber.

The Upper Tanana boil the berries with sugar and flour to thicken; eat the raw berries, either plain or mixed with sugar, grease or a combination of the two; fry them in grease with sugar or dried fish eggs; or make them into pies, jam, and jelly. They also preserve the berries alone or in grease and store them in a birchbark basket in an underground cache, or freeze them.

===== Use of the &quot;minus&quot; subspecies =====
The Anticosti people use the fruit to make jams and jellies. The Nihithawak Cree store the berries by freezing them outside during the winter, mix the berries with boiled fish eggs, livers, air bladders and fat and eat them, eat the berries raw as a snack food, or stew them with fish or meat. The Iñupiat of Nelson Island eat the berries, as do the Iñupiat of the Northern Bering Sea and Arctic regions of Alaska, as well as the Inuvialuit. The Haida people, Hesquiaht First Nation, Wuikinuxv and Tsimshian all use the berries as food.

=== Traditional medicine ===
In traditional medicine, &quot;V. vitis-idaea&quot; was used as an apéritif and astringent. The Upper Tanana ate the berries or used their juice to treat minor respiratory disorders.

=== Other uses ===
The Nihithawak Cree use the berries of the &quot;minus&quot; subspecies to color porcupine quills, and put the firm, ripe berries on a string to wear as a necklace. The Western Canadian Inuit use the &quot;minus&quot; subspecies as a tobacco additive or substitute.

<text>Ted Ray (born Charles Olden; 21 November 1905 – 8 November 1977) was an English comedian of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, on radio and television. His BBC radio show &quot;Ray&#x27;s a Laugh&quot; ran for 12 years.

==Biography==
Ray was born Charles Olden in Wigan, Lancashire, England, to comic singer and mimic Charles Olden (who used the stage-name Charlie Alden) and his wife Margaret Ellen (née Kenyon). His parents moved to Liverpool within days of his birth, and Liverpudlians regard him as a local. He was educated at Anfield council school and Liverpool Collegiate School, and as a youth wished to become a footballer. 

As a comedian of the 1940s and 1950s, he demonstrated his ad-libbing skills in his weekly radio show &quot;Ray&#x27;s A Laugh&quot; from 1949 until 1961.
A music hall comedian, Ray usually played violin badly as part of his act, first as Hugh Neek, then &quot;Nedlo the Gypsy Violinist&quot;. He also played comedy roles in several British films—notably as the headmaster in &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot;.

He is best remembered for the BBC Radio show &quot;Ray&#x27;s a Laugh&quot;, a domestic comedy in which Kitty Bluett played his wife. Other actors and actresses who featured on the show included Peter Sellers, Fred Yule, Patricia Hayes, Kenneth Connor, Pat Coombs and Graham Stark; Sellers&#x27; earliest appearances predated &quot;The Goon Show&quot; by a couple of years. In 1949 and 1950, Ray was King Rat of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

Ray was an accomplished golfer, frequently playing with professional sportsmen. Later in his career, he appeared with Jimmy Edwards, Arthur Askey and Cyril Fletcher in the comedy radio panel game &quot;Does the Team Think?&quot;

Ray appeared on television, reading on &quot;Jackanory&quot;, a children&#x27;s programme, in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974, he presented a radio show on BBC Radio 2, &quot;The Betty Witherspoon Show&quot;, with Kenneth Williams, Miriam Margolyes and Nigel Rees. He was also involved in &quot;Jokers Wild&quot;, an ITV celebrity comedy game show (1969–74) which was chaired by Barry Cryer. Arthur Askey was another regular on the show.

He married showgirl Dorothy Sybil (b. 1909), daughter of mechanical engineer George Henry Stevens; the couple had two sons: Robin Ray, a well-known television personality in the 1960s and 1970s, who initiated &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; and specialist classical music shows, and Andrew Ray, a child star of the 1950s who had a long career on stage, film and television.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: firstly, in October 1955 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and secondly in February 1975, when Andrews surprised him on the doorstep of his Southgate home.

In 1975, returning home from a day of golfing and alcohol, two of his passions, Ray was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident. The injuries sustained were physically debilitating and left him dependent on crutches; he was convicted of dangerous driving under the influence of alcohol.

On 16 June 1977, he recorded a half-hour interview talking about his life, which was broadcast on 25 July 1977. This was repeated on Radio 4 Extra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Funny Business&quot; series on 3 November 2013.

On 8 November 1977, he suffered a fatal heart attack.

==&quot;The Ted Ray Show&quot; (1955–59)==
&quot;The Ted Ray Show&quot; was a BBC TV production. The first series accented variety, with international guests; the second and third series had greater emphasis on stand-up comedy; the fourth featured domestic routines (with Kitty Bluett as Ted Ray&#x27;s wife and Kenneth Connor as &quot;that interfering brother-in-law&quot;); the fifth and six—with new writers—concentrated on sketch comedy and were branded &#x27;New Edition&#x27; and &#x27;1959 Edition&#x27; to underline the difference.

<text>In computer graphics, turtle graphics are vector graphics using a relative cursor (the &quot;turtle&quot;) upon a Cartesian plane (x and y axis). Turtle graphics is a key feature of the Logo programming language.

==Overview==

The turtle has three attributes: a location, an orientation (or direction), and a pen. The pen, too, has attributes: color, width, and on/off state (also called &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;).

The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, such as &quot;move forward 10 spaces&quot; and &quot;turn left 90 degrees&quot;. The pen carried by the turtle can also be controlled, by enabling it, setting its color, or setting its width. A student could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle&#x27;s motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. Seymour Papert called this &quot;body syntonic&quot; reasoning.

A full turtle graphics system requires control flow, procedures, and recursion: many turtle drawing programs fall short. From these building blocks one can build more complex shapes like squares, triangles, circles and other composite figures. The idea of turtle graphics, for example is useful in a Lindenmayer system for generating fractals.

Turtle geometry is also sometimes used in graphics environments as an alternative to a strictly coordinate-addressed graphics system.

==History==
Turtle graphics are often associated with the Logo programming language. Seymour Papert added support for turtle graphics to Logo in the late 1960s to support his version of the turtle robot, a simple robot controlled from the user&#x27;s workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot&#x27;s body. Turtle geometry works somewhat differently from (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) addressed Cartesian geometry, being primarily vector-based (i.e. relative direction and distance from a starting point) in comparison to coordinate-addressed systems such as bitmaps or raster graphics. As a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic of the turtle robot. The turtle is traditionally and most often represented pictorially either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon).

Today, the Python programming language&#x27;s standard library includes a Turtle graphics module. Like its Logo predecessor, the Python implementation of turtle allows programmers to control one or more turtles in a two-dimensional space. Since the standard Python syntax, control flow, and data structures can be used alongside the turtle module, turtle has become a popular way for programmers learning Python to familiarize themselves with the basics of the language.

==Extension to three dimensions==
The ideas behind turtle graphics can be extended to include three-dimensional space. This is achieved by using one of several different coordinate models. A common setup is cartesian-rotational as with the original 2D turtle: an additional &quot;up&quot; vector (normal vector) is defined to choose the plane the turtle&#x27;s 2D &quot;forward&quot; vector rotates in; the &quot;up&quot; vector itself also rotates around the &quot;forward&quot; vector. In effect, the turtle has two different heading angles, one within the plane and the other determining the plane&#x27;s angle. Usually changing the plane&#x27;s angle does not move the turtle, in line with the traditional setup.

Verhoeff 2010 implements the two vector approach; a &quot;roll&quot; command is used to rotate the &quot;up&quot; vector around the &quot;forward&quot; vector. The article proceeds to develop an algebraic theory to prove geometric properties from syntactic properties of the underlying turtle programs. One of the insights is that a &quot;dive&quot; command is really a shorthand of a turn-roll-turn sequence.

Cheloniidae Turtle Graphics is a 3D turtle library for Java. It has a &quot;bank&quot; command (same as &quot;roll&quot;) and a &quot;pitch&quot; command (same as &quot;dive&quot;) in the &quot;Rotational Cartesian Turtle&quot;. Other coordinate models, including non-Euclidean geometry, are allowed but not included.

<text>Vincent Leonard Price Jr. (May 27, 1911 – October 25, 1993) was an American actor. He was known for his work in the horror film genre, mostly portraying villains. He appeared on stage, television, and radio, and in more than 100 films. Price has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures and one for television.

Price&#x27;s first film role was as a leading man in the 1938 comedy &quot;Service de Luxe&quot;. He became a character actor, appearing in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1944), &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). He established himself in the horror genre with roles in &quot;House of Wax&quot; (1953), &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958), &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1959), &quot;Return of the Fly&quot; (1959), &quot;The Tingler&quot; (1959), &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964), &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; (1968), &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971), and &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973). He collaborated with Roger Corman on a series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, including &quot;House of Usher&quot; (1960), &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961), &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1964). Price appeared in the television series &quot;Batman&quot; as Egghead.

Price voiced the villainous Professor Ratigan in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), and appeared in the drama &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987), which earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male nomination. Price&#x27;s final film was Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990). For his contributions to cinema, he received lifetime achievement or special tribute awards from Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films; Fantasporto; Bram Stoker Awards; and Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Price narrated animated films, radio dramas, and documentaries, and provided the narration in Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Thriller&quot;. For his voice work in &quot;Great American Speeches&quot; (1959), Price was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

Price was an art collector and arts consultant, with a degree in art history. He lectured and wrote books on art. The Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College is named in his honor. Price was a gourmet cook and cookbook author.

==Early life and education==
Vincent Leonard Price Jr. was born on May 27, 1911, in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of the four children of Vincent Leonard Price, president of the National Candy Company, and his wife Marguerite Cobb (née Wilcox) Price. His grandfather was Vincent Clarence Price, who invented &quot;Dr. Price&#x27;s Baking Powder&quot;, the first cream of tartar-based baking powder, and it secured the family&#x27;s fortune. Price was of Welsh and English descent and was a descendant, via his paternal grandmother, of Peregrine White, the first child born in colonial Massachusetts, being born on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; while it was in Provincetown Harbor in Massachusetts.

Price attended the St. Louis Country Day School, and took a summer course at Milford Academy in Milford, Connecticut. In 1933, he graduated with a degree in English and a minor in art history from Yale University, where he worked on the campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. After teaching for a year, he entered The Courtauld Institute of Art in London, intending to study for a master&#x27;s degree in fine arts.

Instead he was drawn to the theater, first appearing on stage professionally in 1935 in the play &quot;Chicago&quot; at the Gate Theatre in London. Next he introduced the role of Prince Albert in Laurence Housman&#x27;s play &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, also at the Gate Theatre in 1935. Later that year he moved to New York City to reprise the role of Prince Albert in the Broadway production of &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, opposite Helen Hayes in the title role of Queen Victoria. He played the role for two seasons at the Broadhurst Theatre, through June 1937. In 1938 he appeared in productions of &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; with Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre company. From 1941 to 1942, Price played Mr. Manningham in &quot;Angel Street&quot;, the Broadway production of &quot;Gas Light&quot;, which he helped bring to New York.

== Career ==
=== Early film roles ===

Price started out in films as a character actor. He made his film debut in &quot;Service de Luxe&quot; (1938), and established himself in the film &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), opposite Gene Tierney, directed by Otto Preminger. He played Joseph Smith in the movie &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940) and William Gibbs McAdoo in &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), as well as Bernadette&#x27;s prosecutor, Vital Dutour, in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), and as a pretentious priest in &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1944).

Price&#x27;s first venture into the horror genre, for which he later became widely known, was in the Boris Karloff film &quot;Tower of London&quot; (1939). The following year, Price portrayed the title character in &quot;The Invisible Man Returns&quot; (a role he reprised in a voice-only cameo in the closing scene of the horror-comedy spoof &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; released in 1948). He reunited with Tierney in &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945) and &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946). He also had many villainous roles in film noir thrillers such as &quot;The Web&quot; (1947), &quot;The Long Night&quot; (1947), &quot;Rogues&#x27; Regiment&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Bribe&quot; (1949), with Robert Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Charles Laughton.

Price&#x27;s first starring role was as con man James Reavis in the biographical film &quot;The Baron of Arizona&quot; (1950). He did a comedic turn as the tycoon Burnbridge Waters, co-starring with Ronald Colman in &quot;Champagne for Caesar&quot; (also 1950), one of his favorite film roles.

=== 1950s ===
Price was active in radio, portraying the Robin Hood-inspired crime-fighter Simon Templar in &quot;The Saint&quot;, which ran from 1947 to 1951. In the 1950s, Price moved into more regular horror-film roles with the leading role in &quot;House of Wax&quot; (1953) as a homicidal sculptor, the first three-dimensional film to land in the year&#x27;s top 10 at the North American box-office. His next roles were &quot;The Mad Magician&quot; (1954), the monster movie &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958), and its sequel &quot;Return of the Fly&quot; (1959). That same year, Price starred in two thrillers by producer-director William Castle: &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; as eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren, and &quot;The Tingler&quot; as Dr. Warren Chapin, who discovered the titular creature. He appeared in the radio drama &quot;Three Skeleton Key&quot;, the story of an island lighthouse besieged by an army of rats. He had first performed the work in 1950 on &quot;Escape&quot; and returned to it in 1956 and 1958 for &quot;Suspense&quot;.
Outside the horror realm, Price played Baka in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, released in 1956. About this time, he also appeared in episodes of television shows such as &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. In the 1955–56 television season, he was cast three times on the religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;. In the 1955 episode &quot;Cleanup&quot;, Price portrayed the Reverend Robert Russell. In 1956, he was cast as Rabbi Gershom Mendes Seixas in &quot;The Rebel&quot;, and as the Rev. Alfred W. Price in &quot;God&#x27;s Healing&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, Price achieved a number of low-budget filmmaking successes with Roger Corman and American International Pictures (AIP) starting with the &quot;House of Usher&quot; (1960), which earned over $2 million at the box office in the United States and led to the subsequent Edgar Allan Poe adaptations of &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961), &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; (1962), &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963), &quot;The Raven&quot; (1963), &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; (1964). He starred in &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964), the first adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, and portrayed witch hunter Matthew Hopkins in &quot;Witchfinder General&quot;, (US: &quot;The Conqueror Worm&quot;, 1968) set during the English Civil War. Price also starred in comedy films such as &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; (1965) and its sequel &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs&quot; (1966). In 1968, he played the part of an eccentric artist in the musical &quot;Darling of the Day&quot;, opposite Patricia Routledge.

In the 1960s, Price began his role as a guest on the television game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, becoming a semi-regular in the 1970s, including being one of the guest panelists on the finale in 1980.

Price made many guest-star appearances in television shows during the decade, including &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;F Troop&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. He had a recurring role in the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series as the villain Egghead from 1966 to 1967. In 1964, he provided the narration for the Tombstone Historama in Tombstone, Arizona, which was still in operation as of 2016. He also starred as the host of the Australian TV series &quot;If These Walls Could Speak&quot;, in which a short history of an historical building (supposedly narrated by the building itself) was covered, and as the narrating voice of the building.

=== 1970s ===
During the early 1970s, Price hosted and starred in BBC Radio&#x27;s horror and mystery series &quot;The Price of Fear&quot;. He accepted a cameo part in the Canadian children&#x27;s television program &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; (1971) in Hamilton, Ontario, on the local television station CHCH-TV. In addition to the opening and closing monologs, his role in the show was to recite poems about various characters, sometimes wearing a cloak or other costumes. He appeared in &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971), its sequel &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again&quot; (1972), and &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973), in which he portrayed one of two serial killers. That same year, he appeared as himself in &quot;Mooch Goes to Hollywood&quot;, a film written by Jim Backus.

Price was an admirer of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and in 1975 visited the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia, where he had his picture taken with the museum&#x27;s popular stuffed raven. Price also recorded dramatic readings of Poe&#x27;s short stories and poems, which were collected together with readings by Basil Rathbone.

In 1975, Price and his wife Coral Browne appeared together in an international stage adaptation of &quot;Ardèle&quot;, which played in the U.S. and in London at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. During this run, Browne and Price starred together in the BBC Radio play &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot; first airing in 1975. Price greatly reduced his film work from around 1975, as horror itself suffered a slump, and he increased his narrative and voice work, as well as advertising Milton Bradley&#x27;s Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture.

Price provided a monolog for the Alice Cooper song &quot;The Black Widow&quot; on the &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot; album in 1975, and he appeared in the corresponding TV special &quot;Alice Cooper: The Nightmare&quot;. He starred for a year in the early 1970s in the syndicated daily radio program &quot;Tales of the Unexplained&quot;. He made guest appearances in a 1970 episode of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, showcasing his art expertise, and in a 1972 episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, in which he played a deranged archaeologist. In October 1976, he appeared as the featured guest in an episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. In 1977, Price recorded a cover version of Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett&#x27;s 1962 Single record The Monster Mash produced by UK record producers Ken Burgess and Bob Newby and released in the UK by EMI Records.

Also in 1977, Price began performing as Oscar Wilde in the one-man stage play &quot;Diversions and Delights&quot;, written by John Gay and directed by Joe Hardy, and set in a Parisian theater on a night about one year before Wilde&#x27;s death. The original tour of the play was a success in every city except for New York City. In the summer of 1979, Price performed the role of Wilde at the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, Colorado, on the same stage from which Wilde had spoken to miners about art some 96 years before. He eventually performed the play worldwide. Victoria Price stated in her biography of her father that several members of Price&#x27;s family and friends thought that this was his best acting performance.

In 1979, Price starred with his wife in the short-lived CBS series &quot;Time Express&quot;. That same year he hosted the hour-long television special &quot;America Screams&quot;, riding on several roller coasters and recounting their history. During 1979–1980, he hosted the &quot;Mystery Night&quot; segment of the radio series &quot;Sears Radio Theater&quot;.

=== Later career ===

In 1982, Price provided the narrator&#x27;s voice in &quot;Vincent,&quot; Tim Burton&#x27;s six-minute film about a young boy who flashes from reality into a fantasy where he is Vincent Price. That same year, Price provided the spoken-word sequence throughout the Michael Jackson song &quot;Thriller&quot;, and appeared as Sir Despard Murgatroyd in a television production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (with Keith Michell as Robin Oakapple). In 1983, he played the Sinister Man in the British spoof horror film &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot;. He appeared in &quot;House of the Long Shadows&quot; with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine; he had worked with each of those actors at least once in previous decades, but this was the first time that all had teamed up. One of his last major roles, and one of his favorites, was as the voice of Professor Ratigan in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; in 1986.

From 1981 to 1989, Price hosted the PBS television series &quot;Mystery!&quot; In 1985, he provided voice talent on the Hanna-Barbera series &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot; as the mysterious &quot;Vincent Van Ghoul&quot;, who aided Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo, and the gang in recapturing thirteen demons. He was a lifelong fan of roller coasters, and he narrated a 1987 thirty-minute documentary on the history of roller coasters and amusement parks, including Coney Island. During this time (1985–1989), he appeared in horror-themed commercials for Tilex bathroom cleanser.

In 1984, Price appeared in Shelley Duvall&#x27;s live-action series &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; as the Mirror in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, and the narrator for &quot;The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers&quot;. In 1987, he starred with Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, and Ann Sothern in &quot;The Whales of August,&quot; a story of two sisters living in Maine facing the end of their days. His performance in &quot;The Whales of August&quot; earned the only award nomination of his career, an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.

In 1989, Price was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. His last significant film work was as the inventor in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990).

In 1990, Price recorded the narration of the Phantom for the Phantom Manor attraction at Disneyland Paris. However, shortly after the ride opened in 1992, the narration was removed and replaced with one entirely in French, performed by Gérard Chevalier. Only Price&#x27;s infamous laughter remained on the soundtrack. In 2018, during a major renovation, it was announced that parts of Price&#x27;s narration would be restored. Since the 2019 reopening, the new tracks are dual-language; Price&#x27;s original excerpts as well as previously unused material from his 1990 recording comprise the English-speaking portions, while actor Bernard Alane voices the Phantom in French.

==Art==
Price, who studied art history at Yale, was an art lover and collector. He was a commissioner of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board.

In 1957, impressed by the spirit of the students and the community&#x27;s need for the opportunity to experience original artworks firsthand, Vincent and Mary Grant Price donated 90 pieces from their private collection and a large amount of money to establish the Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, California, which was the first &quot;teaching art collection&quot; owned by a community college in the United States. They ultimately donated some 2,000 pieces; the collection contains over 9,000 pieces and has been valued in excess of $5 million.

Price also spent time working as an art consultant for Sears, Roebuck and Co. From 1962 to 1971, Sears offered the &quot;Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art&quot;, selling about 50,000 fine-art prints to the general public. Works which Price selected or commissioned for the collection included some by Rembrandt, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dalí. Public access to fine art was important to Price, who, according to his daughter Victoria, saw the Sears deal as an &quot;opportunity to put his populist beliefs into practice, to bring art to the American public.&quot; In the 1960s, portraits of Native Americans painted by Charles Bird King were secured for Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s White House restoration. Through the efforts of Vincent Price, these five paintings were paid for and donated to the White House Collection by Sears.

Price amassed his own extensive collection of art, and in 2008, a painting bought for $25 by a couple from Dallas was identified as a piece from Price&#x27;s collection. Painted by leading Australian modernist Grace Cossington Smith, it was given a modern valuation of AU$45,000.

==Cooking==
Price was a gourmet cook, and he authored several cookbooks with his second wife, Mary. These include:
* &quot;A Treasury of Great Recipes&quot; (1965)
* &quot;Mary and Vincent Price present a National Treasury of Cookery&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Mary and Vincent Price&#x27;s Come into the Kitchen Cook Book: A Collector&#x27;s Treasury of America&#x27;s Great Recipes&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Cooking Price-Wise with Vincent Price&quot; (1971)

&quot;Mary and Vincent Price present a National Treasury of Cookery&quot; was a five-volume series, packaged in a boxed set and published by the Heirloom Publishing Company. These five books were combined into a single book two years later and published as &quot;Mary and Vincent Price&#x27;s Come into the Kitchen Cook Book: A Collector&#x27;s Treasury of America&#x27;s Great Recipes&quot;. Most of the Prices&#x27; cookbooks remained in print throughout the 1970s. After being out of print for several decades, two of their books were reprinted; &quot;A Treasury of Great Recipes&quot; (in August 2015 by Calla Editions) and &quot;Mary and Vincent Price&#x27;s Come into the Kitchen Cook Book&quot; (in November 2016 by Calla Editions), both featuring new forewords by their daughter Victoria Price. &quot;Cooking Price-Wise with Vincent Price&quot; was scheduled to be reprinted by Dover Publishing in October 2017 under the updated title &quot;Cooking Price-Wise – The Original Foodie&quot;.

The movie &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; has a comedic scene in which Price, having invited Jane Russell and Robert Mitchum to dinner, receives bad news. He plays the entire scene holding a duck in his hand, ready to be cooked &quot;soaked in sherry with only salt, sage, and pepper.&quot;

In 1971, Price hosted his own cooking program on British television, called &quot;Cooking Price-Wise&quot; produced for the ITV network by Thames Television, which was broadcast in April and May 1971. This show gave its name to Price&#x27;s fourth and final cookbook later that year. Price promoted his cookbooks on many talk shows, one of the most famous instances being the November 21, 1975, broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, when he demonstrated how to poach a fish in a dishwasher.

Price recorded a number of audio cooking tutorials titled &quot;International Cooking Course&quot;. These were titled &quot;Bounty of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Classical Spanish Cuisine&quot;, &quot;Cuisina Italiana&quot;, &quot;Delights from the Sultan&#x27;s Pantry&quot;, &quot;Dinner at the Casbah&quot;, &quot;Dining at Versailles&quot;, &quot;Exotic Delights from the Far East&quot;, &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Foods from the Austro-Hungarian Empire&quot;, &quot;La Cocina Mejicana&quot;, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Board&quot;, and &quot;The Wok&quot;. In addition to those, he recorded an audio wine course titled &quot;Wine Is Elegance&quot;. These audio recordings were released on 33⅓ LPs by Nelson Industries in 1977 and were also packaged in a 12-cassette boxed set titled &quot;Beverly Hills Cookbook – Cookbook of the Rich and Famous, Your Host Mr. Vincent Price&quot;.

In August 1982, he co-hosted &quot;A Taste of China&quot; for Thames Television over five episodes. He also prepared a fish recipe on Wolfgang Puck&#x27;s &quot;Cooking with Wolfgang Puck&quot; VHS, released in October 1987 by Warner Home Video.

==Personal life==
Price married three times. His first marriage was in 1938 to former actress Edith Barrett; they had one son, poet and columnist Vincent Barrett Price. Edith and Price divorced in 1948. Price married Mary Grant in 1949, and they had a daughter, inspirational speaker Victoria Price, on April 27, 1962, naming her after Price&#x27;s first major success in the play &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;. The marriage lasted until 1973. He married Australian actress Coral Browne in 1974; she had appeared as one of his victims in &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973). The marriage lasted until her death in 1991.

Victoria Price&#x27;s biography &quot;Vincent Price: A Daughter&#x27;s Biography&quot; (1999) details Price&#x27;s early antisemitism and initial admiration for Adolf Hitler. According to his daughter: &quot;When he went to Germany and Austria as a young man, he was struck by a lot of things going on during the Weimar Republic and the dissolution of the empire... So when Hitler came into power, instead of seeing him as a dangerous force, he was sort of swept up in this whole idea that Hitler was going to bring German pride back.&quot; However, Price became a liberal after becoming friends with New York intellectuals such as Dorothy Parker and Lillian Hellman in the 1930s, so much so that he was &quot;greylisted&quot; under McCarthyism in the 1950s for having been a prewar &quot;premature anti-Nazi&quot;. After being unable to find work for a year, he agreed to requests by the FBI that he sign a &quot;secret oath&quot; to save his career. Victoria said that her father became so liberal that &quot;one of my brother&#x27;s earliest memories is when Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s death was announced, my father fell backward off the sofa sobbing.&quot;

Price denounced racial and religious prejudice as a form of poison at the end of an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot;, which aired on NBC Radio on July 30, 1950,
claiming that Americans must fight against it because such prejudices within the United States fuel support for the nation&#x27;s enemies. He was later appointed to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board under the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration; he called the appointment &quot;kind of a surprise, since I am a Democrat&quot;.

Price was supportive of his daughter when she came out as a lesbian and joined PFLAG as an honorary board member. He was critical of Anita Bryant&#x27;s anti-gay rights campaign in the 1970s. Price was also one of the first celebrities to film a public service announcement to help allay public fears about HIV/AIDS. In an interview in 2015, Victoria said that her father confided in her his intimate, though nonsexual, relationships with men when she came out to him as a lesbian.

==Illness and death==
Price suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His symptoms were especially severe during the filming of &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, requiring his filming schedule to be shortened. His illness also contributed to his retirement from &quot;Mystery!&quot; in 1989. He died at age 82 of lung cancer on October 25, 1993, at his home in Los Angeles, California. His remains were cremated and his ashes scattered off Nicholas Canyon Beach, near Point Dume in Malibu.

==Legacy==
The A&amp;E Network aired an episode of &quot;Biography&quot; the night following Price&#x27;s death, highlighting his horror-film career, but because of its failure to clear copyrights, the show was never aired again. Four years later, A&amp;E produced its updated episode, titled &quot;Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain&quot;, which aired on October 12, 1997. The script was by Lucy Chase Williams, author of &quot;The Complete Films of Vincent Price&quot;. In early 1991, Tim Burton was developing a personal documentary with the working title &quot;Conversations with Vincent,&quot; in which interviews with Price were shot at the Vincent Price Gallery, but the project was never completed and was eventually shelved.

Price was an honorary board member and strong supporter of the Witch&#x27;s Dungeon Classic Movie Museum in Bristol, Connecticut, until his death in 1993. The museum features detailed life-sized wax replicas of characters from some of Price&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Fly,&quot; &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes,&quot; and &quot;The Masque of the Red Death.&quot; A black-box theater at Price&#x27;s alma mater, Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, is named after him.

&quot;Vincent Twice, Vincent Twice&quot; was a muppet who hosted &quot;Mysterious Theater&quot; on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, spoofing Price&#x27;s hosting of &quot;Mystery!&quot; Price was parodied in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&quot;). Price had his own &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppet, who was always trying to be &quot;sinister&quot; and lure people into his ghoulish traps, only for his victims to point out all the obvious flaws. &quot;Rhythmeen&quot;, the ZZ Top album from 1996, includes a track named &quot;Vincent Price Blues&quot;.

Starting in November 2005, featured cast member Bill Hader of the NBC sketch comedy/variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has played Price in a recurring sketch in which Price hosts botched holiday specials filled with celebrities of the 1950s/&#x27;60s. Other cast members who played Price on &quot;SNL&quot; include Dan Aykroyd and Michael McKean (who played Price when he hosted a season-10 episode and again when he was hired as a cast member for the 1994–95 season).

In 1999, a frank and detailed biography of Price written by his daughter, Victoria, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. In late May 2011, an event was held by the organization Cinema St. Louis to celebrate what would have been Price&#x27;s 100th birthday. It included a public event with Victoria at the Missouri History Museum and a showcase of ephemeral and historic items at the gallery inside the Sheldon Concert Hall.

In an unusual convergence of widely different generational and cultural backgrounds, the genteel Price was a friend of the English hard rock band Deep Purple and in 1975, he appeared on Roger Glover&#x27;s live version of &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; as a narrator. Decades later, in 2013, Deep Purple released &quot;Vincent Price&quot;, a single the band members dedicated to him. That same year, American director and writer John Waters composed a &quot;heartfelt and appreciative&quot; retrospective on Price for Turner Classic Movies, which recognized the actor as its &quot;Star of the Month&quot; in October 2013 and showcased then a selection of his most popular films. The tribute was repeatedly broadcast on TCM to promote and complement those televised presentations. In sharing with viewers his feelings about Price, Waters at one point describes the actor&#x27;s screen appeal, especially when he was featured in darker roles:

<text>The Nordic Realm Party ( ; NRP) was a Neo-Nazi political party in Sweden, founded in 1956 as the National Socialist Combat League of Sweden (&quot;Sveriges nationalsocialistiska kampförbund&quot;) by Göran Assar Oredsson. Oredsson was also the party leader except for a few years during the 1970s while he wrote his autobiography &quot;Prisat vare allt som gjort mig hårdare&quot; (&quot;Blessed be everything that has made me a harder man&quot;). During that time, his wife Vera Oredsson took on the role as party leader and became Sweden&#x27;s first female party leader. 

The party had a group modelled after the German Sturmabteilung, called the Realm Action Group (, RAG). whose members committed several political crimes. 
NRP published a few magazines, two being the &quot;Nordic Struggle&quot; and &quot;The Sunwheel&quot;. 

In 1973, NRP ran for the Swedish parliament but only obtained a few hundred votes. In 2009 the party dissolved.

<text>Democratic Alliance () was a Swedish anti-Socialist organisation. It was known for its support of the United States in the Vietnam War, the support for NATO and strong criticism of Olof Palme then Prime Minister of Sweden.

The heritage of DA has been passed on by Contra, a foundation which publishes a magazine by the same name. It takes libertarian and conservative positions and claims credit for introducing the ideas of Milton Friedman in Sweden.

Leading members of DA have been Carl G Holm, founder of the magazine &quot;Contra&quot;, and Tommy Hansson, currently editor of &quot;Contra&quot;.

<text>William Desmond Anthony Pertwee, (21 July 1926 – 27 May 2013) was an English actor and comedian. He is best remembered for playing Chief ARP Warden Hodges in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and P.C. Wilson in &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot;.

==Early life==
Pertwee was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, on 21 July 1926. Born the youngest of three boys of a Brazilian mother and an English father, James Francis Carter Pertwee, who travelled the country as a salesman until he became ill and died in 1938, when Bill Pertwee was 12. The family moved home many times during Pertwee&#x27;s childhood and he lived in Hereford, Glasbury, Colnbrook, Newbury, Erith, Belvedere, Blackheath, Storrington, Westcliff-on-Sea, Wilmington and Worthing.

His education was disrupted by the moves and he attended many schools including an independent convent school, a small independent school, followed by Frensham Heights School in Surrey, Dartford Technical College and Southend College.

Pertwee left school during the Second World War and worked for a company that made parts for Spitfire cannon. He was declared unfit for RAF service as he was on medication following a swimming accident, but was a member of the Air Training Corps (UK Air Cadets). He later worked as an accounts clerk at the Stock Exchange and as a salesman for the clothing retailer Burberry in London.

==Entertainment career==
Pertwee appeared in the radio comedy series &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (1959–1964) and &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1965–1967). He was also a warm-up act for many television shows.

His most prominent role was that of ARP Warden Hodges in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, which he played in both the original television series from 1968 to 1977, and the radio adaptations, as well as the radio sequel &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;, set after the war. Pertwee was president of the Dad&#x27;s Army Appreciation Society and the author of the book &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army – The Making of a Television Legend&quot;.

In July 2008 he and other surviving members of the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; cast gathered together at the Imperial War Museum on the 40th anniversary of the show&#x27;s first broadcast in 1968. He also made appearances on &quot;This Morning&quot;. In 1975 he took part in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; stage show and with Norman Macleod released the Dad&#x27;s Army single &quot;Get Out And Get Under The Moon&quot;, with Pertwee&#x27;s B-side song &quot;Hooligans&quot; on EMI.

Pertwee appeared in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films – &quot;Carry On Loving&quot; (1970) and &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973). His appearance in &quot;Carry On at Your Convenience&quot; (1971) was cut from the final film. His other film appearances include &quot;The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1971), &quot;Psychomania&quot; (1973), as postmen in the film versions of &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; and &quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Pop Performer&quot; (1975), &quot;What&#x27;s Up Nurse!&quot; (1977) and &quot;What&#x27;s Up Superdoc!&quot; (1978).

On television Pertwee appeared in the final episode of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; (1981) and an episode of &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; (1986). He played PC Wilson in &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; (1988–1993), another creation of Jimmy Perry and David Croft.

The subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1999, Pertwee was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Imperial War Museum. In 2006, he performed in the World Cup song, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Jurgen Klinsmann?&quot;

In 2011 a portrait of Pertwee, painted by a local artist, was unveiled in the Dad&#x27;s Army Museum, Thetford where it now resides. Pertwee was patron of the museum and of the DAAS (Dad&#x27;s Army Appreciation Society) until his death.

==Personal life==

Pertwee married Marion Macleod, sister of John and Norman Macleod of the Maple Leaf Four, in 1955. They had a son, Jonathan James Pertwee (born in 1966), who has appeared in various TV programmes.

Following the death of his wife, he lived in Topsham, Devon. He was awarded an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s 2007 Birthday Honours list for his services to charity. He was vice-president of the &quot;Railway Ramblers&quot; and a member of the executive committee of the Entertainment Artistes&#x27; Benevolent Fund (&#x27;The Royal Variety Charity&#x27;) and was initiated in 1976 as a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

Pertwee died aged 86 on 27 May 2013. He had been ill since the previous year and died peacefully at his home in Cornwall. Three days previously he had attended a parade in Thetford (home of the Dad&#x27;s Army Museum) where spectators and museum volunteers remarked how frail he was looking. His death, and those of Pamela Cundell in 2015 and Frank Williams in 2022, left Ian Lavender (who died in 2024), who played Private Pike, as the only surviving &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; cast member.

Pertwee&#x27;s brother James Raymond &quot;Jiggy&quot; Pertwee was an RAF Whitley Bomber pilot who was killed in a crash on a hillside close to a disused quarry above Bank Foot, near Ingleby Greenhow in North Yorkshire, following a leaflet drop over Dortmund, Germany, in June 1941.

He was related to Michael Pertwee and Jon Pertwee, being a second cousin of Michael&#x27;s and Jon&#x27;s father, the screenwriter and actor Roland Pertwee. He was godfather to one of the sons of his &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; co-star Ian Lavender.

<doc id="151959" wikidata="Q15451" url="?curid=151959" title="W. D. Hamilton">
<text>William Donald Hamilton (1 August 1936 – 7 March 2000) was a British evolutionary biologist, recognised as one of the most significant evolutionary theorists of the 20th century. Hamilton became known for his theoretical work expounding a rigorous genetic basis for the existence of altruism, an insight that was a key part of the development of the gene-centered view of evolution. He is considered one of the forerunners of sociobiology. Hamilton published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex. From 1984 to his death in 2000, he was a Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford University.

Richard Dawkins has written that Hamilton was &quot;the greatest Darwinian of my lifetime&quot;.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in 1936 in Cairo, Egypt, the second of seven children. His parents were from New Zealand; his father A.M. Hamilton was an engineer, and his mother B.M. Hamilton was a physician. The Hamilton family settled in Kent. During the Second World War, Hamilton was evacuated to Edinburgh. He became interested in natural history at an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects. In 1946, he discovered E.B. Ford&#x27;s New Naturalist book &quot;Butterflies&quot;, which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection, genetics, and population genetics.

He was educated at Tonbridge School, where he was in Smythe House. As a 12-year-old, he was seriously injured while playing with explosives his father had that were left over from making hand grenades for the Home Guard during World War II. Hamilton had to have a thoracotomy and parts of fingers on his right hand had to be amputated in King&#x27;s College Hospital to save his life. He was left with scarring and needed six months to recover.

Before going up to the University of Cambridge, he travelled in France and completed two years of national service. As an undergraduate at St. John&#x27;s College in Biology, he was uninspired by the &quot;many biologists [who] hardly seemed to believe in evolution&quot;.

==Hamilton&#x27;s rule==

Hamilton enrolled in an MSc course in demography at the London School of Economics (LSE), under Norman Carrier, who helped secure grants for his studies. Later, when his work became more mathematical and genetical, he had his supervision transferred to John Hajnal of the LSE and Cedric Smith of University College London (UCL).

Both Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by aiding their close relatives, but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it. Hamilton worked through several examples, and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was Sewall Wright&#x27;s coefficient of relationship. This became Hamilton&#x27;s rule: in each behaviour-evoking situation, the individual assesses his neighbour&#x27;s fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation. Algebraically, the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if:
 formula_1 

where &quot;C&quot; is the cost in fitness to the actor, &quot;r&quot; the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient, and &quot;B&quot; is the fitness benefit to the recipient. Fitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity. &quot;r&quot; is a number between 0 and 1. His two 1964 papers entitled &quot;The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour&quot; are now widely referenced.

The proof and discussion of its consequences, however, involved detailed mathematics, and two reviewers passed over the paper. The third, John Maynard Smith, did not completely understand it either, but recognised its significance. Having his work passed over later led to friction between Hamilton and Maynard Smith, as Hamilton thought Maynard Smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea (during the review period Maynard Smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas). The Hamilton paper was printed in the &quot;Journal of Theoretical Biology&quot; and, when first published, was largely ignored. Recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books.

Much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system. This system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own (potential) offspring. Thus, Hamilton reasoned, a &quot;costly action&quot; would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters, rather than reproducing themselves.

The supergenes notion (sometimes called the &quot;Green-beard effect&quot;) - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified by Hamilton in 1987.

==Spiteful behaviour==
In his 1970 paper &quot;Selfish and Spiteful Behaviour in an Evolutionary Model&quot; Hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival. What of possible cases where an organism is deliberately harming others without apparent benefit to the self? Such behaviour Hamilton calls spiteful. It can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism&#x27;s genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance.

Spite, however, is unlikely ever to be elaborated into any complex forms of adaptation. Targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge, and the majority of pairs of individuals (assuming a panmictic species) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic relatedness, making the selection of targets of spite problematic.

==Extraordinary sex ratios==
Between 1964 and 1977, Hamilton was a lecturer at Imperial College London (including Silwood Park, where a building is named in his honour). Whilst there he published a paper in &quot;Science&quot; on &quot;extraordinary sex ratios&quot;. Fisher (1930) had proposed a model as to why &quot;ordinary&quot; sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 (but see Edwards 1998), and likewise extraordinary sex ratios, particularly in wasps, needed explanations. Hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in 1960 when he had been assigned to help Fisher&#x27;s pupil A.W.F. Edwards test the Fisherian sex ratio hypothesis. Hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem, opening up a whole new area of research.

The paper introduced the concept of the &quot;unbeatable strategy&quot;, which John Maynard Smith and George R. Price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology. Price had originally come to Hamilton after deriving the Price equation, and thus rederiving Hamilton&#x27;s rule. Maynard Smith later peer reviewed one of Price&#x27;s papers, and drew inspiration from it. The paper was not published but Maynard Smith offered to make Price a co-author of his ESS paper, which helped to improve relations between the men. Price committed suicide in 1975, and Hamilton and Maynard Smith were among the few present at the funeral.

Hamilton was a visiting professor at Harvard University and later spent nine months with the Royal Society&#x27;s and the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Xavantina-Cachimbo Expedition as a visiting professor at the University of São Paulo. From 1978 Hamilton was Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan. Simultaneously, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His arrival sparked protests and sit-ins from students who did not like his association with sociobiology. There he worked with the political scientist Robert Axelrod on the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, and was a member of the BACH group with original members Arthur Burks, Robert Axelrod, Michael Cohen, and John Holland. 

Hamilton was regarded as a poor lecturer. This shortcoming would not affect the recognition of his work, however, as it was popularised by Richard Dawkins in the book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; published in 1976.

==Chasing the Red Queen==
Hamilton was an early proponent of the Red Queen theory of the evolution of sex (separate from the other theory of the same name previously proposed by Leigh Van Valen). This was named for a character in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance:

:&quot;Well, in our country,&quot; said Alice, still panting a little, &quot;you&#x27;d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time, as we&#x27;ve been doing.&quot;
:&quot;A slow sort of country!&quot; said the Queen. &quot;Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!&quot; (Carroll, pp. 46)

This theory hypothesizes that sex evolved because new and unfamiliar combinations of genes could be presented to parasites, preventing the parasite from preying on that organism: species with sex were able to continuously &quot;run away&quot; from their parasites. Likewise, parasites were able to evolve mechanisms to get around the organism&#x27;s new set of genes, thus perpetuating an endless race.

==Return to Britain==
In 1980, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1984, he was invited by Richard Southwood to be the Royal Society Research Professor in the Department of Zoology at Oxford, and a fellow of New College, where he remained until his death.

His collected papers, entitled &quot;Narrow Roads of Gene Land&quot;, began to be published in 1996. The first volume was entitled &quot;Evolution of Social Behaviour&quot;.

==Social evolution==
The field of social evolution, of which Hamilton&#x27;s Rule has central importance, is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours, i.e. those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor. Social behaviours can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient. A behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits, and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss. A behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits, and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss. This classification was first proposed by Hamilton in 1964.

Hamilton also proposed the coevolution theory of autumn leaf color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory.

== Origin of HIV ==

During the 1990s, Hamilton became interested in the now-discredited hypothesis that the origin of HIV lay in Hilary Koprowski&#x27;s oral polio vaccine trials in Africa during the 1950s. Hamilton&#x27;s letter on the topic to &quot;Science&quot; journal was rejected in 1996. Despite this, he spoke to the BBC supporting the hypothesis, and wrote the foreword of Edward Hooper&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;The River&quot;. To look for evidence of the hypothesis, Hamilton went on a 2000 field trip to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to assess natural levels of simian immunodeficiency virus in primates. None of the over 60 urine and faecal samples contained detectable SIV virus.

==Death==
Hamilton returned to London from Africa on 29 January 2000. He was admitted to University College Hospital, London, on 30 January 2000. He was transferred to Middlesex Hospital on 5 February 2000 and died there on 7 March 2000. An inquest was held on 10 May 2000 at Westminster Coroner&#x27;s Court to inquire into rumours about the cause of his death. The coroner concluded that his death was due to &quot;multi-organ failure due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a duodenal diverticulum and arterial bleed through a mucosal ulcer&quot;. Following reports attributing his death to complications arising from malaria, the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit&#x27;s investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final African expedition. However, the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill (which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms) lodging in the diverticulum; but, even if this suggestion were correct, the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.

A secular memorial service (he was an agnostic) was held at the chapel of New College, Oxford on 1 July 2000, organised by Richard Dawkins. He was buried near Wytham Woods. He, however, had written an essay on &quot;My intended burial and why&quot; in which he wrote:
The second volume of his collected papers, &quot;Evolution of Sex&quot;, was published in 2002, and the third and final volume, &quot;Last Words&quot;, in 2005.

In 1966, he married Christine Friess; the couple had three daughters, Helen, Ruth, and Rowena. They amicably separated 26 years later. From 1994, Hamilton found companionship with Maria Luisa Bozzi, an Italian science journalist and author.

<text>University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore (UAS Bangalore) is located in Bengaluru, India. It was established in 1964 as UAS Bangalore by a legislative act. 
==Origin== 
The British government in India, shaken by several famines in India, set up a commission to improve the state of agriculture to reduce the impact of famines. This led to the Famine Commission of 1880 and in 1889 a commission was set up with Voelcker to examine agriculture in India. The report led the rulers of Mysore kingdom (The Wodeyars) to establish research units in the field of agriculture and donated about of land to set up an Experimental Agricultural Station at Hebbal, and appointed German-Canadian chemist Adolf Lehmann in 1900 who began research on soil fertility at a laboratory that now houses the Directorate of Agriculture. About 30 acres of land was then acquired at Hebbal for experimental fields. Later in 1906, Leslie Coleman, a Canadian Entomologist and Mycologist succeeded Lehmann and served for 25 years.

What began on a land was soon extended to about . The increasing reputation of this experimental station as a training center led to the foundation of the Mysore Agricultural College at Hebbal in 1946 affiliated to the Mysore University. This was soon followed by the Agricultural College at Dharwad in 1947 which was then affiliated to Karnataka University. In 1958, veterinary science as a discipline was started with the establishment of the Veterinary College at Hebbal also affiliated to Mysore University.

===Formation===

In 1948 a University Education Commission had been started under S. Radhakrishnan with members that included Zakir Hussain and the American educationist J.J. Tigert, and Arthur Ernest Morgan. They examined the Land-Grant colleges of the United States as a potential model for rural and agricultural education. This recommendation was taken up in 1961 with the formation of an Indo-American team to develop the universities and their curriculum. This resulted in a first Joint Indo-American team in 1954 that studied American universities leading to US-AID supported collaboration between American and Indian universities. A second team was established in 1959 that made recommendations to make agricultural universities autonomous and to have veterinary, home science, and agricultural education on a single campus with integrated teaching, extension and research. This was followed by a committee headed by Ralph W. Cummings of the Rockefeller Foundation, along with Ephraim Hixon of the USAID, L. Sahai (Animal Husbandry Commissioner) and K.C. Naik as convener. The then Mysore State Government through its Act No. 22 passed in 1963 provided for the creation of the University of Agricultural Sciences. The university came into existence on 21 August 1964 and was meant to serve the agricultural education needs of the state of Karnataka with a campus that included the old experimental stations at Hebbal established by Lehmann and Coleman with an additional campus at GKVK added in 1969. K.C. Naik served as the first Vice Chancellor. The UAS was inaugurated on 21 August 1964 by Vice President of India Zakir Husain in the presence of Chester Bowles, United States Ambassador to India and S. Nijalingappa, Chief Minister of Karnataka. On 12 July 1969, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inaugurated GKVK campus with its buildings designed by the architect Achyut Kanvinde who was influenced by Walter Gropius. The Ford Foundation made a grant of $331000 in 1966 to develop graduate research in entomology at the university.

The university initially included the agricultural colleges at Hebbal and Dharwad, the Veterinary College at Hebbal, the fisheries college at Mangalore, and 35 research stations located in different parts of the state following agroclimatic zonation and focus on specific crops along with 45 ICAR projects which were with the State Department of Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.

===Later years and growth===
Later on the Marine Product Processing Training Centre (MPPTC) at Mangalore and Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Hanumanamatti, Dharwad were also transferred to the university.

The university established the Fisheries College at Mangalore in 1969 to provide degree level training and the Agricultural Engineering Institute at Raichur in the same year to offer a three-year diploma course in Agricultural Engineering. The Home Science College was started to impart education on rural based home science at Dharwad campus in 1974, besides establishing a College of Basic Sciences and Humanities and College of Post Graduate Studies at Hebbal.

The phenomenal growth of the university, the differences in agroclimate in the parts of the state, led to the bifurcation of the university into two agricultural universities. An amendment to the University of Agricultural Sciences Act in 1986 saw the birth of the second university for agriculture in the state. The University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore was entrusted territorial jurisdiction over 15 southern districts of Karnataka comprising nearly fifty percent of the total area of the state, while the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, was given jurisdiction over the remaining area in the northern districts of the state.

In 2005, with the needed to provide better autonomy to the veterinary education and research in the state, the Veterinary and Animal sciences faculty was bifurcated form both the Universities of Agricultural Sciences - Bangalore and Dharwad and placed under the single university - Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University with its headquarters in the northern district of Karnataka, Bidar by the passing of the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University Bill, 2004 in the Legislative Assembly on 10 February 2004.

==Constituent colleges==
The university has constituent colleges at places of Karnataka: 
* College of Agriculture, GKVK, Bengaluru
* College of Agriculture, Mandya
* College of Agriculture, Hassan
* College of Sericulture, Chintamani
* College of Agriculture, Chamaraja Nagara
* College of Agricultural Engineering, GKVK, Bengaluru

==Ranking and notability==
In 2012, the university was recognised as the best agricultural university in India by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for which it was conferred the Sardar Patel Outstanding ICAR Institution Award for excellence in teaching, research and extension. In 2021, the university was recognised as the best agricultural university in South India and 3rd best state university in India.

The NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranked it 11th among Agriculture institutes in India in 2024.

<doc id="151961" wikidata="Q448717" url="?curid=151961" title="Air Raid Precautions">
<text>Air Raid Precautions (ARP) refers to a number of organisations and guidelines in the United Kingdom dedicated to the protection of civilians from the danger of air raids. Government consideration for air raid precautions increased in the 1920s and 30s, with the Raid Wardens&#x27; Service set up in 1937 to report on bombing incidents. Every local council was responsible for organising ARP wardens, messengers, ambulance drivers, rescue parties, and liaison with police and fire brigades.

From 1 September 1939, ARP wardens enforced the &quot;blackout&quot;. Heavy curtains and shutters were required on all private residences, commercial premises, and factories to prevent light escaping and so making them a possible marker for enemy bombers to locate their targets.

With increased enemy bombing during the Blitz, the ARP services were central in reporting and dealing with bombing incidents. They managed the air raid sirens and ensured people were directed to shelters. Women were involved in ARP services through the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service.

The Auxiliary Fire Service was set up in 1938 to support existing local fire services, which were amalgamated into a National Fire Service in 1941.

From 1941 the ARP officially changed its title to Civil Defence Service to reflect the wider range of roles it then encompassed. During the war almost 7,000 Civil Defence workers were killed. In all some 1.5 million men and women served within the organisation during World War Two. Over 127,000 full-time personnel were involved at the height of the Blitz but by the end of 1943 this had dropped to 70,000. The Civil Defence Service was stood down towards the end of the war in Europe on 2 May 1945.

Between 1949 and 1968 many of the duties of the Civil Defence Service were resurrected through the Civil Defence Corps.

==Origins==
During the First World War Britain was bombed by Zeppelins and Gotha bombers and it was predicted that large-scale aerial bombing of the civilian population would feature prominently in any future war. In 1924, the Committee of Imperial Defence set up a subcommittee to look at what measure could be taken to protect the civil population from aerial attack. The new committee, known as Air Raid Precautions, was headed by the then Lord Privy Seal, Sir John Anderson.

For the next ten years this committee looked into issues of new aerial weapons development and the possible impact on civilians. The use of gas attacks in the First World War played heavily on the decisions and protection via gas masks was a core decision taken by the committee. Every single person would need a gas mask which meant nearly 40 million would be required. Together with ideas around the building of air raid shelters, evacuations of people and blackout requirements these were all termed passive air defence.

With the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany&#x27;s remilitarisation during the 1930s, a further Home Office committee, the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Department, was created in March 1935. This department replaced the earlier subcommittees and took overall control of the British response to passive air defence.
In April 1937, the Air Raid Wardens&#x27; Service was created which aimed to seek some 800,000 volunteers (some 200,000 people had joined by mid-1938, and following the Munich Crisis of September 1938 another 500,000 had enrolled). After the bombing of Guernica, Gaumont-British began distributing newsreels on air-raid safety to British cinemas. Wardens gave ARP advice to the public and were responsible for reporting bombs and other incidents, and were joined by the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service in May 1938. On 1 January 1938, the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 6. c. 6) came into force, compelling all local authorities to begin creating their own ARP services. Air raid shelters were distributed from 1938.

With the threat of war imminent in 1939, the Home Office issued dozens of leaflets advising people on how to protect themselves from the inevitable air war to follow.

==ARP duties==

The ARP services were to include several specialist branches:

===Wardens===
ARP wardens ensured the blackout was observed, sounded air raid sirens, safely guided people into public air raid shelters, issued and checked gas masks, evacuated areas around unexploded bombs, rescued people where possible from bomb damaged properties, located temporary accommodation for those who had been bombed out, and reported to their control centre about incidents, fires, etc. Also, they called in other services as required.

===Report and control===
Central headquarters that received information from wardens and messengers and managed the delivery of the relevant services needed to deal with each incident.

===Messengers===
Often Boy Scouts or Boys&#x27; Brigade members aged between 14 and 18 as messengers or runners would take verbal or written messages from air raid wardens and deliver them to either the sector post or the control centre. Bombing would sometimes cut telephone lines and messengers performed an important role in giving the ARP services a fuller picture of events.

===First aid parties===
Trained to give first response first aid to those injured in bombing incidents. First aid parties would provide initial treatment on scene, and could call upon doctors and nurses to provide enhanced care.

===Ambulance drivers===
Casualties from bombing were taken to first aid posts or hospital by volunteer drivers.

===Rescue services===
The rescue services were involved in getting the dead and injured out of bombed premises.

===Gas decontamination===
Specialists to deal with and clean up incidents involving chemical weapons.

===Fire guards===
Following the destruction caused by the bombing of the City of London in late December 1940, the Fire Watcher scheme was introduced in January 1941. All buildings in certain areas had to have a 24-hour watch kept. In the event of fire these fire watchers could call on the rescue services and ensure they could access the building to deal with incidents.

==Second World War==

Local councils were responsible for organising all the necessary ARP services in their areas. Although the standard procedures prescribed that the ideal warden should be at least 30 years old, men and women of all ages were wardens. In certain instances, given special needs of communities, even teenagers were wardens. The role of ARP was open to both men and women but only men could serve in the gas contamination (teams that dealt with chemical and gas bombs), heavy and light rescue and demolition services.

Control of a local authority&#x27;s warden service was through a chief warden to whom each sector&#x27;s area warden would report. Within metropolitan boroughs, the initial aim was to have one warden to every 500 residents (this increased later), reporting from individual warden posts – each with its own post warden. Post wardens received messages from the local wardens which they passed to the central Report and Control headquarters.

ARP wardens were initially set up in temporary posts (in homes, shops and offices) and later in purpose-built facilities, mainly at the junctions of roads. In cities, a warden post was responsible for a small area (larger in rural areas) with five wardens to every 4–5,000 people. In London there were approximately ten posts to the square mile. Divided into sectors each post had between three and six wardens who had local knowledge of the location of shelters, utilities (water, gas, electric), what buildings contained (important for the fire services) and who was resident in their sector.
ARP wardens had the task of patrolling the streets during blackout, to ensure that no light was visible. If a light was spotted, the warden would alert the person/people responsible by shouting something like &quot;Put that light out!&quot;. They could report persistent offenders to the local police.

During the seven-month Phoney War period following the outbreak of war in September 1939, ARP wardens mainly offered advice, issued gas masks and air raid shelters (such as the external Anderson and internal Morrison shelter) and enforced the blackout.

===The Blitz===

The role of ARP services came into their own during the Blitz of 1940–41. ARP control centres would sound the air raid sirens and wardens would marshal people into the shelters and then watch out for the fall of any bombs within their sector – often done during air raids and therefore highly dangerous.

When the wardens came across the site of a bombing they would telephone for the emergency services, render first aid to victims with minor injuries and deal with small fires (placing sand on incendiary devices). Other ARP units included first-aid, light and heavy rescue parties, stretcher parties and messenger boys and girls (who cycled between incidents carrying messages from wardens).
Other duties included helping to police areas suffering bomb damage and helping bombed-out householders. They were also tasked with keeping an emergency under control until official rescue services arrived.

From 1 September 1939 a small percentage of ARP wardens were full-time and were paid a salary (£3 for men, £2 for women), but most were part-time volunteers who carried out their ARP duties as well as full-time jobs. Part-time wardens were supposed to be on duty about three nights a week, but this increased greatly when the bombing was heaviest. One in six was a woman, and amongst the men there were a significant number of veterans of World War I.

==Uniform==

At the beginning of the war, ARP wardens had no uniform, but wore their own clothes (wardens wore helmets, arm bands and badges on their civilian clothes) and in October 1939 issued with &#x27;bluette&#x27; overalls with a red on black &#x27;ARP&#x27; badge.

From the formation of the ARP until 1939, the badges were produced by the Royal Mint and made of solid sterling silver, with a crescent-shaped button hole attachment for men and a pin style brooch for women. From 1940 on, the badges were made of a base metal.

From May 1941 full-time and regular part-time wardens were issued with dark blue battledress and beret. Women were issued with a four pocket tunic, again in dark blue serge with skirt.

===Helmets===

ARP service personnel were issued with Mk. II British helmets. These were often not made to the same level as issued to soldiers to reduce costs. These helmets, which had less resistance to ballistic impact, would have small holes drilled in the rim to show they were not for front line use. Depending on the role of the person the helmet would be marked with a letter or letters to easily allow others to ascertain their role at an incident.
* W for wardens (some warden/fire guards had W/FG). Rank within the warden service was denoted by a white helmet and black bands.
* R for rescue services (later HR and LR were used for heavy and light rescue parties)
* RP for repair parties
* FAP for first aid parties and first aid posts 
* A for ambulance drivers
* M for messenger/runner

==Numbers==

By the outbreak of war there were more than 1.5 million involved in the various ARP services. There were around 1.4 million ARP wardens in Britain during the war.

Full-time ARP staff peaked at just over 131,000 in December 1940 (nearly 20,000 were women). By 1944, with the decreasing threat from enemy bombing, the total of full-time ARP staff had dropped to approximately 67,000 (10,000 of whom were women). Volunteers in 1944 numbered nearly 800,000 (of whom 180,000 were women).

==Medals==
Many wardens went considerably beyond the call of duty and a search of medal citations in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; demonstrates this. The first ARP warden to receive the George Cross was Thomas Alderson, who won his award for actions saving civilian life in Bridlington in 1940.

<text>The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (commonly known as the Hong Kong Government or HKSAR Government) is the executive authorities of Hong Kong. It was established on 1 July 1997, following the handover of Hong Kong.

The Chief Executive and the principal officials are appointed by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in accordance with the outcome of local processes. The Government Secretariat is headed by the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong, who is the most senior principal official of the Government. The Chief Secretary and the other secretaries jointly oversee the administration of Hong Kong, give advice to the Chief Executive as members of the Executive Council, and are accountable for their actions and policies to the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council.

Under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; constitutional principle, the Government is, in law, exclusively in charge of Hong Kong&#x27;s internal affairs and specified external relations. The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), from which the Hong Kong government is financially independent, is responsible for Hong Kong SAR&#x27;s defence and foreign policy, while decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress can, in certain circumstances, override territorial judicial processes. The Hong Kong SAR government replaced the former British Hong Kong Government (1842–1997) in 1997. Despite gradually evolving, the general governmental structure was inherited from British Hong Kong.

On February 28, 2024, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, Paul Chan, announced the Special Administrative Region’s (SAR) government budget for the fiscal year 2024 to 2025 (“2024–25 Budget”). Under the 2024-25 budget, total government expenditure is set to rise by 6.7 percent to HK$776.9 billion (US$99.23 billion).

==Head of government==
The Chief Executive is the head of the Region and head of government of Hong Kong. The Basic Law designates a system of governance led by a Chief Executive and an Executive Council, under the principles of separation of powers, with a two-tiered system of semi-representative government and an independent judiciary. The Chief Executive is elected by an Election Committee, a 1500-member electoral college consisting of individuals and bodies (i.e. special interest groups) elected within 40 functional constituencies defined in the Basic Law. The winner is then appointed to the position by the Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing the Basic Law, signing bills and budgets, promulgating laws, making decisions on government policies, and issuing Executive Orders. Then Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, began exercise of her unfettered residual powers of law-making by decree on 4 October 2019, under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, Chapter 241 of the Laws of Hong Kong, bypassing the legislature.

 the Chief Executive of Hong Kong officially replaced the Governor of Hong Kong as the head of the government for Hong Kong following the handover. The Chief Executive is assisted by the Chief Secretary for Administration and the Financial Secretary, and other secretaries who heads policy bureaus. The secretaries for each government affairs are appointed by the State Council of China on the nomination of the Chief Executive. The Secretary for Justice (SJ) is responsible for legal matters of the government and prosecution for criminal cases in the territory. The Independent Commission Against Corruption and Audit Commission report directly to the Chief Executive. The current Chief Executive is John Lee.

==Executive==
===Executive Council===
The Executive Council decides on matters of policy, the introduction of bills to the Legislative Council and the drafting of subordinate legislation. The Council consists of 21 principal officials and 16 non-official members. All members are appointed by the Chief Executive from among the senior officials of the executive authorities, members of the Legislative Council, and other influential public personnels. They serve for a period no longer than the expiry of the Chief Executive&#x27;s term of office.

===Principal officials===
In a system popularly called the Principal Officials Accountability System introduced by then Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in July 2002, all principal officials, including the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary, Secretary for Justice, heads of government bureaux and the Director of the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office would no longer be politically neutral career civil servants, but would all be political appointees chosen by the Chief Executive from within or outside the civil service. The system was portrayed as the key to solve previous administrative problems, notably the co-operation of high-ranking civil servants with the Chief Executive.

Under the new system, there are 3 Secretaries of department and 13 Directors of Bureaux. The system is aimed at raising the accountability of the civil service, so the political appointees are responsible for all their job aspects and will step down if they make any failure. All heads of bureaux became members of the Executive Council, and came directly under the Chief Executive instead of the Chief Secretary or the Financial Secretary.

===Deputy ministers and political assistants===

The government released a report on the Further Development of the Political Appointment System on 17 October 2007. Two new layers, deputy directors of Bureaux and Assistants to Directors (AD) would be added to the political appointments. Each Director of Bureau will be assisted by the two new appointees and constitute the political team, who would ostensibly work closely with bureau secretaries and top civil servants in implementing the Chief Executive&#x27;s policy agenda in an executive-led government. As with the principal officials, these two new posts may be drawn from within or outside the civil service, and appointees may or may not have a political background.

Eight new Under-secretaries were named on 20 May, and nine Political Assistant appointments were announced on 22 May 2008. By the administration&#x27;s own admission, the announcements were poorly handled, and there was widespread criticism of several key aspects, namely the nationality and experience of appointees, the transparency of the recruitment process and the level of officials&#x27; salaries.

==Chief Secretary for Administration==
The Chief Secretary for Administration is responsible for assisting the Chief Executive in the supervision of policy bureaux and plays a key role in ensuring harmony in policy formulation and implementation. The current Secretary is Chan Kwok-ki.

==Financial Secretary==
The Financial Secretary is responsible for preparing the Government Budget in accordance with the Chief Executive&#x27;s agenda in the policy address, ensuring fiscal policies are in accordance to the Public Finance Ordinance. The secretary has to estimate of revenue and expenditure before the Legislative Council each year, and to deliver an annual budget to the Legislative Council, outlining the government&#x27;s budgetary proposals and moving the appropriation bills. The current FS is Paul Chan Mo-po.

== Secretary for Justice ==
The Secretary for Justice is responsible for prosecutions and legal matters and heads the Department of Justice. The current Secretary for Justice is Paul Lam.

==Policy bureaux and departments==
The hierarchical structure of the government secretariat and government departments in Chief Executive John Lee&#x27;s administration since 1 July 2022 is as follows:

===Office of the Chief Executive===
The Office of the Chief Executive is responsible for ensuring the Chief Executive receives the best advice and support for formulating and co-ordinating policies. It is headed by the Director of the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office, who would sit in meetings of the Executive Council.

The Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office, Independent Commission Against Corruption, Audit Commission, Office of the Ombudsman and Public Service Commission report to the Chief Executive directly.

===Chief Secretary for Administration&#x27;s Office===
The Human Resources Planning and Poverty Co-ordination Office, Administration Wing and Legal Aid Department are under the Chief Secretary for Administration&#x27;s Office.

===Financial Secretary&#x27;s Office===
The Office of the Government Economist and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are under the Financial Secretary&#x27;s Office.

===Department of Justice===
The Department of Justice is led by the Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong) (Legal Department and Attorney General before the transfer of sovereignty). The Secretary for Justice (SJ) is responsible for all prosecutions in Hong Kong, drafting all government legislation, and advising other policy bureaux and departments of the government on a vast array of legal issues.

The department consists of the Prosecutions Division, the Civil Division, the Legal Policy Division, the Law Drafting Division, the International Law Division and the Administration and Development Division.

===Policy Bureaux===
The current fifteen policy bureaux is a result of the 2022 government reorganisation, which added, expanded, and re-titled several bureaux. Currently, nine bureaux reports to the Chief Secretary for Administration, and the other six reports to the Financial Secretary. The Chief Secretary for Administration is customarily considered to be the leader of the bureaux.

*Civil Service Bureau
*Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau
*Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (newly established)
*Education Bureau
*Environment and Ecology Bureau (re-titled from the Environment Bureau and takes over the Food and Health Bureau except health)

*Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (reorganised from the Home Affairs Bureau)
*Labour and Welfare Bureau
*Security Bureau
*Commerce and Economic Development Bureau

<doc id="151965" wikidata="Q654799" url="?curid=151965" title="Vernalization">
<text>Vernalization () is the induction of a plant&#x27;s flowering process by exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After vernalization, plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually do so. The term is sometimes used to refer to the need of herbal (non-woody) plants for a period of cold dormancy in order to produce new shoots and leaves, but this usage is discouraged.

Many plants grown in temperate climates require vernalization and must experience a period of low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and winters, rather than in autumn. The needed cold is often expressed in chill hours. Typical vernalization temperatures are between 1 and 7 degrees Celsius (34 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit).

For many perennial plants, such as fruit tree species, a period of cold is needed first to induce dormancy and then later, after the requisite period, re-emerge from that dormancy prior to flowering. Many monocarpic winter annuals and biennials, including some ecotypes of &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and winter cereals such as wheat, must go through a prolonged period of cold before flowering occurs.

==History of vernalization research==
In the history of agriculture, farmers observed a traditional distinction between &quot;winter cereals&quot;, whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and &quot;spring cereals&quot;, whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist John Hancock Klippart, Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist Gustav Gassner who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold.

In 1928, the Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term &quot;яровизация&quot; (&quot;yarovizatsiya&quot; : &quot;jarovization&quot;) to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (from яровой : &quot;yarvoy&quot;, Tatar root ярый : &quot;yaryiy&quot; meaning ardent, fiery, associated with the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into &quot;vernalization&quot; (from the Latin &quot;vernum&quot; meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as &quot;the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment.&quot;

Lysenko&#x27;s 1928 paper on vernalization and plant physiology drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Later however, according to Richard Amasino, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly. Opposing this view and supporting Lysenko&#x27;s claim, Xiuju Li and Yongsheng Liu have detailed experimental evidence from the USSR, Hungary, Bulgaria and China that shows the conversion between spring wheat and winter wheat, positing that &quot;it is not unreasonable to postulate epigenetic mechanisms that could plausibly result in the conversion of spring to winter wheat or vice versa.&quot;

Early research on vernalization focused on plant physiology; the increasing availability of molecular biology has made it possible to unravel its underlying mechanisms. For example, a lengthening daylight period (longer days), &quot;as well as&quot; cold temperatures are required for winter wheat plants to go from the vegetative to the reproductive state; the three interacting genes are called &quot;VRN1&quot;, &quot;VRN2&quot;, and &quot;FT&quot; (&quot;VRN3&quot;).

==In &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;==

&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (&quot;thale cress&quot;) is a much-studied model for vernalization. Some ecotypes (varieties), called &quot;winter annuals&quot;, have delayed flowering without vernalization; others (&quot;summer annuals&quot;) do not. The genes that underlie this difference in plant physiology have been intensively studied.

The reproductive phase change of &quot;A. thaliana&quot; occurs by a sequence of two related events: first, the bolting transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears). Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for vernalization research.

In winter annual &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, vernalization of the meristem appears to confer competence to respond to floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence for as long as 300 days in the absence of an inductive signal.

At the molecular level, flowering is repressed by the protein &quot;Flowering Locus C&quot; (&quot;FLC&quot;), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering. Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active copy of the gene &quot;FRIGIDA&quot; (&quot;FRI&quot;), which promotes &quot;FLC&quot; expression, thus repression of flowering. Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of &quot;VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3&quot;, which interacts with the &quot;VERNALIZATION2&quot; (&quot;VRN2&quot;) polycomb-like complex to reduce &quot;FLC&quot; expression through chromatin remodeling. Levels of VRN2 protein increase during long-term cold exposure as a result of inhibition of VRN2 turnover via its N-degron. The events of histone deacetylation at Lysine 9 and 14 followed by methylation at Lys 9 and 27 is associated with the vernalization response. The epigenetic silencing of &quot;FLC&quot; by chromatin remodeling is also thought to involve the cold-induced expression of antisense &quot;FLC COOLAIR&quot; or &quot;COLDAIR&quot; transcripts. Vernalization is registered by the plant by the stable silencing of individual &quot;FLC&quot; loci. The removal of silent chromatin marks at &quot;FLC&quot; during embryogenesis prevents the inheritance of the vernalized state.

Since vernalization also occurs in &quot;flc&quot; mutants (lacking &quot;FLC&quot;), vernalization must also activate a non-&quot;FLC&quot; pathway. A day-length mechanism is also important. Vernalization response works in concert with the photo-periodic genes CO, FT, PHYA, CRY2 to induce flowering.

==Devernalization==
It is possible to devernalize a plant by
exposure to sometimes low and high temperatures subsequent to vernalization. For example, commercial onion growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant&#x27;s energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.

<text>Typical elements of a [[Windowing system|[[Window (computing)|window]]]]. The [[window decoration]] is either drawn by the [[window manager]] or by the client. The drawing of the content is the task of the client.

In computing, a windowing system (or window system) is a software suite that manages separately different parts of display screens. It is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) which implements the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) paradigm for a user interface.

Each currently running application is assigned a usually resizable and usually rectangular surface of the display to present its GUI to the user; these windows may overlap each other, as opposed to a tiling interface where they are not allowed to overlap. Usually a window decoration is drawn around each window. The programming of both the window decoration and of available widgets inside of the window, which are graphical elements for direct user interaction, such as sliders, buttons, etc., is eased and simplified through the use of widget toolkits.

== Technical details ==
The main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server, although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use. Any application that runs and presents its GUI in a window, is a client of the display server. The display server and its clients communicate with each other over an application programming interface (API) or a communications protocol, which is usually called display server protocol, the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user. It receives all the input from the kernel, that the kernel receives from all attached input devices, such as keyboard, pointing devices, or touchscreen and transmits it to the correct client. The display server is also responsible for the output of the clients to the computer monitor. The output of sound is usually not managed by the display server, but the sound volume is usually handled through GUI applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top. A windowing system enables the computer user to work with several programs at the same time. Each program presents its GUI in its own window, which is generally a rectangular area of the screen.

From a programmer&#x27;s point of view, a windowing system implements graphical primitives. For example: rendering fonts or drawing a line on the screen. It provides an abstraction of the graphics hardware for use by higher-level elements of the graphical interface such as a window manager.

A display server protocol can be network capable or even network transparent, facilitating the implementation of thin clients.

==Display server==
A display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a communications protocol, which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable.

The display server is a key component in any graphical user interface, specifically the windowing system.

The server/client relationship of a standalone display server is somewhat counterintuitive in that a &quot;server&quot; is usually thought of as a large, remote machine, whereas a standalone &quot;display server&quot; is a small local system, with most clients being executed on a larger central machine. The explanation is that a display server provides the &quot;services&quot; of a display and input devices.

==Display server communications protocols==

===X11===

One example of a display server is the X.Org Server, which runs on top of the kernel (usually a Unix-like kernel, such as Linux or BSD). It receives user input data (e.g. from evdev on Linux) and passes it to one of its clients. The display server also receives data from its clients; it processes the data, it does the compositing and on Linux it passes the data to one of three kernel components – DRM, gem or KMS driver. The component writes the data into the framebuffer and content of the framebuffer is transmitted to the connected screen and displayed. X relies on GLX.

One of the implementations of display server concept is X Window System, in particular its actually used version – X.Org Server and Xlib and XCB client libraries. The X.Org Server is a display server, but in its current implementation it relies on a second program, the compositing window manager, to do the compositing. Examples are Mutter or KWin.

Notable examples of display servers implementing the X11 display server protocol are X.Org Server, XFree86, XQuartz and Cygwin/X, while client libraries implementing the X11 display server protocol are Xlib and XCB.

===Wayland===

Display servers that implement the Wayland display server protocol are called Wayland compositors. Like any display server, a Wayland compositor is responsible for handling input and output for its clients and, in contrast to X11, the compositing as well. Examples are Weston, Mutter, KWin or Enlightenment.

Wayland compositors communicate with Wayland clients over the Wayland display server protocol. This protocol defines that clients can directly write data into the framebuffer using the EGL rendering API. The display server still gets to decide which window is on top and thus visible to the user and also still is responsible for passing data regarding to input devices from evdev to its clients.

Wayland is used to a certain degree in some Linux desktop distributions, such as Fedora. It is also well suited for mobile computing and has been adopted, for example, by the smartphone- and tablet-focused projects Tizen, Sailfish OS and AsteroidOS.

An implementation of Wayland is available under the MIT License, the libwayland-client and libwayland-server libraries.

There is an ongoing effort to add Wayland support to ChromeOS.

===Mir===
The Mir display server comes with its own Mir display server protocol which is different from those used by X11 and Wayland. Mir additionally supports the X11 protocol. It was developed by Canonical and was intended to be the display server of choice for Ubuntu. As of 2017, it has been replaced with the Wayland display server for desktop editions of Ubuntu.

There are implementations of the Mir display server, the libmir-server and the libmir-client libraries available under the GPLv3.

==Windowing systems with APIs==
===SurfaceFlinger===
Google developed a display server called SurfaceFlinger for Android:

Everything in Android is rendered to a &quot;surface&quot;; &quot;surfaces&quot; are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by SurfaceFlinger.

Yet another Android-specific solution is &quot;Gralloc&quot;. Gralloc handles device memory i.e. it does allocation, arbitration, it handles synchronization via Android/Linux fence file descriptors. Gralloc competes with other solutions like e.g. Mesa&#x27;s Generic Buffer Management (GBM) or Nvidia&#x27;s EGLStreams. The Gralloc hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is used to allocate the buffers that underlie &quot;surfaces&quot;.

For compositing in Android, Surfaces are sent to SurfaceFlinger, which uses OpenGL ES to do the compositing.

Hardware Composer HAL (HWC) was introduced in Android 3.0 and has evolved steadily over the years. Its primary purpose is to determine the most efficient way to composite buffers with the available hardware. As a HAL, its implementation is device-specific and usually done by the display hardware OEM.

===Quartz Compositor===
For Apple&#x27;s macOS family of operating systems, Quartz Compositor fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the windowing system.

===Desktop Window Manager===
For Microsoft Windows, from Windows Vista onward, Desktop Window Manager enables the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface. It was originally created to enable portions of the new &quot;Windows Aero&quot; user experience, which allowed for effects such as transparency, 3D window switching and more. It is also included with Windows Server 2008, but requires the &quot;Desktop Experience&quot; feature and compatible graphics drivers to be installed. From Windows 8 onwards DWM can&#x27;t be disabled and is software rendered if no suitable graphics card is installed.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Portugal. It was composed by Alfredo Keil and written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça during the resurgent nationalist movement ignited by the 1890 British Ultimatum to Portugal concerning its African colonies. Used as the marching song of the failed republican revolt of 31 January 1891, in Porto, it was adopted as the national anthem of the newborn Portuguese Republic in 1911, replacing &quot;Hino da Carta&quot;, the anthem of the deposed constitutional monarchy.

==History==
On 11 January 1890, the United Kingdom issued an ultimatum demanding that Portugal refrain from colonizing land lying between the Portuguese colonies of Angola, on the west coast of Africa, and Mozambique, on the east coast, thereby forming one contiguous polity (as proposed on the Pink Map). Despite a popular uproar, the Portuguese government accepted their demands. This contributed to the unpopularity of King Carlos I and the monarchy, and it garnered support for the increasingly popular republican movement in Portugal.

The night after the ultimatum was accepted, composer Alfredo Keil, at the suggestion of a group of friends that included Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and Teófilo Braga, wrote the melody for &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; as a patriotic protest march. Inspired by the outrage felt by the Portuguese people, the lyricist, Henrique Lopes de Mendonça, accepted Keil&#x27;s request to create words to suit his melody. Mendonça said &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; was a song &quot;in which the fatherland&#x27;s wounded soul would merge with its ambitions of freedom and revival&quot;; he hoped it would be an anthem, embraced by the people, that could express their yearning for national vindication. Such expressions are epitomized by &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the Portuguese fado, and &quot;Hino da Maria da Fonte&quot;. The march was quickly disseminated; several thousands of copies of the sheet music were freely distributed, together with fliers and posters. The song&#x27;s popularity also spread across national borders, and verses were translated into other languages.

On several stages in Lisbon, &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; drew special attention. On 29 March 1890, the march was performed at the Great Patriotic Concert, held at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos (Saint Charles National Theatre), as well as at every other theatre in the capital. Beyond its use in cultural displays, &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; was also exploited for commercial gain. Several food products, including canned sardines and cookies, were named for this song.

However, the song was perceived as a political weapon, and it was soon converted into a republican hymn. This political co-option of the theme&#x27;s original meaning forced both authors to disavow this vision and stress its purely non-partisan sentiments. On 31 January 1891, a republican rebellion broke out in the northern city of Porto and &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; was adopted by the rebels as their marching song. The rebellion was crushed, and the song was banned. However, it was never forgotten, and, on 5 October 1910, a new and stronger rebellion developed as &quot;A Portuguesa&quot; played in the background. A year later, the first session of the Constituent Assembly officially proclaimed it as the national anthem.

In 1956, the emergence of melodic variants of the anthem forced the government to create a committee whose aim was to define an official version. On 16 July 1957, the current version was proposed, and it was approved by the Council of Ministers.
==Lyrics==
The anthem&#x27;s official version consists of the first verse and the chorus from Mendonça&#x27;s poem.


==Protocol==
Within Portugal, the anthem is played at both civilian and military ceremonies where the country, flag, or head of state (the President of the Republic) is honoured. It is also played at receptions for foreign heads of state, following that of the visitor, and in ceremonies during official presidential visits to other countries.

<text>Sarrià-Sant Gervasi () is one of the biggest districts of Barcelona, Spain. It is the district with the highest per capita income, the largest proportion of university degrees and the lowest unemployment rate. Situated on the north-west of the city, surrounded by the districts of Les Corts, Gràcia, Eixample and Horta-Guinardó and by the villages of Sant Just, Sant Feliu, Molins de Rei, and Sant Cugat. It is formed by the old villages of Sarrià (added to Barcelona in 1927), Vallvidrera (added to Sarrià in 1890), Santa Creu d&#x27;Olorda (added to Sarrià in 1916), and Sant Gervasi (&quot;Saint Gervasius&quot;) de Cassoles (added to Barcelona in 1897). The first written document found about Sarrià dates from the year 987, and the origins of the village are a Roman colony. The old Monestir de Pedralbes belonged to the village of Sarrià, and it is now the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza.

Today, Sarrià still retains a village atmosphere, even in the middle of Barcelona, with narrow streets and small houses. The main street of Sarrià is Major de Sarrià.

The main market in Sarrià-Sant Gervasi is the Mercat de Sarrià on Passeig Reina Elisenda, which opened in 1900 and was renovated in 1967 and again in 2007.

Part of the Collserola mountain belongs to the district, where the Tibidabo and the Observatori Fabra are, and it is a popular place to promenade by bike or by foot or to stop by the road to Sant Cugat, with impressive views over the city.


==Neighbourhoods==

<text>The Nullarbor Plain ( ; Latin: feminine of &#x27;no&#x27; and &#x27;tree&#x27;) is part of the area of flat, almost treeless, arid or semi-arid country of southern Australia, located on the Great Australian Bight coast with the Great Victoria Desert to its north. It is the world&#x27;s largest single exposure of limestone bedrock, and occupies an area of about . At its widest point, it stretches about from east to west across the border between South Australia and Western Australia.

== History ==
Historically, the Nullarbor was seasonally occupied by Indigenous Australian people, the Mirning clans and Yinyila people. Traditionally, the area was called &quot;Oondiri&quot;, which is said to mean &#x27;the waterless&#x27;.

The first Europeans known to have sighted and mapped the Nullarbor coast were Captain François Thijssen and Councillor of the Indies, Pieter Nuyts, on the Dutch East Indiaman &quot;&#x27;t Gulden Zeepaert&quot; (the Golden Seahorse). In 1626–1627, they charted a stretch of the southern Australian coast east of Cape Leeuwin and extending to longitude 133 30&#x27;E. While the interior remained little known to Europeans over the next two centuries, the stretch of coast adjoining the Great Australian Bight was named for Nuyts, and maps subsequent to 1627 bore the legend &quot;Landt van P. Nuyts&quot; or &quot;Terre de Nuyts&quot;. That survives as two geographical names in West Australia: Nuytsland Nature Reserve and Nuyts Land District, and in South Australia as Nuyts Reef, Cape Nuyts and the Nuyts Archipelago.

Edward John Eyre became the first European to successfully cross the Nullarbor (from East to West) in 1841. In writing about Eyre&#x27;s voyages in 1865, Henry Kingsley wrote that the area across the Nullarbor and Great Australian Bight was a &quot;hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of Nature, the sort of place one gets into in bad dreams&quot;. Eyre departed westwards from Fowlers Bay, South Australia on 17 November 1840 with John Baxter and a party of three Aboriginal men. When three of his horses died of dehydration, he returned to Fowler&#x27;s Bay. He departed with a second expedition on 25 February 1841. By 29 April, the party had reached Caiguna. Lack of supplies and water led to a mutiny. Two of the Aboriginal men killed Baxter and took the party&#x27;s supplies. Eyre and the third Aboriginal man, Wylie, continued on their journey, surviving through bushcraft and some fortuitous circumstances such as receiving some supplies from a French whaling vessel anchored at Rossiter Bay, Western Australia, some east of Esperance. They completed their journey in Albany in June 1841.

In August 1865, while travelling across the Nullarbor Plain, E.A. Delisser in his journal named both Nullarbor and Eucla for the first time.

A proposed new state of Auralia (meaning &quot;land of gold&quot;) would have comprised the Goldfields, the western portion of the Nullarbor Plain and the port town of Esperance. Its capital would have been Kalgoorlie.

During the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in the 1950s, the Australian Government removed the Wangai people from their homeland. Since then, they have been awarded compensation, and many have returned to the general area. Others never left. 

Some agricultural interests are on the fringe of the plain including the Rawlinna Station, the largest sheep station in the world, on the Western Australian side of the plain. The property has a short history compared to other properties of its type around Australia, having been established in 1962 by Hugh G. MacLachlan, of the South Australian pastoral family. An older property is Madura Station, situated closer to the coast; it has a size of and is also stocked with sheep. Madura was established prior to 1927; the extent of the property at that time was reported as .

In 2013, a huge area of the Nullarbor Plain, stretching almost from the Western Australian border to the Great Australian Bight, was proclaimed as the Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area under the &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot; (SA), doubling the area of land in South Australia under environmental protection to . The area contains 390 species of plants and a large number of habitats for rare species of animals and birds.

==Geology and geography==

The Nullarbor Plain is a former shallow seabed, as indicated by the presence of bryozoans, foraminifera, echinoids and red algae calcareous skeletons that make up the limestone. The region is also the location of &quot;Nullarbor limestone&quot; and it has a reputation as a significant karst region with Oligocene and Miocene cave formations.

The sequence within the limestone includes five formations:
*the upper formation is the Nullarbor Limestone which is early middle Miocene in age;
*the Mullamullang member of this formation is a paraconforming member, being separated by 5 million years;
*the third member is the Abrakurrie Limestone that was formed in a central depression of the earlier formation; this is late Oligocene to Early Miocene in age and does not reach the edge of the plain;
*the last two formations are conforming formations; the late Eocene Toolinna Limestone lies on the Wilsons Bluff Limestone which is mid- to late Eocene in age; and
*the Toolinna Limestone does not cover the whole Nullarbor and is extant only in the extreme east beside the Abrakurrie formation which lies in a depression.
One theory is that the whole area was uplifted by crustal movements in the Miocene, and since then, erosion by wind and rain has reduced its thickness. The plain has most likely never had any major defining topographic features, resulting in the extremely flat terrain across the plain today.

According to Curtin University research published in 2023, &quot;Nullarbor drastically shifted to dry conditions between 2.4 and 2.7 million years ago&quot;.

In areas, the southern ocean blows through many caves, resulting in blowholes up to several hundred metres from the coast. The Murrawijinie Cave in South Australia is open to the public, but most of the Nullarbor Caves on the Western Australian side can only be visited and viewed with a permit from the Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The Nullarbor is known for extensive meteorite deposits, which are extremely well preserved in the arid climate. In particular, many meteorites have been discovered around Mundrabilla, some up to several tonnes in weight.

According to the USDA soil taxonomy system, the Nullarbor&#x27;s soils are classified as mainly consisting of aridisols.

=== Limits ===

Frequently &quot;The Nullarbor&quot; is expanded in tourist literature and web-based material to loosely refer to all the land between Adelaide, South Australia and Perth, Western Australia. Through observing satellite images, the limits of the limestone formation of the plain can be seen to stretch from approximately west of the original Balladonia settlement (now abandoned) to its easternmost limit a few kilometres west of the town of Ceduna.

==Climate==

The Nullarbor has a desert climate, with arid to semi-arid conditions. Inland, summers can be scorching hot, with daytime temperatures close to , while in winter nights can drop well below freezing. Closer to the coast, the temperature is milder with more rainfall in the winter months. The mean annual rainfall at Cook is , with most rain falling between May and August. Summers are very dry, with rain falling mainly from sporadic storms; however, occasionally decaying tropical systems can cause heavier rain in the summer months. Temperatures on the plain have ranged from at the like-named Nullarbor, South Australia which is the fourth hottest recorded temperature (and the hottest recorded December temperature) in all of Australia, to at Eyre, which is the coldest recorded temperature in Western Australia.

== Biogeography ==
The Nullarbor Plain constitutes a deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregion, called the Nullarbor Plains xeric shrublands by the World Wildlife Fund. The ecoregion is coterminous with the Nullarbor biogeographic region under the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA). The ecoregion is bounded on the west and southwest by the Coolgardie woodlands ecoregion, on the north and northeast by the Great Victoria Desert, on the southeast by the Eyre and Yorke mallee, and on the south by the Great Australian Bight.

===Flora===
Vegetation in the area is primarily low saltbush (&quot;Atriplex&quot; spp.) and bluebush (&quot;Maireana&quot; spp.) scrub.

===Fauna===
The fauna of the Nullarbor includes communities of crustaceans, spiders, and beetles adapted to the darkness of the Nullarbor Caves and the underground rivers and lakes that run through them. Mammals of the desert include the southern hairy-nosed wombat, which shelters from the hot sun by burrowing into the sands, as well as typical desert animals such as red kangaroos and dingoes. An elusive subspecies of the Australian masked owl unique to the Nullarbor is known to roost in the many caves on the plain. The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits. The caves provide roosts to large colonies of wattled microbats, species &quot;Chalinolobus morio&quot;.

===Protected areas===
A 2017 assessment found that 62,317 km2, or 32%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include:
* Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve
* Nullarbor National Park, a protected area in South Australia
* Nullarbor Regional Reserve, a protected area in South Australia
* Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area, a protected area in South Australia

== Communications and transport ==

===Telegraph===
The need for a communications link across the continent was the spur for the development of an east–west crossing. Once Eyre had proved that a link between South Australia and Western Australia was possible, efforts to connect them via telegraph began. In 1877, after two years of labour, the first messages were sent on the new telegraph line, boosted by eight repeater stations along the way. The line operated for about 50 years before being superseded, and remnants of it remain visible.

===Railway line===
The Trans-Australian Railway railway line crosses the Nullarbor Plain from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Construction of the line began in 1917, when two teams set out from Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, meeting in the centre of the plain at Ooldea, an uninhabited area noted for a water supply. This original line suffered severe problems with track flexing and settling in the desert sands, and journeys across the Plain were slow and arduous. The line was entirely rebuilt in 1969, as part of a project to standardise the previously disparate rail gauges in the various states, and the first crossing of the Nullarbor on the new line reached Perth on 27 February 1970. The &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; is a weekly passenger train crossing the Nullarbor from Perth to Sydney via Adelaide.

The railway line has the longest straight section of railway in the world (), while the Eyre Highway (refer below) contains the longest straight section of tarred road in Australia ().

Most of the inhabited areas of the Nullarbor Plain can be found in a series of small settlements located along the railway, and in small settlements along the Eyre Highway that provide services to travellers, mostly spaced between one and two hundred kilometres apart. The town of Cook, South Australia, was formerly a moderately thriving settlement of about 40 people, with a school and a golf course. The reduction of railway operations at the town resulted in its virtual desertion, and it now has a permanent population of four. The &quot;Tea &amp; Sugar&quot; operated until 1996, supplying provisions to the town along the railway line.

===Road===
The Eyre Highway, which connects Norseman in Western Australia to Port Augusta, was carved across the continent in 1941. At first it was little more than a rough track but was gradually sealed over the next thirty years. The last unsealed section of the Eyre Highway was finally sealed in 1976. Unlike the railway, though, it crosses the plain at its southernmost edge rather than through the centre.

The unsealed Trans Access Road closely follows the Trans-Australian Railway, running all the way from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta and onward. It services the numerous cattle and sheep stations that populate the Western side of the Nullarbor and affords access to rail maintenance teams. It is a brutally rough road and—despite the amount of traffic it carries—is poorly maintained.

== Cultural significance ==

The Nullarbor represents the boundary between eastern and western Australia, regardless of the travel method. The press might write that a prime minister who visits Perth has &quot;headed across the Nullarbor&quot;. &quot;Crossing the Nullarbor&quot;, for many Australians, is a quintessential experience of the &quot;Australian Outback&quot;. Stickers bought from roadhouses on the highway show &quot;I have crossed the Nullarbor&quot;, and can be seen on vehicles of varying quality or capacity for long-distance travel. The process of &quot;beating the crowds&quot; on overbooked and overpriced air services at the time of special sporting events can also see significant numbers of vehicles on the road.

Crossing the Nullarbor in the 1950s and earlier was a significant achievement, as most of the route then was a dirt track of variable quality, and presenting real hazards to the motorist. It presented one of the major challenges in Round-Australia car trials (the Redex and Ampol Trials) and gave photographers many opportunities for shots of daring driving and motoring misfortune.

The Nullarbor features in the Australian 1981 thriller film &quot;Roadgames&quot;. The film was directed by Richard Franklin and starred Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis. The film has often been cited as one of the best Hitchcock films Alfred Hitchcock never made.

=== Notable crossings and records ===

====On bicycles====
On 25 December 1896, after an arduous journey of thirty-one days, Arthur Charles Jeston Richardson became the first cyclist to cross the Nullarbor Plain, pedaling his bicycle from Coolgardie to Adelaide. Carrying only a small kit and a waterbag, he followed the telegraph line as he crossed the Nullarbor. He later described the heat as &quot;1,000 degrees in the shade&quot;.

In 1937 Hubert Opperman set a record fastest time of 13 days, 10 hours and 11 minutes for the transcontinental crossing from Fremantle to Sydney. His time cut five days off the previous record.

During their three-year cycling trip around Australia between 1946 and 1949, Wendy Law Suart and Shirley Duncan became the first women to cycle across the Plain.

Between 29 June and 3 July 2015, brothers Tyron and Aaron Bicknell recorded the fastest-known crossing of the Nullarbor Plain on single speed bicycles. Their ride took advantage of the low temperatures in the Australian winter months and was completed over 4 days, 5 hours and 21 minutes, making it one of the fastest bicycle crossings and the fastest done with a single-geared bike.

In January 2017, Austrian cyclist Christoph Strasser set the current record from Norseman to Ceduna of 1 day, 21 hours, 42 minutes.

====On foot====
The first non-Indigenous person to walk across Australia from the west to the east coast, Henri Gilbert, crossed the Nullarbor Plain on foot, with no support team or stock, in the middle of summer. His walk across Australia, from Fremantle to Brisbane, was achieved between August 1897 and December 1898.

For two winter months in 1985, six young Jesus Christians walked from Port Augusta to Norseman without taking any food, water, additional clothing or a support vehicle- although supplies were given to them by passing motorists.

In 1998, runner Robert Garside ran across the Nullarbor without a formal support crew, as part of an authenticated run around the world. Unconventionally, Garside obtained water and other support from &quot;passing traffic&quot; who would leave water cached ahead for him at agreed drop-offs, to achieve the feat. In 2010, columnist Dan Koeppel ran the heart of the Nullarbor with a friend the same way, to vindicate Garside. Garside commented in his diary, that &quot;the key to running the Nullarbor turned out to be Australian hospitality&quot;, and Koeppel concurred that &quot;[F]rom an armchair it is completely impossible to run the Nullarbor. Once you&#x27;re out there, however, there is a way. Robert Garside discovered it. So would I&quot;.

<text>County of Bentheim () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the Dutch provinces of Overijssel and Drenthe, the district of Emsland, and the districts of Steinfurt and Borken in North Rhine-Westphalia.

== History ==

The District has roughly the same territory as the County of Bentheim, a state of the Holy Roman Empire that was dissolved in 1803.

== Geography ==

The district&#x27;s north-western region named (&quot;low county&quot;) protrudes into Dutch territory, and borders it to the north, west and south. The Vechte River (Dutch &quot;Vecht&quot;) traverses the district from south to north and flows into the Netherlands.

== Coat of arms ==
The arms are identical to the arms of the historic County of Bentheim. The origin of these arms is unknown.

<doc id="151980" wikidata="Q244381" url="?curid=151980" title="Microstate">
<text>A microstate or ministate is a sovereign state having a very small population or land area, usually both. However, the meanings of &quot;state&quot; and &quot;very small&quot; are not well-defined in international law. Some recent attempts to define microstates have focused on identifying qualitative features that are linked to their size and population, such as partial delegation of their sovereignty to larger states, such as for international defense.

Commonly accepted examples of microstates include five historic European microstates: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City. Malta, Iceland and Luxembourg are sometimes included in that list but are generally considered too populous to be genuine microstates. Other examples are small, isolated island states in the Pacific Ocean that gained independence from the European or Australasian powers: Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu. The smallest political entity recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City, with fewer than 1,000 residents and an area of only . Some microstates – such as Monaco and Vatican City – are city-states consisting of a single municipality.

== Definitions ==
=== Quantitative ===
Most scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable (such as the size of its territory or population) or a composite of different variables. While it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states, there is no consensus on what variable (or variables) or cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as &quot;microstates&quot; (as opposed to small &quot;normal&quot; states). According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as &quot;inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units&quot;.

=== Qualitative ===

Some academics have suggested defining microstates according to the unique features that are linked to their geographic or demographic smallness. Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label. Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states (or failed states) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.

An alternative approach is to define microstates as &quot;modern protected states&quot;. According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): &quot;microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.&quot; Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies.

The smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is the Vatican City, though its precise status is sometimes disputed, e.g., Maurice Mendelson argued in 1972 that &quot;[i]n two respects it may be doubted whether the territorial entity, the Vatican City, meets the traditional criteria of statehood&quot;.
== Politics ==
Statistical research has shown that microstates are more likely to be democracies than larger states. In 2012, Freedom House classified 86% of the countries with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants as &quot;free&quot;. This shows that countries with small populations often had a high degree of political freedom and civil liberties, which is one of the hallmarks of democracies. Some scholars have taken the statistical correlation between small size and democracy as a sign that smallness is beneficial to the development of a democratic political system, mentioning social cohesiveness, opportunities for direct communication and homogeneity of interests as possible explanations for why this is the case.
Case study research, however, has led some researchers to believe that the statistical evidence belies the anti-democratic elements of microstate politics. Due to small populations, family and personal relations are often decisive in microstate politics. In some cases, this impedes neutral and formal decision-making and instead leads to undemocratic political activity, such as clientelism, corruption, particularism and executive dominance.

The high number of democracies amongst microstates could be explained by their colonial history. Most microstates adopted the same political system as their colonial ruler. Because of the high number of microstates that were British colonies in the past, microstates often have a majoritarian and parliamentary political system similar to the Westminster system. Some microstates with a history as British colony have implemented some aspects of a consensus political system, to adapt to their geographic features or societal make-up. While the colonial history often determines what political systems microstates have, they do implement changes to better accommodate their specific characteristics.

=== Microstates and international relations ===
Microstates often rely on other countries in order to survive, as they have a small military capacity and a lack of resources. This had led some to believe that microstates are forced to subordinate themselves to larger states which reduces their sovereignty. However, research has shown that microstates strategically engage in patron-client relationships with other countries. This allows them to trade some privileges to countries that can advance their interests the most. Examples of this are microstates that establish a tax haven or sell their support in international committees in exchange for military and economic support.

== Historical anomalies and aspirant states ==
A small number of tiny sovereign political units have been founded on historic anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. Those types of states, often labelled as &quot;microstates,&quot; are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.

The Republic of Indian Stream, now the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire, was a geographic anomaly that had been left unresolved by the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, and was claimed by both the United States and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area&#x27;s residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.

The Cospaia Republic became independent by a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.
Couto Misto was disputed by Spain and Portugal and operated as a sovereign state until the 1864 Treaty of Lisbon partitioned the territory, with the larger part becoming part of Spain.

Jaxa was a small state that existed during the 17th century at the border between Tsardom of Russia and Qing China. Despite its location in East Asia, the state&#x27;s primary language was Polish.

<doc id="151982" wikidata="Q5945" url="?curid=151982" title="Cloppenburg (district)">
<text>Cloppenburg is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Ammerland, Oldenburg, Vechta, Osnabrück, Emsland and Leer.
Like the neighbouring Vechta district, it is well known for factory farming, especially of turkeys and pigs. These two districts are also known as the &quot;Schweinegürtel&quot; (“pig belt”). The ground is mostly of poor quality. The mass import of animal food made factory farming possible. With the help of liquid manure, corn is grown, which is also used for a growing production of biogas.

== History ==
The region was part of the County of Tecklenburg in medieval times. It was then for a long time (1400-1803) property of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. In 1803 it was annexed by Oldenburg and remained a part of Oldenburg until 1945. The district was established in 1933.

In terms of political history, both Cloppenburg and neighbouring Vechta are, as one of the few historically Catholic districts in an otherwise majority-Protestant state, some of the most conservative areas in Germany. The federal constituency Cloppenburg – Vechta is frequently the Christian Democratic Union&#x27;s safest constituency, winning a majority in all but two elections since WWII.

The district, alongside neighborging Vechta, have due to their large Catholic population the highest birth rates and lowest median ages in Germany.

== Geography ==
The district comprises the western portion of a historical region called Oldenburgisches Münsterland, which means &quot;lands of Oldenburg formerly held by Münster&quot;. It is a plain countryside, which was originally swampy and full of tiny rivers and brooks.

The Thülsfelde Reservoir is an artificial lake that was built between 1924 and 1927 in order to prevent floods in the area. Today it is a major tourist attraction with several camping sites and a youth hostel.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* top left and top right: the cross as well as the red stripes are part of the arms of Oldenburg
* bottom left: three water lilly leaves made up the arms of Tecklenburg
* bottom right: red and yellow are the colours of Münster

Its blazon is: &quot;Quarterly; I: Or, two bars Gules; II: Azure, a cross Or; III: Argent, three water lily leaves Gules; IV: Or, a fess Gules&quot;.

<text>In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: &#x27;, plural&#x27;) is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end botanical subfamily names with &quot;-oideae&quot;, and zoological subfamily names with &quot;-inae&quot;.

Detarioideae is an example of a botanical subfamily. Detarioideae is a subdivision of the family Fabaceae (legumes), containing 84 genera.

Stevardiinae is an example of a zoological subfamily. Stevardiinae is a large subdivision of the family Characidae, a diverse clade of freshwater fish.

<doc id="151992" wikidata="Q1539307" url="?curid=151992" title="Hellenism (modern religion)">
<text>Hellenism () in a religious context refers to the modern pluralistic religion practiced in Greece and around the world by several communities derived from the beliefs, mythology, and rituals from antiquity through and up to today. It is a system of thought and spirituality with a shared culture and values, and common ritualistic, linguistic, and literary tradition. More broadly, Hellenism centers itself on the worship of Hellenic deities, namely the twelve Olympians.

Greeks who identify their religion and way of life with Hellenism are commonly referred to as Εθνικοί Έλληνες (Ethnic Hellenes). Non-Greek devotees of the Greek gods who embody Hellenic ideals are commonly referred to as Hellenists. Modern Hellenism is sometimes referred to as a Pagan religion; this classification is also at times used as a pejorative for ethnic Hellenes. &quot;Olympianismos&quot; (Olympianism) and &quot;Neopaganismos&quot; (Neopaganism) are used by the Greek Orthodox Church in a derogatory manner, while the term &quot;Dodekatheismos&quot; (religion of twelve gods) is used by both Christian critics and some polytheists.

Another more general name for this religion is Hellenic polytheism or paganism. This term is used most often outside of Greece.

Some academics use the term &#x27;ancient Greek religion&#x27; as a catch-all term in Greece, in order to differentiate it from the Orthodox religion which is also sometimes presented as the &#x27;national religion&#x27;. Followers of &quot;ancient Greek religion&quot; in Greece argue that the term &quot;ancient&quot; is not appropriate, as they claim their beliefs have been continuously practiced, sometimes secretly, and are still alive today.

Ancient Greek religion has manifested itself as &#x27;known religion&#x27; (γνωστή θρησκεία) in Greece through the two religious names, &quot;Hellenic Ethnic Religion&quot; and &quot;Ancient Hellenic Religion&quot;. &quot;Hellenic Ethnic Religion&quot; is represented by the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (Greek: Ύπατο Συμβούλιο των Ελλήνων Εθνικών) while &quot;Ancient Hellenic Religion&quot; is represented by Ellinais (Hellenic Ancient-Religious Holy Society) (Greek: ΕΛΛΗΝ.Α.Ι.Σ - Ελλήνων Αρχαιοθρήσκων Ιερόν Σωματείον)

Various religious movements reviving or reconstructing ancient Greek religious practices have been publicly emerging since the 1990s. In 2006, Ancient Hellenic Religion, was granted &quot;known religion&quot; status by Greece. In 2017, Greece legally recognized Hellenic Religion as a &quot;known religion.&quot; With the status of &quot;known religion&quot; both religions attained certain religious freedoms in Greece, including the freedom to open houses of worship and for clergy to officiate at weddings.

== Naming and terminology ==

Hellenism (in Greek Ἑλληνισμός) has been used to refer to Greco-Roman Paganism since the time of Emperor Julian the Philosopher, who may have been the first to use the term as such in his letter to Ascanius:

In the original Greek:

Thus some Hellenists use the term Hellenism or Hellenismos as a religious label in homage to Emperor Julian. The late Vlassis G. Rassias defined Hellenism beyond religious simplification, explaining it to be the Hellenic &quot;way of life&quot; , or &quot;worldview.&quot;

The phrase &quot;Hellenic polytheistic reconstructionism&quot; refers specifically to the methodology used by some practitioners to recreate the religion based on academic sources, rather than the religion itself, and not all Hellenists are reconstructionists. Other organizations, such as (), the (Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum), and the () use a combination of terms interchangeably, including &quot; (&quot;, &quot;Hellenic religion&quot;), &quot;&quot;Hellenic polytheistic religion&quot;, and &quot;Hellenism.&quot;&quot;

Other terms in common usage by Hellenists include &quot;Greek reconstructionism&quot; and &quot;Hellenic Traditionalism,&quot; but the two are not synonymous. The American group Elaion uses the term &quot;Dodekatheism&quot; (, , &quot;twelve&quot; + , , &quot;belief in the gods&quot;) to describe their approach to the Hellenic religion, stating that the term &quot;has been used for some time within and outside Greece to refer to ancient Greek religion and we feel that it is important for those of us outside Greece share a common name and identity with our co-religionists in the homeland of our spirituality,&quot; and that the term &#x27;Hellenism&#x27; is linked too closely in current use to the modern Greek nation.

== Theology and values ==
When discussing theology, opinions are divided. Some argue that theology is a fundamental part of the ancient tradition and an integral part of ancient philosophy. Some groups, such as YSEE, have published materials about the ancient Greek religion that include a section on theology and praxis, but without specific reference to philosophers or philosophical movements. Others disagree that theology is a central part of the ancient religion and practice. They argue that since they do not have any dogmas or holy books, theology only relates to philosophical movements such as Epicureanism, and that at the community level, they reject any association with specific philosophical paths. They see any such choice as a personal one, not one that should be endorsed by a group or the community, as is the case with monotheistic religions. They consider the rituals based on mythology, with myths forming the basis of their festivals, and there is no theology behind them.

This perspective does not mean that members of the community or broader Hellenic religious milieu can do whatever they please. It is acknowledged that there are certain principles, rooted in tradition, that should be followed and accepted by members. As one follower stated, &quot;you can&#x27;t be dogmatic in our circles, because we don&#x27;t have a dogma [laughing], ... there are of course some guiding principles that one needs to follow because they are based on tradition, these are things that you need to follow.&quot; This means that values are still present and should be adhered to. In some cases, they are openly stated in the group&#x27;s texts:

It is clear that certain values are held in common within the community and should be accepted by members, but there is no such requirement for theological or philosophical beliefs. As one member stated, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have read Homer or Hesiod. The most important is piety. To be possessed by Gods and be pious is the A and Z.&quot; Piety was mentioned by most, if not all, members as one of the most important values that people should follow in their everyday lives.

Prominent concepts include, but are not restricted to: Eusebeia (piety), Arete (virtue), and Xenia (hospitality). These are rooted in the various ancient Greek values concepts that they look to for guidance and inspiration from the Tenets of Solon, the Delphic maxims, the Golden verses of Pythagoras, Epicurean philosophy, the ethics of Aristotle, Stoic philosophy and more.

=== Eusebeia ===

Eusebeia (Εὐσέβεια) is often translated as &quot;piety&quot; or &quot;reverent conduct&quot; (towards gods or parents), &quot;reverence,&quot; &quot;respect.&quot; Eusebeia is the basic practice of Hellenic Religion, fundamental in every way. &quot;Eusebeia&quot; is the attitude and practice of showing respect and reverence to the Gods and parents. The Delphic Maxims say &quot;Follow God&quot; (), &quot;Worship the Gods&quot; (), and &quot;Respect Your Parents&quot; ().

=== Arete ===

Arete () is often translated as &quot;excellence&quot; or &quot;moral virtue.&quot; Arete is intrinsic to the concept of living up to one&#x27;s potential. For modern Hellenists, arete is one of the most important virtues, and it is believed that cultivating it will lead to a good life of happiness and prosperity. Cultivating arete is not limited to just one domain, but also refers to the improvement of all aspects of one&#x27;s existence.

In the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer, &quot;arete&quot; is used mainly to describe heroes and nobles and their mobile dexterity, with special reference to strength and courage, but it is not limited to this. Penelope&#x27;s arete, for example, relates to co-operation, for which she is praised by Agamemnon. The excellence of the gods generally included their power, but, in the Odyssey (13.42), the gods can grant excellence to a life, which is contextually understood to mean prosperity.

=== Xenia ===

&quot;Xenia&quot; () is the concept of hospitality and is sometimes translated as &quot;guest-friendship&quot; or &quot;ritualized friendship.&quot; It is an institutionalized relationship, rooted in generosity, gift exchange, and reciprocity; fundamental aspects of &quot;xenia&quot;. Historically, hospitality towards foreigners (Hellenes not of one&#x27;s polis) and guests was a moral obligation. Hospitality towards foreign Hellenes honored Zeus &quot;Xenios&quot; (and Athene &quot;Xenia&quot;), patrons of foreigners. In aristocratic circles, as early as the Homeric epics, it was as a sort of fictitious kinship, cemented not only by ties of hospitality and gift exchange but by an obligation to promote the interests of the xenos. &quot;Theoxenia&quot; is a theme in Greek mythology in which human beings demonstrate their virtue or piety by extending hospitality to a humble stranger (xenos), who turns out to be a disguised deity (theos) with the capacity to bestow rewards.

=== Offerings and rituals ===
Offerings and libations are considered sacred integral acts within worship. There are several types of offerings that are performed, sacrifices, votive offerings, and libations.

Devotees are divided upon the question of animal sacrifice. Some are fine with the practice, while others do not engage in the practice at all. Some instead offer symbolic food of the animal that is sacrificed instead of the animal, often though not exclusively fruit, bread, or cakes. Worship generally takes the form of prayer, offerings, and setting up altars. Altars serve as the sacred place and focal point of worship to one or more given deities, where offerings and prayers are made to the gods.

== Beliefs ==
Hellenism has historically been a pluralistic religion with beliefs ranging between polytheism, animism and monism, although a Hellenist may hold beliefs that fall into all of these categories. Additionally, there are other interpretations of divinity in line with Hellenistic philosophies, like Epicureanism. Hellenism is, in practice, primarily centered around polytheistic and animistic worship.
Devotees worship the Greek gods, which include Twelve Olympians, divinities and spirits of nature (such as nymphs), underworld deities (chthonic gods) and heroes. Both physical and spiritual ancestors are greatly honored. The gods exhibit both universal and local qualities. For the Greeks, &quot;their gods were at the same time universal, found everywhere and powerful over the whole world, and intensely local, manifesting themselves in particular places.&quot;

Some Hellenists may also enrich their beliefs through metaphysical schools or frameworks of Ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world with developed cosmological systems. Amongst the most prominent of these schools are neoplatonism and stoicism.

== Festivals ==
There are many festivals throughout the year that many seek to celebrate, where the dates are often set by the lunisolar Attic calendar. The festivals typically commemorate events in Greek history, honoring deities that the festivals celebrate, and connote spiritual themes. The celebrations incorporate religious themes, arts, sacrifices and offerings, family get togethers and feasts. Popular sacred days are Deipnon, Noumenia and Agathos Daimon.

Hellenic festivals include:

* Anthesteria
* Lenaia
* Dionysia
* Thargelia
* Arrephoria
* Kronia
* Aphrodisia
* Panathanaia
* Herakleia
* Genesia
* Pyanepsia
* Thesmophoria
* Khalkeia
* Rural Dionysia
* Haloa
* Elaphebolia
* City Dionysia
== Relationship to ancient Greek religion ==

The majority of modern historians agree that the religion practiced by the ancient Greeks had been extinguished by the 9th century CE at the latest and that there is little to no evidence that it survived (in public form at least) past the Middle Ages. (In certain isolated areas it survived until the 12th century; see Tsakonia and Maniots.) Greek member Panagiotis Marinis has claimed that the religion of ancient Greece survived throughout the intervening centuries, and some claim they were raised in families that practiced this religion.

The revival of Hellenic religious identity is typically only part of a larger social movement of re-Hellenizing Greek identity in a comprehensive way, not only religious. This re-Hellenization movement is the current iteration of previous attempts to revive Hellenism. The first to promote such efforts was the late Byzantine philosopher Georgios Gemistus Plethon in the 15th century. It was in Mystras, in the Despotate of the Morea, that Plethon formed a &#x27;circle&#x27; of students. It is through Plethon and his students that many ethnic Greeks today trace their teachings and practices and give credit for tradition&#x27;s survival to the present day.

Two notable students of Plethon include the historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles and Bessarion. Bessarion, educated in neoplatonism, was considered for the Catholic papacy twice. In a letter recounting the news of his teacher&#x27;s death, Bessarion says that Plethon has left to &quot;dance with the Olympian Gods&quot; () and honors Plethon by claiming him to be the reincarnation of Plato based on the &quot;teachings of the Pythagoreans and Plato about the endless ascent and descent of souls&quot; ().

In 1458, just a few years after the death of Plethon, Michael Tarchaniota Marullus was born near the site of ancient Sparta in the Despotate of the Morea or in Constantinople. Both of Marullus&#x27;s parents were Greek exiles who had fled from Constantinople when it fell to the Turks in 1453, and he always proudly called himself a Greek. Marullus was a poet and stratioti-soldier. Among his works, Marullus composed a collection of hymns, the &quot;Hymni naturales,&quot; in which he celebrates the Olympian pantheon. Bartolomeo Scala, his father-in-law, was a member of the Platonic Academy in Florence, Italy.

Validating the relationship between Hellenic ethnic religion and the ancient Greek religion for &#x27;continuity&#x27; is difficult as an outsider to the tradition, argued Vlassis G. Rassias:

Though when Plethon&#x27;s presentation of Zeus as the &#x27;father&#x27; of Poseidon and Kronos is compared to the Derveni papyrus (discovered in 1962), Plethon appears less the heretic. The Derveni Papyrus recounts an Orphic cosmology, one in which the world of today is Zeus&#x27; creation. The new order of the world arises from Zeus after he swallows the severed phallus, the last act in a series of overthrowings of the ruling figure. In doing this, Zeus contained all things within himself and remade the world and regenerated all the Gods and Goddess once more, being King and &#x27;father&#x27; to all things. This aligns with the writings of Plethon. In the Book of Laws, Zeus &quot;existed from all eternity&quot;, &quot;not born of any other ... he is self-father [αὐτοπάτορα] ... has no other father than himself ... he is the father and the eldest creator [δημιουργὸν] of all things.&quot; The other gods in the Greek pantheon are divided according &quot;to divine nature [] into the second and third orders, the first of which are the children of Zeus, his creations, and the second are the children of his children, the creations of his creations.&quot;

Emically speaking, &quot;revival&quot; accurately describes the religious activity occurring in Greece and around the world since one of the main hallmarks is group gatherings and public festival celebrations. Etic observations from a distance by classical scholars, describe contemporary practices as inauthentic and therefore irrelevant or remain open on the issue. British classicist Mary Beard criticized Greek Hellenist worshippers, saying, &quot;until these eager neo-pagans get real and slaughter a bull or two in central Athens, I shan&#x27;t worry that they have much to do with ancient religion at all&quot;, later commented that, &quot;I think I was really responding to the claims made by this group that they were reviving ancient paganism. I am absolutely ok with the idea that religions change. I was reacting to their claims to be a modern version of ancient &#x27;paganism&#x27;.&quot; American classicist, Sarah Iles Johnston affirmed contemporary practice. &quot;The bricolage and re-imaginings of contemporary Pagans is not entirely different from that of ancient Greek religious culture and that even classical scholars inevitably re-imagine the gods.&quot; Revivalists view the tradition as a living, changing religion. Hellenic Revivalism allows room for practitioners to decide what feels right to them, and to adapt historical religious practices to modern life.

Hellenists and other self described pagans/polytheists typically engage in reconstructionism, a methodology that attempts to accurately base modern religious practice on the imitation of culturally and historically genuine examples of ancient religious practices. The term is frequently used in the United States to differentiate between syncretic and eclectic Neopagan movements, and those based on the traditions, writings, history, and mythology of a specific ancient polytheistic culture. The Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes have made a clear distinction between themselves and the Neopagan movements, and identify some &#x27;Hellenic&#x27; groups as &quot;simply disguised as &#x27;Hellenes&#x27; for reasons that exist hidden within the depths of their own minds.&quot;

== History ==

===18th century===
During the 18th century, several notable authors and freethinkers embraced Ancient Greek religion to some extent, studying and translating ancient works of theology and philosophy, and in some cases composing original hymns and devotionals to the Ancient Greek pantheon. The English author John Fransham (1730–1810) was one example, considered an eccentric by his peers, who was also referred to as a pagan and a polytheist. In Fransham&#x27;s 1769 book &quot;The Oestrum of Orpheus&quot;, he advanced a theology similar to that of the Neoplatonists: that the first cause of existence is uncreated and indestructible, but not intelligent, and that the universe is shaped by &quot;innumerable intelligent powers or forces, &#x27;plastic and designing&#x27;, who ruled all sublunary affairs, and may most fitly be designated by the nomenclature of the Hellenic theology.&quot; Despite his apparent belief in the Hellenic gods, Fransham does not seem to have been particularly devoted to their worship. According to an 1875 profile in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Fransham&#x27;s &quot;libations to the Penates found their way down his own throat, and when he sacrificed a fowl to &#x27;Esculapius it was usually in the form of chicken-broth for his supper.&quot;

Another example of an 18th-century literary figure who may have considered himself a Hellenist was Thomas Taylor (1758–1835), who produced the first English translations of many neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts. Taylor was widely known as the &quot;English Platonist&quot;, and rumors existed that he had produced anonymous pamphlets advocating a return to a sort of pagan religion (these rumors have been debunked by modern scholars). Though the extent of his actual devotion to Ancient Greek spirituality remains unknown, brief descriptions written by others about him tend to portray him as a sincerely devout polytheist. One such sketch, written by Isaac D&#x27;Israeli, describes Taylor delaying answering his door until he has finished his mid-day hymn to Apollo, and reports that his study contained a hanging globe of clear glass, representing Zeus, that scattered sunbeams he would use to read and write, shifting his position in the room to follow them throughout the day.

In 1779, the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote in his diary that &quot;the beautiful gods continue to visit me&quot;. He did not profess a literal belief in the deities of Classical Greece, rather perceiving them to be poetic symbols of his own deepest experience.

His work inspired a limited number of devotees. The most notable was Godefroi Izarn, the Marquis de Valadi, a young member of a wealthy French family who adopted a &quot;Pythagorean mode of life&quot;. In 1788, Valadi traveled to England in order to convince an unnamed &quot;gentleman of eminence in the literary world&quot; to become the head of a new Pythagorean sect, assuring him that Valadi would help him find numerous followers. He refused, and suggested Valadi learn Greek and become the head of the sect himself. Valadi began his studies at Glasgow, where he learned of Taylor, to whom he wrote in a letter:

Valadi paid Taylor to live in his house and study under him, but his tenure as Taylor&#x27;s disciple was short lived. He returned to France to fight in the French Revolution in 1789 (he reportedly said, &quot;I came over Diogenes. I am going back Alexander&quot;), and was executed by guillotine in December 1793 during the Reign of Terror.

===19th century===
The literary and artistic movement known as Romanticism promoted notions of the masterless personal soul, a heightened regard for nature and an interest in supernatural themes, including both magic and Pagan, especially Classical Greek, religion. Many proponents of Romanticism wrote poems inspired by figures of Greek mythology. One example of this is found in the poem &quot;The World Is Too Much with Us&quot; written by William Wordsworth and first published in 1807 in his poetry collection &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot;. In it, Wordsworth criticises the world of the early 19th century as materialistic and as removing itself from nature. Towards the end of the poem, Wordsworth wishes he was a pagan who believes in the Greek gods instead of a Christian even though he considers paganism outdated because he thinks that life would have more meaning that way. As Wordsworth himself put it:

Another example is seen in the private letters that the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg wrote to each other. In one letter written in 1821, Shelley wrote to Hogg:

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, several neopagan groups were formed, often incorporating elements of ancient Greek religion and honoring Greek gods, but with heavily syncretic elements drawn from Hermeticism and 19th century folklore studies. Most prominent of these modern traditions are Thelema and Wicca, though Feraferia (an American tradition founded in the 1970s by Fred Adams) places heavier emphasis on a more Hellenistic style of worship and on the Greco-Roman pantheon of gods. One Wiccan organization in the United States, the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, began to host a spring festival based on the Eleusinian Mysteries in 1985, which has continued to be held every year through the present day.

While not exactly a Hellenist, the sociologist and practicing Wiccan Margot Adler stated in her book on Wicca titled &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; that when she was a child, she had a great interest in the Greek gods and goddesses and that she also devised her own rituals to perform in dedication to them. Many years later when Adler found out about Wicca, she converted to that religion because she felt that it confirmed her earlier childhood experiences, though Adler also notes that with regards to her conversion &quot;I never converted in the accepted sense. I simply accepted, reaffirmed, and extended a very old experience.&quot;

During the 1970s, some began to reject the influence of Hermeticism and other heavily syncretic forms of Greek religion in preference of practices reconstructing earlier or more original forms of Hellenic worship. Early revivalists of Hellenic religion tended to be individuals working alone, and early attempts to organize adherents into larger groups failed. The first successful revival attempt was made by the Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes (or YSEE). In 1993, a variety of adherents to the Hellenic religion in Greece and elsewhere came together and began the process of organization. This resulted in a &quot;Hellenic National Assembly&quot;, initiated at a gathering in southern Olympus on 9 September 1995. The process culminated with the formal establishment of the YSEE as a non-profit in Greece, in June 1997.

In the 1990s and 2000s, as the practice of the ancient Greek religion (also known as Hellenic religion) began to increase in popularity. The Orthodox Church of Greece viewed it as a significant threat to its own existence and wanted to eliminate it. As a result, they established a special committee, composed of Metropolitans, priests, and university professors from divinity schools, to study ancient cults and neopaganism. They also organized conferences, published articles and texts, and uploaded information to the internet, all with the goal of arguing that the ancient Greek religion is a dangerous, idolatrous cult with strange beliefs and practices, possibly even having connections to Satanism, and that Greek people should avoid it at all costs. The Orthodox Church also emphasized that the only true and accepted traditional religion in Greece is and should be Orthodox Christianity, the religion of the forefathers.

===21st century and official recognition===
====2004 Olympics controversy====

The 2004 Summer Olympics stirred up several disputes concerning Hellenic polytheistic religion.
* Professor Giorgos Dontas, president of the Archaeological Society of Athens expressed public outrage at the destruction of ancient archaeological sites around the Parthenon and Acropolis in preparation for the games.
* Prior to the Olympic Games, MSNBC correspondent Rehema Ellis, in a story called &quot;It&#x27;s Greek to Me: Group Tries to Restore Pagan Worship&quot;, documented the vandalism and arson of a bookstore in Athens which sold books promoting ancient Greek religion. She also interviewed several adherents who were upset about the current state of affairs in Greece. Ellis said: &quot;A contrast in this place where the Olympic Games were created to honour Zeus – now those praying to the ancient gods are criticized for putting too much faith in the past.&quot;
* The Greek Society of the Friends of the Ancients objected to the commercial use of Athena and Phevos as the official mascots of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. They felt that the caricatured representations of the Greek gods Athena and Phoebus were disrespectful and culturally insensitive. In a BBC Radio interview on 26 June 2004, Dr. Pan. Marinis President of the said that the mascots &quot;mock the spiritual values of the Hellenic civilization by degrading these same holy personalities that were revered during the ancient Olympic Games. For these reasons we have proceeded to legal action demanding the punishment of those responsible.&quot;

====Recognition and places of worship====

In May 2006 an Athens court granted official recognition to the veneration of the Ancient Greek pantheon. Soon afterwards, on 22 January 2007, the Hellenist group Ellinais held a ceremony at the historic Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens. It was the first such rite performed at the temple since the ancient Greek religion was outlawed by the Roman government in the late 4th century. The ceremony involved participants dressed as ancient warriors who left their swords and spears outside the sacred site, to represent the laying down of arms before the Olympic games. The BBC referred to the event as a show of &quot;intentional publicity&quot;. The event caught the attention of the Greek Orthodox Church. Reporters at the event suggested the church might step up their opposition to the legitimizing of Hellenism. Father Eustathios Kollas, who presided over a community of Greek Orthodox priests, said: &quot;They are a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past.&quot; Despite the 2006 court ruling, the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports continued to disallow ceremonies of any kind at archaeological sites, and some early 21st century Hellenic rituals therefore took the form of protests. In August 2008, a group of adherents, again organized by Ellinais, gathered at the Acropolis both to give libations and other offerings to the goddess Athena, and to protest the removal of architectural pieces from the temples to a new museum at the site.

The first modern Hellenic temple dedicated to the Hellenic gods was started in 1994 just outside Thessaloniki in the village of Oraiokastro and completed in 2009. Another temple, dedicated to Alexander and the Earth opened in the nearby village of Mesaio in 2019.

A modern Hellenic temple in Athens is still in the planning stages as of 2017, and worshippers meet at a temporary temple at the headquarters of the Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes (YSEE) at an apartment building on Aristotelous street in central Athens.

==Organizations in Greece and demographics==

Ancient Greek religion originated in and is practiced in Greece and has inspired religious worship in other countries. Leaders of the movement claimed in 2005 that there are as many as 2,000 adherents to the Hellenic tradition in Greece, with an additional 100,000 who have &quot;some sort of interest&quot;. No official estimates exist for devotees worldwide. Outside Greece, religious organizations began to emerge around 1998, with some individuals claiming to have been engaging in some form of traditional practice since the 1970s.

The first Greek organization to openly support the religious revival of Hellenic religion was (Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes or YSEE), established in 1997, and is publicly active. YSEE is a founding member of the World Congress of Ethnic Religions (now European Congress of Ethnic Religions) and hosted the seventh annual WCER Congress in June 2004. With branches also in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany, their level of real world public activity, and actual membership levels, the Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes can be argued to be the defining lead organization for the public revival movement. YSEE is also a member of the European Union&#x27;s action program to combat discrimination. The organization primarily refers to the religion as the &quot;Ethnic Polytheistic&quot; or &quot;genuine Hellenism&quot; and its practitioners as &quot;Ethnikoi Hellenes&quot;, &quot;Ethnic [National] Hellenes&quot;. YSEE uses the terms &quot;traditional&quot;, &quot;ethnic&quot;, and &quot;genuine&quot; to refer to their religious practices. Hellenic polytheist author Vlassis G. Rassias has written a popular series of books on &quot;Christian persecutions against the Hellenes&quot;, while the Athens-based group &quot;Ellinais&quot; emphasizes &quot;world peace and the brotherhood of man&quot;.

Another active organization based in Greece, the (, ) religious community was founded in 2008. Labrys has focused primarily on the religious aspects of Hellenism or Hellenic polytheism, avoiding anti-Christian rhetoric and politics, establishing weekly public rituals and engaging in other aspects of practical promotion of polytheism like theater and music. Labrys has also promoted among Hellenes worldwide the need to actively practice household worship and the idea that family and community should be the starting points of religious practice. The community has been organizing since 2008 the largest festival in Athens and also actively participates and supports the religious aspects of the oldest Hellenic festival in Greece, Prometheia which is held every year on Mount Olympus. The Labrys religious community has published a book.

== Other organizations ==
Founded in the United States in 2001, Hellenion identifies its practices as &quot;Hellenic Pagan Reconstructionism&quot; and emphasizes historical accuracy in its mission statement. Hellenion does not provide official membership numbers to the public, but an unofficial estimate of 43 members was made for 2007 and approximately 100 members for 2017. though this number can only give the roughest approximation, as Hellenion offers hardship waivers to those who cannot afford the typical membership fees. In early 2010, the organization reported 1 demos (fully chartered local congregation) and 6 proto-demoi (start-up congregations not fully chartered with less than 3 members) established, which offer rituals and other events for members and frequently for the public as well. Two of the six proto-demoi cannot be independently verified to exist. Hellenion offers legal clergy training, basic adult religious education classes, and other educational/training courses for its members.

Another American group, Elaion, was founded in 2005 after members of other groups grew dissatisfied with what was, in their view, a de-emphasis on Hellenic ethics, philosophy, poetry, and art, and a re-emergence of &quot;occult&quot; doctrines among some practitioners. Elaion aimed to create an organization that emphasized ethics, piety, and &quot;right-living&quot;, which they initially termed &quot;Traditionalist Hellenismos&quot;. No reported numbers for current membership levels are known to exist. Among the various modern Stoic philosophical groups, many equate Zeus with Divine Providence, or Divine Logos. Among the modern Epicurean philosophical groups, Society of Epicurus accepts the ancient, naturalistic, polytheistic view of the Epicurean gods as one of three legitimate modern interpretations of Epicurean theology.

In Brazil, there are some religious groups, in different states. In addition, in Portuguese language, there is the website of RHB – Reconstrucionismo Helênico no Brasil, built since 2003 by Brazilian members of Hellenion and other international groups, such as the American Neokoroi and the Greek Thyrsos.

<text>Hong Kong is administratively divided into 18 districts. Each district has a district council.

District councils was formerly called district boards, for which the boards were established in 1982, when Hong Kong was under British rule. However, the districts have limited relevance to the population, as few public services operate according to district boundaries. The police, fire services, health services, education and hospital authorities, and postal service each define their own idiosyncratic geographic divisions.
==History==
In the 1860s, residents speaking the same dialects were often grouped together, and social structure was more important than district structure. Merchants often travelled together as guilds and sold common goods across different areas. Organizations such as Nam Pak Hong, Tung Wah Hospital Committee and &quot;District Watch Committee&quot; often cut across any native district lines. The concept of boundary separation only became important around 1870, when cultural conflicts increased between coolies, Chinese and the British. One of the first legal attempt to control districts came in 1888 under the European District Reservation Ordinance, which reserved areas exclusively to Europeans. The first Town Planning Ordinance did not appear until 1939.

The New Territories and New Kowloon became part of Hong Kong since 1898. The colonial government appoints District Officer to oversee the area. At first the Northern District Officer was stationed in Tai Po. The Northern District and Southern District was later split into Islands District Office, Tuen Mun District Office, Yuen Long District Office, Sai Kung District Office, etc.

Following the appointment of district officers in urban Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Kowloon since 1968, the District Administration Scheme was implemented in 1982 with the establishment of a district board and a district management committee in each of the districts in Hong Kong, including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and aforementioned the New Territories. The aim of the scheme is to achieve a more effective co-ordination of government activities in the provision of services and facilities at the district level, ensure that the Government is responsive to district needs and problems and promote public participation in district affairs. From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, the former district boards were replaced by provisional district boards. The provisional district boards were in turn replaced on 1 January 2000, with 18 district councils.

There have been two major changes on district divisions since their implementation in 1982:

# Kwai Tsing District split off from Tsuen Wan District in 1985.
# Yau Tsim District and Mong Kok District merged to become Yau Tsim Mong District in 1994.

There were also alterations to the borders between Sham Shui Po and Kwai Tsing districts, which used to straddle across Nob Hill since its development on the site of the former Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park, in 2006, and between Eastern and Wan Chai districts, which involved reallocation of the Tin Hau and the Victoria Park constituencies in 2014. The borders between Sham Shui Po with that of Kwai Tsing and Yau Tsim Mong were also altered after new land reclamation projects in the 1990s made it necessary to redraw the previous sea borders over newly formed land. The border between Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City districts was altered following reclamation of Hung Hom Bay in the 1990s.

== Districts ==
Hong Kong in administration consists of three areas (區域), which was further divided into 18 districts (地區). The three areas are: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. The New Territories has the most districts (9), followed by Kowloon (5), and lastly Hong Kong Island (4).

The population density per district varies from 1,021 (Islands) to 59,704 (Kwun Tong) per km2. Before the combination of Mong Kok and Yau Tsim districts in 1995, Mong Kok District had the highest density (~120,000/km2).

==Management structure==




==The Home Affairs Department==
The Home Affairs Department is responsible for the District Administration Scheme, community building and community involvement activities, minor environmental improvement projects and minor local public works, and the licensing of hotels and guesthouses, bedspace apartments and clubs. It promotes the concept of effective building management and works closely with other government departments to consistently improve the standard of building management in Hong Kong. It monitors the provision of new arrival services and identifies measures to meet the needs of new arrivals. It also disseminates information relating to and, where necessary, promotes the public&#x27;s understanding of major government policies, strategies and development plans; and collects and assesses public opinion on relevant issues affecting the community. These responsibilities are discharged primarily through the 18 district offices covering the whole of Hong Kong.

==District officers==
As head of each district office, the district officer is the representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government at the district level. He has the responsibility of overseeing directly the operation of the District Administration Scheme in the district. He is charged with implementing and co-ordinating the execution of district programmes, ensuring that the advice of the district council is properly followed up, and promoting residents&#x27; participation in district affairs. In addition, he is required to maintain close liaison with different sectors of the community and reflect their concerns and problems to the Government. It is his duty to ensure that district problems are resolved promptly through inter-departmental consultation and co-operation. Also, he acts as a link between the district council and departments and serves as a mediator between them when problems arise. The district officer is also involved with the community at every level. He has a role to mediate in the resolution of disputes between corporate bodies and residents. He performs an advisory and liaison role in providing assistance to building management bodies. He operates a public enquiry service to enable the community to have easy access to services and information provided by government. In emergency situations, the district officer is responsible for co-ordinating various departments&#x27; efforts on the ground for ensuring the effective provision of relief services.

==The role of district councils==
District councils play an essential advisory role on district matters and issues affecting the whole of Hong Kong as appropriate. The functions of a district council are:

* To advise the Government on:
** matters affecting the well-being of the people in the district;
** the provision and use of public facilities and services within the district;
** the adequacy and priorities of government programmes for the district; and
** the use of public funds allocated to the district for local public works and community activities;
* Where funds are made available for the purpose, to undertake:
** environmental improvements within the district;
** the promotion of recreational and cultural activities within the district; and
**community activities within the district.

The district councils also advise on the management of community centres, which should be in the best interest of the local residents. The district councils initiate, organise and sponsor community involvement projects and activities aimed at enhancing community spirit and social cohesion and promoting the well-being of people in the districts. These range from large-scale district festivals to the formation of local youth choirs and dance troupes. They have also achieved notable success in improving the local environment by undertaking minor environmental improvement projects such as the provision of rest gardens, rain shelters and amenity planting.

In the 2003/04 financial year, $205.6 million has been allocated for the district councils.

==Consultation with district councils==
Departments send representatives to district council meetings, to consult them and, where appropriate, act on their advice and keep them informed of government policies and programmes in general and, more specifically, of the work of departments in the district and local matters that are likely to affect the livelihood, living environment or well-being of the residents within a district.

==Composition of district councils==
The eleven-term district councils, comprising 479 members (452 elected, 27 ex officio who are chairmen of the rural committees in the New Territories), commenced on 1 January 2020.

==District management committees==

The district management committee in each district is chaired by the district officer. It is a government committee consisting of representatives of the core departments in the district, and provides a forum for departments to discuss and resolve district problems. It responds positively to the advice and requests of the district council and submits a comprehensive written report on its work to each meeting of the district council. To enhance communication between the district management committee and the district council, the district council chairman, vice-chairman and chairmen of district council committees are invited to join district management committee as members.

<text>The Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

The then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the trijet 727, received its first orders in August 1978.
The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982, and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982.
Eastern Air Lines placed the initial variant in commercial service on January 1, 1983.
A package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a combi model in September 1988.
The stretched was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. 
After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 NG variants as a successor to the -200.
The jetliner is powered by 36,600–43,500 lbf (163–193 kN) Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000 underwing turbofan engines for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW).
The 757 has a 2,000 sq ft (185 m2) supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag and a conventional tail.
It keeps the 707 fuselage width and six–abreast seating and its two-crew glass cockpit has a common type rating with the concurrently designed 767 (a wide-body aircraft).

It was produced in two fuselage lengths: the long 757-200 (the most popular with 913 built) typically seats 200 passengers in two classes over 3,915 nautical miles [nmi] (7,250 km; ); while the long 757-300 typically seats 243 over 3,400 nmi (6,295 km; ).
The 757-200F can haul a 72,210 lb (32,755 kg) payload over 2,935 nmi (5,435 km; ).
Passenger have been modified for cargo use as the Special Freighter (SF) and the Precision Converted Freighter (PCF).
Major customers for the 757 included U.S. mainline carriers, European charter airlines, and cargo companies.
It was commonly used for short and mid-range domestic routes, shuttle services, and transcontinental U.S. flights.
ETOPS extended flights were approved in 1986 to fly intercontinental routes.
Private and government operators have customized the 757 as VIP carriers such as the US C-32.
In July 2017, there were 665 Boeing 757 in commercial service, with Delta Air Lines being the largest operator with 127 airplanes in its fleet.

The airliner has recorded ten hull-loss accidents out of a total of 13 hull losses, .

==Development==

===Background===
In the early 1970s, following the launch of the first wide-body airliner, the 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727. Designed for short and medium length routes, the trijet was the best-selling jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched 727 (to be designated 727-300), and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727&#x27;s existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.
United Airlines provided input for the proposed 727-300, which Boeing was poised to launch in late 1975, but lost interest after examining development studies for the 7N7. Although the was offered to Braniff International Airways and other carriers, customer interest remained insufficient for further development. Instead, airlines were drawn to the high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck technologies, lower weight, improved aerodynamics, and reduced operating cost promised by the 7N7. These features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size wide-body airliner, code-named 7X7, which became the 767. Work on both proposals accelerated as a result of the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.

By 1978, development studies focused on two variants: a with seating for 160, and a with room for over 180 seats. New features included a redesigned wing, under-wing engines, and lighter materials, while the forward fuselage, cockpit layout, and T-tail configuration were retained from the 727. Boeing planned for the aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passenger-kilometer of any narrow-body airliner. On August 31, 1978, Eastern Air Lines and British Airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7N7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the version. These orders were signed in March 1979, when Boeing officially designated the aircraft as the 757. The shorter did not receive any orders and was dropped; 737s later fulfilled its envisioned role.

===Design effort===
The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727. The focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs, which had grown amid rising oil prices during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Design targets included a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines, plus 10 percent from aerodynamic improvements, versus preceding aircraft. Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) was set at , which was more than the 727. The 757&#x27;s higher thrust-to-weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high conditions with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air, offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft. Competitors needed longer takeoff runs for these hot and high conditions. Boeing also offered options for higher payload capability.
The twin-engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four-engine designs. Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the turbofan built by Rolls-Royce, which was capable of of thrust. This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S. Domestic manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney subsequently offered the thrust PW2037, which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980. General Electric also offered its engine early in the program, but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand.

As development progressed, the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767, which was several months ahead in development. To reduce risk and cost, Boeing combined design work on both twinjets, resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics. Computer-aided design, first applied on the 767, was used for over one-third of the 757&#x27;s design drawings. In early 1979, a common two-crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft, including shared instrumentation, avionics, and flight management systems. In October 1979 the nose was widened and dropped to reduce aerodynamic noise by six dB, to improve the flight deck view and to give more working area for the crew and for greater commonality with the 767. Cathode-ray tube (CRT) color displays replaced conventional electromechanical instruments, with increased automation eliminating the flight engineer position common to three-person cockpits. After completing a short conversion course, pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa, owing to their design similarities.
A new aft-loaded shape which produced lift across most of the upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, was used for the 757&#x27;s wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727&#x27;s produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.

One of the last 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 in favor of a conventional tail. This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a deep stall, and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage. At in length, the was longer than the , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space, seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor. The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 737, was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727. This was mainly to reduce drag, and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing&#x27;s market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.

===Production and testing===
Boeing built a final assembly line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, about half of the aircraft&#x27;s components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities with the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and final assembly of the first aircraft began in January 1981.
The prototype 757 rolled out of the Renton factory on January 13, 1982. The aircraft, equipped with engines, completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on February 19, 1982. The first flight was affected by an engine stall, following indications of low oil pressure. After checking system diagnostics, company test pilot John Armstrong and co-pilot Lew Wallick were able to restart the affected engine, and the flight proceeded normally thereafter. Subsequently, the 757 embarked on a seven-day weekly flight test schedule. By this time, the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers, namely Air Florida, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Monarch Airlines, and Transbrasil.

The seven-month 757 flight test program used the first five aircraft built. Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests, hot and cold weather trials, and route-proving flights. Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process. After design issues were identified, the 757&#x27;s exit doors received dual-spring mechanisms for easier operation, and the fuselage was strengthened for greater bird strike resistance. The production aircraft was lighter than originally specified, and recorded a three percent better-than-expected rate of fuel burn. This resulted in a range increase of , and prompted Boeing to tout the aircraft&#x27;s fuel efficiency characteristics. After 1,380 flight test hours, the RB211-powered 757 received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on December 21, 1982, followed by UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) certification on January 14, 1983. The first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22, 1982, about four months after the first 767 deliveries. The first 757 with PW2037 engines rolled out about one year later, and was delivered to Delta Air Lines on November 5, 1984.

===Service entry and operations===
Eastern Air Lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots&#x27; introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40 percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.

Despite the successful debut, 757 sales remained stagnant for most of the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were less expensive and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines&#x27; 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.

In the late 1980s, increasing airline hub congestion and the onset of U.S. airport noise regulations fueled a turnaround in 757 sales. From 1988 to 1989, airlines placed 322 orders, including a combined 160 orders from American Airlines and United Airlines. By this time, the 757 had become commonplace on short-haul domestic flights and transcontinental services in the U.S., and had replaced aging 707s, 727s, Douglas DC-8s, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. The maximum range of , which was over one-and-a-half times the 727&#x27;s, allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer nonstop routes. The 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations, such as John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, and airports with aircraft size restrictions, such as Washington National Airport near downtown Washington, D.C. The largest U.S. operators, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each.
In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair were the 757&#x27;s largest mainline customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as too large for their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the CAAC Airlines in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.

In 1986, the FAA approved RB211-powered 757s for extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) operations over the North Atlantic, following precedents set by the 767. Under ETOPS regulations, a set of safety standards governing twinjet flights over oceans and other areas without nearby suitable landing sites, airlines began using the aircraft for mid-range intercontinental routes. Although the 757 was not originally intended for transoceanic flights, regulators based their decision on its reliable performance record on extended transcontinental U.S. services. ETOPS certification for 757s equipped with PW2000 series engines was granted in 1992.

In the early 1990s, the FAA and other U.S. government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), began studying the 757&#x27;s wake turbulence characteristics. This followed several incidents, including two fatal crashes, in which small private aircraft experienced loss of control when flying close behind the twinjet. Smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected rolling movements when flying behind 757s. Investigators focused on the aircraft&#x27;s aft-loaded wing design, which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce wingtip vortices that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s. Other tests were inconclusive, leading to debate among government agencies, and in 1994 and 1996 the FAA updated air traffic control regulations to require greater separation behind the 757 than other large-category jets. The 757 became the only sub- airliner to be classified as a &quot;heavy&quot; jet, alongside wide-body aircraft, under FAA separation rules.

===Shortened variant: -100===
757-100 was a 150-seat, short fuselage version intended to offer similar capacity to a 727-200 but with greater range. Both the 757-100 and -200 were announced at the product launch on August 31, 1978, however the large wing and landing gear common with the 757-200 were found to be excessively heavy for an aircraft of that capacity. Planning for the 757-100 was discontinued in March 1979.

===Stretched variant: -300===
Production of the 757 peaked at an annual rate of 100 aircraft in the early 1990s, during which time upgraded models came under consideration. For over a decade, the narrow-body twinjet had been its manufacturer&#x27;s only single-aisle airliner without a stretched variant, and while rumors of a long-range and stretched persisted, no formal announcements had been made. European charter carriers were particularly interested in a higher-capacity version which could take better advantage of the 757&#x27;s range. Besides meeting the needs of charter customers, a larger model would enable Boeing to match the passenger lift capabilities of the with lower operating costs, and counter longer-range versions of the 185-seat Airbus A321, a new stretched variant of the A320 narrow-body airliner.
In September 1996, following a launch order for 12 aircraft from charter carrier Condor, Boeing announced the stretched at the Farnborough Airshow. The new model was a stretch of the , resulting in room for 50 more passengers and nearly 50 percent more cargo. The type&#x27;s design phase was intended to be the shortest in its manufacturer&#x27;s history, with 27 months from launch to certification. Due to development and cost concerns, radical upgrades such as a Next Generation 737-style advanced cockpit were not implemented. Instead, the stretched derivative received upgraded engines, enhanced avionics, and a redesigned interior. The first rolled out on May 31, 1998, and completed its maiden flight on August 2, 1998. Following regulatory certification in January 1999, the type entered service with Condor on March 19, 1999.

The 757-300 was also ordered by American Trans Air, Arkia Israel Airlines, Continental Airlines, Icelandair, and Northwest Airlines. Sales for the variant remained slow, and ultimately totaled 55 of the -300. Boeing had targeted the as a potential replacement for two of its largest customers, American Airlines and United Airlines, but neither were in a financial position to commit to new aircraft. Overtures to other charter airlines also did not result in further orders. By November 1999, faced with diminishing sales and a reduced backlog despite the launch of the , Boeing began studying a decrease in 757 production rates.

=== Further developments ===
While the 757 program had been financially successful, declining sales in the early 2000s threatened its continued viability. Airlines were again gravitating toward smaller aircraft, now mainly the 737 and A320, because of their reduced financial risk. An airline industry downturn and the large number of relatively young 757s already in service also reduced customer demand. In 2000, spurred by interest from Air 2000 and Continental Airlines, Boeing reexamined the possibility of building a longer-range . The proposed derivative would have featured auxiliary fuel tanks, plus wing and landing gear upgrades from the , resulting in a higher MTOW and a potential range increase to over . However, the proposal failed to garner any orders. In March 2001, Boeing delivered the first , a second-hand converted for freighter use, to DHL Aviation. The marked the manufacturer&#x27;s first foray into passenger-to-freighter conversions.
Customer interest in new 757s continued to decline, and in 2003, a renewed sales campaign centered on the and yielded only five new orders. In October 2003, following Continental Airlines&#x27; decision to switch its remaining orders to the , Boeing announced the end of 757 production. The 1,050th and last example, a built for Shanghai Airlines, rolled off the production line at the Renton factory on October 28, 2004, and was delivered on November 28, 2005, after several months of storage. With the conclusion of the 757 program, Boeing consolidated 737 assembly at its Renton factory, downsizing its facilities by 40 percent and shifting staff to different locations.

Since the end of production, many Boeing 757s have remained in service, mainly in the U.S. From 2004 to 2008, the average fuel cost for typical mid-range U.S. domestic 757 flights tripled, putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets. In May 2005, the FAA granted regulatory approval for manufacturer-sanctioned blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated as a retrofit on the . The winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by through the reduction of lift-induced drag. Continental Airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the , and in February 2009 became the first operator of with winglets. Aviation Partners further developed the blended winglet into the Scimitar Blended Winglet, which improves fuel burn by 1.1% over the original blended winglet. Icelandair and United Airlines have retrofitted their 757-200s with Scimitar Blended Winglets.
Prior to the United-Continental merger in 2010, the 757 remained the only narrow-body aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three U.S. legacy carriers: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. During this period, the 757&#x27;s capacity and range capabilities had remained largely unequaled among narrow-body airliners; when selecting replacement aircraft, airlines have had to either downsize to smaller single-aisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the and A321, or upsize to the larger, longer-range 787 Dreamliner and wide-body jets. The Tupolev Tu-204, a narrow-body twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757&#x27;s, is offered in a 200-seat version and has seen limited production for mainly Russian customers. Within Boeing, the 215-seat, range 737-900ER had been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 757-200 after the latter ceased production. The Airbus A321neo LR and XLR variants finally provided a suitable 757-200 replacement on market in terms of range and capacity, and Icelandair and United Airlines have ordered the A321XLR to replace the Boeing 757 on their longer-range routes.

===Replacement aircraft===

In February 2015, Boeing marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth stated that re-engining the 757 had been studied but there was no business case to support it. At the March 2015 ISTAT conference, Air Lease Corporation&#x27;s Steven Udvar-Hazy predicted the 757 replacement would be a more capable, clean-sheet 767-like twin-aisle airplane capable of taking off from runways like New York LaGuardia, and Tinseth was focused on 20% more range and more capacity than the 757-200.

==Design==
===Overview===
The 757 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. Each wing features a supercritical cross-section and is equipped with five-panel leading edge slats, single- and double-slotted flaps, an outboard aileron, and six spoilers. The wings are largely identical across all 757 variants, swept at 25 degrees, and optimized for a cruising speed of Mach 0.8 (). The reduced wing sweep eliminates the need for inboard ailerons, yet incurs little drag penalty on short and medium length routes, during which most of the flight is spent climbing or descending. The airframe further incorporates carbon-fiber reinforced plastic wing surfaces, Kevlar fairings and access panels, plus improved aluminum alloys, which together reduce overall weight by .

To distribute the aircraft&#x27;s weight on the ground, the 757 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the company&#x27;s previous narrow-body aircraft to provide ground clearance for stretched models. In 1982, the became the first subsonic jetliner to offer longer lasting carbon brakes as a factory option, supplied by Dunlop. The stretched features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff.

Besides common avionics and computer systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating to fly the 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.

===Flight systems===
The 757&#x27;s flight deck uses six Rockwell Collins CRT screens to display flight instrumentation, as well as an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS). These systems allow the pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer. An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an automatic landing system facilitates CAT IIIb instrument landings in low visibility conditions. The inertial reference system (IRS) which debuted with the was the first to feature laser-light gyros. On the , the upgraded flight deck features a Honeywell Pegasus flight management computer, enhanced EICAS, and updated software systems.

To accommodate the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 has a more rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows. 

Three independent hydraulic systems are installed on the 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls in the event of an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft&#x27;s electronics bay.

===Interior===
The 757 interior allows seat arrangements of up to six per row with a single center aisle. Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours, the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression. As on the 767, garment-bag-length overhead bins and a rear economy-class galley are standard equipment. The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727. To save weight, honeycomb sandwich is used for interior paneling and bins. Unlike previous evacuation slide designs which are not equipped for water landings, the 757&#x27;s main exits feature combination slide rafts similar to those found on the 747. In the 1980s, Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow-body aircraft to be similar to that of the 757.

In 1998, the 757-300 debuted a redesigned interior derived from the Next Generation 737 and 777, including sculptured ceiling panels, indirect lighting, and larger overhead bins with an optional continuous handrail built into their base for the entire cabin length. Centerline storage containers mounted in the aisle ceiling for additional escape rafts and other emergency equipment were also added. The 757-300&#x27;s interior later became an option on all new . In 2000, with wheeled carry-on baggage becoming more popular, Delta Air Lines began installing overhead bin extensions on their to provide additional storage space, and American Airlines did the same in 2001. The larger bins are part of aftermarket interior upgrades which include updated ceiling panels and lighting. 
==Variants==
The 757 was produced in standard and stretched lengths. The original 757-200 debuted as a passenger model, and was subsequently developed into the 757-200PF and 757-200SF cargo models, as well as the convertible 757-200M variant. The stretched 757-300 was only available as a passenger model. When referring to different versions, Boeing, and airlines are known to collapse the model number (757) and the variant designator (e.g. or ) into a truncated form (e.g. &quot;752&quot; or &quot;753&quot;). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) classifies all variants based on the under the code &quot;B752&quot;, and the is referred to as &quot;B753&quot; for air traffic control purposes.

===757-200===
The 757-200, the original version of the aircraft, entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1983. The type was produced with two different exit configurations, both with three standard cabin doors per side: the baseline version has a fourth, smaller cabin door on each side aft of the wings, and is certified for a maximum capacity of 239, while the alternate version has a pair of over-the-wing emergency exits on each side, and can seat a maximum of 224. The 757-200 was offered with a MTOW of up to ; some airlines and publications have referred to higher gross weight versions with ETOPS certification as &quot;757-200ERs&quot;, but this designation is not used by the manufacturer. Similarly, versions with winglets are sometimes called &quot;757-200W&quot; or &quot;757-200WL&quot;. The first engine to power the 757-200, the Rolls-Royce RB211-535C, was succeeded by the upgraded RB211-535E4 in October 1984. Other engines used include the Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4B, along with the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2037 and Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000-37/40/43. Its range with full payload is .

Although designed for short and medium length routes, the 757-200 has since been used in a variety of roles ranging from high-frequency shuttle services to transatlantic routes. In 1992, after gaining ETOPS approval, American Trans Air launched 757-200 transpacific services between Tucson and Honolulu. Since the turn of the century, mainline U.S. carriers have increasingly deployed the type on transatlantic routes to Europe, and particularly to smaller cities where passenger volumes are insufficient for wide-body aircraft. Production for the 757-200 totaled 913 aircraft, making the type by far the most popular 757 model. At over , , the longest commercial route served by a 757 is United Airlines&#x27; Newark to Berlin flight; the aircraft assigned to this route cannot fly with full payload. United&#x27;s 757s assigned to transatlantic routes are fitted with 169 seats. In July 2018, 611 of the 757-200 versions were in service.

===757-200PF===
The 757-200PF, the production cargo version of the 757-200, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1987. Targeted at the overnight package delivery market, the freighter can carry up to 15 ULD containers or pallets on its main deck, for a volume of up to , while its two lower holds can carry up to of bulk cargo. The maximum revenue payload capability is including container weight. The 757-200PF is specified with a MTOW of for maximal range performance; when fully loaded, the aircraft can fly up to . Because the freighter does not carry any passengers, it can operate transatlantic flights free of ETOPS restrictions. Power is provided by RB211-535E4B engines from Rolls-Royce, or PW2037 and PW2040 engines from Pratt &amp; Whitney.

The freighter features a large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Next to this large cargo door is an exit door used by the pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main-deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range operations, UPS&#x27;s 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.

==== 757-200SF/PCF (conversion) ====
The 757-200SF is a passenger to freighter conversion developed by Boeing following an order for 34 aircraft plus 10 options by DHL. It entered service in 2001 with the initial ex-British Airways aircraft converted at Boeing&#x27;s Wichita site and subsequent blocks of aircraft converted by Israel Aerospace Industries and ST Aerospace Services. Modifications included the removal of passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, addition of cargo handling flooring and the installation of a 757-200PF port-side cargo door in the forward fuselage. The forward two entry doors and lobby area of the passenger aircraft are retained resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 full sized pallets and one smaller LD3. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo such as racehorses, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft to facilitate animal handlers. ST Aerospace continue to offer 14, 14.5 and 15 Unit load device variants of the SF in 2020.

In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6 billion (~$ in ) plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet citing a 25% reduction in operating cost along with noise benefits.

The 757-200PCF is a passenger to freighter conversion, developed by Precision Conversions and certificated in 2005. Reported in 2019 to cost $5 million (~$ in ) per aircraft and similar to the SF it has 15 pallet positions. External differences include the removal of the forward passenger style doors and their replacement with a -200PF style small crew door. Internally the main cargo door is not integrated with the base aircraft hydraulic and warning systems and instead operates from a self-contained hydraulic system though powered by the aircraft electrics. By early 2020 a total of 120 757-200PCFs had been delivered.

===757-200M/CB===
The 757-200M, a convertible version capable of carrying cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200CB (Combi), the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door in the manner of the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.

Nepal Airlines ordered the 757-200M to fulfill a requirement for an aircraft that could carry mixed passenger and freight loads, and operate out of Tribhuvan International Airport, with its elevation, in the foothills of the Himalayas. Patterned after convertible variants of the 737 and 747, the 757-200M can carry two to four cargo pallets on its main deck, along with 123 to 148 passengers in the remaining cabin space. Nepal Airlines&#x27; 757-200M, which features Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines and an increased MTOW of , was the only production example ordered. When cargo is carried on the main deck, the crew must include an additional dedicated, trained cargo firefighter.

In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions launched aftermarket conversion programs to modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft. Vision Technologies Systems launched a similar program in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the Air Transport Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.

===757-300===

The 757-300, the stretched and longest version of the Boeing 757 variants, entered service with Condor in 1999. With a length of , the type is the longest single-aisle twinjet ever built, coming in just shorter than the quad-jet DC-8-61/63. Designed to serve the charter airline market and provide a low-cost replacement for the 767-200, the 757-300 shares the basic design of the original 757, while extending the fuselage forward and aft of the wings. Six standard cabin doors, two smaller cabin doors behind the wings, plus a pair of over-the-wing emergency exits on each side, enable the 757-300 to have a maximum certified capacity of 295 passengers. A higher MTOW of is specified, while fuel capacity remains unchanged; as a result, the stretched variant offers a maximum range of . Engines used on the type include the RB211-535E4B from Rolls-Royce and the PW2043 from Pratt &amp; Whitney. Due to its greater length, the 757-300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to avoid tailstrikes.

Condor ordered the stretched 757 to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and serve as low-cost, high-density transportation to holiday destinations such as the Canary Islands. Because tests showed that boarding the 757-300 could take up to eight minutes longer than the 757-200, Boeing and Condor developed zone-based boarding procedures to expedite loading and unloading times for the lengthened aircraft. The 757-300 has been operated by mainline carriers Continental Airlines (now part of United Airlines as of 2010), Northwest Airlines (now part of Delta Air Lines as of 2008), and Icelandair; other operators have included American Trans Air (the first North American operator), Arkia Israel Airlines, along with charter carriers Condor and Thomas Cook Airlines as of 2014. Production for the 757-300 totaled 55 aircraft. All 55 were in service in July 2018.

===Government, military, and corporate===
Government, military, and private customers have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and research to cargo and VIP transport. The 757-200, the most widely ordered version of the aircraft, has formed the basis for these applications. The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.

* Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System (ARIES) – A NASA platform for air safety and operational research, was created in 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777&#x27;s fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.

* C-32 – The United States Air Force operates six 757-200s under the designation C-32. Four are VIP-configured C-32A variants, whose mission is primarily transport of the Vice President of the United States, First Lady, and Secretary of State. The C-32As are powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000, and outfitted with a communication center, conference room, seating area, and private living quarters. The USAF also operates two 45-seat Rolls-Royce powered 757-200 aircraft, designated C-32B Gatekeeper, which provides airlift to special operations units and global emergency response teams. The C-32Bs are outfitted for any contingency, with an advanced communications suite, aerial refueling capabilities, extended fuel tanks, and an internal airstair. The C-32As are painted in the Raymond Loewy-designed blue and white livery used on most Special Air Mission aircraft, while the C-32Bs are painted gloss white with minimal identification markings. The first C-32s were acquired in 1998 and replaced C-137 Stratoliner transports.
* F-22 Flying Testbed – The first 757 built was used in 1998 as a testbed for Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor avionics and sensor integration. The Boeing-owned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighter&#x27;s wing sensor layout, along with a forward F-22 fuselage section with radar and other systems, and a 30-seat laboratory with communication, electronic warfare, identification, and navigation sensors.
* Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – As part of their ecoDemonstrator program, Boeing commenced a series of test flights on March 17, 2015, with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing was modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap to be deployed during landing which protrudes just ahead of the leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency&#x27;s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Krueger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing.
* Active Flow Control System – On one aircraft Boeing has mounted 31 active flow jets mounted ahead of the rudder&#x27;s leading edge. They receive air from the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). Their purpose is to recover air flow that has separated from the rudder and redirect it to the rudder so that the rudder regains effectiveness, even at high deflection angles. The air exiting the APU is very hot, at , and is cooled by a heat exchanger mounted under the aft fuselage, which is connected to the ducts running along the front and back of the stabilizer&#x27;s spars. This ensures an even air supply at all times.
* Royal New Zealand Air Force 757 Combi – The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) operates two 757s converted to 757-200M standard by ST Aerospace Services for delivering equipment, medical evacuation, troop movements, and VIP transport. A cargo door, upgraded auxiliary power unit, enhanced communications systems, and retractable airstairs are fitted. The two aircraft, which replaced two 727-100QCs, have carried the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and flown to the ice-covered Pegasus Field near New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.
* VIP transport – The 757-200 serves as VIP transports for the President of Argentina under the Presidential Air Group serial &quot;Tango 01&quot; and for the President of Mexico under the Mexican Air Force call sign TP01 or &quot;Transporte Presidencial 1&quot;. A Royal Brunei Airlines 757-200 was used by the Sultan of Brunei in the 1980s before being sold to the Government of Kazakhstan in 1995. The royal family of Saudi Arabia uses a 757-200 as a flying hospital. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen used a private 757 from 2005 until 2011; the aircraft was then sold to Donald Trump and became known as &quot;Trump Force One&quot; during his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
* Excalibur – A testbed for the British BAE Systems Tempest&#x27;s avionics and sensors. The aircraft is to be converted from a civilian airliner by Leonardo UK and 2Excel.

== Operators ==


As of 2018, the largest 757 operators were Delta Air Lines, FedEx Express and United Airlines; Delta Air Lines also was the largest overall, with a 757 fleet of 127 aircraft. American Airlines&#x27; 757 fleet of 142 aircraft was the largest until 2007, when the carrier retired Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000-powered models originating from its TWA acquisition to have an all Rolls-Royce RB211-powered 757 fleet. Delta subsequently acquired 17 former TWA/American Airlines 757s, and in October 2008, gained 45 more 757s from its acquisition of Northwest Airlines.

As of 2018, the cargo carrier with the most 757s was FedEx Express, which operated a 757-200F fleet of 111 aircraft. UPS Airlines operated a further 75 of the type, with DHL Aviation and its affiliated companies, DHL Air UK, DHL Latin America, European Air Transport Leipzig, and Blue Dart Aviation, combined operating 35 cargo 757s of various types in 2018.

Joint launch customer British Airways operated the 757-200 for 27 years before retiring the type in November 2010. To celebrate the fleet&#x27;s retirement, the airline unveiled one of its last three 757-200s in a retro style livery on October 4, 2010, matching the color scheme that it introduced the aircraft into service with in 1983. Subsequently, the type remained in operation with the company&#x27;s subsidiary, OpenSkies.

Over the duration of the program, 1,050 Boeing 757s were built with 1,049 aircraft delivered. The prototype 757 remained with the manufacturer for testing purposes. In August 2020, a total of 642 Boeing 757 aircraft of all variants were in commercial service with operators Delta Air Lines (127), FedEx Express (107), UPS Airlines (75), United Airlines (72), Icelandair (27) and others with fewer aircraft of the type.

==Accidents and incidents==
, the 757 has been involved in 47 aviation occurrences, including ten hull-loss accidents out of a total of 13 hull-losses. Nine incidents and 12 hijackings have resulted in a total of 575 occupant fatalities.
=== Accidents ===
The first fatal event involving the aircraft occurred on October 2, 1990, when a hijacked Xiamen Airlines 737 collided with a China Southern Airlines 757 on the runways of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, China, killing 46 of the 122 people on board. Two 757-200s were hijacked on September 11, 2001, during the September 11 attacks; hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing all 64 on board and 125 on the ground, and United Airlines Flight 93 was also hijacked, and crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 on board.
Accidents involving pilot error include American Airlines Flight 965, which crashed into a mountain in Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, killing 151 passengers and all eight crew members with four survivors, and a dog, and the mid-air collision of DHL Flight 611 near Überlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on July 1, 2002, with the loss of the two people on board plus 69 on a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154. The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the collision of DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors, but was mainly blamed on the Tupolev&#x27;s crew not following a TCAS resolution advisory. Accidents attributed to spatial disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, which crashed into the ocean near Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, which crashed into the ocean off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its pitot tube sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.

On September 14, 1999, Britannia Airways Flight 226A crash-landed near Girona-Costa Brava Airport, Spain, during a thunderstorm; the 757&#x27;s fuselage broke into several pieces. The 245 occupants evacuated successfully, with 40 requiring hospital treatment; one passenger died five days later of unsuspected internal injuries. On October 25, 2010, American Airlines Flight 1640, a 757 flying between Miami and Boston, safely returned to Miami after suffering the loss of a fuselage section at an altitude of approximately . After investigating the incident, the FAA ordered all 757 operators in the U.S. to regularly inspect upper fuselage sections of their aircraft for structural fatigue.

On November 9, 2018, Fly Jamaica Airways Flight 256 was substantially damaged after a runway excursion at Cheddi Jagan International Airport. One fatality was reported, and the aircraft was declared a hull loss. The other 127 occupants survived.

=== Incidents ===
Two private aircraft crashes were blamed on wake turbulence emanating from 757s. On December 18, 1992, a Cessna Citation crashed near Billings Logan International Airport in Montana, killing all six aboard, and on December 15, 1993, an IAI Westwind crashed near John Wayne Airport in California, killing all five aboard. Both airplanes had been flying less than behind a 757. The FAA subsequently increased the required separation between small aircraft and 757s from to .

On April 7, 2022, a DHL Boeing 757 aircraft operating Flight 7216 crash landed at San Jose, Costa Rica after attempting an emergency landing due to a hydraulic failure. Both crew members survived without injuries; the incident is under investigation.

==Aircraft on display==
A Delta Air Lines 757-200, registered as N608DA, is on display at the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. The aircraft was the sixty-fourth example built. The aircraft was repainted into Delta&#x27;s &#x27;Widget&#x27; livery, the livery it wore when it was originally delivered, and is now on static display at the museum entrance.

<text>TWAIN and TWAIN Direct are application programming interfaces (APIs) and communication protocols that regulate communication between software and digital imaging devices, such as image scanners and digital cameras. TWAIN is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

The three key elements of TWAIN are:
* Application software. For example, graphics software, a fax application or a word processor.
* Source manager software. The source manager software is a software library provided by the TWAIN Working Group.
* Device drivers (referred to as &quot;Source software&quot; in the specification document) 

Both the application and the device driver must support TWAIN for the interface to be successfully used.

The first release was in 1992,
and it was last updated in 2021.

It was designed with the help of a number of companies from the computer industry, to try to establish a unified standard connection interface between computers and imaging devices. 

== History ==

The design of TWAIN began in January 1991. The TWAIN group was originally launched in 1992 by several members of the imaging industry, with the intention of standardizing communication between image handling software and hardware. Review of the original TWAIN Developer&#x27;s Toolkit occurred from April, 1991 through January, 1992.

On September 19, 2019, the TWAIN Working Group announced TWAIN Direct 1.0 which is a RESTful API version of the TWAIN specification.

==Name origin==
The word &quot;TWAIN&quot; is not officially an acronym, but it is a backronym. The official website notes that &quot;the word TWAIN is from Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of East and West&quot; — &#x27;...and never the twain shall meet...&#x27; — reflecting the difficulty, at the time, of connecting scanners and personal computers. 

It was up-cased to TWAIN to make it more distinctive. This led people to believe it was an acronym, and then to a contest to come up with an expansion. None was selected, but the entry &quot;Technology Without an Interesting Name&quot; continues to haunt the standard. For example, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Information Technology&quot; lists &quot;Technology Without an Interesting Name&quot; as the official meaning of TWAIN.

== Objectives ==

Objectives of the TWAIN Working Group and standard include:

* Ensure image-handling software and hardware compatibility
* Keep the specification current with the state of current software and hardware while maintaining backward compatibility
* Provide multiple-platform support
* Maintain and distribute a no-charge developer&#x27;s toolkit
* Ensure ease of implementation
* Encourage widespread adoption
* Open Source Data Source Manager
* LGPL Open Source License
* BSD Open Source Sample Application and Sample Data Source Application

TWAIN provides support for:

* Production, high-speed scanning
* ICC Color profiles
* Digital cameras
* Multiple operating system platforms including Windows, classic Mac OS, macOS, and Linux

== TWAIN Working Group ==

Today the TWAIN standard, including the specification, data source manager and sample code, are maintained by the not-for-profit organization TWAIN Working Group.

Board and associate members of the TWAIN Working Group include:

* Atalasoft, a Kofax Company
* Dynamsoft
* Epson
* ExactCODE GmbH
* Fujitsu
* Hewlett-Packard
* ICE Health Systems
* InoTec GmbH
* Kodak Alaris
* Microtek International, Inc.
* P3iD Technologies Inc.
* PDF Association
* Plustek
* Visioneer, Inc.

<doc id="152001" wikidata="Q1757296" url="?curid=152001" title="Soli, Cyprus">
<text>Soli or Soloi () is an ancient Greek city on the island of Cyprus, located next to the town of Karavostasi, southwest of Morphou (Guzelyurt), and on the coast in the gulf of Morphou. Since 1974 the site has been within the Turkish occupied territory of the Northern Cyprus.

Originally, Soloi was located in a much more constricted geographical location. At its current location, the entire urban centre was designed by Solon during his 10-year trip, after whom the name Soloi is commonly attributed. Reyes, however, disputes this etymological origin, as the name Soloi appears on the Esarhaddon prism predating Solon&#x27;s visit. Soloi was one of the ten city-kingdoms into which Cyprus was divided at the time.

What remains today is mainly from the Roman period, most notably the mosaic floor of the basilica with its wealth of birds, animals and geometric designs and a picture of a swan. There is a theatre but it has been renovated to the point that it no longer has any atmosphere of its original age.

A trio of ancient underground tombs has been discovered near Soli. The tombs were excavated in 2005 and 2006. Two of the tombs contained many findings, but the third tomb was empty as a result of looting. According to archaeologists the findings indicate a high level of wealth and power. Some of the vessels found are similar to items typically produced in Athens. The artifacts are on display at the Museum of Archeology and Nature in Morphou.

According to ancient written sources the city was supplying Athens with timber and copper and in return getting luxurious metal vessels from there.

== Archaeological Excavations ==
The Swedish Cyprus Expedition, led by Einar Gjerstad, excavated Soli during October 1927. The ancient town of Soli was located on the Mesaoria plain which was a well-situated place, close to the sea and harbor in the north as well as cultivated plains to the east and Cyprus&#x27; richest copper district to the south. The very top plateau was surrounded by a strong wall of similar construction to the city wall. The entrance was probably to the north side. Within this area, the foundation of a temple (templum in antis) was found. The archaeologist&#x27;s conclusions about this temple are very conjectural. The Acropolis Hill was probably the first to be inhabited. When the town grew larger the area between the hill and the sea was inhabited. The buildings were often repaired and rebuilt. The town of Soli has changed from time to time. The earliest potsherds are from the Cypro-Archaic periods but they are very few in comparison with the Cypro-Hellenistic and Cypro-Roman sherds.

The necropolis of Soli is spread over an enormous area around the town. Thousands of the tombs had already been opened by modern tomb robbers and were therefore destroyed. The sherds from the robbed tombs make it possible to date them and most of them are from the Cypro-Archaic II period to the Cypro-Roman.

=== Temples at Cholades ===
According to the excavators many of the walls at Cholades were made of reused material found in the river below the sites. Sometimes even pieces of broken statues were reused in the walls. Several walls had been decorated with mural paintings, most of them were found on fragments of stucco, fallen to the floors close to the walls. In one room the paintings were better preserved, and the pattern could be studied. The other rooms seem to have had walls decorated with vertical and horizontal lines in red, blue, black, and green creating large squares. One room had fragments with wide red bands as well.

They also found water conduits, cisterns, stairs and altars. All the buildings create a temple complex consisting of different temples numbered from A to F. The temples were altered, changed, and rebuilt during four periods. Material from the temples displays a particularly rich material of sculptures made of marble and limestone. According to the archeologists temples A and B were conjointly dedicated to Aphrodite and Cybele. One or possibly both of temples C and D were sacred to Isis and temple E to Serapis Canopus and Eros. Temple F was dedicated to Mithras. During the first period, there was a loose connection between the cella and the irregular courtyards in front of it. In period 2 (temple B, C, and D) the shape is still irregular although the connection between the cella and courtyards is beginning to get closer. In the third period, temple E was reconstructed with the cellae and courtyards built together as a closed unit and it seems like the importance of symmetry improves. In period 4 are some courtyards roofed with several closed chapels. The temples date from the Cypro-Hellenistic period and the Roman times.

The marble sculptures found during the excavation were probably made from imported marble. It seems likely that the heads were made separately from the body and fitted together with an iron pin. Some sculptures have been mended. All the sculptures were once painted although the colours are faintly preserved. Other sculptures were made of alabaster, terracotta as well as soft and hard limestone. Some of the sculptures were found in situ and these were always located in connection to the cellae. The archeologists proposed that they probably were placed on the altars in the cellae. Therefore the altars might have been used as iconostasis, or a stand for the various sculptures. This was only observed with the sculptures in the cella, not the ones from the courtyards or outside. The sculptures from period 1 (250 B.C.) were all found in temple A. From period 2 (end of 2nd century B.C.) all the sculptures were found at temples B, C, and D. From period 3 (middle of 3rd century A.D.) and 4 (beginning of 4th century. A.D.) all the sculptures were found in temple E. The sculptures and inscriptions were used as the foundation for the archaeologist&#x27;s identifications of the temples, therefore they might be the correct identification but it is not completely sure.

=== Theatre ===
Further on the Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated an ancient theatre at Soli. They proposed that the theatre was planned and erected in one piece and they could not distinguish any building periods. The structure displays that the theatre is from the Roman period and coins exhibit an even more precise date, 42/3 A.D as well as 66-70 A.D.  It seems to have been in use until the fourth century. The theatre consists of three parts, &quot;orchestra&quot;, auditorium, and stage-building. The &quot;orchestra&quot; is cut out of the rock and has a semicircular shape with a rectangular addition in front. The floor of the &quot;orchestra&quot; was plastered with lime cement and the rainwater was carried off by a conduit of terracotta pipes. Two entrances, the western and eastern &quot;paradoi&quot;, lead to the orchestra. The auditorium was also semicircular and cut into the rock of the sloping hill. The auditorium is divided by a diazoma covered by limestone slabs.

<doc id="152002" wikidata="Q374355" url="?curid=152002" title="River Ouse, Sussex">
<text>The Ouse ( ) is a long river in the English counties of West and East Sussex. It rises near Lower Beeding in West Sussex, and flows eastwards and then southwards to reach the sea at Newhaven. It skirts Haywards Heath and passes through Lewes. It forms the main spine of an extensive network of smaller streams, of which the River Uck is the main tributary. As it nears the coast it passes through the Lewes and Laughton Levels, an area of flat, low-lying land that borders the river and another tributary, the Glynde Reach. It was a large tidal inlet at the time of the Domesday book in 1086, but over the following centuries, some attempts were made to reclaim some of the valley floor for agriculture, by building embankments, but the drainage was hampered by the buildup of a large shingle bar which formed across the mouth of the river by longshore drift.

In 1539, a new channel for the entrance to the river was cut through the shingle bar, and meadows flourished for a time, but flooding returned and meadows reverted to marshland. The engineer John Smeaton proposed a solution for the drainage of the valley in 1767, but it was only partly implemented. William Jessop surveyed the river in 1788, and produced proposals to canalise the upper river above Lewes, and to radically improve the lower river. The Proprietors of the River Ouse Navigation were created by act of Parliament, the River Ouse Navigation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 52), and eventually built 19 locks, to enable boats to reach Upper Ryelands Bridge at Balcombe. Trustees and the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels jointly managed the work on the lower river, and the agriculturalist John Ellman continued the progress while he was Expenditor for the Commissioners, which enabled 120-ton ships to reach Lewes by 1829. Navigation on the upper river could not compete with the railways, and all traffic had ceased by 1868.

On the lower river, Newhaven became an important port and barge traffic continued using the river up to Lewes until the 1950s. Cross-Channel ferries still sail from the port. The river provides habitat for many varieties of fish, including unusually large sea trout that swim up the river to spawn in the higher tributaries. The Lewes Brooks area of the levels is a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its wide variety of invertebrates. Walkers can follow the course of the river by using the Sussex Ouse Valley Way long-distance footpath, and the Sussex Ouse Conservation Society promotes awareness of the navigation by publishing details of shorter walks. The Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust is hoping to see navigation restored to the upper river, but this is not universally popular, as the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust is opposed to the idea.

==Course==
The River Ouse, together with its main tributary the River Uck, form the central spines of a network of streams and rivers which drain over of Sussex. There are around of streams in total, of which some are designated as main rivers, on which the Environment Agency has a responsibility for maintenance.

The river rises near Lower Beeding in West Sussex and meanders eastwards, passing under Upper Ryelands Bridge, once the limit of navigation. After it has been joined by the outflow from Ardingly Reservoir, created by building a dam across the valley of a tributary, which has resulted in the partial flooding of two river valleys, it turns to the south east, passing to the north of Lindfield and Haywards Heath. It passes into East Sussex just before reaching Sheffield Park railway station on the preserved Bluebell Railway. After skirting around Newick, it turns to the south and is joined by its main tributary, the River Uck, flowing in from the north east, before reaching Isfield. Most of the tributaries are in the upper catchment that have joined it originate in the heaths and forests of the High Weald, where fast-flowing small streams cut deep valleys through woods, and flow over underlying beds of sandstones and clays.

Below Isfield, the narrow valley widens out into a broad flood plain, and the river is joined by the Longford Stream, the Iron River and the Bevern Stream, before it reaches Barcombe Mills. There is a network of channels at Barcombe, which once supplied water for at least two watermills, but the last one was destroyed by fire in 1938. On the east bank of the river is Barcombe Reservoir and Water Treatment Works. Both are owned by South East Water, who extract water from the river and depending on the quality of the water, store it in the reservoir or treat it immediately and pump it into the public water supply. The works was constructed in two stages, in 1962 and 1977 and can deliver up to 75 Megalitres per day (Mld) for public consumption. Just north of this on the west bank of the river is the Anchor Inn, dating from 1790, which has boats for hire, restaurants and bars, and is licensed for civil weddings.

Some of the tributaries on this middle section are similar to those on the upper section, but others are lowland streams, where the underlying geology is alluvium and clays, and which flow more slowly. The Bevern Stream and Northend Stream both originate in the chalk uplands of the South Downs, but traverse greensand and clay before they reach the Ouse. Below the weirs of Barcombe, the river is partially tidal, and forms large meanders, with numerous ox-bow lakes. At Hamsey, a long lock cut crosses the neck of a large meander creating Hamsey Island, home to St Peter&#x27;s Church, which is situated on a mount. Much of it dates from the 12th century, with 14th and 15th century additions, and the structure is Grade I listed. Flow on the river above is modulated by a half-weir, which prevented a serious ecological disaster spreading further downstream, when a spillage of pesticide near Newick in 2001 killed the insect populations and more than 500 fish on a stretch of the river.

The tidal river continues through the town of Lewes, where the channel has been considerably modified over time, and is crossed by three bridges. Willey&#x27;s Bridge is a small footbridge opened in 1965, to provide public access to South Malling church and to enable residents in housing estates built at Malling to get to Lewes. Previously, access to the church had only been available on Sundays, when owners of Malling Deanery allowed people to use their private suspension bridge, constructed in 1934, and located a little further upstream. This had in turn replaced a wooden bridge erected in 1868. The Phoenix Causeway is a larger road bridge named after the former Phoenix Ironworks, which was constructed in 1979 to provide a bypass for Cliffe High Street, and the Grade II listed Cliffe Bridge carries the High Street over the river. It was designed by Nicholas Dubois, and built in 1726–27. It consists of a single arch in red brick with stone dressings, but the original design has been modified. An inscribed keystone was obscured when a footway was added to the north side of the bridge in 1888, and cast iron balustrades replaced the original brick balustrades when the bridge was reconstructed in 1932. After Cliffe the Winterbourne stream flows into the Ouse and also supplies water to the Railway Land nature reserve, owned by Lewes District Council, and managed with help from the Railway Land Wildlife Trust. It covers and was the site of railway sidings until 1989. It includes a reed bed called the Heart of Reeds. The Ouse continues southeast past Glynde, where the tributary of Glynde Reach joins from the east, and then passes Rodmell, Southease and Piddinghoe. There are public pathways on both sides of the channel for most of this stretch.

At Southease there is a swing bridge, designed by Henry E Wallis of Westminster in 1878 and installed two years later, to replace a previous structure slightly further upstream. It consists of three bowspring arches, one fixed and the other two mounted on a central pivot. It was manually operated by a capstan mounted on the movable section, and is a rare example of its type, which are more normally found in docks and industrial areas. In 1988, Parliamentary approval was obtained to fix the bridge in position, as it had not been opened since 1967. The river finally reaches Newhaven, where it splits industrial Denton Island from the mainland. A wooden drawbridge was built in 1794 to carry the coastal road over the river, but this was replaced in 1866, when a cast iron swing bridge was erected in its place. It carried both a road and a tramway, which was used in the construction of the West Quay breakwater, a project which was finally completed in 1889. The tramway was then used to facilitate maintenance of the breakwater, until the tracks were lifted in 1963. A new road bridge, at a higher level and slightly further to the north, replaced the swing bridge in 1974. It is opened regularly for commercial shipping, near to high tide, but as the bridge carries the A259 road, each opening causes significant traffic congestion. Below the bridge, the river becomes the Port of Newhaven, where there is a ferry terminal for sailings to Dieppe in France, a service which has been running since 1847. Finally, the river flows into the English Channel, surrounded on either side by two long breakwater piers.

==Name==
&#x27;Ouse&#x27; is a common name for rivers in England, with examples including the Ouse in Yorkshire, and the Great Ouse and Little Ouse in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The name may stem from the Celtic word Ūsa, which is in turn derived from the word *udso-, meaning &quot;water&quot;. The root of this word is the Indo-European *wed-, from which the modern English words &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;water&quot; also stem. If this derivation is correct, then its name is a tautology, meaning &quot;Water river&quot; or &quot;Wet river&quot;. However, the National Rivers Authority stated that the river above Lewes was called the Middewinde historically, while the river from Lewes to the sea was called &quot;The Great River of Lewes&quot;, and that the present name is a contraction of Lewes, with which it rhymes. This claim is also supported by others.

==Formation==
The Ouse is one of the four rivers that cut through the South Downs. It is presumed that its valley was cut during a glacial period, since it forms the remnant of a much larger river system that once flowed onto the floor of what is now the English Channel. In the warmer interglacials the lower valley would have flooded; there are raised beaches 40 metres (Goodwood-Slindon) and 8 metres (Brighton-Norton) above present sea level. The offshore topography indicates that the current coastline was also the coastline before the final deglaciation, and therefore the mouth of the Ouse has long been at its present latitude.

==Inundation and drainage==
When the Domesday book was produced in 1086, the Ouse valley was probably a tidal inlet with a string of settlements located at its margins. In later centuries the river was draining the valley sufficiently well for some of the marshland to be reclaimed, by building embankments to create highly prized meadow land. However, by the 14th century the Ouse valley was regularly flooding in winter, and frequently the waters remained on the lower meadows through the summer. In 1422 a Commission of Sewers was appointed to restore the banks and drainage between the coast and Fletching, around inland, which may indicate that the Ouse was affected by the same storm that devastated the Netherlands in the St Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1421. Drainage became so bad that of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s meadow at Southerham were converted into a permanent fishery (the Brodewater) in the mid-15th century, and by the 1530s the entire Lewes and Laughton Levels comprising over , were reduced to marshland again.

Part of the problem of flooding was caused by longshore drift creating a huge shingle bar across the river mouth, which had gradually moved eastwards to Seaford, some from its position in Roman times. The bar prevented the river from draining effectively, and made it difficult for ships to enter the estuary. Prior Crowham of Lewes Priory sailed to Flanders and returned with two drainage experts. In 1537 a water-rate was levied on all lands on the Levels to fund the cutting of a channel through the shingle bar at the mouth of the Ouse, below Castle Hill at Meeching, to allow the river to drain the Levels. This canalisation created access to a sheltered harbour, Newhaven, which succeeded Seaford as the port at the mouth of the Ouse.

The new channel was completed by 1539 and drained the Levels so that much of the valley floor could be reclaimed for pasture. However, shingle continued to accumulate and so the mouth of the Ouse began to migrate eastwards again. In 1648 the Ouse was reported to be unfit either to drain the levels or for navigation. At some time between 1676 and the publication of an Admiralty chart in 1698, the river flowed along the back of the shingle bar and broke through into the sea about further to the east, at the site of a tide mill. The outlet at Newhaven had been reinstated by 1731, when the Newhaven Harbour Commissioners were established by act of Parliament. The engineer John Reynolds carried out some work for them on the piers at the entrance to the river, and constructed a sluice across it at Piddinghoe between 1731 and 1733, working for the Drainage Commissioners, but that was short lived, as it was damaged in 1736 and taken down rather than repaired. By the 18th century the valley was regularly inundated in winter and often flooded in summer.
===Smeaton&#x27;s survey===
In 1767 the Commissioners for the Lewes and Laughton Levels employed the engineer John Smeaton to survey the river and the drainage of the levels, which he did over four days in June following a period of wet weather. He found that the meadows, which were locally known as brooks, were in many cases under water, but that their condition, and therefore the remedies that would be required, were variable. In particular, the brooks of Southover, Iford, Pool Bar, and Rodmell, which he called the West Levels, were badly affected as their embankments were low and poorly maintained. At high tide, the level of the river was above that in the meadows. The same applied to Ranscombe brooks, to the north of the junction between the Ouse and the Glynde, Further down river, at White Wall and Tarring, the brooks were generally dry, which he attributed to the land surface being higher, the walls being higher and well maintained, and the outfall sluices from the meadows being arranged at a lower level in relation to the river.

He noted that the rise and fall of the tide below Piddinghoe was some , but this was reduced to just at the mouth of the Glynde, and was barely visible at Lewes Bridge. A series of shoals, combined with the narrow and winding channel, held water back and prevented it from draining from the levels. He also commented on the great shingle bar crossing the mouth of the river at Newhaven, which if removed would allow the water levels to be around lower at low tide. The brooks above Lewes Bridge became gradually drier as he progressed towards Barcombe Mill, but with almost no fall on the river, its winding course and numerous shoals hampered the drainage of the meadows. The brooks bordering the Glynde, to the east of Ranscombe, were generally at a higher level, but were affected by stagnant water lying on the surface. There was again no gradient on that river, which followed a winding course, but he was confident that if the drainage of Ranscombe could be solved, the drainage of the Laughton Levels would also be.

His first proposal to achieve the drainage of the levels was to straighten the river, to remove all of the obstructions, and to construct an outfall sluice, to prevent the tides entering the river. The brooks on the west level and at Ranscombe would need better embankments, and adequate sluices to allow water to drain away when required. A second option involved raising the banks on all of the meadows, and constructing a separate sewer to carry surplus water from them to the sea, leaving the main river largely unaltered. The outfall sluice would have been located at Tarring Tenantry near Piddinghoe, and would contain three openings, two of , each with a set of pointed doors facing in opposite directions, to prevent the sea entering the river, and to retain water in the river during dry periods. The third opening would be wide, with double pointed doors facing in both directions, so that it could additionally be used as a navigation lock at all states of the tide and river.

He estimated the cost of the first scheme to be £10,800, and the commissioners implemented some of his suggestions, improving the channels below Lewes in 1768, by dredging to remove shoals and making the channel wider in places. However, they did little to straighten the river, and Smeaton&#x27;s great sluice was not constructed.

==Ouse navigation==
The is some evidence that the Ouse was used for navigation in the early 18th century, as boats are marked on a map published in 1724, travelling to Maresfield Forge, to the north of Shortbridge. There is also a lock marked on the river, though this was presumably a flash lock. Smeaton&#x27;s plan for a sluice and navigation lock at Piddinghoe had not been carried out, and the river remained free of tolls. The preamble to the River Ouse Navigation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 52) indicated that the river was only used from the sea to Barcombe Mills at that time.
In 1788, the engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river with a view to extending navigation. He suggested that the river could be made navigable to Pilstye Bridge, near the road from Cuckfield to Balcombe. It would be deep, and at least wide, enabling it to accommodate boats , which could carry 30 tons. The work would involve easing sharp curves, widening the channel in places, making cuts to straighten some sections, and constructing 25 locks. He estimated that the work would cost £14,400, in addition to the costs associated with obtaining an act of Parliament, but was not entirely convinced that making the upper stretch navigable was sensible, and suggested that stopping the navigation at Lindfield would result in only 18 locks being needed, with the cost dropping to £9,271. Navigation of the river between Lewes and Newhaven was only normally possible when there were spring tides, and so he also suggested that this could be resolved by making the channel wider, deeper and straighter. This work would include a new cut some long, and would cost an additional £1,980, which included the cost of a towpath from Lewes to Piddinghoe, just to the north of Newhaven.

An act of Parliament, the &#x27; (30 Geo. 3. c. 52) was obtained on 28 April 1790, covering improvements to the river between Lewes Bridge and Hammer Bridge in Cuckfield, with a branch to Shortbridge. The Company of Proprietors of the River Ouse Navigation was created by the act, and they had powers to raise £25,000, by issuing £100 shares. Work on the river could not start until the proprietors had raised £10,000, and tolls could not be charged until some work had been done. On 6 June 1791 a second act of Parliament, the &#x27; (31 Geo. 3. c. 76) was obtained, covering the work between Lewes and Newhaven, for the purposes of improving navigation and also improving the drainage of the low-lying lands of the Lewes and Laughton Levels. The work was to be jointly supervised by some Trustees and the Commissioners of the Levels, who could then collect tolls for use of their part of the river.
Contracts for work on the river above Lewes were advertised in May 1790, and were awarded to Pinkertons, who had worked with Jessop on a number of projects. However, by mid-1791, the committee was complaining that Pinkertons&#x27; work had been sub-standard and that some parts had failed. By April 1793, the navigation was open from Lewes to Sheffield Bridge, and some work on increasing the size of the channel had been carried out between there and Hammer Bridge. The construction costs had reached £20,000, but the tolls were meagre, averaging just £236 per year between 1793 and 1796. The navigation was in the hands of a receiver from 1797, but by 1805, enough funds had been raised to open another to Freshfield Bridge. Tolls increased sufficiently for the Proprietors to obtain another act of Parliament, the (46 Geo. 3. c. cxxii) on 12 June 1806, which allowed them to raise another £30,000, and to abandon plans to proceed beyond Hammer Bridge. With new motivation, the Proprietors found an engineer in William Smith, the geologist who had formerly worked for the Somerset Coal Canal, and engaged Dymoke Wells to carry out the construction work. Wells was a local man, and agreed to take one-third of the payment as cash and the remainder as bonds and shares. The creditors who had installed a receiver were given bonds, and control of the navigation passed back to the Proprietors, who collected £751 in tolls during 1809. By the end of the year, the navigation had been extended to Lindfield Mill.

The proprietors then faced a dispute with the first Lord Sheffield, who, in their opinion, had overseen a period of stagnation, once the navigation had reached his wharf at Sheffield Bridge. Subsequently, he had quarrelled with the other proprietors and had sought to obstruct the project. The difficulties endured for several years, but eventually there was reconciliation with the second Lord Sheffield, who had a seat on the committee by 1823. The navigation reached its greatest extent of in 1812, when Wells constructed a further extension to Upper Ryelands Bridge at Balcombe, with similar payment terms to his previous contract. There was a branch to Shortbridge, and some shorter branches. There were 19 locks, although Hadfield only quotes 18, perhaps because there were two at Barcombe, identified as Pikesbridge Upper and Lower Lock on the 1875 map. Each was , and the barges used on the navigation could carry 18 tons, suggesting that the channel was not as deep as Jessop had suggested, since his plan was for boats with a draught of which could carry 30 tons. Almost no records of the tolls collected are known to exist, but it appears that they were sufficient to pay interest on the money borrowed, but not to pay any dividends to the shareholders.

===Lower river===

Several attempts were made to improve the tidal river below Lewes. In March 1730, the engineer John Reynolds had surveyed the state of the timber pier at Newhaven, and reported to Parliament. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1731, and the Harbour Commissioners employed him to carry out renovation work, at a cost of £3000. Over the next four years, piers were repaired and extended to control the channel, but Reynolds sluice at Piddinghoe, constructed between 1731 and 1733 and designed to hold back the water so that it could be used to scour the channel, failed and was removed in 1736.

The act of Parliament obtained in 1791, to straighten the channel below Lewes, was managed by Trustees and the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels. Funding came from tolls on the river, and a drainage charge for landowners within the levels. There were clauses in the act to ensure that tolls could not be varied significantly without corresponding variations in the land drainage rates. The work on straightening and enlarging the lower river was carried out between 1791 and 1795, and Jessop&#x27;s plans were overseen by a schoolmaster and civil engineer from Lewes called Cater Rand. The provision of a bridge at Southease was a requirement of the act, as the re-routing of the river divided farmland. In practice the costs to the landowners on the levels were too high, and another act of Parliament was obtained on 20 June 1800, which repealed the river tolls, and replaced them with higher tolls, to redress the balance.

From 1783, John Ellman, better known for his agricultural achievements, became the Expenditor for the Lewes and Laughton Levels, and as well as carrying out the tradition role of collecting the water scot tax and spending it, he worked tirelessly to organise and supervise work on the Glynde Reach and the lower Ouse, which enabled a 120-ton ship named &quot;Kitty&quot; to unload stone at Lewes Bridge in the late 1820s. He retired in 1828, and the following year the river flooded, but the results of the improvements were seen when the meadows drained in just 48 hours. Tapsfield&#x27;s Shallow, near to Lewes Bridge, was finally removed by the engineer William Cubitt in 1838. Work on the west breakwater, a huge construction to protect the mouth of the river and enable ships to access the port of Newhaven at all states of the tide, began after a tramway link was constructed in 1866. It was completed in 1889, and the tramway was subsequently used to maintain the breakwater, until the tracks were lifted in 1963. For many years the locomotive used on the tramway was No. 72 &quot;Fenchurch&quot;, now preserved on the Bluebell Railway, which runs from on the upper river to .

===Operation===

Trade along the Ouse Navigation consisted mostly of lime, chalk, manure, aggregates and coal. Whilst in 1801 there were 51 barges registered as trading on the river, of which 21 worked on the section above Lewes, the navigation was never a huge commercial success. In 1825 there was a proposal for a canal from Lewes to Brighton, which would have left the river at Lewes, risen through 29 locks, and required a tunnel to reach Brighton, but no further action was taken. Competition arrived in the early 1840s, when the London and Brighton Railway was built. Initially, this provided some trade, as 11 million bricks from the Netherlands were transported along the Ouse for the construction of the Ouse Valley Viaduct at Haywards Heath. There is some evidence that goods were carried up the navigation and transferred to the railway, but this practice was short lived, as the coastal railway from Brighton to Lewes opened in 1846. Receipts in that year were about £800, a drop from around £1,200 in the 1810s, and despite significant reductions in tolls, traffic dwindled rapidly. The death-knell occurred in 1858, when the Lewes to Uckfield branch line opened, running parallel to the river for much of its route, and in 1859, the company stopped keeping records. The navigation above Lindfield was disused by 1861, and the last barge to Lindfield sailed in 1868, after which there was no trade above Lewes, although boats continued working on the Lower Ouse below Lewes.

A major user of the lower river was the Southerham Cement Works, located on the east bank of the river just above Lewes railway bridge. A chalk pit is known to have existed there since at least 1725, and it became a cement works in the 19th century, as the demand for building materials grew. The works had its own fleet of barges, which were used to transport coal, coke and clay to the site, and to carry lime and cement away from it. Although it had been connected to the railway by sidings since at least 1875, barges continued to serve the works until the 1950s.

===Management===
With the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, most rivers were managed by a catchment board, with the land drainage functions handled by an internal drainage board (IDB). The Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels effectively became an IDB until a new structure could be created. This happened in 1939, but rather than creating an independent IDB, flood management of the Ouse became the responsibility of the River Ouse Catchment Board (internal drainage). During the successive reorganisations of the water industry, responsibility passed to the East Sussex River Board, the Sussex River Authority, and the Southern Water Authority. When the water companies were privatised in 1989, rivers became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, and when the Environment Agency replaced that organisation in 1995, they managed the River Ouse Internal Drainage District (IDD), together with five other IDDs in Sussex. In 2012, the Environment Agency decided that these functions would be better served by locally accountable organisations, and consulted local authorities as to how best this could be achieved.

Lewes District Council, who contributed £131,000 annually to the work of the IDD, opposed the setting up of an independent Internal Drainage Board. East Sussex County Council, who act as the local flood authority, were initially worried that this might result in their costs rising, but Lewes Council stated that they would use any savings made from not supporting an Internal Drainage Board to fund flood and coastal erosion management. Subsequently, The River Ouse (Sussex) Internal Drainage District Order 2016 was passed by Parliament on 18 July 2016, which abolished the River Ouse Internal Drainage District as from 31 March 2017, without creating a formal body to replace it.

The work carried out to improve the river has not removed the risk of flooding, and there have been major flood events in 1960, 1979, 1987, 1993 and 2000, which have affected people living in Lewes, Uckfield, Haywards Heath and Lindfield. The river is embanked below Barcombe Mills, and although this primarily protects agricultural land, it also offers some protection to around 2,000 properties. Following the floods of 1960, a further round of widening the channel and raising the banks below Lewes occurred, and where gravity drainage of the levels has proved ineffective, water is pumped into the river from land drainage ditches. Tidal water has been unable to enter the Laughton Level since 1973, when a dam and pumping station was constructed across the Glynde Reach at Beddingham. There are land drainage pumping stations at Stoneham, Offham, Rodmell, ET Wadham, Ranscombe, Denton and Beddingham, with an eighth station at Lewes which pumps water into the Malling Drain.

===Legacy===
On the upper river, the remains of most of the old locks are still visible, although all are gradually deteriorating. The Sussex Ouse Conservation Society promotes awareness of the navigation, and publishes details of circular walks which include river sections. For serious walkers, the Sussex Ouse Valley Way is a long-distance footpath which follows the course of the river. It begins near its source at Horsham, and is long, ending at the sea near Seaford. The Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust was formed in 2001, with the long-term aim of seeing navigation restored to the upper river, and have completed work on restoring Isfield Lock. However, the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust see this aim as a threat to the ecology of the river.

==Milling==
The river has been used as a source of power, with nine mills known to have existed on the main channel, with four more on the Shortbridge Stream, three on the Bevern Stream, and a tide mill at Bishopstone, to the east of Newhaven. The northernmost of the mills on the main channel was Fletching Mill. A forge was operational at the site in 1574, but was replaced by a corn mill when the iron industry declined. This was replaced by a three-storey brick and timber building at some point, which was later supplemented by a four-storey square extension with a flat roof, from which the owners, the Maryon-Wilson family, could watch cricket matches at Sheffield Park. While the navigation was in use, there was a wharf just to the north of the mill, where barges moored to deliver grain or collect produce. The mill ceased to use water power in the 1920s, when Tidy &amp; Sons owned it, but was in use until 1940, when the War Office requisitioned it to billet soldiers in it. Much of the fabric of the building was damaged during this period, and it was only used irregularly after the war, until it was demolished in 1950, as was the hump-back bridge at the front of the building.

Between 1813 and 1816, a local papermaker called James Pim bought a property called &quot;Sharp&#x27;s&quot; in Newick, and built a paper mill close to Sharp&#x27;s Bridge Lock. He was the only occupant of the building, and by the time it was offered for sale in 1853, the details in the sale documents make it clear that paper making had ceased. They noted that the mill was next to a wharf, and that it was powered by a single engine. No buyer was found, and the mill had been demolished by the time the 1874 Ordnance Survey map was published. There is still a &quot;Sharp&#x27;s Bridge House&quot; near to the bridge, which was probably the property bought by Pim in 1813.

Isfield Paper Mill was built on a site next to Isfield Lock, which the proprietors of the navigation offered for sale in 1793. Molineux and Johnston bought the land and built a large mill, for which the opening ceremony in July 1809 was a grand affair, according to the &quot;Sussex Weekly Advertiser&quot;. Success was fairly short-lived, as it was offered for sale in 1855, together with Molineux and Johnston&#x27;s other mill at Lewes. Neither mill was sold, and the building materials from a foreman&#x27;s cottage, nine other cottages, stone from the leats and two large cast iron waterwheels were sold at auction on 28 September 1857. There is some evidence for another mill further downstream, as Isfield Old Mill appears on Greenwood&#x27;s map of 1823, and the 1874 Ordnance Survey map shows details of the leats, but it was not mentioned on the Tithe Apportionment of 1840, which is usually a reliable source of information. It was probably dismantled in the late 18th century.

At Barcombe there were two mills, the most northerly of which was known as Barcombe Oil Mill, although this hid the fact that it was also used for milling corn. It was established soon after the navigation opened in 1793, and the mill was unusual in its location, in that most oil production took place in East Anglia. Seeds were crushed by edge rolling millstones, and then held in linen bags to be beaten by trip hammers. The process was initially powered by waterwheel, but subsequently a beam engine was installed, and by 1880 was driving 16 hydraulic presses. Oil was used in the production of soap and paint, while oil cake was used as cattle feed, fertiliser and fuel. Much of the mill was destroyed by fire on 6 June 1854, when slicks of burning oil floated downstream and threatened Barcombe Mill. The cost of the repairs was estimated to be between £7,000 and £8,000, but the mill was rebuilt and continued trading. When offered for sale in 1880, it could produce 80 tons of oil cake and 200 quarters of wheat per week. The beam engine supplemented two breastshot water wheels, one made of iron and the other of wood. The mill was served by a siding on the Lewes to Uckfield Railway after the demise of the navigation, continuing in use until at least 1911, and was demolished around 1917.

Barcombe Mill was considerably older, as Thomas Erith had a fulling mill in the 16th century. It was used as a corn mill and paper mill prior to the owner becoming bankrupt in 1706. It developed once the navigation provided transport links, enabling flour and produce to reach Lewes to the south and several villages to the north. The owners at the time were Thomas Rickman &amp; Son, who also owned Barcombe Oil Mill. A siding from the mill to Barcombe Mills railway station revolutionised transport, and a new, larger mill was built in 1870, with four floors and powered by two enclosed water wheels. It could produce 500 to 600 sacks of flour each week. Ownership passed to William Catt &amp; Sons in 1879, who also ran the tide mill at Bishopstone, and in 1894 they installed a Turner five-sack roller mill. A compound engine was used to power the roller mill, while three pairs of millstones were driven by a &quot;Little Giant&quot; turbine. Milling ceased in 1918, and after a period of dereliction, it was used to manufacture buttons, made by slicing Italian nuts. Button production started in 1931, but the mill building was destroyed by fire in March 1939. It had been one of the biggest watermills in Sussex, but little remains apart from the four channels, while a grass mound where the main building was conceals an atmospheric syphon installed in the 1960s, which is used to force water downstream when the river is in spate.

Continuing downstream, Germany Mill was built near the village of Hamsey in 1744. When the navigation was constructed, the course of the river was altered, and the mill lost its water supply. The three-storey brick and flint building still exists, but is now used for drying grain. Lewes Paper Mill was owned by Messrs Molineux, Johnston &amp; Lee, and operated from 1802 until its demolition in 1825. A large flour mill powered by steam was built on the site in 1860, but was short-lived, closing in 1868. Burgeon&#x27;s map dating from 1724 mentions a tide mill at Lewes, but no other references to it are known to exist.

The final mill was Bishopstone Tide Mill, located a little to the east of the present mouth of the river. The Duke of Newcastle, Thomas Pelham, obtained an Act of Parliament to authorise construction of the mill on the foreshore of land that he owned at Bishopstone. The first mill was completed in 1788, by which time Pelham had died. It was sold in 1791 to Thomas Barton, and the sale documents listed five pairs of stones, capable of producing 130 quarters of week each week. The new owner built a large mill with three storeys, capable of producing 1,500 sacks of flour each week, using 16 pairs of stones. The site was regularly affected by storms, with wheat and flour destroyed in 1792, while in 1820, the building was damaged and part of the dam was washed away. After 1853, the volume of flour produced gradually declined, often as a result of weather conditions, but it continued in operation until March 1883, when there was another violent storm and the new harbour at Newhaven required more water. The site which was known as Tide Mills was much more than just the mill buildings, as 60 men were employed, and William Catt, the owner until his death in 1853, built cottages for his workers and a school for the children. Transport of the flour to markets improved when the Newhaven to Seaford railway line opened, and the mill was served by a siding. Some of the buildings remained in use for various purposes until the end of the Secord World War, but virtually nothing remains of what was the largest water mill in Sussex.

==Ecology and wildlife==
The river provides habitat for most of the species of coarse fish that can be found in Britain. It is known for the unusually large sea trout that migrate up the river each year to spawn. There are also populations of pike and more recently carp, both of which can exceed in weight. Other species include barbel, roach, dace, rudd, perch, chub, bream and tench. The Sheffield and Batts Bridge tributaries have small populations of pumpkinseed, which have escaped from on-line fish ponds, and since 2009 a few catfish have appeared in the river at and upstream of Lewes. Rarer breeds which inhabit the river include grayling, stone loach, river lampreys, and bullhead, which are a species under threat on an international scale. The tidal stretches contain fish that can tolerate the lower levels of salt found in brackish water, including flounder, grey mullet, bass, twait shad, and sea lampreys.

Lewes Brooks is a Site of Special Scientific Interest on the levels to the west of the river below Lewes. It covers an area of , and is noted for its wide diversity of water beetles, rare snails, flies and moths. The habitat is enhanced by a gradation in the water, which varies from fresh in the west to brackish in the east. Several studies into the presence and effects of organic and inorganic pollutants in the Sussex Ouse have been carried out, including one on the effects of estrogens entering the river from Sewage Treatment Works outfalls on the reproductive physiology of fish.

===Water quality===
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

Apart from the initial section from its source to Ardingly, the channel is designated as heavily modified, because of the canalisation works. The water quality of the River Ouse system was as follows in 2019.

Reasons for the quality being less than good include discharges from sewage treatment works, physical modification to the channel, which prevents the free movement of fish, and runoff from agricultural land. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

==Culture==
The author Virginia Woolf drowned herself in the River Ouse on 28 March 1941, near the village of Rodmell; her body was recovered from the river on 18 April. Olivia Laing&#x27;s book, &quot;To the River: A Journey Beneath the Surface&quot;, was published in 2011; walking the length of the Ouse, Laing reflects upon Woolf&#x27;s life and upon the relationship between history and place.

<text>Seaford is a town in East Sussex, England, east of Newhaven and west of Eastbourne.

In the Middle Ages, Seaford was one of the main ports serving Southern England, but the town&#x27;s fortunes declined due to coastal sedimentation silting up its harbour and persistent raids by French pirates. The coastal confederation of Cinque Ports in the mediaeval period consisted of forty-two towns and villages; Seaford was included under the &quot;Limb&quot; of Hastings. Between 1350 and 1550, the French burned down the town several times. In the 16th century, the people of Seaford were known as the &quot;cormorants&quot; or &quot;shags&quot; because of their enthusiasm for looting ships wrecked in the bay. Local legend has it that Seaford residents would, on occasion, cause ships to run aground by placing fake harbour lights on the cliffs.

Seaford&#x27;s fortunes revived in the 19th century with the arrival of the railway connecting the town to Lewes and London. It became a small seaside resort town, and more recently a dormitory town for the nearby larger settlements of Eastbourne and Brighton, as well as for London.

The traditional Sussex pronunciation of the name has a full vowel in each syllable: &quot;sea-ford&quot;. However, outside Sussex, and increasingly within, it is commonly pronounced with a reduced vowel on the second syllable: .

==Geography==

The town lies on the coast near Seaford Head, roughly equidistant between the mouths of the River Ouse and the Cuckmere. The Ouse valley was a wide tidal estuary with its mouth nearly closed by a shingle bar, but the tidal mudflats and salt marshes have been &quot;inned&quot; (protected from the tidal river by dykes) to form grassy freshwater marshes (grazing marsh). To the north the town faces the chalk downland of the South Downs, and along the coast to the east are the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs, and Beachy Head. This stretch of coast is notified for its geological and ecological features as Seaford to Beachy Head Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The River Ouse used to run parallel to the shore behind the shingle bar, entering the sea close to Seaford. However, a major storm in the 16th century broke through the bar at its western end, creating a new river mouth close to the village called Meeching, which was later renamed to Newhaven. Part of the former channel of the river remains as a brackish lagoon.

The town formerly had excellent beaches, which were supplied by longshore drift constantly moving sand along the coast from west to east. However, in the early 20th century a large breakwater was constructed at Newhaven Harbour and the harbour entrance was regularly dredged. These works cut off the supply of fresh sand to the beach. By the 1980s the beach at Seaford had all but vanished, the shoreline becoming steep, narrow and largely composed of small boulders. This made Seaford attractive to watersports enthusiasts (since water visibility was good and there was a rapid drop-off into deep water) but it discouraged more general seaside visitors. So in 1987 a massive beach replenishment operation was carried out, in which around 1 million tonnes of material was dredged from sandbanks out to sea and deposited on the shore. During a severe storm that October a substantial amount of the deposited material on the upper part of the beach was washed out past low tide level, leading to questions in the House of Commons. The beach has been topped up several times since then, giving the town a broad beach of sand and shingle.

The town&#x27;s publicity website states: &quot;For many, the main attraction in Seaford is the beach&quot;, which draws visitors, particularly during the summer months when sea temperatures can reach up to 20°C (68°F).

To the east of Seaford, below chalk cliffs, is a beach called Hope Gap. It is a location in the film &quot;Hope Gap&quot;.

==History==

In 1620 and 1624, the bailiff of Seaford was William Levett, of an Anglo-Norman family long seated in Sussex. William Levett of Seaford owned the Bunces and Stonehouse manors in Warbleton, probably inheriting them from his father John Levett, who died in 1607. Levett sold the estates in 1628 and died in 1635, his will being filed in Hastings.

The Old Town Hall in South Street was the meeting place of the borough council, which had the power to elect two members of parliament, until the implementation of the Reform Act 1832.

The Levett family intermarried with other Sussex families, including the Gildredges, the Eversfields, the Popes, the Ashburnhams, the Adamses, and the Chaloners. A seal with his arms belonging to John de Livet, Lord of Firle, was found at Eastbourne in 1851.

==Politics and administration==
From 1894 to 1974 Seaford was an urban district run by Seaford Urban District Council. In the local government reorganisation of 1974 it became an unparished area which was part of the Lewes District Council area. This loss of independence was unpopular with Seaford residents and in 1999 the town became a civil parish within Lewes, with a town council. Municipal services within Seaford are now provided by three tiers of local government – the county council, the district council and the town council.

The town council has 20 members, four elected by each of five wards. The Seaford Community Partnership is a body incorporating representatives drawn from all three tiers of local government and from local civic groups. The partnership seeks to advise on long-term development strategy for the town. Currently the town council is composed of 10 Conservative, 7 Liberal Democrat and 1 Labour, 1 UKIP and 1 independent councillor.

In the Lewes District council elections on 7 May 2015 the town returned 7 Conservative district Councillors and 3 Liberal Democrat district Councillors. The May 2019 elections returned 8 Conservatives and 2 Liberal Democrats, which those of May 2023 returned 6 Liberal Democrats and 4 Greens. For District elections, the wards are the same five as for the Town council (Central, North, East, West, South) however they only return two Councillors to the District council.

The parliamentary constituency of Seaford was a notorious rotten borough until its disenfranchisement in the Reform Act 1832 when it was incorporated into the Lewes constituency. Seaford returned three members of parliament who went on to become Prime Minister: Henry Pelham represented the town from 1717 to 1722, William Pitt the Elder from 1747 to 1754 and George Canning in 1827.

As of July 2024, Liberal Democrat James MacCleary serves as the MP for the Lewes constituency, which includes Seaford. He succeeded Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, who had held the seat since the 2015 General Election. Caulfield, a former NHS nurse, won the seat in 2015 by a narrow margin of 1,083 votes, unseating the previous Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker. Baker had represented Lewes for several terms before his defeat in 2015.

Seaford has been twinned with the town of Bönningstedt, Germany, since 1984. Seaford has one of the longest-serving town criers in England and Wales —Peter White— who was appointed to this honorary position in 1977 by Lewes District Council and is now an appointee of Seaford Town Council. In 2012 he was also appointed Serjeant at Mace, and his historic uniform for both crying and mace-bearing is a replica of that worn by 19th. Century Serjeant William Woolgar. (in post 1865 – 1901) 

Seaford has the westernmost of the South Coast Martello Towers, number 74, now a local history museum.

Seaford lifeguards patrol the beach and water each weekend and bank holiday from May to September. They are made up of volunteers, mainly young people, who give thousands of unpaid hours every year to train and help keep the public safe. They have been recognised as the best equipped and trained non-RNLI beach lifeguard unit in the country. 

==Sport and leisure==
Seaford Cricket Club have played at the Salts Recreation Ground since 1946, though the origins of cricket in Seaford go back to the 18th century. The latest augmentation of facilities was in 2010, when the pavilion was extended. Seaford Rugby Football Club, affiliated to the Sussex County Rugby Football Union, play at the same venue, which has the distinction of being below sea-level.

Seaford Town, the local football club, plays at the Crouch Playing Field. They play in the Sussex County League Division Two.

The town is home to No2 (Seaford) detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

The town has two golf courses, Seaford Golf Club, a downland course at Firle Road, and Seaford Head Golf Course, from which the coastline and the South Downs can be seen.

Seaford has at least two bowling clubs. They include Seaford Bowling Club, which is a private club at Blatchington Road, dating back to 1912, and The Crouch Bowling Club in Crouch Gardens, East Street.

Downs Leisure Centre operates &#x27;The Wave&#x27; in Seaford. The Wave is a leisure centre offering a range of sports and pastimes, including badminton, indoor bowls, children&#x27;s disco dancing, line-dancing and fitness classes. It should not be confused with WAVES, which is a Seaford-based charity supporting families in difficulties.

Swimming facilities are provided for the town at Seaford Head Swimming Pool, which is also run by Wave Leisure.

Towards the western end of Seaford Bay lies Newhaven and Seaford Sailing Club. Founded in 1952 by a group of sailing enthusiasts, the club now has two sites – racing off Seaford Beach and sailing at Piddinghoe Lake near Newhaven where the RYA accredited Sailing School is located.

The area around Seaford, such as up the Cuckmere Valley and along the South Downs Way, offers many walking routes.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the relay TV transmitter situated in Newhaven. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 95.0 FM broadcast from Brighton, Seahaven FM broadcasts from Eastbourne on 96.3 FM, also online and Heart South on 96.9 FM. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Argus&quot; (formerly &quot;South Coast Leader&quot;).

==Transport==
Two local half-hourly circular bus services, the 119 and 120, are provided by Cuckmere Buses (Monday-Friday) and Compass Bus on Saturdays, who also run bus 126 from Seaford via Alfriston to Eastbourne.

Brighton &amp; Hove operate two frequent bus services, the 12 and 12A (up to every 10 minutes), routed along the A259 south coast road through Seaford (the 12A goes via the Chyngton Estate on the east side of Seaford) which take passengers to Brighton or Eastbourne which both have extensive onward bus services.

Seaford station is the terminus of the Seaford Branch Line. Trains operate to Brighton via Lewes, typically running at a frequency of two trains per hour. Services operated by Southern.

==Education==

Between the late 19th century and the 1950s, Seaford was renowned as a &quot;school town&quot;. The many preparatory schools and other independent schools were the main employers in the town. In the 1960s, Sutton Avenue had a road sign warning &quot;7 schools in next mile&quot;. Sunday mornings in term-time were marked by &quot;crocodiles&quot; of schoolchildren from each of the preparatory schools walking to church for the special schools&#x27; service.

Most of these independent schools, such as Ladycross School and St Peter&#x27;s School were closed and the land used for new housing estates in the last decades of the 20th century. The last girls&#x27; school, Micklefield, closed in 1994.

Although it has many primary schools (Chyngton, Cradle Hill, Annecy, Seaford County Primary), from the nursery to the &quot;sixth year&quot; of education, the town of Seaford has only one state-run secondary school, Seaford Head School, which in 2009 closed its sixth form, but re-opened it in 2014. Seaford was also home to an independent school, Newlands Preparatory and Manor, which included a specialist unit for pupils with specific learning difficulties. However, the school closed for good in July 2014. Its previous site is currently being redeveloped into a housing estate.

The town is also home to a special needs boarding school called Bowden House which is run by Tower Hamlets Council.

==Places of worship==
Parts of the nave, aisles and clerestory of the Church of England parish church of St Leonard are Norman work from the 11th century. The north and south arcades and most of the clerestory windows are Early English Gothic. The tower is 14th century and its upper part is Perpendicular Gothic. The transepts and polygonal apse are Gothic Revival additions designed by John Billing and built in 1861–82. There is some modern stained glass by the Cox &amp; Barnard firm of Hove. The church is a Grade I listed building. St Luke&#x27;s Church, opened in 1959 and built of flint and brick, serves the Chyngton and Sutton suburbs of the town. It has been attributed to architect John Leopold Denman.

The Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas More was built in 1935 to replace a chapel in the grounds of Bishop of Southwark Francis Bourne&#x27;s home nearby. James O&#x27;Hanlon Hughes and Geoffrey Welch designed the flint and render building, which was extended in 1969 using artificial stone.

W.F. Poulton designed a Gothic Revival chapel for Congregationalists in 1877. The flint building has a distinctive corner turret. It is now a United Reformed church with the name &quot;Cross Way Clinton Centre&quot;, and has links with the town&#x27;s Methodist church, now called &quot;Cross Way Church&quot;. This was built in the Gothic Revival style of red brick in 1894. A town-centre Baptist chapel was demolished in 1973 and replaced by a new brown-brick circular church on the road to East Blatchington. Elsewhere in the town, there is a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Kingdom Hall, a Spiritualist church and an Evangelical church (the Seaford Community Church in Vale Road).

There is a Quaker meeting in the town every Sunday in The Little Theatre in Steyne Road and the Quakers maintain a Peace Garden nearby.

== Military ==

The Romans are known to have had a camp in Seaford. From 1794 coastal defence barracks were established at East Blatchington. In 1806–1808 a Martello Tower was built at the eastern end of Seaford Bay. It is the most westerly of the towers, numbered tower 74.

During the First and Second World Wars there were large military camps in the town. In the First World War, the camps were built to house the 22nd Division from Kitchener&#x27;s Third New Army. The south camp nearly encircled Seaford ladies college. In December 1914 there was a strike by a mainly Welsh regiment over the remoteness of the accommodation and mud. In 1919 two thousand Canadians rioted after one of them was beaten by a camp picket for walking with his hands in his pockets.

Seaford has seven Victoria Cross holders associated with the town:
* William George Walker lived and died in Seaford

<text>Newhaven is a port town in the Lewes district of East Sussex, England, lying at the mouth of the River Ouse.

The town developed during the Middle Ages as the nearby port of Seaford began drying up, forcing a new port to be established. A sheltered harbour was built in the mid-16th century, and a breakwater in the late 18th, to provide continued access to the sea. Newhaven increased in importance following the arrival of the railway in 1847, and regular cross-Channel ferry services to Dieppe. Though these have been reduced in the 21st century, Newhaven still provides regular ferry services and continues to be used as an important freight terminal. In 2021 the parish had a population of 12,854.

Newhaven lies at the mouth of the River Ouse, in the valley the river has cut through the South Downs. Over the centuries the river has migrated between Newhaven and Seaford in response to the growth and decay of a shingle spit (shoal) at its mouth.

There was a Bronze Age fort on what is now Castle Hill.

In about 480 AD, the Saxon people established a village near where Newhaven now stands, which they named &quot;Meeching&quot; (variously known as &quot;Myching&quot; or &quot;Mitching&quot;).

Throughout the Middle Ages, the main outlet and port of the Ouse was at Seaford (one of the Cinque Ports).

The growth of the shingle spit hindered the outflow of the river, which consequently flooded the Levels upstream and hindered access to the port. Therefore, a channel through the shingle spit was cut in the mid-16th century below Castle Hill, creating access to a sheltered harbour, better than that at Seaford. This was the origin of modern Newhaven.

However, shingle continued to accumulate and so the mouth of the Ouse began to migrate eastwards again. Under the Ouse Navigation Act (1790), a western breakwater was constructed to arrest longshore drift and so cut off the supply of shingle to the spit. A new outlet (The Cut) was built on the river&#x27;s present course, below Castle Hill. At that time the settlement began to be known as the &quot;new haven&quot;. The present breakwater was built in 1890.

It was part of the Holmstrow hundred until the abolition of hundreds in the 19th century.

==Port==


Although there are some signs of the derelict facilities that serviced the former train ferry operations, the port still sees a great deal of freight and passengers movement. International ferries run to the French port of Dieppe, Seine-Maritime, operated by DFDS Seaways. There are two outbound sailings per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, using the 18,654 GT ro-ro ferry MS &quot;Côte D&#x27;Albâtre&quot;. Rail passengers wishing to connect with the ferries are advised nationally to travel to , and then use the free bus service; this has resulted in a dramatic fall in passenger services at , leading to questions regarding its future and that of .

The port is the proposed main landside site for E.ON&#x27;s development of the offshore-Rampion Wind Farm.

===History===
The village was of little maritime importance until the opening of the railway line to Lewes in 1847. In 1848, the exiled French King Louis Philippe I landed here in disguise after abdicating his throne. The London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) constructed their own wharf and facilities on the east side of the river, and opened the Newhaven harbour railway station. The railway also funded the dredging of the channel and other improvements to the harbour between 1850 and 1878, to enable it to be used by cross-channel ferries, and in 1863 the LB&amp;SCR and the Chemin de Fer de l&#x27;Ouest introduced the Newhaven-Dieppe passenger service. The harbour was officially recognised as &#x27;The Port of Newhaven&#x27; in 1882. Imports at that time included French farm products and manufactures, timber, granite and slates.

Newhaven harbour was designated as the principal port for the movement of men and materiel to the European continent during the First World War and was taken over by the military authorities and the ferries requisitioned for the duration of the war. Between 22 September 1916 and 2 December 1918, the port and town of Newhaven were designated a &#x27;Special Military Area&#x27; under the &#x27;Defence of the Realm Regulations&#x27;, and the Harbour station was closed to the public. The port and harbour facilities, rail sidings and warehousing were greatly enlarged at this time and electric lighting installed to allow for 24-hour operation.

During the Second World War, large numbers of Canadian troops were stationed at Newhaven, and the ill-fated Dieppe Raid in 1942 was largely launched from the harbour.

When the high-profile gambler and murder-suspect Lord Lucan vanished in 1974, his car was found abandoned in Norman Road, Newhaven, with traces of blood matching the blood-groups of his children&#x27;s nanny Sandra Rivett, whom he is believed to have murdered, and his wife, whom he had attempted to murder, according to her testimony. The Newhaven location suggested that he had taken the cross-channel ferry, but no confirmed sighting of him was ever made.

===Lifeboat===
The Newhaven Lifeboat, the first of which was commissioned in 1803, is among the oldest in Britain, and was established some 20 years before the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The town established the rescue lifeboat in response to the wreck of HMS &quot;Brazen&quot; in January 1800, from which only one man of her crew of some 105 men could be saved. The town used a combination of funds raised locally and contributed by Lloyd&#x27;s of London to purchase a lifeboat built to Henry Greathead&#x27;s &quot;Original&quot; design. Newhaven also has one of the Watch stations of the National Coastwatch Institution.

==Industry==

To the east, in the neighbouring parish of Seaford was the village of Tide Mills, built in 1761, and now derelict. Here are the remains of workers&#x27; cottages, the tide mill itself, and a large saline lagoon which was the storage pond for high water to power the mills on the outgoing tide.

The Newhaven Marconi Radio Station was established in 1904, and started running in 1905. The station was owned and operated by the Marconi Radio Company and achieved regular ship to shore radio communications in approximately 1912.

To the east of Newhaven is the 50,000-foot production factory of King &amp; McGaw, This company started out in printed art for professional organizations and was known as King Posters by the late 1980s. It then expanded to business to consumer trading over the internet. It is now the UK&#x27;s largest online Art provider. The company&#x27;s contribution to the area was recognised in April 2014 with a visit from local MP Norman Baker.

The Heritage Marine Hospital was built in 1924 to cater for disabled boys who had undergone surgery. It became a casualty of wartime defence work during the Second World War.

The Denton Island Business Park lies to the north of the town on the west bank of the river. The business park has attracted a number of businesses to the area with the basepoint Newhaven Enterprise Centre being the focal point. The centre has attracted a lot of new businesses to the area.

A new waste incinerator, just across from Denton Island, was completed in late 2011 and is now in full operation, despite huge opposition by local residents from across the Lewes District.

==Military==
Historical

Newhaven Fort, one of the Palmerston Forts, was built on Castle Hill on the recommendation of the 1859 Royal Commission to defend the growing harbour. It was the largest defence work ever built in Sussex and is now open as a museum.

The adjacent village of Tide Mills was the site of an experimental seaplane base at the head of the beach. The first formation of No. 242 Squadron RAF was on 15 August 1918 from numbers 408, 409 and 514 Flights at the seaplane station at Newhaven, Sussex. Operating from there and the nearby airfield at Telscombe Cliffs, it was equipped with Short Type 184 seaplanes and carried out anti-submarine patrols over the English Channel until the end of the First World War. Surveys carried out in 2006 have exposed part of the slipway, concrete aprons to both hangars with door tracks and several other slabs presumed to be workshops. Sussex Archaeological Society started a dig in April 2006 to catalogue the entire East Beach site.

Army Cadet Force

*A detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

==Layout==
The main part of the town is located on the west side of the river, there is also a residential area at Denton and Mount Pleasant on the slopes of the Downs to the east. Industrial areas lay on the east side of the river as do all three of the railway stations which serve Newhaven; Newhaven Town, Newhaven Harbour and the now redundant Newhaven Marine. Recent housing development has taken place at the West Quay, Harbour Heights, August Fields and the old Parker Pen site (Safford Park).

==Governance==
Newhaven Town Council was formed in 1974. There are 18 councillors representing four wards: Denton ward (five councillors); South ward (eight); North ward (three) and Central ward (two).

The town comprises two wards of Lewes District (part of the county of East Sussex.) Newhaven North ward returns 2 district councillors to Lewes District Council, and Newhaven South ward returns 3 district councillors. The 4 May 2023 local elections returned 5 Liberal Democrat councillors for the 5 seats.

The parliamentary constituency for Newhaven is Lewes. From 1974 to 1997 John Rankin Rathbone (known as Tim Rathbone) served as the constituency member of parliament, for the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrat Norman Baker was elected member of parliament in 1997 and served until 2015, when Conservative Maria Caulfield was elected. Since July 2024, Liberal Democrat James MacCleary is the MP.

The parish includes part of the Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest. The cliffs are mainly of geological interest, containing many Santonian and Campanian fossils. The SSSI listing includes flora and fauna biological interest too.

The open land surrounding Newhaven to the west, north and east is part of the South Downs National Park, although the town itself is excluded from the boundaries.

==Transport==
Newhaven lies at the southern end of the cross-country A26 trunk road originating in Maidstone; and its junction with the A259 coast road between Brighton and Eastbourne. It is also located on the Seaford Branch Line from Lewes; there are two operating railway stations, Newhaven Town and Newhaven Harbour. A third, for all intents and purposes unused since its train ferry services ceased using it, was Newhaven Marine railway station.

Walkers on the Vanguard Way, a long-distance footpath, end their journey here from East Croydon in south London.

==Education, culture and religion==

There is one secondary school in the town: Seahaven Academy (previously known as Tideway Comprehensive), There are four primary schools: Denton Community Primary, Breakwater academy, Harbour Primary School and High cliff Academy which opened in September 2015 in a brand-new building in Southdown Road, on what was part of the Tideway Comprehensive School site.
The Newhaven Local &amp; Maritime Museum is operated by the Newhaven Historical Society and is a registered charity. The Planet Earth Museum and Sussex History Trail is dedicated to the history of the earth. They are both located at Paradise Park which is a garden centre owned by the Tate family.

The parish church is dedicated to St Michael and is shared by the Church of England and Methodist communities. The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to the Sacred Heart (Church of the Sacred Heart).

The town is featured in &quot;Crime Is My Business&quot; by W. Howard Baker (Sexton Blake Library No 408, Amalgamated Press, 1958) and possibly based on an idea or material by Jack Trevor Story. Although mentioned (along with Brighton, Beachy Head, and Eastbourne), the references are vague and one would not recognise the town from the book. Other references in the text (a typical Sexton Blake adventure) suggest a roadside café somewhere in the region of the recently demolished Peacehaven Motel, which was formerly situated at the eastern end of Peacehaven.

Newhaven has a thriving art community with the art club being formed in the 1960s and new galleries displaying local work in the town.

<text>Gamesley is a residential area within the Borough of High Peak in Derbyshire, England, west of Glossop and close to the River Etherow which forms the boundary with Tameside in Greater Manchester. Gamesley is a ward of the High Peak Borough Council. It had a population of 2,531 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==
===Early===
Gamesley is the site of a Roman fort, Ardotalia, renamed &quot;Melandra&quot; in the 19th century by an amateur historian. It was one of a string of forts built along the route from Lincoln (Lindum Colonia) to Chester (Deva). It also lies on the route from Derby (Derventio) via Buxton (Aquae Arnemetiae) to Manchester (Mamucium)
It was built about 108 AD in the reign of the Emperor Trajan and abandoned about 150–155 AD.

===Construction of the estate===
The original village of Gamesley consisted of rows of cottages inhabited by workers at the local textile mills, and it remained largely undeveloped until the 1960s, when it underwent considerable change.
It was chosen as the location of an overspill estate, built by Manchester City Council. This was in order to rehouse people from decaying inner city areas of Manchester. These housing areas were also built in other towns surrounding Manchester, such as nearby Hattersley on the outskirts of Hyde.

The Gamesley estate was built in two halves. The first houses were built by contractors Finnegans which were constructed with flat felted roofs, pebbledash-clad ground floors and tile-cladded first floors. Finnegans&#x27; houses were equipped with warm air central heating that used gas as an energy source. The Finnegan side of the estate was known locally as the &#x27;gas side&#x27;. In the late 1980s the local authority renovated the Finnegan system built houses; the works included re-enveloping the external building with traditional bricks and mortar. The works also added apex roofing complete with roofing tiles. The second half of the Gamesley estate was built a couple of years later by George Wimpey using the Wimpey no-fines house building method. The houses were constructed with full pebbledash finish and tiled apex roofing. The houses built by George Wimpey had a solid concrete ground floor which had electrical underfloor heating installed&#x27; the first floors of these houses were built with no heating. Because electricity was the main energy source for heating, the George Wimpey side of Gamesley became known locally as the &#x27;electric side&#x27;. Unlike the Finnegan part of the estate, which has seen full facelifts to the properties, little has changed externally to the houses on the George Wimpey side. In late 2000s and early 2010s, all council-owned properties (and some privately owned properties if the owner choose to at their expense) had external insulation added to improve energy efficiency. The external insulation was finished with pebbledash.

Gamesley staged events in July 2008 to mark the 40th anniversary since it was first built and people from Manchester began moving onto the estate.

==Culture and community==
The Trans Pennine Trail passes through Gamesley on its way from Southport to Hornsea. Gamesley is on the West section of the Trail, which is well signposted throughout the estate.

A Roman Garden was established in 2006 with the help of the Countryside Agency&#x27;s &#x27;Doorstep Greens&#x27; programme. 
The estate is home to Gamesley Fold Cottage Garden, a well-known garden and house dating back to 1650. The garden has been featured on television and in glossy magazines, and it is open to the public every year under the National Gardens Scheme, as well as private visits.

<text>Newhaven is an inner–city district in the capital city of Scotland, Edinburgh, which lays between Leith and Granton and is about north of the city centre of Edinburgh, just north of the Victoria Park district. 

Formerly a village and harbour on the Firth of Forth, it had a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants at the 1991 census. Newhaven was designated a conservation area, one of 40 such areas in Edinburgh, in 1977. It has a very distinctive building form, typical of many Scottish fishing villages, with a &quot;forestair&quot; leading to accommodation at first floor level. The lower ground floor was used for storing nets. 

More modern housing dating from the 1960s has replicated the style of these older buildings. Victoria Primary School, created in 1844, is a historic, listed building in Newhaven Main Street and was the oldest council primary school still in use within the City of Edinburgh council area until pupils and staff moved to a new building across in Western Harbour in 2021. It latterly had a school roll of around 145 children. The site has now been acquired under the Community Asset Transfer scheme, by the Heart of Newhaven Community, a volunteer-led charity, who will be running it as a community hub. 

The new Western Harbour development extends north into the Firth of Forth from Newhaven. It is also the home of Next Generation Sports Centre (now named David Lloyd Newhaven Harbour), where the tennis player Sir Andy Murray regularly played as a youngster.

==History==
===Early history===
The village lies on the line of a prehistoric raised beach. It was part of North Leith Parish, being situated north of the Water of Leith which divided Leith into north and south parishes. It was once a thriving fishing village and a centre for shipbuilding. King James IV wanted to build a Scottish navy, but the existing port of Leith proved unsuitable for large warships. In 1504 he created &quot;Newhavin&quot; (meaning literally &quot;new harbour&quot;) as a custom-built port, specifically for the construction of the warship &quot;Michael&quot; (popularly called the &quot;Great Michael&quot;). The ship was built between 1507 and 1511. The site of the original harbour is the current open space at Fishmarket Square (see photo above).

Surviving walls of the Chapel of St. Mary and St. James, believed to have been built for the dockyard workers and mariners, can still be seen in Lamb&#x27;s Court and Westmost Close off Main Street. The chapel was ruinous by 1611; the grounds were acquired for use as a graveyard by the Society of Free Fishermen in 1766 and used as such until 1848. In the reign of James VI the Flemish entrepreneurs Cornelius de Vos and Eustachius Roche set up salt pans at Newhaven to make sea salt.

Between 1572 and 1890, Newhaven was a major port for landing oysters. In 1881, out of a population of 400 fishermen in the village at the time, 17 fishermen from Newhaven, including boats crewed by a father and son(s), or brothers were among the one hundred and eighty-nine who lost their lives in a severe storm, known as the Eyemouth disaster. There were nine widows and 57 children bereaved from those lives lost just in Newhaven.

===Fishing===
Although close to Edinburgh, the people of Newhaven remained distinctive in dress and tradition. As a result, the village and its residents have been well documented in photographs and postcards intended to show the distinctive local character, notably by the pioneer Victorian photographers David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson who photographed many of the fishermen and fishwives of Newhaven in both their village surroundings and the partnership&#x27;s Calton Hill studio in Edinburgh.

The Society of Free Fishermen of Newhaven, dating from at least 1572, was one of the oldest friendly societies in Scotland. It survived until 1989.

===19th and 20th centuries===

Up to the end of the 20th century, pilots of ships on the Firth of Forth traditionally came from a close-knit group of Newhaven families. The early pilots provided their own crews and sailing cutters which were regarded as the fastest and most seaworthy available.

The village was once connected by the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway to Edinburgh and Leith, but the line closed in 1956. 
The station building and platform still exists off Trinity Crescent. Other stations also existed at the end of Annfield and on Craighall Road. It was also connected to Stirling by steamboat managing the 42 miles in just over 3 hours.

The Newhaven fleet also played a role in the whaling industry, recalled in the name &quot;Whale Brae&quot; at the northmost end of Newhaven Road. The whalemaster&#x27;s house (13) at the centre of what is now Park Road had clear views down to the harbour over the lower buildings to the north. Originally brick built as an oddity and novelty it was later rendered then doubled in size using stone (i.e. unusually the stone section is the extension). It was split into two flats in the 1970s.

===Recent history===
Newhaven was redeveloped by Edinburgh&#x27;s town planners in the 1950s and 1960s under the control of both the city architect (for the demolition elements) and Ian Lindsay and Partners (for the reconstruction). Main Street was almost wholly obliterated but rebuilt in &quot;replica&quot; on its north side. The south side was rebuilt as uncompromisingly modern three storey flats in a typically bland 1960s style. Other redevelopment in the area, at New Lane, Great Michael Rise and on Laverockbank Crescent, was the work of the eminent Scottish modern architect Sir Basil Spence.

A 16th century stone armorial panel on the south side of Main Street, known locally as the &quot;Newhaven Stone&quot;, appears to have come from the long vanished Trinity Mains Farm, a farm estate linked to Trinity House in Leith whose crest appears on the tablet. The farm gave its name to the adjacent suburb of Trinity. The panel is copied in part on a plaque in the local primary school.

The upper section of the village contained larger villas, looking down over the more crowded village of fishing cottages.

The Victorian fishmarket on the east side of the harbour was rescued from demolition in 1990 by its listing. Originally converted to a huge Harry Ramsden&#x27;s it is now the Loch Fyne restaurant. The Newhaven Heritage Museum placed in a small room in the northern section did not survive, but the fishmarket function itself has now been revitalised, including a publicly accessible fishmonger.

New development north and north-east of the village has quickly dwarfed the original village, both in the sense of scale and population. Much of the village now looks out onto high-rise modern apartments rather than the Firth of Forth.

===Transport===

====Buses====

Newhaven is served by Lothian buses: 7 and 11 going direct to the city centre, and the 16/N16 linking to Leith and from there again to the city centre.

====Tram====

Newhaven was part of the early 20th century tram route until 1956. 

The Edinburgh Trams light rail extension opened to passengers in June 2023 providing connection to the city centre and the airport.

The line terminates at Newhaven tram stop which is located to the north side of Lindsay Road.


====Harbour====

A lighthouse built at the harbour entrance in 1869 is a local landmark. The harbour has now been dwarfed by the enlarged Leith Harbour. The once thriving Victorian fishmarket is now converted into a smaller still functioning fishmarket, and the Loch Fyne restaurant. The Newhaven Heritage Museum which used to occupy a small section of the old fishmarket closed in 2007. It has since been converted into a retail fishmonger, linked to the adjacent fishmarket. Some of its exhibits have been kept by the Victoria Primary School. In 2021, the historical school building was confirmed as a future home for a charity &quot;Heart of Newhaven Community&quot; following a community grant from the Scottish Land Fund to buy it.

== Heritage events ==
In common with other historical villages, an Annual Gala Day has been held in May or June in Newhaven, with a traditional decorated &#x27;royal barge&#x27; bringing the &#x27;Gala Queen&#x27; and &#x27;Fisher King&#x27; (young children, &#x27;crowned&#x27; each year) across the harbour to lead processions, celebrations and music, to the present day The war memorial on the side of the Victoria School, is the site of annual Armistice Day ceremonies. On 14 October 2021, a 140-year memorial for the men lost in the Eyemouth disaster (and remembering all those lost at sea) is proposed with an appeal for descendants of those lost to take part in person/virtually as some are in USA, Canada and Australia.

<text>Operation Peter Pan (or Operación Pedro Pan) was a clandestine exodus of over 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban minors ages 6 to 18 to the United States over a two-year span from 1960 to 1962. They were sent by parents who feared, on the basis of unsubstantiated rumors propagated by the US, that Fidel Castro and the Communist party were planning to terminate parental rights and place minors in alleged &quot;communist indoctrination centers&quot;, commonly referred to as the &quot;Patria Potestad&quot;. No such actions by the Castro regime ever took place.

The program consisted of two main components: the mass evacuation of Cuban children via airplane to the United States – Miami as a particularly common hub – and the programs set up to care for them once they arrived. Both were led by Father Bryan O. Walsh of the Catholic Welfare Bureau. The operation was the largest exodus of minor refugees in the Western Hemisphere at the time. It operated covertly out of fear that it would be viewed as an anti-Castro political enterprise.

== Origins ==
=== Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution ===
Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, but more importantly after the regime&#x27;s October 1960 move to nationalize industries, the first wave of Cuban immigrants left for the United States. These upper and upper-middle classes were not tied to Batista&#x27;s government (those left in the days following the overthrow of Batista) but had economic livelihoods incompatible with the regime&#x27;s goals. Most, if not all, thought it to be a temporary departure, imagining a life where they would return to Cuba once another regime came to power in the country. 
An additional wave of Cubans left upon the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the subsequent announcement by Castro that he was a Marxist-Leninist. 
This proclamation of a new order acted as a catalyst to leave to those who had adopted a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude to developments. This third wave of Cuban immigrants was predominantly middle class. This wave of Cuban immigrants included middle merchants and management, landlords, mid-level professionals and a significant representation of skilled unionized workers. The constituents of these different classes looked on warily at the closures of private universities and schools in 1961 since these actions played into their fears that the government would take over the education of their children.

=== Parental fears ===

By 1960, the Cuban government began reforming education strategies. School children were taught military drills, how to bear arms, and anti-American songs. By 1961, the Cuban government would seize control of all private schools.

As a result of the new social order, rumors began to swirl, originating from both inside the United States and other anti-Castro media. Various outlets, including the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, reported that Castro and his followers intended to terminate parental rights, assume custody of all Cuban children, prohibit religion and indoctrinate them into communism. The CIA-backed Radio Swan station asserted that the Cuban government was planning to remove children from their parents and send them to the Soviet Union. These claims lacked evidence, but denials fell on deaf ears.

These rumors, combined with the pre-existing worry instilled by the Spanish Civil War (during which children were evacuated to other countries), made the &quot;patria potestad&quot; hoax impossible to contain. It had already reached the Catholic church and the general public, and opponents of the now openly communist regime who did not migrate during the first wave of the exodus began sending their children off to perceived safety.

=== Organizing an exodus ===
Having been involved in a similar program that gained young Hungarians entrance to the US following Soviet repression of the 1956 uprising, Father Bryan O. Walsh of the Catholic Welfare Bureau, with the help of the U.S. government, developed the Cuban Children&#x27;s Program in late 1960. Key players included Tracy Voorhees, Eisenhower Administration, James Baker, Father Walsh, and in Cuba Polita Grau and her brother Ramón Grau Alsina.

An October meeting brought the influx of Cuban refugees in Miami to the attention of the White House, with particular focus on what appeared to be a high number of unaccompanied minors wandering the city. Shortly after, Tracy Voorhees – a veteran U.S. government official who was serving as the president&#x27;s Personal Representative for Cuban Refugees – reported that, though the issue was not large in number, it had still been highly publicized and, therefore, the administration needed to be seen taking action.

Up until that time, the Catholic church had been the largest provider of aid. But, towards the end of 1960, President Eisenhower approved $1 million to help, with specific funds allocated to the creation of a Cuban emergency refugee center. To further their efforts, and ultimately further the smear campaign of Castro&#x27;s Cuba, Voorhees recommended the administration further their involvement, this time taking specific interest in caring for the Cuban refugee children.

Simultaneously, James Baker (headmaster of an American school in Havana) met with Walsh (who was already invested in helping already arrived child refugees settle into their new life) to detail his efforts helping parents send their children to Miami. Baker&#x27;s original goal was to establish a boarding school in the United States for Cuban refugee children. However, both later agreed professional social welfare agencies would be better equipped for the job. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, the Children&#x27;s Services Bureau and Jewish Family and Children&#x27;s Services were the agencies that ultimately agreed to care for the refugee children. Thus, in November 1960, they appealed for federal funding, and, following the earlier recommendation from Voorhees, it was granted.

Baker would arrange the children&#x27;s transportation and facilitate visas, Walsh would arrange for accommodations in Miami. Underground organizations led by the involved parents helped spread information. Among those who helped alert parents about the program were Penny Powers, Pancho and Bertha Finlay, Drs. Sergio and Serafina Giquel, Sara del Toro de Odio and Albertina O&#x27;Farril. To maintain confidentiality, the program&#x27;s leaders in the U.S. minimized communications with their contacts in Cuba.

== Operations ==
=== Emigration ===
By January 1961, 6,500 Cuban children were enrolled in Miami and Miami-adjacent schools. By September 1962, that number had jumped to 19,000. And while Pedro Pans are often depicted as babies, infants or elementary-school-aged children, most of them were actually teenaged boys.

A lack of limitations placed on how many were admitted coupled with federally-funded foster care made the Cuban Children&#x27;s Program one unlike any other. It only continued to grow and get more complex.

In January 1961, the U.S. embassy of Cuba closed, but Operation Peter Pan persisted. Instead of visas, children received waivers in the form of simple letters signed by Walsh effectively gaining them entrance into the country. Airlines were instructed to accept these letters as official documents and, as an added incentive, the U.S. government covered the cost of flights.

From there, things continued to spiral. In September of that year, the State Department began allowing Cuban child refugees to apply for visa waivers on behalf of their parents. For many who could not otherwise afford it or did not already have other relatives in the United States, this became a fairly regular means of familial immigration.

=== Funding ===
By late 1960, Castro had expropriated several companies that made up the American Chamber of Commerce in Havana, including Esso Standard Oil Company and Freeport Sulfur Company. The leaders of these companies moved to Miami while they analyzed the actions of Cuba&#x27;s new government. Under the impression that Castro&#x27;s rule would be brief, they agreed to aid the Cuban children by providing funding for Operation Peter Pan. Through collaborations with Baker, these business leaders agreed to help secure donations from multiple US businesses and send them to Cuba.

Because Castro was supervising all major monetary transactions, the businessmen were very careful in how the funds were transferred. Some donations were sent to the Catholic Welfare Bureau and others were written out as checks to citizens living in Miami. These individuals then wrote checks out to the W. Henry Smith Travel Agency in Havana, which helped fund the children&#x27;s flights to the United States. It was necessary to send the funds in American currency because Castro had ruled that plane tickets could not be purchased with Cuban pesos.

=== Housing ===
As the need for shelters grew as the children arrived in increasing numbers, several prominent locations were converted to house them, including Camp Matecumbe, the Opa-locka Airport Marine barracks. Special homes, authorized by state officials and operated by Cuban refugees, were formed in several hundred cities across the nation including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Lincoln, Nebraska; Wilmington, Delaware; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida.

Many children were placed in foster care, some were placed in positive living environments and others endured emotional and physical neglect. Laws prevented any relocated children from being housed in reform schools or centers for juvenile delinquents. Further, the minors were not made available for adoption.

=== End ===

The Cuban Children&#x27;s Program remained a secret until February 1962, when &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; introduced its readers to the masses of unaccompanied Cuban minors who made their way across the country for three years unnoticed. On March 9 of the same year, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;&#x27;s Gene Miller also ran a story about the event, in which he coined the term Operation Pedro Pan.

The American portion of Operation Peter Pan ended when all air traffic between the United States and Cuba ceased in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. Cuban immigrants were instead re-routed to Spain and other countries following the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Cuban immigrants would have to travel via Spain or Mexico to reach the United States until 1965.

In December of 1965, the United States established a program of Freedom Flights (&quot;los vuelos de la libertad&quot;) to unite Cuban parents with their children. The Catholic Welfare Bureau reported that, once the Freedom Flights began, nearly 90% of the minors still in its care were reunited with their parents.

Remnants of the program would continue up until 1981. An estimate of 25,000 children were affected by the program. 

== Legacy ==
=== Film ===
Nearing the end of this mass-exodus of children to the United States, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy approved funding for a propaganda film designed to assist migrant children&#x27;s understanding of why their parents had made this choice on their behalf. This film elaborates on the many things for children to do within their current situation, including but not limited to learning, playing, and attending religious ceremonies. However, this film is careful not mention the current events in Cuba. The film was directed by Cliff Solway, a Canadian director for CBC.

Titled &quot;The Lost Apple&quot;, the (approximately) thirty-minute short film follows the life of Roberto and two other young children inside the Florida City Camp that was one of the main offloading sites for children. The film was produced by the United States Information Agency. Narrated by Carlos Montalbán, the short film explains to young Cuban children how and why they are in the United States. The narrator explains that camps such as the Florida City Camp is only a temporary place for the children to stay, as they are meant to find other opportunities through scholarships or be housed with foster parents. 

=== Museums ===
The American Museum of The Cuban Diaspora (shortened to The Cuban) hosted an installation recounting Operation Peter Pan for its 60th anniversary in 2021. The museum is located in Miami, Florida and was founded in 2004. The Cuban, working directly with Operation Pedro Pan Group, Inc. (OPPG), expanded on OPPG&#x27;s 2015 exhibit by adding documents, objects, and images loaned by the historical committee of the organization. 

=== Pedro Pan children ===
Many Pedro Pans had trouble assimilating into American society. Many were sent to the United States on the instruction of their parents and felt alienated both from their homeland and their new home. Some found the United States an unwelcoming place gripped by racial segregation.

Those who felt uncomfortable in American society often participated in the growing Civil rights movement and anti-war movement, adopted the traits of the growing youth counterculture, or rejected the ideology of their parents. Many would desire to return to Cuba. In the same way, some others found professional success, and went on to become notable people. One of such examples is Maximo Alvarez, founder of the fuel distribution chain Sunshine Gasoline Distribution inc., who emigrated to the United States as a Pedro Pan child in 1961, at the age of 13. In 1961, thirteen-year-old Ana Mendieta, who would become a well-known multimedia and performance artist, emigrated to the United States with her older sister. 

Some Pedro Pan children would involve themselves in the Abdala organization, an organization of Cuban-American students dedicated to protesting the Cuban government and promoting Cuban-American pride.

Other Pedro Pan children would adopt leftist sympathies after becoming involved in social movements in the United States. In 1977, some Pedro Pan emigrants joined the Antonio Maceo Brigade that sympathized with the Cuban government and supported Cuban exiles&#x27; travel to Cuba. The brigade would make the first trip of Cuban exiles to Cuba.

==== Pedro Pan Children by the Numbers ====
A study from Yale University investigated if the Pedro Pan population shows persistent differences in their physical and mental health, and attachment secondary to childhood separation from their family. These participants were compared against a control sample of Cuban immigrants who had traveled with their families to the US at the same time as the Pedro Pan children. 102 adults who were involved in the Operation Pedro Pan exodus participated in this study. 

Within the survey, it was reported that no significant differences were found between the Pedro Pan group and the control group. However, the result of the study can be interpreted in many different ways. Since both groups were part of a larger exile, they could have similar mindsets about their familial ties and feelings towards the earlier time period.

=== Conflicting narratives ===
The United States government may have had other than humanitarian motives for allowing Cuban migration. The emigration of Cuba&#x27;s middle class undermined its economic situation through a &quot;brain drain&quot;. Stories of abandoned Pedro Pans deepened Anti-Castro sentiment within the Americas, connecting the rise of Communism and the separation of families.

In 1978, El Grupo Areito and Casa de las Américas collaborated to publish &quot;Contra viento y marea&quot;, a book of anonymous testimonies detailing alienation from both the Cuban community from which they fled and the American community to which they came. A direct contrast to the previous happy-go-lucky stories of Operation Pedro Pan, these accounts told stories of loneliness, poor conditions and mental, physical and sexual abuse.

=== Controversy over CIA involvement ===
An ongoing political controversy developed around charges that Operation Peter Pan was not an effort of volunteers and charitable organization, but had been secretly funded by the U.S. government as a covert operation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Author Maria de los Angeles Torres filed a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain government files on the program. In 1999, a ruling by the U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois determined that this &quot;evacuation of Cuban children turned out not to be a CIA operation at all&quot;. The ruling was based in part on the court&#x27;s review of 733 pages of documentation provided by the CIA for use in an earlier lawsuit. Despite this, several former CIA agents have admitted to editing, printing and distributing copies of a fabricated Patria Potestad law that stated the revolutionary government was about to abolish parental rights. This, along with fake news about threats to the Cuban family broadcast on CIA-operated Radio Swan, helped fuel the exodus of unaccompanied children.

<text>Sábado Gigante (English translation: &quot;Giant Saturday&quot; or &quot;Gigantic Saturday&quot;; known officially as Sábado Gigante Internacional outside Chile) is a Spanish-language television program that was broadcast by Spanish International Network in the United States. It was Univision&#x27;s longest-running program and the longest-running television variety series in world television history. &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; is an eclectic and frenetic mix of various contests, human-interest stories, and live entertainment. From its start in 1962, it was hosted by Chilean TV star Mario Kreutzberger under the stage name of Don Francisco. Rolando Barral and Pedro De Pool began serving as a co-hosts in 1986; that role was taken over by Javier Romero in 1991.

The three-hour program aired on Univision each Saturday at 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. from 1987 to 2001). A new episode was produced every week throughout the show&#x27;s history, with no reruns and only rare preemptions due to special programming (most notably by &quot;Teletón USA&quot;, an annual 24-hour telethon held each December, which Kreutzberger has hosted since its inception in 2012).

On April 17, 2015, Univision announced that &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; would end after 53 years, with its final episode (titled &quot;Sábado Gigante: Hasta Siempre&quot;; English translation: &quot;Giant Saturday: Farewell&quot; or &quot;Gigantic Saturday: Farewell&quot;) airing on September 19, 2015. Present at the show were former members of &quot;Clan Infantil&quot; and the current host of the Univision magazine &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; Pamela Silva Conde, the soap opera actress Sherlyn, the Univision Radio host José Felipe Padrón, &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; correspondent Tony Dandrades, actor and singer Eduardo Antonio, the Venezuelan singer Karolina con K and Zuleyka Rivera, Miss Universe 2006 and current presenter of the UniMás program &quot;La Revista de Zuleyka&quot;, among others.

For the first time during the show&#x27;s run, the final episode aired live in Chile, Mexico, and the U.S. After the finale, Univision replaced it with a prerecorded Mexican show, &quot;Sabadazo&quot;, which premiered on October 30, 2010, on Televisa and September 2012 on Univision. It was later replaced with &quot;Crónicas de Sábado&quot; and &quot;Sal y Pimienta&quot; on Univision as &quot;Sabadazo&quot; was moved back to its original afternoon time slot (both shows were later replaced by 2-3 Liga MX association football games broadcast on the network under the name &quot;Sábado Futbolero&quot; broadcast during that league&#x27;s season; &quot;Sabadazo&quot; was then canceled in 2015).

==Broadcast history==
Kreutzberger originated the weekly program on August 5, 1962, airing on Canal 13 in Chile as &quot;Show Dominical&quot; (&quot;Sunday&#x27;s Show&quot;). He had been inspired by television shows he had seen in the United States and Argentina but, as he explained, &quot;My idea was mixing all the programs that I saw into one program.&quot;

The program&#x27;s broadcasts were subsequently moved to Saturdays, and henceforth, was renamed &quot;Sábados Gigantes&quot; in 1963 and quickly developed a loyal following in Chile, and then throughout Latin America. In Chile, during the 1970s and 1980s, the show reached peak audiences of 80%. During this period, some episodes of the program lasted up to eight hours.

In its early years, the series was broadcast live with the exception of short segments; notable among the pre-taped segments was the travelogue, where Kreutzberger visited different locations around the world.

On April 12, 1986, Kreutzberger and the program moved to Miami, Florida where it began to be produced by the Spanish International Network, now Univision (originally by their Miami affiliate, WLTV). At that time, the show&#x27;s title was changed to the singular &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, although some longtime fans in Chile still call it by the pluralized title. On June 18, 2005, the series celebrated its 1,000th episode on Univisión, and on May 20, 2006, it celebrated its 20th anniversary in the U.S. and on May 21, 2011, it celebrated its 25th anniversary on the Univision. On October 27, 2012, &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; celebrated its 50th anniversary (counting both its runs in Chile and the U.S.).

For the Univision program, from its inception until 2001, the broadcast began at 7:00pm ET, with the &quot;first hour&quot; (from 1996 to 2001) usually revolving around a theme and marketed under an alternate name (e.g. &quot;Amor Gigante&quot;, &quot;Sorpresa Gigante&quot;, &quot;Tutti Frutti Gigante&quot;, &quot;Fiesta Gigante&quot; among others). This first hour was exclusive to Univision and was not used in international broadcasts.

For several years, two programs were recorded each week from identical sets:
* One in Miami, Florida for broadcast in most Latin American countries, as well as Australia, Canada, and Europe.
* One in Santiago, Chile for broadcast in that country (Kreutzberger&#x27;s home country).

In 2000, the show was remotely broadcast from Los Angeles to coincide with the Mexican Independence Day celebrations. In June 2010, the final hour of the show was again remotely broadcast at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California to celebrate the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In 2011, the show aired a special three-hour telethon benefiting the American Red Cross&#x27; efforts to aid the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

== Regular segments ==

=== El Chacal de la Trompeta (aka &quot;La Gran Oportunidad&quot;) ===
One of the show&#x27;s signature segments, six contestants are given the chance to sing a song, with the bad performers being eliminated mid-song by &quot;El Chacal&quot;, a ghost-like character who blows an old trumpet to end such acts (similar to &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). Unlike &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, El Chacal does not have to wait a specific amount of time before eliminating someone (on many occasions, contestants have been eliminated almost immediately after beginning their performance). Don Francisco would always get into the act, and wear silly hats and wigs to intimidate the contestant. From 2000 to 2006, the eliminated performer would also be &quot;fed&quot; to a lion in his cave, with Don Francisco chanting &quot;A los leones&quot; (in addition to the usual &quot;y...fuera!&quot; chant). The &quot;Lion&quot; character was later phased out and would be &quot;replaced&quot; with an Alex the Lion doll. The &quot;surviving&quot; performers are voted on by the audience, with the one receiving the most applause winning a prize or cash (in this case, $1,000). The performer also has the chance to win an additional $1,000 by acquiring &quot;La Corona&quot;, which would pre-qualify that performer for the &quot;Reyes del Chacal&quot; competition, which was held every two to four years (although this competition had not been held since 2010). From 1987 to 1993, any performer who advanced also received a six-pack of Coca-Cola.

A running gag of this segment occurs whenever Don Francisco sings during this segment, El Chacal would blow the trumpet mid-song, effectively insulting the host, who responds by kicking El Chacal. He would also kick the character if a bad call was made. Another running gag also had an attractive female performer &quot;automatically&quot; advancing before even singing.

El Chacal&#x27;s name translates to &quot;the Jackal&quot; in English, and his antics are more in line with such, similar to a laughing hyena. However, there is a bit darker (or dark humor) meaning behind the character and his appearance. He actually has more similarities to an &quot;Executioner&quot; or a &quot;Hooded Hatchetman&quot;, who used to kill people on the gallows or guillotine while wearing such a mask. Only in this case, he &quot;kills off&quot; acts of performers by playing the trumpet and not wielding an axe or guillotine.

In November 2013, Leonardo Núñez Guerrero, the man who played El Chacal for more than 20 years, was fired from the show by Don Francisco.

=== Miss Colita ===
A parody of beauty pageants, six women compete in swimsuits or other revealing attire for the title of &quot;Miss Colita&quot;. It is similar to the Brazilian contest &quot;Miss Bumbum&quot;. The contest is usually held the Saturday before the Miss Venezuela, Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, although it – or variants of the segment – are frequently held every two to four weeks. A Christmas-themed version, &quot;Miss Santita&quot;, is held the Saturday before Christmas. Another version, &quot;Miss Colita Petite&quot;, features mainly smaller women. From 2003 to 2005, it was succeeded by a similar contest, &quot;Miss Curvilinea&quot;, which focused more on the body type and form. The final &quot;Miss Colita&quot; contest took place on August 22, 2015, the same night as the Miss Teen USA 2015 pageant.

It is also well known for the song &quot;Mueve la colita&quot;, where the idea of the contest was conceived from; it has been an unofficial hymn of &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;. Don Francisco had stated that the popularity of the song and its accompanying dance saved the program from an early cancellation in 1987, although this was not publicly revealed until 2012, during the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration.

This segment has been criticized by several former Miss Universe delegates including Alicia Machado, Justine Pasek, Mónica Spear, and Taliana Vargas due to the main focus of the contest being the buttocks. This led to the creation of Miss Curvilinea, among other similar contests.

=== Miss Chiquitita ===
This contest featured girls (usually children) competing for the title of &quot;Miss Chiquitita&quot;. The contest was held between 1994 and 1996, and was held in a two-month period; it was revived in July 2012 after a 16-year hiatus. The structure was similar to Miss America, sans the swimsuit and evening gown rounds.

=== Clan Infantil/Los Niños de la Conversación ===
This segment involved a group of children (usually regular attendees of the program with rotations every year) participating in a round table discussion with Don Francisco regarding various topics. Additionally, the same children are also sometimes used as a panel for contests with adults as participants.

Cap&#x27;n Crunch was a sponsor of this segment from 1997 to 2001 in the Univision version, with the children (and one member, usually female, holding a box of the cereal) often singing along with its jingle. The Cap&#x27;n Crunch jingle (specifically the 1993-98 version) later gained a cult following amongst those who were viewers of the program.

=== Live entertainment ===
Every hour of the show, recording artists and bands (usually from Latin America) perform songs live in front of the audience. Notable non-Spanish language artists/groups that performed in &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; have included Pitbull, SkyBlu (of the group LMFAO), No Mercy, Eden&#x27;s Crush, i5, Dream, Kiley Dean, Tony Bennett and Psy.

In addition to musical talent, other acts such as magicians, world record holders among others also perform their talents during the show.

=== El Detector De Mentiras ===
Whenever someone is accused of infidelity, Don Francisco puts that person to a lie detector test, conducted by retired police officer (and licensed polygraph) Joe Harper. While this is a serious segment, there is some humor, whenever Harper mispronounces the words in the questions since he is not fluent in Spanish, only to be criticized (and corrected) by Don Francisco.

There have been several instances where infidelity was not involved in this segment, when a woman believed to have had an encounter with extraterrestrial life in Battle Ground, Washington, as well as a man being suspected by his wife of being gay.

=== Póngale Ritmo ===
This segment is a dance competition. The first round has contestants perform a freestyle dance before a panel of judges. Only three are selected for the final rounds of the contest.

=== La Cuatro ===
At some point during the show, Don Francisco gets interrupted (and sometimes annoyed) by &quot;La Cuatro&quot; (initially named &quot;La Cuatro Dientes&quot; in Chile; played by Chilean singer and actress Gloria Benavides). She has a semi-romantic interest in Don Francisco, but would frequently pester him, including the use of bad jokes and bothering the audience. If La Cuatro pokes fun at various celebrities, Don Francisco warns her (numerous times) to not mess with them.

=== Comedy segments ===
There have been numerous comedic segments throughout the show&#x27;s run. Some of the starring actors include Frank Falcon, Miguel &quot;El Flaco&quot;, Gloria Ordonez, Carlos Justis, Juanito and Zulema Salazar. They were best known for helping launch the career of the Argentine model/vedette/actress Nanci Guerrero, who starred in a majority of these sketches. Most have included the following:
* &quot;La familia Fernández&quot;: A sketch involving a dysfunctional Mexican family, consisting of the patriarch Julio Fernández (played by Carlos Yustis), his wife Teresita, their daughter Isabel and her boyfriend Maximo (played by Patricio Torres), who developed a close friendship with Julio.
* &quot;Julio y Max&quot;: A spin-off sketch from &quot;La familia Fermández&quot;, featuring the namesake characters in various situations.
* &quot;La Oficina de Producción&quot;: One of &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;″s most popular sketches, it follows &quot;network executives&quot; – La Cuatro, Mr. James Douglas (the head executive who spoke only English in earlier sketches; Mr. Douglas also had a ladies&#x27; man persona), La Señorita Karina (a secretary who also acted as Mr. Douglas’ interpreter in the earlier sketches; played by Margarita Coego), Anabel (another secretary who replaced Karina; played by Nanci Guerrero), Ñañito (played by Armando Roblan), Osvaldo Zapata (a supervisor with a Western style), Ricky (a security guard), and Albertito (a chauffeur; played by Miguel González) – at a production office. Don Francisco precedes the sketch by calling one of the characters, while each sketch would end in bad luck, either by arrest, death, an unwanted situation or with Mr. Douglas &quot;firing&quot; one or all of the characters.
* &quot;Hospital Gigante&quot;: A similar sketch in a hospital setting. This sketch was known for its suggestive/risqué themes, as La Doctora Cosabella (played by Guerrero) would often strip into her lingerie (whenever someone in the hospital shouts &quot;Mequetrefe&quot;). Rómulo (played by Miguel González), a paramedic, has a romantic interest in Cosabella. La Cuatro has a role as another doctor. González and Guerrero returned in-character in 2006, attempting to take Don Francisco to their hospital. Alfonso Zayas also acted in this segment.
* &quot;Hotel Gigante&quot;: A sketch set in a hotel. It is similar in format to &quot;Hospital Gigante&quot;, albeit with different characters.
* &quot;Condominio Gigante&quot;: A sketch set in a condominium.
* &quot;Nave Espacial&quot;: A parody sketch of various science fiction films, mostly &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It is set in a space station.
* &quot;Cuatro Para Las Cuatro Con La Cuatro&quot;: Itself a parody of telenovelas, it follows La Cuatro as a maid in an apartment (later a mansion). Regular characters included Doña Concha (played by Adonis Losada) and Doña Eufrocina (played by Norma Zuñiga), Marcelo Jose (played by Carlos Farach), the residents, as well as an American businessman named Donald (aka &quot;Nice to Meet You&quot;; played by Aaron Hill). It was followed by two &quot;sequels&quot;, &quot;La Posada&quot; and &quot;Don Medical Center&quot;, the latter a reboot of &quot;Hospital Gigante&quot;, while Hill later reprised his role as the &quot;Nice to Meet You&quot; character from 2013 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2015 during La Cuatro&#x27;s segments with Don Francisco.
* &quot;La cosa está dura&quot;: A sketch involving Mexican immigrants adjusting to typical American life.
* &quot;El hospital de la risa&quot;: Another sketch in a hospital setting.

=== Animal-related contests ===
There have been contests involving animals, usually pets. One of them, &quot;La gracias de mi mascota&quot;, features pets performing certain talents. Another variant, &quot;Igualito a mí mascota&quot;, features pets looking like their owners. Ron Magill, from the Metro Zoo in Miami, is a guest on the show whenever these contests are held. Another game, &quot;Los huevos de Ron Magill&quot; (named after Magill himself), has audience members attempt to replicate an animal&#x27;s sound which, if one is performed successfully, then that person can reach their hand in an oversized egg for a chance to win up to $1,500.

==== Don Francisco&#x27;s relationship with Magill ====
It is noted that Magill had also been frequently criticized by Don Francisco, as well as (in some occasions) made fun of by the audience due to his poor Spanish-speaking ability (despite Magill&#x27;s first language being Spanish during childhood). However, Magill has stated that he re-learned the language through his tenure on &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;. During an interview, Magill (jokingly) stated that if he was fluent in Spanish, he would have not been allowed to participate in the show. Another running gag during these segments had Don Francisco constantly annoy Magill while holding certain animals (mostly those potentially dangerous to humans) by constantly asking questions about the animal held.

These gags would later carry over on Don Francisco&#x27;s later programs (&quot;Don Francisco Te Invita&quot; and &quot;Siempre Niños&quot;, both on Telemundo) after the cancellation of &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, whenever Magill is a guest on them.

=== Romance-themed contests ===
Throughout the show&#x27;s run, there have been competitions involving romantic themes, often rotated weekly. The contests have included the following:

*&quot;Solteras Sin Compromiso&quot;: A competition involving single women vying to win a date with one of the single men featured in the segment. This competition was primarily played in the Chilean version during the early years of the program. A similar contest played in the Univision version, &quot;Solteros y Solteras&quot; features single men and women and uses a battle of the sexes format.
*&quot;Todo Por El Amor&quot;: A series of competitions involving married and unmarried couples. The competitions are done in rounds, with the couple with the most points at the end of the contests wins a cash prize of US$5,000. A running gag of these contests involves Don Francisco slapping the husband/boyfriend if he was not behaving during his relationship with his significant other.

===The car games, a.k.a. &quot;Final de Automóvil&quot;===

Throughout its run, the final segment of the show was always a contest where one of the finalists (chosen from those consisting of winners of that episode&#x27;s games and competitions as well as select members of the audience) have a chance to win a new car prize (there has been one instance where a car was not a prize for an episode, during the 50th anniversary episode, where the prize was $50,000 in cash). In 2000 and from 2005 to 2009, another car prize (usually from a different manufacturer) was offered at the end of the first hour of the show, while the show&#x27;s final episode had three contests for cars during each hour, all with a guaranteed winner.

Before each car game is played in the Univision version, a disclaimer said by either Don Francisco, Javier Romero or one of the co-presenters precedes the car games by stating: &quot;Any contestant that wishes to win the car must participate in the car games in-person. Neither &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; or Univision ask for money in exchange for prizes, if you receive a call asking for money in exchange for a prize [from someone claiming to be on behalf of Univision or &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;], please call the corresponding authorities.&quot; while the same disclaimer is shown on-screen at the end of the program. A similar disclaimer is also used for the Chilean version of Gigante hosted by Don Francisco&#x27;s daughter, Vivi. Contestants must be 18 and older to compete for the car, while there have been instances that a contestant&#x27;s younger family member (often their children/grandchildren) would participate alongside them. It has been revealed that the winning contestants have to wait 30 days for their cars to be delivered to them and that the actual car varied from the one shown in the program.

Cars given away in the U.S. program have included those from Ford Motor Company (1986–89, 1999–2014, 2015 for the final show), Toyota (1987?-1990?), General Motors (1986–1987) Honda (1990–99), Daewoo (2000), Hyundai (2005–09) and Kia Motors (2014–2015). In Chile, some cars given away include Volkswagen, Lada, Renault-Samsung, Arica-Mini, and Subaru. During the show&#x27;s early years in the U.S. and during the final episode, the cars were provided by Miami-based dealership Gus Machado Ford. Javier Romero (or, from 1996 to 1997, an unnamed spokesman representing Honda, who would always encourage viewers to test-drive the cars at their local Honda dealerships) would also plug the cars, either with a detailed or a more generic description, the latter without mentioning the make, model or the manufacturer. The former was solely used in the U.S. (from 1989 to 2012), while the latter was used in international broadcasts (where Honda and Ford cars were not sold). The plugs, especially for when Hondas were used as the car prizes, were also known for the use of a distinct background music, which was dropped after Hondas were no longer used (the Honda background music remained in place for the generic descriptions used for broadcasts outside the U.S., until 2010).

While the car prizes in the program were usually either compact and/or mid-size cars (the latter being usually sedans), larger cars such as pickup trucks and SUVs were also used as car prizes.

In the Chilean version, cars may be used as one of the regular prizes during some of the games. In addition to cars, houses were even given away as grand prizes for certain games, most notably from the ones sponsored by La Tomboleta.

From 1992 to 1996, Polaroid was the main sponsor of the car games (with rotations from the show&#x27;s other sponsors). From 1996 to 1998, AT&amp;T succeeded Polaroid as the sponsor. From 1998 to 2005, AmericaTel, another long-distance phone service once endorsed by Don Francisco, succeeded AT&amp;T.

Prior to the revamping in 2008, the games played for the car were similar to the pricing games seen on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, but were based on luck rather than having the contestant guess the actual price of the car (with very few games focusing on guessing the pricing the car). These have included a game with a staircase of buttons in any of these three colors (red, green (yellow originally), or blue) with the contestant selecting two rows (one for the contestant, the other for Don Francisco) and trying to avoid a &quot;broken&quot; button (indicated by an alarm) to win (this game was relaunched in 2005 with a man in a cherry picker, usually a stunt double, falling out of it if the broken button was pushed (this was phased out in 2007), a green row of buttons, replacing the yellow and a minor rule change of $100 each for the initial five buttons, decreased from the $250). If the contestant or Don Francisco pushes the broken button, the contestant would lose the game. However, if the contestant or Don Francisco successfully pushes all of the buttons on each staircase they chose without pushing the broken button, they win a total of $4,000 in cash (later in 2005; $5,000 in cash) and a brand-new car. This version was based on a contest played in the Chilean version, where Don Francisco and the contestant used a plastic revolver-like pistol (without any bullets); should the pistol click without firing, the contestant would also win a displayed prize for each successful click. Otherwise, the contestant would lose if the pistol fired (indicated by a sound-effect of an actual pistol firing). This version was discontinued in 1987 due to the use of the pistols bringing concerns of gun violence in Chile and globally, which was also one of the reasons this version was not played in the U.S. version (and replaced with the staircase version). The concept is loosely based on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Ten Chances&quot; pricing game, albeit largely unrelated. It was also the only game where the host also played a participation role.

This game is similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Any Number&quot; pricing game. Contestants can call out digits one at a time, revealing them in the retail prices of four prizes on the gameboard, and wins the first prize whose price is completely revealed. A gameboard contains spaces representing five digits in the price of a car, four digits in the price of a trip anywhere in the world (mainly a Spanish-speaking country, usually within Latin America or, occasionally, the country of that week&#x27;s La Cámara Viajera segment), four digits representing an amount of money that is valued at more than $1,000 (similar to a piggy bank), and three digits in the price of a smaller prize (usually a Polaroid One Step or Spectra camera and its corresponding film due to their sponsorship). The first digit in the price of the car is revealed at the beginning of the game (a rule implemented after cars valued at more than $10,000 were used in the game). Another game, similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;One Away&quot; and &quot;Race Game&quot; pricing games, had contestants try to rearrange a wrong price to the correct one within a 30-second time limit, in which the contestant wins the car and various other prizes if they get the correct price (representing the total retail value of all prizes). In 1999, the contestant had 60 seconds (later 40 seconds in 2006), while also guessing the correct items (e.g. pictures of actors/actresses/singers, songs from each artist, cities/capitol from each country, athletes of a specific sport, etc.). If there is less than 6 right, the contestant can try again to rearrange. However, if the contestant successfully gets all 6 right before time expires, the contestant wins the car and $6,000.

Another game is similar to &quot;High Rollers&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Dice Game&quot; and &quot;Lucky Seven&quot; pricing games is where a contestant can roll a pair of dice by eliminating on any number or combination of the dice beside each row of 6 which is top or bottom, leaving the last number or combination of the number remaining on the game board, similar to &quot;The Big Numbers&quot; displayed in the bonus round. Additionally, there&#x27;s also a lucky seven or doubles on the dice, which is also a wild card, that a contestant can remove on any number or combination they want. The contestant awards $500 to the player&#x27;s score for each number or combination eliminated on the game board. If the contestant makes a bad roll, they get a strike (represented by a monster named after El Chacal), 2 strikes, the game ends, and loses everything. If the contestant successfully rolls the same exact number or combination remaining on the game board that they matched, or if they roll a lucky seven (which is also a wild card), then the contestant wins whatever money they accumulated (up to $3500) plus a brand-new car. However should only a 1 remain on the board after eliminating all the others, the game is deemed a draw and the contestant solely wins up to $2500. When this game was initially played in 1996, the actual car was hidden behind a door in the center that opens if the contestant wins (similar to the Master Key-like car game mentioned below). When a new season of the show premiered later that year, a downsizing of the game board eliminated the door. It was also one of a few car games in the program to be short-lived, having only been played from 1996 to 1997.

Another game involved 10 cardboard keys (which resembled large keycards) with the contestant having to choose the key (with a set number of chances) that opens the large vault containing the car inside (similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Master Key&quot; and &quot;Safe Crackers&quot; pricing games). In 1995, the vault and keys changed color from gold to blue. In 1999, the vault was revamped with several colors: red, yellow, green and blue; patterned yellow and white keys and an ice-platinum &quot;$&quot; symbol; alongside a minor rule change of the game having all the finalists choose one key each and was expanded to 20 keys, whilst the 2006 relaunch returned to the 1993-95 format, but with a makeover (it resembled a bank vault and the 16 keys in-game were modeled after real keys). From 1993 to 1995, a giant die rolled from the bleachers determine the number of keys to pick (a fish bowl was used from 2006 to 2008). If the vault opens in which they pick the winning key number, a siren went off, and the contestant wins the car. Otherwise, the buzzer will sound if the vault does not open in which the contestant picks the wrong key number (with Don Francisco showing the audience the winning key number in an envelope and, occasionally, using that key to open the vault). There have been multiple occasions where contestants won the car on the first/only key. This game was considered the most popular car game of the show and is the first car game played. This game now appears occasionally, with all finalists each picking the key they believe opens the car door. And if the car door opens, they will win a new car. During gameplay, whenever contestants are on their sole/final key, Don Francisco would offer a cash prize (up to $2,000) in exchange for their key (there have been multiple instances where contestants picked the winning key but took the cash prizes). The final episode in September 2015 had a guaranteed winner of a car, as five members of the audience were allowed to pick a key from a bowl and try it in the door lock. The third contestant was successful.

There are several games that used the &quot;3 Strikes&quot; concept (with the El Chacal de la Trompeta character image used as the &quot;strikes&quot; from 1996 to 2015). A basic version has contestants choose one of 12 slots which contain either a wheel, a strike (represented by an El Chacal icon from 1999 onwards) or the &quot;Sabado Gigante&quot; logo. Each wheel adds $1,000 to the player&#x27;s score, and if the contestant successfully finds all 4 wheels, the contestant wins $4,000 and the car. If the contestant finds the &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; logo, it will eliminate one strike and, from 1988 to 1999, awarded a $500 bonus, in which the contestant got to keep regardless of outcome. A variant of this game uses people holding large cards containing El Chacal, the Wheel and the Sábado Gigante logo. This version appears mainly in special episodes of the show and whenever the show is broadcast outside Miami. Notable participants have included Nuestra Belleza Latina/Miss Venezuela contestants, association football players (mainly those from Liga MX, MLS, WPS clubs or from the Mexico national team), Sábado Gigante characters, Miss Colita contestants among others.

The number of panels is determined by the number of players competing during the show (consisting of those that earned a panel through winning the show&#x27;s other contests as well as randomly-selected audience members). One of them has the word &quot;Auto&quot; in it, while the others have El Chacal (the 1998-2008 version included one panel with the &quot;Auto&quot; marker, several panels with amounts of cash (up to $300) and one or two panels with a &quot;Muchas Gracias&quot; marker). The contestant who finds the Auto panel, moves on to the car game. Another method existed where playing cards were used, with the contestant that drew an Ace advancing to the car game.

There was one game where contestants are given a survey question and must correctly guess five responses related to the question (similar to &quot;Family Feud&quot;). Other games have included a matching game where contestants must match the names of pictured items (usually those of celebrities, places, etc.) as well as a game where the contestant must answer either yes or no before a statement/question was displayed (similar to truth or dare?), with them winning the car (alongside other prizes) in the statement/question if answered correctly.

The new car games introduced in 2008, which are essentially updated and digitalized versions of older games, have included:
* A car puzzle, which contestants find the parts of a digitalized car. Each piece adds $1,000 to the player&#x27;s score, while El Chacal takes money away. The first one takes $1,000 from the player, the second deducts $2,000 and everything for all three; thus it is possible to have a negative amount after the first and/or second mistake. If the player successfully finds all 7 parts of a digitalized car without finding El Chacal 3 times, the player wins a brand-new car and whatever money has been accumulated (up to $7,000; should the player correctly find parts of the car before finding El Chacal, they win the money accumulated regardless of outcome, while, unlike other games, the contestant cannot quit if they&#x27;re on their second Chacal strike). This was based on an older game where players spell out the word &quot;Gigante&quot;, similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Spelling Bee&quot; pricing game and was played using the 3 Strikes. The 1989-95 version was structured similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;3 Strikes&quot; pricing game, where the contestant would reach their hand down to a box and pick up the game pieces with the letters or strikes on them, whilst the 1999-2008 version was modified where the contestant picks up the pieces on the game board, similar to the aforementioned show&#x27;s &quot;Punch-a-Bunch&quot; game.
* A virtual race, where contestants select a colored stock car (Red, Green or Blue) – which closely resemble Formula One cars – and wins if the chosen color places first. This preceded a similar game where the 2001-05 version included a car, El Chacal, and a cruise ship (if the ship placed first, the contestant wins a cruise to an unspecified location). The 2006-08 version depicted a horse race and is similar to the current format. This game was played twice during the final episode with three contestants choosing each colored car. This was similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s &quot;Rat Race&quot; pricing game.
* A roulette game, where players spin a virtual wheel and try to stop at the car space five times. There are 6 parts of a car spinning around a virtual wheel including a gallon of gasoline, license plate, car door (replicating a Ford Fiesta door), steering wheel, car key, and a car tire/wheel. Each parts of a car adds $1,000 to the player&#x27;s score, and if the contestant successfully stops at the car space 5 times without stopping at the &quot;Chacal&quot; space 3 times, the contestant wins a brand-new car and whatever money has accumulated. The older versions have the word &quot;Auto&quot; and &quot;Chacal&quot; and amounts of cash (between $500 and $1,500) on a physical wheel. Additionally, the 1998-99 version, which was filmed separately from the main program, also had the actual car center stage, with the wheel on the right side, drawings of cars on the top center above the car and those of El Chacal on the left. The 2000-08 version was downsized to a single game board, eliminating the center stage, while that same version was later modified with new color schemes. This game is loosely similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s&#x27; &quot;Showcase Showdown&quot; round, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;″s&#x27; &quot;Go for a Spin&quot; game, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, the latter being unrelated.
*There was another game in which a contestant picks a door up or down, and are then shown a number and the contestants are asked if the next door&#x27;s number is higher or lower. Each correct answer adds $1,000 to their score, and if the contestant successfully gets 5 out of 7 right without making 2 mistakes, the contestant wins $5,000 and a brand-new car. This is similar to the overall gameplay of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. The 1996-99 version was played differently, where the contestant must collect cards containing five pictures of a disproportionate car, which closely resembled one from the animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (equaling 1 part each), with the adjacent card being a drawing of a monster (named after El Chacal de la Trompeta despite it not looking like the character). Additionally, If the contestant draws a card with a gold seal of the car, the player automatically wins the car and, in some cases, whatever money accumulated (with instances where contestants drew the gold seal on their third turn, the fastest possible occurrence). This version also became a playable Flash game on the show&#x27;s website and was considered the most difficult game on the show. The 1999-2008 version is similar to the current format (made in response to the difficulty of the first version) and was first played using large playing cards (with Jacks, Kings and Queens being equal to 10, and Aces either 1 or 11; Should multiple rows of cards contain the same number and all rows have exhausted before winning the car, the contestant wins whatever money accumulated, while they sometimes would also lose the game if they already had an incorrect answer). The game board also was overhauled with ice-platinum borders, wheel lights, a cardboard cut-out of a car and two El Chacal silhouettes. In 2002, the &quot;playing cards&quot; were replaced by large flash cards with the &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; logo and a number (1–12) on each side. This was the only car game in the show to have its gameplay changed.

== Irregular segments ==

=== Coro Millionario ===
A competition where three contestants must answer a riddle with the clues sung to them by an on-stage choir. This game debuted in the Univision program in 1990 and was played semi-regularly until 1995. The game would return for a week in 1999 and as a three-week limited run in 2008, the latter of which was the final playing of the competition.

=== La Cámara Viajera ===
&quot;La Cámara Viajera&quot; (&quot;The Traveling Camera&quot;) is the show&#x27;s travelogue segment – which only appeared occasionally (regularly until 2004) – where Don Francisco visits a selected country where he mainly talks about the culture and its attractions. The segment has taken him to over 185 countries worldwide, many of them more than once. It was also known for its long-term sponsorship with American Airlines on the Univision program, which precedes the segment by advertising daily flights from Miami (where the program was taped) to the location of that week&#x27;s segment. Additionally, American Airlines commercials would also traditionally air during the commercial break after the segment.

=== Talent Competitions ===
There also have been numerous talent competitions throughout the program&#x27;s run (which are held every 1–4 years). They have included:
* &quot;Gigantes de Mañana/Estrellas del Futuro&quot;: A singing competition for children and young adults, who performed at one point in specific music genres (Regional Mexican music and Reggaeton, both in 2005). 
* &quot;Idolos de la Canción&quot;: A competition with participants emulating various singers.
* &quot;Reyes del Chacal&quot;: A competition consisting of past winners of the &quot;El Chacal de la Trompeta&quot; segment.
* &quot;Ritmo Dieta&quot;: A Zumba-style weight loss competition similar to &quot;Póngale Ritmo&quot;.
* &quot;Diva Latina/Viva la Diva&quot;: A singing competition consisting of young women.

==Product placement==
Throughout the show&#x27;s run, product placement has been a vital part of &quot;Sabado Gigante&quot;. Whenever a certain product is advertised during the show, Don Francisco, along with the audience, would sing that product&#x27;s jingle. Otherwise, he, one of the co-presenters or Javier Romero will describe the product. Most products, such as Cookie Crisp and Chex cereals (when they were produced by Ralston), would often alternate weekly or monthly.

Several products advertised on the Univision-produced &quot;Sabado Gigante&quot; (during segments) have included the following:


Additionally, other brands advertised in the program outside of segments included AARP, Cafe Bustelo, Claritin, DirecTV, Ferrero Rocher, Ford, Goya, The Home Depot, Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s, Pam, State Farm, Walgreens and Walmart.

== Adonis Losada&#x27;s arrest, conviction and prison life ==
In September 2009, comedian Adonis Losada, who played Doña Concha on the show, was arrested and subsequently charged with 30 counts of possession of child pornography after detectives in Boynton Beach, Florida alleged that he uploaded one of the images to a social networking site. Police found 18 images of child pornography on a hard drive in his home. Following the arrest, the Doña Concha character was scrapped from &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;. On July 7, 2016, Losada was found guilty and sentenced to 153 years in prison.

<doc id="152030" wikidata="Q170013" url="?curid=152030" title="Corvette">
<text>A corvette is a small warship. It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper (or &quot;rated&quot;) warship. The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate, while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war.

The modern roles that a corvette fulfills include coastal patrol craft, missile boat and fast attack craft. These corvettes are typically between 500 and 2,000 tons. Recent designs of corvettes may approach 3,000 tons and include a hangar to accommodate a helicopter, having size and capabilities that overlap with smaller frigates. However unlike contemporary frigates, a modern corvette does not have sufficient endurance or seaworthiness for long voyages.

The word &quot;corvette&quot; is first found in Middle French, a diminutive of the Dutch word &quot;corf&quot;, meaning a &quot;basket&quot;, from the Latin &quot;corbis&quot;.

The rank &quot;corvette captain&quot;, equivalent in many navies to &quot;lieutenant commander&quot;, derives from the name of this type of ship. The rank is the most junior of three &quot;captain&quot; ranks in several European (e.g.; France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Croatia) and South American (e.g., Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia) navies, because a corvette, as the smallest class of rated warship, was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a &quot;captain&quot; rank.

==Sailing vessels==

During the Age of Sail, corvettes were one of many types of warships smaller than a frigate and with a single deck of guns. They were very closely related to sloops-of-war. The role of the corvette consisted mostly of coastal patrol, fighting minor wars, supporting large fleets, or participating in show-the-flag missions. The English Navy began using small ships in the 1650s, but described them as sloops rather than corvettes. The first reference to a corvette was with the French Navy in the 1670s, which may be where the term originated. The French Navy&#x27;s corvettes grew over the decades and by the 1780s they were ships of 20 guns or so, approximately equivalent to the British Navy&#x27;s post ships. The British Navy did not adopt the term until the 1830s, long after the Napoleonic Wars, to describe a small sixth-rate vessel somewhat larger than a sloop.

The last vessel lost by France during the American Revolutionary War was the corvette &quot;Le Dragon&quot;, scuttled by her captain to avoid capture off Monte Cristi, Haïti in January 1783.

Most corvettes and sloops of the 17th century were in length and measured 40 to 70 tons burthen. They carried four to eight smaller guns on single decks. Over time, vessels of increasing size and capability were called &quot;corvettes&quot;; by 1800, they reached lengths of over and measured from 400 to 600 tons burthen.

==Steam ships==

Ships during the steam era became much faster and more manoeuvrable than their sail ancestors. Corvettes during this era were typically used alongside gunboats during colonial missions. Battleships and other large vessels were unnecessary when fighting the indigenous people of the Far East and Africa.

==World War II==
The modern corvette appeared during World War II as an easily-built patrol and convoy escort vessel. The British naval designer William Reed drew up a small ship based on the single-shaft Smiths Dock Company whale catcher , whose simple design and mercantile construction standards lent itself to rapid production in large numbers in small yards unused to naval work. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, later Prime Minister, had a hand in reviving the name &quot;corvette&quot;.

During the arms buildup leading to World War II, the term &quot;corvette&quot; was almost attached to the . The Tribals were so much larger than and sufficiently different from other British destroyers that some consideration was given to resurrecting the classification of &quot;corvette&quot; and applying it to them.

This idea was dropped, and the term applied to small, mass-produced antisubmarine escorts such as the of World War II. (Royal Navy ships were named after flowers, and ships in Royal Canadian Navy service took the name of smaller Canadian cities and towns.) Their chief duty was to protect convoys throughout the Battle of the Atlantic and on the routes from the UK to Murmansk carrying supplies to the Soviet Union.

The Flower-class corvette was originally designed for offshore patrol work, and was not ideal when pressed into service as an antisubmarine escort. It was shorter than ideal for oceangoing convoy escort work, too lightly armed for antiaircraft defense, and the ships were barely faster than the merchantmen they escorted. This was a particular problem given the faster German U-boat designs then emerging. Nonetheless, the ship was quite seaworthy and maneuverable, but living conditions for ocean voyages were challenging. As a result of these shortcomings, the corvette was superseded in the Royal Navy as the escort ship of choice by the frigate, which was larger, faster, better armed, and had two shafts. However, many small yards could not produce vessels of frigate size, so an improved corvette design, the , was introduced later in the war, with some remaining in service until the mid-1950s.

The Royal Australian Navy built 60 s, including 20 for the Royal Navy crewed by Australians, and four for the Indian Navy. These were officially described as Australian minesweepers, or as minesweeping sloops by the Royal Navy, and were named after Australian towns.

The s or trawlers were referred to as corvettes in the Royal New Zealand Navy, and two, and , rammed and sank a much larger Japanese submarine, , in 1943 in the Solomon Islands.

In Italy, the Regia Marina, in dire need of escort vessels for its convoys, designed the , of which 29 were built between 1942 and 1943 (out of 60 planned); they proved apt at operations in the Mediterranean Sea, especially in regards to their anti-air and anti-submarine capability, and were so successful that the class survived after the war into the Marina Militare Italiana until 1972.

==Modern corvettes==
Modern navies began a trend in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of building corvettes geared towards smaller more manoeuvrable surface capability. These corvettes have displacements between and measure in length. They are usually armed with medium- and small-calibre guns, surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles (SAM), and anti-submarine weapons. Many can accommodate a small or medium anti-submarine warfare helicopter, with the larger ones also having a hangar. While the size and capabilities of the largest corvettes overlap with smaller frigates, corvettes are designed primarily for littoral deployment while frigates are ocean-going vessels by virtue of their greater endurance and seaworthiness.

Most countries with coastlines can build corvette-sized ships, either as part of their commercial shipbuilding activities or in purpose-built yards, but the sensors, weapons, and other systems required for a surface combatant are more specialized and are around 60% of the total cost. These components are purchased on the international market.

===Current corvette classes===


Many countries today operate corvettes. Countries that border smaller seas, such as the Baltic Sea or the Persian Gulf, are more likely to build the smaller and more manoeuvrable corvettes, with Russia operating the most corvettes in the world.

In the 1960s, the Portuguese Navy designed the s as multi-role small frigates intended to be affordable for a small navy. The &quot;João Coutinho&quot; class soon inspired a series of similar projects – including the Spanish , the German MEKO 140, the French A69 and the Portuguese – adopted by a number of medium- and small-sized navies.

The first operational corvette based on stealth technology was the Royal Norwegian Navy&#x27;s . The Swedish Navy introduced the similarly stealthy .

Finland has plans to build four multi-role corvettes, currently dubbed the , in the 2020s as part of its navy&#x27;s Project Squadron 2020. The corvettes will have helicopter carrying, mine laying, ice breaking, anti-aircraft and anti-ship abilities. They will be over long and cost a total of 1.2 billion euros.
The new German Navy is designed to replace Germany&#x27;s fast attack craft and also incorporates stealth technology and land attack capabilities. The Israeli Navy has ordered four of these, named s and a more heavily armed version of the type, deliveries commenced in 2019.

The Greek Navy has categorised the class as fast attack missile craft. A similar vessel is the fast attack missile craft of the Turkish Navy, which is classified as a corvette by Lürssen Werft, the German ship designer.
The Indian Navy operates four s built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers. All of them were in service by 2017.

The Israeli Navy operates three s. Built in the U.S. to an Israeli design, they each carry one helicopter and are well-armed with offensive and defensive weapons systems, including the Barak 8 SAM, and advanced electronic sensors and countermeasures. They displace over 1,200 tons at full load.

Turkey began to build MİLGEM-class corvettes in 2005. The MİLGEM class is designed for anti-submarine warfare and littoral patrol duty. The lead ship, TCG &quot;Heybeliada&quot;, entered navy service in 2011. The design concept and mission profile of the MİLGEM class is similar to the of littoral combat ships of the United States.

In 2004, to replace the patrol boat, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Defence awarded a contract to Abu Dhabi Ship Building for the of corvettes. This class is based on the CMN Group&#x27;s Combattante BR70 design. The &quot;Baynunah&quot; class is designed for patrol and surveillance, minelaying, interception and other anti-surface warfare operations in the United Arab Emirates territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.

The United States is developing littoral combat ships, which are essentially large corvettes, their spacious hulls permitting space for mission modules, allowing them to undertake tasks formerly assigned to specialist classes such as minesweepers or the anti-submarine .

<text>The district of Oldenburg (German: &quot;Landkreis Oldenburg&quot;, not to be confused with the cities of Oldenburg and Oldenburg in Holstein) is a district in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Diepholz, Vechta, Cloppenburg and Ammerland, the city of Oldenburg, the district of Wesermarsch and the city of Delmenhorst.

==History==

The district of Oldenburg was established in 1933. Until 1988 the administrative seat was in the city of Oldenburg. Since then the capital has been in Wildeshausen.

==Geography==

The district is located between the metropolitan areas of Oldenburg and Bremen. The Hunte River runs through the district from south to north.

<doc id="152036" wikidata="Q1546156" url="?curid=152036" title="S-100 bus">
<text>The S-100 bus or Altair bus, IEEE 696-1983 &quot;(inactive-withdrawn)&quot;, is an early computer bus designed in 1974 as a part of the Altair 8800. The bus was the first industry standard expansion bus for the microcomputer industry. computers, consisting of processor and peripheral cards, were produced by a number of manufacturers. The bus formed the basis for homebrew computers whose builders (e.g., the Homebrew Computer Club) implemented drivers for CP/M and MP/M. These microcomputers ran the gamut from hobbyist toy to small business workstation and were common in early home computers until the advent of the IBM PC.

==Architecture==
The bus is a passive backplane of 100-pin printed circuit board edge connectors wired in parallel. Circuit cards measuring serving the functions of CPU, memory, or I/O interface plugged into these connectors. The bus signal definitions closely follow those of an 8080 microprocessor system, since the Intel 8080 microprocessor was the first microprocessor hosted on the bus. The 100 lines of the bus can be grouped into four types: 1) Power, 2) Data, 3) Address, and 4) Clock and control.

Power supplied on the bus is bulk unregulated +8 Volt DC and ±16 Volt DC, designed to be regulated on the cards to +5 V (used by TTL ICs), -5 V and +12 V for Intel 8080 CPU IC, ±12 V RS-232 line driver ICs, +12 V for disk drive motors. The onboard voltage regulation is typically performed by devices of the 78xx family (for example, a 7805 device to produce +5 volts). These are linear regulators which are commonly mounted on heat sinks.

The bi-directional 8-bit data bus of the Intel 8080 is split into two unidirectional 8-bit data buses. The processor could use only one of these at a time. The Sol-20 used a variation that had only a single 8-bit bus and used the now-unused pins as signal grounds to reduce electronic noise. The direction of the bus, in or out, was signaled using the otherwise unused DBIN pin. This became universal in the market as well, making the second bus superfluous. Later, these two 8-bit buses would be combined to support a 16-bit data width for more advanced processors, using the Sol&#x27;s system to signal the direction.

The address bus is 16-bits wide in the initial implementation and later extended to 24-bits wide. A bus control signal can put these lines in a tri-state condition to allow direct memory access. The Cromemco Dazzler, for example, is an early card that retrieved digital images from memory using direct memory access.

Clock and control signals are used to manage the traffic on the bus. For example, the &quot;DO Disable&quot; line will tristate the address lines during direct memory access. Unassigned lines of the original bus specification were later assigned to support more advanced processors. For example, the Zilog Z-80 processor has a non-maskable interrupt line that the Intel 8080 processor does not. One unassigned line of the bus then was reassigned to support the non-maskable interrupt request.

==History==
 During the design of the Altair, the hardware required to make a usable machine was not available in time for the January 1975 launch date. The designer, Ed Roberts, also had the problem of the backplane taking up too much room. Attempting to avoid these problems, he placed the existing components in a case with additional &quot;slots&quot;, so that the missing components could be plugged in later when they became available. The backplane is split into four separate cards, with the CPU on a fifth. He then looked for an inexpensive source of connectors, and he came across a supply of military surplus 100-pin edge connectors. The 100-pin bus was created by an anonymous draftsman, who selected the connector from a parts catalog and arbitrarily assigned signal names to groups of connector pins.

A burgeoning industry of &quot;clone&quot; machines followed the introduction of the Altair in 1975. Most of these used the same bus layout as the Altair, creating a new industry standard. These companies were forced to refer to the system as the &quot;Altair bus&quot;, and wanted another name in order to avoid referring to their competitor when describing their own system. The &quot;&quot; name, short for &quot;Standard 100&quot;, was coined by Harry Garland and Roger Melen, co-founders of Cromemco. While on a flight to attend the Atlantic City PC &#x27;76 microcomputer conference in August 1976, they shared the cabin with Bob Marsh and Lee Felsenstein of Processor Technology. Melen went over to them to convince them to adopt the same name. He had a beer in his hand and when the plane hit a bump, Melen spilt some of the beer on Marsh. Marsh agreed to use the name, which Melen ascribes to him wanting to get Melen to leave with his beer.

The term first appeared in print in a Cromemco advertisement in the November 1976 issue of Byte magazine. The first symposium on the bus, moderated by Jim Warren, was held November 20, 1976 at Diablo Valley College with a panel consisting of Harry Garland, George Morrow, and Lee Felsenstein. Just one year later, the Bus would be described as &quot;the most used busing standard ever developed in the computer industry.&quot;

Cromemco was the largest of the manufacturers, followed by Vector Graphic and North Star Computers. Other innovators were companies such as Alpha Microsystems, IMS Associates, Inc., Godbout Electronics (later CompuPro), and Ithaca InterSystems. In May 1984, &quot;Microsystems&quot; published a comprehensive product directory listing over 500 &quot;/IEEE-696&quot; products from over 150 companies.

The bus signals were simple to create using an 8080 CPU, but increasingly less so when using other processors like the 68000. More board space was occupied by signal conversion logic. Nonetheless by 1984, eleven different processors were hosted on the bus, from the 8-bit Intel 8080 to the 16-bit Zilog Z-8000. In 1986, Cromemco introduced the XXU card, designed by Ed Lupin, utilizing a 32-bit Motorola 68020 processor.

== IEEE-696 Standard ==

As the bus gained momentum, there was a need to develop a formal specification of the bus to help assure compatibility of products produced by different manufacturers. There was also a need to extend the bus so that it could support processors more capable than the Intel 8080 used in the original Altair Computer. In May 1978, George Morrow and Howard Fullmer published a &quot;Proposed Standard for the Bus&quot; noting that 150 vendors were already supplying products for the Bus. This proposed standard documented the 8-bit data path and 16-bit address path of the bus and stated that consideration was being given to extending the data path to 16 bits and the address path to 24 bits.

In July 1979 Kells Elmquist, Howard Fullmer, David Gustavson, and George Morrow published a &quot;Standard Specification for Bus Interface Devices.&quot;
In this specification the data path was extended to 16 bits and the address path was extended to 24 bits. The IEEE 696 Working Group, chaired by Mark Garetz, continued to develop the specification which was proposed as an IEEE Standard and approved by the IEEE Computer Society on June 10, 1982.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved the IEEE standard on September 8, 1983. The computer bus structure developed by Ed Roberts for the Altair 8800 computer had been extended, rigorously documented, and now designated as the American National Standard IEEE Std 696–1983.

== Retirement ==
IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 and followed it with increasingly capable models: the XT in 1983 and the AT in 1984. The success of these computers, which used IBM&#x27;s own, incompatible bus architecture, cut deeply into the market for bus products. In May 1984, Sol Libes (who had been a member of the IEEE-696 Working Group) wrote in &quot;Microsystems&quot;: &quot;there is no doubt that the S-100 market can now be considered a mature industry with only moderate growth potential, compared to the IBM PC-compatible market&quot;.

As the IBM PC products captured the low-end of the market, machines moved up-scale to more powerful OEM and multiuser systems. Banks of bus computers were used, for example, to process the trades at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; the United States Air Force deployed bus machines for their mission planning systems. However throughout the 1980s the market for bus machines for the hobbyist, for personal use, and even for small business was on the decline.

The market for bus products continued to contract through the early 1990s, as IBM-compatible computers became more capable. In 1992, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, replaced their bus computers with the IBM model PS/2. By 1994, the bus industry had contracted sufficiently that the IEEE did not see a need to continue supporting the IEEE-696 standard. The IEEE-696 standard was retired on June 14, 1994.

<doc id="152038" wikidata="Q189967" url="?curid=152038" title="Karyotype">
<text>A karyotype is the general appearance of the complete set of chromosomes in the cells of a species or in an individual organism, mainly including their sizes, numbers, and shapes. Karyotyping is the process by which a karyotype is discerned by determining the chromosome complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any abnormalities.
A karyogram or idiogram is a graphical depiction of a karyotype, wherein chromosomes are generally organized in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size. Karyotyping generally combines light microscopy and photography in the metaphase of the cell cycle, and results in a photomicrographic (or simply micrographic) karyogram. In contrast, a schematic karyogram is a designed graphic representation of a karyotype. In schematic karyograms, just one of the sister chromatids of each chromosome is generally shown for brevity, and in reality they are generally so close together that they look as one on photomicrographs as well unless the resolution is high enough to distinguish them. The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as karyology.

Karyotypes describe the chromosome count of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics.

The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a species is called the &quot;somatic number&quot; and is designated &quot;2n&quot;. In the germ-line (the sex cells) the chromosome number is &quot;n&quot; (humans: n = 23).p28 Thus, in humans 2n = 46.

So, in normal diploid organisms, autosomal chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies.

Karyotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study chromosomal aberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, medicine and to gather information about past evolutionary events (&quot;karyosystematics&quot;).

== Observations on karyotypes ==

=== Staining ===

The study of karyotypes is made possible by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa, is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or prometaphase when most condensed. In order for the Giemsa stain to adhere correctly, all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed. For humans, white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture. Sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing (interphase) cells. The sex of an unborn fetus can be predicted by observation of interphase cells (see amniotic centesis and Barr body).

=== Observations ===

Six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared:

# Differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes. Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family. For example, the legumes &quot;Lotus tenuis&quot; and &quot;Vicia faba&quot; each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet &quot;V. faba&quot; chromosomes are many times larger. These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.
# Differences in the position of centromeres. These differences probably came about through translocations.
# Differences in relative size of chromosomes. These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.
# Differences in basic number of chromosomes. These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion. Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes. Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.
# Differences in number and position of satellites. Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.
# Differences in degree and distribution of GC content (Guanine-Cytosine pairs versus Adenine-Thymine). In metaphase where the karyotype is typically studied, all DNA is condensed, but most of the time, DNA with a high GC content is usually less condensed, that is, it tends to appear as euchromatin rather than heterochromatin. GC rich DNA tends to contain more coding DNA and be more transcriptionally active. GC rich DNA is lighter on Giemsa staining. Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of Guanine-Cytosine pairs (that is, it has a higher GC content). The staining technique using Giemsa staining is called G banding and therefore produces the typical &quot;G-Bands&quot;.

A full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.

Variation is often found:

# between the sexes,
# between the germ-line and soma (between gametes and the rest of the body),
# between members of a population (chromosome polymorphism),
# in geographic specialization, and
# in mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals.

== Human karyogram ==
Both the micrographic and schematic karyograms shown in this section have a standard chromosome layout, and display darker and lighter regions as seen on G banding, which is the appearance of the chromosomes after treatment with trypsin (to partially digest the chromosomes) and staining with Giemsa stain. Compared to darker regions, the lighter regions are generally more transcriptionally active, with a greater ratio of coding DNA versus non-coding DNA, and a higher GC content.

Both the micrographic and schematic karyograms show the normal human diploid karyotype, which is the typical composition of the genome within a normal cell of the human body, and which contains 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (allosomes). A major exception to diploidy in humans is gametes (sperm and egg cells) which are haploid with 23 unpaired chromosomes, and this ploidy is not shown in these karyograms. The micrographic karyogram is converted into grayscale, whereas the schematic karyogram shows the purple hue as typically seen on Giemsa stain (and is a result of its azure B component, which stains DNA purple).

The schematic karyogram in this section is a graphical representation of the idealized karyotype. For each chromosome pair, the scale to the left shows the length in terms of million base pairs, and the scale to the right shows the designations of the bands and sub-bands. Such bands and sub-bands are used by the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature to describe locations of chromosome abnormalities. Each row of chromosomes is vertically aligned at centromere level.

===Human chromosome groups===
Based on the karyogram characteristics of size, position of the centromere and sometimes the presence of a chromosomal satellite (a segment distal to a secondary constriction), the human chromosomes are classified into the following groups:
Alternatively, the human genome can be classified as follows, based on pairing, sex differences, as well as location within the cell nucleus versus inside mitochondria:
* 22 homologous autosomal chromosome pairs (chromosomes 1 to 22). Homologous means that they have the same genes in the same loci, and autosomal means that they are not sex chromomes.
* Two sex chromosome (in green rectangle at bottom right in the schematic karyogram, with adjacent silhouettes of typical representative phenotypes): The most common karyotypes for females contain two X chromosomes and are denoted 46,XX; males usually have both an X and a Y chromosome denoted 46,XY. However, approximately 0.018% percent of humans are intersex, sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes.
* The human mitochondrial genome (shown at bottom left in the schematic karyogram, to scale compared to the nuclear DNA in terms of base pairs), although this is not included in micrographic karyograms in clinical practice. Its genome is relatively tiny compared to the rest.

===Copy number===

Schematic karyograms generally display a DNA copy number corresponding to the G0 phase of the cellular state (outside of the replicative cell cycle) which is the most common state of cells. The schematic karyogram in this section also shows this state. In this state (as well as during the G1 phase of the cell cycle), each cell has two autosomal chromosomes of each kind (designated 2n), where each chromosome has one copy of each locus, making a total copy number of two for each locus (2c). At top center in the schematic karyogram, it also shows the chromosome 3 pair after having undergone DNA synthesis, occurring in the S phase (annotated as S) of the cell cycle. This interval includes the G2 phase and metaphase (annotated as &quot;Meta.&quot;). During this interval, there is still 2n, but each chromosome will have two copies of each locus, wherein each sister chromatid (chromosome arm) is connected at the centromere, for a total of 4c. The chromosomes on micrographic karyograms are in this state as well, because they are generally micrographed in metaphase, but during this phase the two copies of each chromosome are so close to each other that they appear as one unless the image resolution is high enough to distinguish them. In reality, during the G0 and G1 phases, nuclear DNA is dispersed as chromatin and does not show visually distinguishable chromosomes even on micrography.

The copy number of the human mitochondrial genome per human cell varies from 0 (erythrocytes) up to 1,500,000 (oocytes), mainly depending on the number of mitochondria per cell.

== Diversity and evolution of karyotypes ==

Although the replication and transcription of DNA is highly standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are highly variable. There is variation between species in chromosome number, and in detailed organization, despite their construction from the same macromolecules. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary cytology.

In some cases there is even significant variation within species. In a review, Godfrey and Masters conclude:

Although much is known about karyotypes at the descriptive level, and it is clear that changes in karyotype organization has had effects on the evolutionary course of many species, it is quite unclear what the general significance might be.

=== Changes during development ===

Instead of the usual gene repression, some organisms go in for large-scale elimination of heterochromatin, or other kinds of visible adjustment to the karyotype.
* Chromosome elimination. In some species, as in many sciarid flies, entire chromosomes are eliminated during development.
* Chromatin diminution (founding father: Theodor Boveri). In this process, found in some copepods and roundworms such as &quot;Ascaris suum&quot;, portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells. This process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost. In &quot;A. suum&quot;, all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution.
* X-inactivation. The inactivation of one X chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals (see Barr body and dosage compensation). In placental mammals, the inactivation is random as between the two Xs; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her X chromosomes. In marsupials it is always the paternal X which is inactivated. In human females some 15% of somatic cells escape inactivation, and the number of genes affected on the inactivated X chromosome varies between cells: in fibroblast cells up about 25% of genes on the Barr body escape inactivation.

=== Number of chromosomes in a set ===

A spectacular example of variability between closely related species is the muntjac, which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and Doris Wurster. The diploid number of the Chinese muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus reevesi&quot;, was found to be 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot;, they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.

The number of chromosomes in the karyotype between (relatively) unrelated species is hugely variable. The low record is held by the nematode &quot;Parascaris univalens&quot;, where the haploid n = 1; and an ant: &quot;Myrmecia pilosula&quot;. The high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns, with the adder&#x27;s tongue fern &quot;Ophioglossum&quot; ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes. Top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon &quot;Acipenser brevirostrum&quot; at 372 chromosomes. The existence of supernumerary or B chromosomes means that chromosome number can vary even within one interbreeding population; and aneuploids are another example, though in this case they would not be regarded as normal members of the population.

===Fundamental number===

The fundamental number, &quot;FN&quot;, of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes. Thus, FN ≤ 2 × 2n, the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed (acrocentric or telocentric) present. Humans have FN = 82, due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs: 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 (the human Y chromosome is also acrocentric). The fundamental autosomal number or autosomal fundamental number, &quot;FNa&quot; or &quot;AN&quot;, of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of autosomes (non-sex-linked chromosomes).

=== Ploidy ===

Ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell.
* Polyploidy, where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major significance in plant evolution according to Stebbins. The proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by Stebbins to be 30–35%, but in grasses the average is much higher, about 70%. Polyploidy in lower plants (ferns, horsetails and psilotales) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants. Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid.
* Haplo-diploidy, where one sex is diploid, and the other haploid. It is a common arrangement in the Hymenoptera, and in some other groups.
* Endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis, but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes. In the &quot;endocycle&quot; (endomitosis or endoreduplication) chromosomes in a &#x27;resting&#x27; nucleus undergo reduplication, the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an &quot;intact&quot; nuclear membrane.In many instances, endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes (which cannot be exactly counted). The cells do not always contain exact multiples (powers of two), which is why the simple definition &#x27;an increase in the number of chromosome sets caused by replication without cell division&#x27; is not quite accurate.This process (especially studied in insects and some higher plants such as maize) may be a developmental strategy for increasing the productivity of tissues which are highly active in biosynthesis.The phenomenon occurs sporadically throughout the eukaryote kingdom from protozoa to humans; it is diverse and complex, and serves differentiation and morphogenesis in many ways.

=== Aneuploidy ===

Aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species. This would give rise to a chromosome abnormality such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost. Abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development. Down syndrome and Turner syndrome are examples of this.

Aneuploidy may also occur within a group of closely related species. Classic examples in plants are the genus &quot;Crepis&quot;, where the gametic (= haploid) numbers form the series x = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and &quot;Crocus&quot;, where every number from x = 3 to x = 15 is represented by at least one species. Evidence of various kinds shows that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups. In primates, the great apes have 24x2 chromosomes whereas humans have 23x2. Human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes, reducing the number.

=== Chromosomal polymorphism ===

Some species are polymorphic for different chromosome structural forms. The structural variation may be associated with different numbers of chromosomes in different individuals, which occurs in the ladybird beetle &quot;Chilocorus stigma&quot;, some mantids of the genus &quot;Ameles&quot;, the European shrew &quot;Sorex araneus&quot;. There is some evidence from the case of the mollusc &quot;Thais lapillus&quot; (the dog whelk) on the Brittany coast, that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats.

=== Species trees ===

The detailed study of chromosome banding in insects with polytene chromosomes can reveal relationships between closely related species: the classic example is the study of chromosome banding in Hawaiian drosophilids by Hampton L. Carson.

In about , the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world, living from rainforests to subalpine meadows. These roughly 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are usually assigned to two genera, &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;Scaptomyza&quot;, in the family Drosophilidae.

The polytene banding of the &#x27;picture wing&#x27; group, the best-studied group of Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson to work out the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable. In a sense, gene arrangements are visible in the banding patterns of each chromosome. Chromosome rearrangements, especially inversions, make it possible to see which species are closely related.

The results are clear. The inversions, when plotted in tree form (and independent of all other information), show a clear &quot;flow&quot; of species from older to newer islands. There are also cases of colonization back to older islands, and skipping of islands, but these are much less frequent. Using K-Ar dating, the present islands date from 0.4 million years ago (mya) (Mauna Kea) to 10mya (Necker). The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is Kure Atoll, which can be dated to 30 mya. The archipelago itself (produced by the Pacific Plate moving over a hot spot) has existed for far longer, at least into the Cretaceous. Previous islands now beneath the sea (guyots) form the Emperor Seamount Chain.

All of the native &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;Scaptomyza&quot; species in Hawaii have apparently descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands, probably 20 million years ago. The subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of niches. Although it would be possible for a single gravid female to colonise an island, it is more likely to have been a group from the same species.

There are other animals and plants on the Hawaiian archipelago which have undergone similar, if less spectacular, adaptive radiations.

=== Chromosome banding ===

Chromosomes display a banded pattern when treated with some stains. Bands are alternating light and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes. Unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations, including chromosome breakage, loss, duplication, translocation or inverted segments. A range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns: G-bands, R-bands, C-bands, Q-bands, T-bands and NOR-bands.

== Depiction of karyotypes ==

=== Types of banding ===

Cytogenetics employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes:
* G-banding is obtained with Giemsa stain following digestion of chromosomes with trypsin. It yields a series of lightly and darkly stained bands — the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300–400 bands in a normal, human genome. It is the most common chromosome banding method.
* R-banding is the reverse of G-banding (the R stands for &quot;reverse&quot;). The dark regions are euchromatic (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are heterochromatic (thymine-adenine rich regions).
* C-banding: Giemsa binds to constitutive heterochromatin, so it stains centromeres. The name is derived from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds a lot of the dye, while the rest of the chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.
* Q-banding is a fluorescent pattern obtained using quinacrine for staining. The pattern of bands is very similar to that seen in G-banding. They can be recognized by a yellow fluorescence of differing intensity. Most part of the stained DNA is heterochromatin. Quinacrin (atebrin) binds both regions rich in AT and in GC, but only the AT-quinacrin-complex fluoresces. Since regions rich in AT are more common in heterochromatin than in euchromatin, these regions are labelled preferentially. The different intensities of the single bands mirror the different contents of AT. Other fluorochromes like DAPI or Hoechst 33258 lead also to characteristic, reproducible patterns. Each of them produces its specific pattern. In other words: the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in AT. Rather, the distribution of AT and the association of AT with other molecules like histones, for example, influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes.
* T-banding: visualize telomeres.
* Silver staining: Silver nitrate stains the nucleolar organization region-associated protein. This yields a dark region where the silver is deposited, denoting the activity of rRNA genes within the NOR.

=== Classic karyotype cytogenetics ===

In the &quot;classic&quot; (depicted) karyotype, a dye, often Giemsa &quot;(G-banding)&quot;, less frequently mepacrine (quinacrine), is used to stain bands on the chromosomes. Giemsa is specific for the phosphate groups of DNA. Quinacrine binds to the adenine-thymine-rich regions. Each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern.

Karyotypes are arranged with the short arm of the chromosome on top, and the long arm on the bottom. Some karyotypes call the short and long arms &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, respectively. In addition, the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from proximal to distal on the chromosome arms. For example, Cri du chat syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It is written as 46,XX,5p-. The critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 (the locus on the chromosome), which is written as 46,XX,del(5)(p15.2).

===Multicolor FISH (mFISH) and spectral karyotype (SKY technique)===

Multicolor FISH and the older spectral karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.
In the case of spectral karyotyping, image processing software assigns a pseudo color to each spectrally different combination, allowing the visualization of the individually colored chromosomes.

Multicolor FISH is used to identify structural chromosome aberrations in cancer cells and other disease conditions when Giemsa banding or other techniques are not accurate enough.

=== Digital karyotyping ===

&quot;Digital karyotyping&quot; is a technique used to quantify the DNA copy number on a genomic scale. Short sequences of DNA from specific loci all over the genome are isolated and enumerated. This method is also known as virtual karyotyping. Using this technique, it is possible to detect small alterations in the human genome, that cannot be detected through methods employing metaphase chromosomes. Some loci deletions are known to be related to the development of cancer. Such deletions are found through digital karyotyping using the loci associated with cancer development.

== Chromosome abnormalities ==

Chromosome abnormalities can be numerical, as in the presence of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in derivative chromosome, translocations, inversions, large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as aneuploidy, often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete; trisomies, in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in homologous recombination. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person&#x27;s body, or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.

=== In humans ===

Chromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include
* Turner syndrome results from a single X chromosome (45,X or 45,X0).
* Klinefelter syndrome, the most common male chromosomal disease, otherwise known as 47,XXY, is caused by an extra X chromosome.
* Edwards syndrome is caused by trisomy (three copies) of chromosome 18.
* Down syndrome, a common chromosomal disease, is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21.
* Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy of chromosome 13.
* Trisomy 9, believed to be the 4th most common trisomy, has many long lived affected individuals but only in a form other than a full trisomy, such as trisomy 9p syndrome or mosaic trisomy 9. They often function quite well, but tend to have trouble with speech.
* Also documented are trisomy 8 and trisomy 16, although they generally do not survive to birth.

Some disorders arise from loss of just a piece of one chromosome, including
* Cri du chat (cry of the cat), from a truncated short arm on chromosome 5. The name comes from the babies&#x27; distinctive cry, caused by abnormal formation of the larynx.
* 1p36 Deletion syndrome, from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1.
* Angelman syndrome – 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the maternal genes, example of imprinting disorder.
* Prader-Willi syndrome – 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the paternal genes, example of imprinting disorder.
* Chromosomal abnormalities can also occur in cancerous cells of an otherwise genetically normal individual; one well-documented example is the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation mutation commonly associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia and less often with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

== History of karyotype studies ==

Chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli in 1842. Their behavior in animal (salamander) cells was described by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of mitosis, in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, Heinrich von Waldeyer in 1888. It is Neo-Latin from Ancient Greek κάρυον &quot;karyon&quot;, &quot;kernel&quot;, &quot;seed&quot;, or &quot;nucleus&quot;, and τύπος &quot;typos&quot;, &quot;general form&quot;)

The next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that chromosomes (that can be observed by karyotype) were the carrier of genes. The term karyotype as defined by the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes, in contrast to their genic contents was introduced by Grigory Levitsky who worked with Lev Delaunay, Sergei Navashin, and Nikolai Vavilov. The subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of C. D. Darlington and Michael JD White.

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46, but revised his opinion from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an XX/XY system. Considering the techniques of the time, these results were remarkable.

Joe Hin Tjio working in Albert Levan&#x27;s lab found the chromosome count to be 46 using new techniques available at the time:

# Using cells in tissue culture
# Pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
# Arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine
# Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
# Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

The work took place in 1955, and was published in 1956. The karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes. The other great apes have 48 chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes.
